Spectacular swimming in "wingsuit" above Bogota
Jhonathan Florez sported a helicopter above Bogota, the colonian capital.
Equipment of a wingsuit (a wingsuit monkey combination), it went up to 160 km/h of the famous Sanctuary Monserrate, situated over 3,000 meters of height, where many baths were gathered to observe its operation.
A black box in your car?
While the U.S. road network planners are hard to find the money necessary to repair the decrepitary infrastructure, many of them have a solution in the form of a small black box that is fixed above the board table of your car.
The devices, which store all thousands of passengers by an automobilist and transmit information to the officials, are at the center of a trial in Washington and the government offices of planning to remane the obsolete financing system of the main roads of the United States.
The sector, in general without interest in planning large ass, has soon caused a strongly animated debate and moved alliances.
Freedoms have joined ecological groups to make pressure so that the government uses small boxes to keep the trace of thousands you're swimming, and eventually from the road on which you circle, then use the information to edit a tax law project.
The Tea Party's shooted.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concerns on the protection of private life.
And while the members of the Congress are not able to agree to know if it is necessary to continue, several States have not been expected.
They are looking for how, during the next decade, they can pass into a system that allows the drivers to pay on the basis of the number of thousands of parcour.
Thousands of motorists have already locked these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system for an experimental virus.
This is really essential for our nation.
“It's not like if we had the choice,” said Hasan Ikhrata, Director-General of Southern California Association of Governments, who expects that the State starts to register the thousands by each Californian automobilist in 2025.
There will be a change in the way we pay these taxes.
Technology is here to do it.
The pressure results in the fact that the Highway Trust Fund of the country, funded with the taxes paid by the Americans to the pump, is financially sec.
Americans do not purchase more than before.
Autos can pass more than thousands of miles with a gallon.
The Federal Tax itself, which is 18.4 percent per galon, has not increased since 20 years.
Political men are reiterate to increase tax, even 1 percent, while the cost prices are high.
"The essence tax isn't simplely delicate," said Lee Munnich, a specialist of transport policy at the University of Minesota.
His State has recently installed 500 car drivers to test a mile payment system.
“It would be the longest logical alternative,” he said.
Wonks calls it the use costs for kilometers.
It is not surprising that the idea of quoted liberalizations can be made, since taxes could be used to modify conduct practices so that they can reduce compressions and gas emissions, such as gas emissions.
California planners are interested in the system because they are developing strategies to achieve the objectives of the State ' s ambitious climate warming laws.
But representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), Chairman of the Committee on Transport of the Chamber of Representatives, said that it would also be the most long-term alternative.
Reason's free market partys also appreciated the idea of paying drivers at a mile.
"It is not just a tax that is in a large black strike", said Adrian Moore, Vice-President of the Policy on the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for their benefits.
The movement is also supported by two elderly United States Secretariat on Transport, which, in 2011, urged the Congress to go on the way of payment a mile.
The United States Senate approved a pilot project of $90 billion last year that had been covered by about 100,000 cars.
But the Chamber's Chamber's presidency killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing elections, which must pass many thousands every day to make themselves working or in the city.
However, several States and large cities make progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregon, which mobilized 5000 drivers to conduct the most important experience of the country.
These automobilists are immediately slow to the State of kilometer costs instead of excise taxes.
Nevada has already conducted a pilot project at the end.
The city of New York is predicting one.
Illinois tried a test on a limited number of trucks.
And coalition I-95, which includes 17 road transport agencies in the United States far away from the coast of the United States (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), studys how it could implement the change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where some 50 volunteers had recently equipped their car of a device, the drivers were concerned that the government could follow their smaller facts and gestures.
“The concerns about Big Brother and such things are a great problem” said Alauddin Khan, who directs the strategic performance management in the Nevada Transport Department.
It's not something that people want.
From the beginning of the test, the Nevada ACLU warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to transform these devices into entire location devices."
It is not necessary to build a large and comprehensive technological infrastructure that will be inevitably expanded in order to keep the records of human allies and arrivals daily.
Nevada is part of some of the countries who now go to find a approachable technology that would enable the State to know how many thousands of cars are, but without knowing the location or the exact time.
If we can do this, has added Khan, the citizens will be more.
The research of this technology has brought some State agencies to call for a small startup from California name True Mileage.
As a result, the company was not intended to help those who pay taxes to States.
She tried to spend on the car insurance market, where the drivers would pay on the basis of their kilometer.
But the devices that it tested have been further to the large ass planners because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically downloaded by modem.
"The people will be more encouraging to do so if you don't save their speed and don't locate them", said Ryan Morrison, Director-General of True Mileage.
In the pilot programmes of some States, there were major errors.
There are very fewer means and less intrusive methods to process.
In Oregon, planners have experienced by offering different automobilists.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They may still choose not to have any device, preferably to pay a forefat based on the average number of thousands percoated by all residents of the State.
Other States hope to sell the concept to disfellowshipping citizens in order to make it more than enough.
In the city of New York, carriers seek to develop a taxing device that would also be equipped to pay station costs, provide a "payment payment" and to create a set of data on the real speed from other drivers that automobilists could use to avoid shipping.
“The automobilists would be encouraged to participate in the benefits offered by the system” said a document on urban installation.
However, some transport planners are asked whether the whole debate on the Millennium Payment is not just a large division.
In the Metropolitan Transport Commission of the area of San Francisco, responsible members say that the Congress could very simplely manage the facility of the Highway Trust Fund by increasing the essence taxes.
A supplementary or annual tax could be imposed on hybrid vehicle drivers and on others whose vehicles do not consume much of the essence, so that each pays their fair part.
"There is not necessary to use a radical surgery when only aspirin is needed", said Randy Rentschler, director of the Commission's legislation and public affairs.
If so, hundreds of millions of automobilists will be worried about the protection of their private life and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: four inedits in listening
The English musician has not ended to surprise this year.
From The Next Day, in January, he prepared a luxe revision planned for 4 November, with several inedits.
Four have already emerged on the Toile.
The advertising of a new album of David Bowie had left all the pants.
On the day of his 66th anniversary, on 8 January 2013, he stated that a new album would be out in March.
After ten years of silence (the last disk, Reality, 2003) and too rare appearances in the public, the English musician proved that we could still be able to count on him to make the pop scene.
A party for his fans
Not the surprises, David Bowie had more than a tour in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke plans to edit this album on 4 November.
For the opportunity, he made a real party for his fans.
This redistribution, titled The Next Day Extra, will be presented in the form of three disks: the original album, unreducted studies sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four clips already declared.
The Next Day Extra will contain ten additional titles in relation to the original album: the three parts of the Deluxe edition, five specially displaced songs for the opportunity, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie also made the presentations of this beautiful cover in a video.
It introduced both the disks, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and pockets, a book to share its own impressions, a book with words...
And, in particular, he gives a front-good of his new Atomica title, typically in the Venice of The Next Day, with very advanced guiders and a sadly mastered rock electricity.
Injuries already listening
But Atomica is not the only title to declare his charms.
The Informationer, like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the toilet.
The Informer is double-face: an worried intro before a luminous horse that gradually slows to leave a pop ball.
About Like A Rocket Man, Bo How did he want to do a small reference to the Rocket Man of Elton John, even even in Gravity?
With this title added, the songer seems in any case in his element when he has no more feet on earth.
Space Oddity, on the side, was much worse.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie makes a new reference to his strangeness: would he come from another planet?
The rifs to guide, intriguing, give the desire to leave the Earth.
Bowie is in any case to play on the camera with these titles: computer tour, man on the board of a shooting, potential marten...
He dismisses and reveles both, plays to adopt different personalities, as he did it all along his career, in particular with his personalities Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
It was not surprised that he had a mask on his hand in the photo of the campaign The invitation to travel, from the Mark Louis Vuitton, which is incarcerated by the new face.
It will appear in one of their advertising spots from 10 November.
The Minister of Defence, Rob Nicholson, emphasized to say that the blessed soldiers were not so-called from the Canadian Army forces, and stressed that a transitional process was followed by all soldiers before their return to civil life.
Mr. Nicholson, attacked by the Liberals and the Neo Democrats at the Chamber of Communities, assured that before their release, the army members followed a transitional plan in collaboration with their senior.
All blessed soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civil life and no one of them is released before being ready.
Delegators accused the Government of wanting to economize money by not allowing the blessed militarys - who do not respond to the rules of the "university of service" of the army that requires that the staff may be able to carry out a number of different tasks - to reach the period of 10 years of admissibility for recruitment benefits.
They, in particular, mentioned two cases reported by La Presse Canadian, including the of a free soldier on Friday.
The chief David Hawkins, a London reserve in Ontario, has been released from the army, despite his request to stay more than one year in order to receive an indeed retreat.
His case occurred after the President Glen Kirkland, who stated before a parliamentary committee, last month, that he had been put out before being ready because he did not respond to the university rule of service.
Mr. Hawkins stressed that a soldier could be prepared from, with plans and consultations, but it was completely different than the fact that he wanted to leave the lines.
"I told them that I wasn't ready," he stated when a interview with the Canadian Press Monday.
I asked for months if there was a way I could stay, and they said no.
Since the beginning of the major battles in Afghan, the army was slaughtered to determine the latitude that it can grant to the blessed soldiers who want to remain in the ranks but are not suitable to fight.
In accordance with the current rules, seriously blessed soldiers have up to three years to restore.
If they do not respond to the criteria for foreign displacement, they may be forced to leave the army.
The last year's data to Parliament indicated that among 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 did not reach the duration of service required to obtain pension benefits.
The free-democratic door on the subject of old fighters, Jim Karygiannis, requested the reintegration of the Chief Hawkins, while the neo-democratic Jack Harris requested the immediate end of "the honourous practice".
Disney on tablets to start an animated series
The American Media and Divorce Group Disney decided to privilege tablets to its own television chain for the next outcome of a new series for children.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from 24 November on the watchdisneyjunior.com site or through its application for phones and tablets.
His world launch on the chains of the Disney Group is expected only in 2014, details the reported Disney Junior's Division.
The animated design, for children from 2 to 7 years of age, tells the adventures of Callie chat, secret of a western city of the United States where it has ruled the order with a magic lasso.
Each episode includes two historys of 11 minutes.
"Interaction with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today", commented Albert Cheng, vice-president of the digital products at Disney/ABC Television Group, referred to in the communication.
This type of experience between Disney's efforts to "extend life periods of its series and to build new relationships with its public through digital platforms more important."
A weekly study by Common Sense Media showed an explosion of the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of the years of age have been used with a table or phone, and 72% of the less than 8 years ago, against 10% and 38% of the two years ago.
Snowden is ready to “cooperate” with Germany on the issue of American supervisory
Edward Snowden, the accusator of the United States Information Services, stated that he was willing to make a witness to the German parliament if the United States National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers to their activities.
The German Deputy Hans-Christian Strubele met Mr. Snowden in Russia, where he enjoys the right of asylum to discuss his witnesses in Germany.
In a letter submitted to the media in Berlin on Thursday, Mr. Snowden said: "Blessing the result of my efforts has been very positive, my Government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a fleet and seeks to penalize the political talk with accuseds against which it is impossible to defend himself."
However, the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he thought that the support of the international community could convince the American Government to abandon criminal charges against him.
In the context of the complaint issued by the United States Ministry of Justice, it is accused of spontaneity and flight of the State.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Minister of Germany, declared at the Online time: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to German responsibilities, we will make it possible."
The relationships between the United States and Germany were tested after complaints that the NSA had taken on listening to the portable phone of the German chanceler Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the parliamentary group that supervises for foreign secret services, stated that if there was a chance to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness, "less of putting it in danger and fully destroying relationships with the United States," he had to benefit.
Mr. Stèbele, deputy Vert German, published a photo of him with Mr Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit in Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Strubele stated that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA consultant, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr. Snowden witnessed in Germany, he should be given the assurance that it would be “safe” there, he said the deputy.
Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that he had made the object of a “severe and supported” persecution campaign that had forced him to leave his country.
He said, however, he was encouraged by the world response to “my political expression act”.
The citizens of the whole world and the high-responsibilities, including the United States, believed that the revelation of an unexpected permanent monitoring system was public use.
The letter continues to provide cooperation with the German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved."
Cogeco Cable could soon offer the interactive television
Cogeco Cable members may even have access to applications such as Facebook, Twitter, and finally video service on Netflix request through their television in a future that doesn't seem so far.
The branch office of Cogeco indicated that she was currently taking preliminary tests of the beta version of this platform with some of its users.
"This will allow us to make the more convenient interfaces as well as more options, " explained the President and Chief of the Cogeco Directory, Louis Audet, in interview.
Cogeco Câble thus gives the step to its competitors, as Bell, even though the Cogeco filial has no specific date in what has been related to this new platform.
"It must be adapted and changed or resisted to change and failure," said Mr. Audet.
The last goal remains to offer tools to which our customers do not now access.
Rogers' telecommunications generator already indicated that it could offer Netflix if some technical details, which were not quoted, could be regulated.
In the United States, the popular video services said to be in discussion with some major cable distributors so that its service is available through their distribution platforms.
The Cogeco and Cogeco Câble also welcomed the announcement made by the Government of Harper at the Throne on 16 October last.
Ottawa wants to force television providers by cable and satellite to offer customers the opportunity to pay card services.
"When we have done nearly two years and half that we say that the idea of forced consumers to purchase important strings, it does not work", said Mr. Audet.
However, it is hoped that the consultations carried out by the Council on Radiodiffusion and Canadian Telecommunications (CRTC) will be discussed on interesting recommendations.
"It should be exagered from these discussions a new type of reference framework to the definition of our new Canadian cultural policy in respect of television," said Cogeco.
The CRTC has consulted the public since last week and should continue with the industry in the next spring.
From the results, Cogeco has recorded a net benefit of 43.8 million to the fourth quarter, or 82 per action.
This is a recule compared to the net benefit of 44.9 million, or 83% per action, of the same period the last year.
The company established in Montreal explains this recurrence by the costs of adjustments related to new acquisitions.
Cogeco acquired the Atlantic Broadband, established in the United States, in 2012 for 1.36 billion.
It was the first major acquisition of the company after the failure in Portugal.
In December, the Montrealaise company also purchased Peer 1 Network Entrepreneurs, an Internet provider established in Vancouver, for the sum of 526 million.
In Cogeco's income, they learned an increase of 41.5 per cent to the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
They are 1.8 billion for the current financial year.
The net benefit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Câble, was 43.9 million, or 90.
However, Cogeco Cable income progressed by 45% to reach 470.4 million.
The company lost 15 237 customers during the fourth quarter.
However, for the 2013 financial year, the number of Cogeco Cable clients is in increased by 5546.
Mr. Audet is not worried about seeing the number of flowing customers like that.
For me, this is not the indication of a trend change, did he not observe.
It varies from a quarter on the other side with a very living competition.
Cave in bowl products
The cheval meat was decepted in bowl-based products boxes, sold by two small British teachers of low price distribution, announced today the food hygiene agency.
Routine tests showed that the products developed in Romania in January and sold by Home Bargains and Save Quality Chains contain ADN from 1 to 5% of horses.
"In the case of horse meat not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not be presented in the product," explained the British Agency.
A scandale on the presence of horses meat in kitchen plates grew in Europe at the beginning of the year after tests carried out in Ireland.
According to the European Commission's reviews, France was the most touched country by the presence of this type of meat in censed products to contain only bovine.
A collision between two vehicles made four blessed, preceding Friday, on road 131, in Lanaudière.
Before four hours, a car driven northern direction in Saint-Félix-de-Valois lost his car manager and surveyed a car that arrived in the other direction.
The four occupants of the two vehicles were blessed, but they were not scared of their life.
The movement was returned to normal at 6:00 p.m., Friday.
Frontier Airlines thinking to pay hand bags
Frontier Airlines intends to pay up to $100 to passengers who carry handbags on his flights.
Frontier Airlines intended to start paying up to $100 for a handbag and $2 for a coffee or a soda, although in its merry advertising, she indicated that passengers could import the not open chain with them at the distance of the flight.
The new handbag costs relate to the sacks covered in the top apartment, so the small sacks installed under the seat will always be free.
Frontier stated that it would pay $25 if the costs were paid in advance and $100 if travellers would pay only once at the shipping gate.
The Frontier's talking port, Kate O'Malley said that $100 were planned to encourage travellers to pay expenses in advance.
“We don't want to pay this price” she explained.
Airlines started to pay the first and second payments recorded in 2008.
The passengers who tried to avoid these costs were so much that they could be in the main bags covered in the top divisions, so there were no longer places in these divisions.
These costs are a way to ensure that passengers transport less than to board.
O'Malley said that these new costs will not really need to collect money.
It is to understand the most faithful clients of Frontier that it becomes more difficult to find the place in the top sections.
The passengers who buy their tickets on the site of the airline will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger who made the chain to a Frontier shipping door could transport a sack free, while the next person in the chair could pay $100 for a similar sack.
O'Malley explained that the site and recording procedures of Frontier are in change to ensure that passengers know the existence of these costs before reaching the door.
Frontier's hand bag costs will not be applied before the summer, although no date has been fixed.
The passengers often care about bag costs and other costs, but the airlines worship them.
They believe that payment maintenance costs are important and that passengers who want this service should pay it.
Many people at Wall Street consider the expense of bagages as a sign that shows that airlines make enough money to cover the air journey cost after years of loss.
However, many of them did not touch bag costs.
Spirit Airlines Inc. applied the first hand bag costs three years ago, and the low-cost company Allegiant followed a few later.
The only other company imposed in such expenses is the Hungarian Wizz Air company, announced the consultor with airlines Jay Sorensen, which follows nearly the additional costs.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit’s main loan payments costs were $50 million per year.
Sorensen, a former framework in Midwest Airlines, recently traveled on Spirit and asked what he would be found at the slaughter door at the time that passengers would discover the inhabited inhabited bagage costs of the company.
“I have never seen such a flowing process from all my professional carriage,” he will state.
I was waiting for seeing dentists and a shut up at the door.
The aircraft was full, he added, “the passengers are mounted up at the random speed of light”.
Frontier is also made as Spirit and applies $2 for a coffee, a tea, a soda or a fruit juice.
Frontier stated that passengers who take a soda or a fruit juice may import the not open chain with them, and those taking coffee can be recovered freely.
It will always distribute from water freely.
US Airways tried to pay for drinks in 2008 but returned back seven months later after passengers were complained and there was no other large airline company.
The decision of Frontier to pay handbag costs when passengers do not buy their ticket directly to the airline is its last effort to encourage customers to go on their website.
Airlines pay online travellers as Orbitz $10 to $25 for each sale ticket.
This encouraged all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly with them instead of addressing a online travel agency.
However, Frontier has been far away in this area.
In September, she started offering only half thousands of customers who purchased their ticket through a online travel agency.
Mercredi, she reduced the prizes of thousands of 25 per cent on a trip.
Thus, a Frontier travel of 1,000 km bought at a online travel agency would allow to win 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to select their seat at advance only if they buy their ticket directly on the Frontier site.
Frontier has a faithful customer in her original city, Denver, but its recreational activity and lost money.
The income decreased 9 per cent and its flight capacity reduced almost 13 per cent during the first quarter, according to the financial results of its mother society, the Airways Holding Inc.
The Republic tried to restore the financing of Frontier to sell the airline.
NSA puts in question an "indoor error" not the computer pirates for its website's pane
The National Security Agency in the shadow declared that it was a bug that had caused its public website for a few hours, and not hackers like some had claimed it online.
"NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours this night because of an internal error that has occurred during an update planned", stated the NSA.gov sponsoring agency in an email statement.
The problem will be resolved tonight.
The claims that the pane was due to a distributed service denial attack [DSD] are false.
Before this night, the online server trackers noted that the NSA site was in pane for at least 6 hours, and some users cannot always access the site.
Soon, a NSA's parliament stated ABC News that the Agency's sensible internal network was not "not all" compromise.
No classified information is in danger, explained the talking door.
At least one online hackticist group has been responsible for the NSA site's pane by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks are intended to enter a target site until servers are overloaded and the site is shocked.
The cyber-tactic is not very sophisticated and the attacks are not intended to pull in the internal system network.
Another secret NSA, a time overnamed “No search Agency” was found under the fire of projectors and was strongly criticized over the last months after a revelation vague about its broad national and foreign communications monitoring programmes, which are part of the NSA secret files flying to the Agency and distributed by the former NSA advisor, Edward Snowden.
This growing conflict around the Agency has caused a lot of speculations that the incident of this night was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Delta-Villa now closed
The Delta Centre-Villa hotel closed its gates in Montreal after 36 years of existence.
The building's investment fund has sold it to promoters that will transform it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Among them, 200 have not always found new jobs.
Delta promises not let his employees fall.
Employees have come to meet employees directly on place, individually met employees to assess their needs.
"This support will continue for the next six months," explains the regional director of the Delta Hotels, Felix Bisson.
Delta closes in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that was owner of this building had choices to do.
If he was re-invested in the building to continue to operate, there were tens of millions of investments while competition is very feasible, there are many new hotels that appeared in Montreal.
"Of he sold him to someone else and that's what happened," explains Paul Arsenault, title of the Transit Tourism Chair at the University of Scientific Management of UQAM.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the next months, such as Crown Plaza, which will become a residence for older people.
In the meantime, four hotel projects over 600 rooms will see this day two years.
For the DG of Titan, "the purchase project of Goodyear Amiens starts with employed zero"
After cut the slogan in January for the partial reprise of the Goodyear site of Amens-Nord promised to close, Maurice Taylor, the DG of the American pneumatics Titan, is now ready to save 333 jobs on the 1 137 basis.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of Productive Reconstruction, had already announced it, Monday 21 October.
After you rejected the purchase project in January, you'll return today.
You had pronounced violent attacks and insultes, speaking of "some workers", which" works three hours" daily, "food" syndicates for the CGT.
We don't understand this time.
Is this to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to make any joy.
Except my wife.
Mr. Montebourg, it is a charming young man who tries to save industrial jobs among the best paid jobs.
If I hurt someone with my words, I'm sorry.
But France also has a high level of tax and unemployment.
Does the truth hurt you?
Working seven hours per day when in other countries we work eight hours is disabled by France.
In India, China and in full of other countries, there are 10 to 12 hours every day.
But I don't have any prejudices on France.
What I see, it is a plant that produces good agricultural nests, has good equipment, is well situated and has spaces to expand.
Why is Titan so necessary for this plant?
Titan doesn't need to buy this plant.
But with a correct price and competent workers, this will be the case to try.
What type of agreement are you expecting between the CGT and Goodyear?
If Goodyear had offered the employees a good start compensation, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now, imagine that Titan buys the clothes of Goodyear.
Since then, Titan could move machines to Poland or to any other countries of the European Union that still have its own currency.
I think Mr. Montebourg knows this.
But he wants to keep the company of friends with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan accepts the recruitment of some 1,200 current jobs of Goodyear.
So Mr. Montebourg needs a Titan's commitment before trying to bring the CGT to sit on the table with Goodyear.
The first step is that the CGT and Goodyear seek an agreement on start compensation for all employees.
Since then, there's no more employees in the plant.
Mr. Montebourg said you were ready to ensure these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm it?
The only number I mentioned to the Minister is 333.
I know he would like a four-year guarantee.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on start compensations.
If all employees accept them, the purchase project of the plant will start with zero employed.
How can we provide employment duration guarantees when there is no longer employees on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg reaches that the CGT and Goodyear agree and that Titan purchases the plant, we have the intention of staying in Amiens-Nords over four years.
The benefit of Bombardier low, while delivery and aircraft commands return
Bombardier Inc, a Canadian aircraft and aircraft constructor, reported a decline of 15% of its net benefit on Thursday, under pressure of a decline of the commands and delivery of aircraft during the third quarter and contracting problems in the Training division.
Bombardier, based on Montreal, has no flight test data for all its new CSeries aircraft or information to know whether the aircraft will respect its ambitious calendar for commercial service before September next.
After the inaugural flight of the test flight about one month and half ago, the last was shooted only three times, and then the question was able to know whether the test phase was in good way.
The results have not been at the height of the previsions, and the course of action has increased from 8 per cent to the Toronto Bourse.
Cameron Doerksen, an analysis in the National Financial Bank, took its notation on Thursday, passing from "surperformance" to "sector performance" because of the low potential of increased swimming up the bourse during the next quarter or the next two quarters.
“Only we are really discovered by the beneficiary margin in the Transport Division,” said Cameron Doerksen in a customer note.
We think that Bombardier will register new commands for its CSeries flights and as the test program will advance.
However, if no new command has been announced in the next months, we are waiting for the market to become more sceptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries Aviation family can catapulate it in the lower segment of a market today dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was deleted in March and moved to the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of closed commands for CSeries aircraft is moderate until 177. It seems that potential purchasers are expected to expect the results of the flight tests to validate the confirmations of the company regarding the energy efficiency and the potential of economics of the new line aircraft.
At the current time, the company registered a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments at 15 customers and operators.
Peter Beaudoin, President and leader of the Director, is convinced that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 orders before the first aircraft is undertaken.
The leaders also reassured the analysts and media on Thursday, indicating that the programme was advanced in accordance with the calendar.
“The test air was not remained on the ground as long as planned,” said Mr. Beaudoin at a telephone conference, adding that the soil tests and software updates were planned during the slaughter time.
Each constructor plans differently.
We decided to process first flights and provide a update period, and that is what we did.
This will be reproduced throughout the flight program.
The second of the five test aircrafts should take place in the coming weeks, the other will follow a few days later, stated the company.
However, analysts are sceptics about the fact that the first customer could fly a CSeries aircraft only 12 months after his inaugural flight.
Bombardier said that it was in evaluation of the income calendar and will provide new information during the next months.

Five years ago, my father's gone out of the world of living.
At the beginning I hated his death, I talked about him now,
I was so afraid of forgotten or instead I didn't know how I was going to continue to "frequencing".
There is no receipt, a job mode to pass through the invisible wall and find itss.
Then the signs appear.
The first time it was the very strong feeling of his presence on the passenger seat while I conducted.
Another time, a snake wake up full night to look at his watch that doesn't leave me, put on the night table.
It's the image of my souring father who joins me in my sights every day.
Our mother left us after his struggling fight against cancer.
It's at least what I thought on the day when I found his empty body, crying on this hospital bed at the fried draps.
Similarly, his funerals were a focalized glass audience around the largest light of the chandels that covered his circle.
I thought she was gone.
Shortly, by small daily or night appearances, a little tired, a little tired, she is rapidly returned to my mind, evolving in the flight and as she returned her place in the landscape of my thinking that believed in deluge.
And then she turned out to me by desiring my own faces that I had not yet seen, massed by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had never lost the person of my mother but just a woman I didn't really know, a woman who incarcerated this person during his stay in life.
When he died, this woman had perfectly lived and freed the person I loved, and here I found her, full and full.
This turn of my life's way remains the most unexpected and the most beautiful.
It's a privilege to know that loved people never leave us.
I look like my father, "to the dear like outside" he seemed.
We always told me.
I never believed it at the time.
I had difficult relationships with him until it becomes old, sick.
There, I didn't worry about him anymore and I could love him.
One day, he's dead.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I was afraid, when I was worried...
He talked to me, was constantly encouraged to live in my body.
I saw his hands looking at my hands, and I prepared him for my body.
But it was never undiscrete.
I could have a personal life.
He gave me my intimacy.
It's been long after one day he's gone.
Finally, it was comfortable and comfortable to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I don't know who said deceased people are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents aren't anymore, but I'm constantly feeling about them near me.
Each event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I'm always talking about it, what did they say?
I'm constantly dreaming of them, maybe not every night, but several times per week it's sure.
I am often dreaming of the last moments I have to share with them before it is too late, only there is always something that prevents me to achieve this moment.
I often wake up when it comes to me, and I feel deeply the absence of them.
Sometimes some dreams bring me to the contrary and inscribe in my history and effectively, they continue to live and share my life.
The oldest of my ecography where I had to know the sex of my baby, I sweared that I wake up, feeling out of bed, my father waited for me on the pallet, and he was smiling me, and I was glad that I was waiting for a little boy.
On the afternoon, I felt he had visited me in my sleep to mean that he shared me with joy with what happened to me.
And of course, it was a little boy in my wheel.
I like to share this moment with him, and I'm glad to tell you this common memory living after his death.
Five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer suites.
A year ago, she was traveling with my family in Cuba.
It's the shock that his disappearance caused me at the young bacheler I was at the time.
Despite all my debts, I have done enoughly.
But she continues to influence my life, in particular in the moments where I find it difficult, or when I have to take important decisions.
Learning the Arab and interesting me in the Middle East, in order to make it a master in a great school, haven't been, with the recule, an anointed choice.
In fact, I often heard him Arab speaking in my childhood, and talking about Marokko, where she lived for decades - before getting France at the time of independence.
The values she has inculked me are always present, while I can think about how she wants to act at a given time.
It's the same for my attitudes: I'm trying to be at the height of the generosity and the right of the spirit that was a credible fertility.
Now, I feel it as a daily presence, a good soul, a salvator spirit.
I see his eyes put on me.
My mother's been deceased 10 years ago.
He died after talking to me with the phone.
I have passed through all phases: incomprehension, angry, pain, crystal, all where, in insolent places, moments inconsistent.
Then, the time was cut off the punishment.
There's been only the lack of this empty, that's the need for her, to trust me, to safeguard me back to the crew of her sweet.
However, she's there, quietly present, she's here and looks at me.
Every morning, I see his worried eyes standing on me, I see the brains that smell his eyes, the reductions around the lips that cross smokes, the skins that march the front of the day of concern.
My mother had my face, and she looked at me all mornings in my watch.
And every morning, I'll turn my eyes back.
My wife and mother of my 3 children are deceived by a cancer at 43 years of age.
We still feel his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his pain bed, then a little again learned to smile, and proclaiming his name is no longer Tabou but a comfort.
Well, I'm talking to him in the night's crush when the absence is too bad, she's invited to my dreams when moral is a little reaching.
We feel betrayed and protected in the difficult times, the time's recule makes us realize how she was head of orchester and we try to stay in the way she had brought us.
If a being loved you very strong, the absence can't take it from your heart and memory.
In a certain way, loved being becomes your internal energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 from a friendly cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted on what he thought or what he appreciated.
I couldn't see her inhumanity and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a little boy.
If I have my convictions sometimes different from the sena, I always ask if my actions are in accordance with his vision of things.
I also had problems in my work for these convictions.
For me, it's impossible to go in a contrary sense, I don't sleep it, and I always ask what he's going to think.
I don't know if I adopted his way to be or if I'm just like him, is it genetic?
In any case, he will always be my reference.
It was a little like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk between us.
Bref, he's here every day.
I feel his presence, and this makes me happy.
It's about thirty years that my husband died at 33 years of age.
I was 28, and my son was six.
The great pain that then invaded me was certainly shocked, but he's always close to me.
It's so often "shoot" in my dreams in such a precise way, as it lives that I'm still worried to find that it was just a dream.
On the other night, he asked me if I was fine, I said not to him, he answered me "I go" but so real that I was washed up in overwhelming, angry, and I shooted the cheese lamp by watching all over there, convinced that he would happen.
I'm always living in the same house, and often, I feel watched and I'm back to see if he's not here, I know that it's him and I'm talking to him.
I feel his presence in all parts, and this makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I wouldn't leave this house where we've been happy, or his spirit lives with me.
I've been 58 years old, I've always lived alone since his start, he's and will remain the love of my life.
I want to clarify that I'm so-called with a responsibilities, I smile and sing, I'm a grandmother, I'm full of friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk to him except with my son, and I'm never going to be in the cemetery.

The cocain lawyer who informed a drug talk of a police investigation was imprisoned
Basharat Dita, 42 years old, gave information to the register of the crime Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret addiction to drugs was not revealed in the great day
He was sentenced to a three-year-old prison penalty by the Liverpool Court of Assis
A large defence lawyer, who had informed a major police investigation parliament because he was afraid that his secret addiction to the drug was not recovered, was sentenced for three years of prison.
Basharat Dita, 42 years old, provided sensitive information to the senator of the crime Neil Scarbrough on investigations on his activities related to drug trafficking after being compromised because of its cost of consumption of cocaine.
The lawyer, who was named Bash and considered by criminals as a “first importance dossier”, was arrested in his home in 2011 after police listening operations addressed to Scarborough, which was represented in a previous case in relation to drug trafficking.
Police officers returned to Sarborlow, 32 years old, in putting three cocaine sacks at the house of the lawyer in Indonesia, in the Lancashire, while he attended a dinner of the Barreau with fellow sisters.
The surveys revealed that it was a “regular consumer” of this class A drug after tests shown cocaine tracks in his hair, on his portal and credit cards.
During a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain illegal information on the arrest of two men for the Scarborough account, as well as one of his associations.
The four suspects were monitored at the time by the police under an important investigation on heroin and cocaine trafficking in the parts of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
With 32 other men, they were later prisoned after the police got heroin and cocaine for an amount of 1,5 m2 and more than 2000,000 pounds of species during a series of roots.
Dita, 42 years old, provides information to criminals because he was afraid that his toxicomania was not revealed in a great day.
Today, at the Court of Liverpool's Assistants, Dita, who works in the Forbes Solicitors Office in February, has been disgraced after being accused of two guests of injury to justice after a proceeding of three weeks.
He acknowledged the possession of cocaine during the previous hearing.
The lawyer's rupture occurred after the police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been regularly in telephone contact with Dita in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and again arrived in the Dita's home and shocked drugs, pursuant to 60 per cent, under the lawyers in a black golf win.
Shortly after the deposite, Scarborough has been regularly in phone contact with Dita who was at a dinner at Ewood Park's footstate, pregnant of the district Rovers club.
The lawyer returned to his home, discovered the drugs and telephoned in nine times.
The court heard that it was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after tests showed traces of this class A drug in his hair, on his portal and credit cards.
It was later arrested, but he refused to consume cocaine. He said he had spoken to the presumed drug trafficker because he was his customer and claimed that their discussions were subject to a 'right privacy'.
During his arrest, Dita switched his portfolio and tried to remove several credit cards, but all of them were inverted and predicted to him a sample of hair.
When a questionnaire, he stated that he had a office at his home, as well as at his place of work, and that clients were calling him home for legal order issues.
But the court heard witnesses that he called major drug trade actors, some of whom he had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were well known.
The lawyer Anne Whyte said: “If someone must know that the law is not to be violated, it's a criminal lawyer.”
Mr. Dita is accused of being abused of his position as a criminal lawyer, and of being too involved with private customers.
The relationship we speak is not just a drug trafficker, but a drug trafficker providing drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will, without doubt, be the legal communication because it was his lawyer.
But this went well beyond the regular limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his customer.
He hindered the police investigation as far as he could allow him to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Dita did not honor his professional, but he dishonored it.
He was too close to some customers, especially Scarborough, and left to compromise his independence.
Sayta refused any illicit act and said, "If I was a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I wouldn't have waited for 15 hours, I would have done it immediately."
But after the hearing, the supervisor Lee Halstead of the Lancashire police said: "M. Dita has been a criminal lawyer to himself because he began to deal with drugs with criminal organizations. "
His addition to the cocaine has always undertaken it and made it vulnerable to the backwards of the leaders of the organized criminal groups who had been responsible for the finding of precise information on police investigations.
The lawyers should observe the most strict integrity rules and establish a climate of trust in the public.
Mr. Dita tragic this confidence and tried to shut down behind his profession.
Lancashire's serious and organized crime unit conducted the investigation on Mr. Dita, which was accused of the three heads of charge of cocaine possession and now towards justice, demonstrating its commitment to continue criminals in justice.
That this case serves for warning to criminals to know that no one is above the law.
We'll find you and we'll translate you before the courts.
Scarborough himself was prisoned for 14 years after being sentenced to the committee of heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Twenty-five other persons involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years of prison for drug trafficking.
On his website, Dita organized a meeting of questions/responsibilities on himself during which he said that his dream job would be a lawyer for representing customers in the death couloir in America, his last invitation to dinner would be Mohammed Ali and the inequality would be the reason to work.

New Collection Requirements against Saint-Croix Brothers
A new request for collective appeal was made against the Saint-Croix brothers, regarding sexual aggressions that would have been issued this time at the Hour of Saint-Joseph, as well as in several orphans, colleagues and schools.
The application was supported on the testimony of the applicant, identified as "J.J.", which had been masturbed in the 1950s, first in Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his Professor, Brother Sumis, then by his condemnant, the father Bernard, at the Hour of Saint-Joseph, where he was serving of messe and where his father worked as a penner.
The first appeal saw only three institutions, and when the regulation was announced, many people said to us, "I was there, can I register me?", tells the lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in the two resorts.
The collective remedies that have been dismissed in particular have been given to allow the approximation of complainants from any establishment where slaughterings could be perpetrated by members of the congregation of Saint-Croix.
At the present time, the appeal gathered the complaints of 25 persons who claimed to have been attacked by the Saint-Croix brothers.
The facts raised are generally older than those mentioned in the first resort, since many of the establishments referred to have closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also stressed that the congregation of Saint-Croix and the Hour of Saint-Joseph, which is a separate entity, "permitted sexual illness to be perpetrated against children," they "exercised a moral, religious and psychological strict on the victims," which they were "the knowledge of the perpetrated sexual slaughter and yet endured them", and that they were "wise and consciously chosen to ignore the questional."
These last accused are based on letters written by the lawyer of the Sainte-Croix Brothers, Me Emilie Perrin, in the 1990s, but also by the investigations made in the archives on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, an elderly brother of Sainte-Croix, who publicly condemned the illnesses.
The collective appeal must first be passed to the stage of receibility in the Supreme Court.
Once the Court's admissibility has been granted, the second step is carried out, or the fund audits.
In the case of the first appeal, the congregation of Saint-Croix had accepted to regulate the friend before the audits were carried out.

Many opposition to medical assistance to die at the Palliative Congress
The Canadian Congress of Palliative Care, which has been launched this week in Ottawa, takes place a few days after the vote on the principle of the draft legislation on medical assistance to die in Quebec.
It is the opportunity for several Palilian care associations to reaffirm their dealing.
If all sicks had access to effective care to eliminate their suffering, in addition to their ability to stay at home, very few of them would like to end up in their days, according to the Canadian Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
If it was highlighted on palliative care in Canada, the approach of euthanasie would be minimum.
The Chairman of the Palilian Care Network of Quebec also rejected the draft medical assistance law.
If it is adopted, Alberte Dery is concerned about the consequences of the next generations.
"This is the sense of life," she regrets.
The majority of palliative care houses will refuse to help patients to die, according to the Vice-President of the Palliative Care Houses Alliance, Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of the Matthieu-Froment-Savoue house in Gatineau, believes that the service would be inutile.
We never ask us, "I want to die, give me a injection."
The Director of the Ontario Palelian Care Association, Rick Firth, believes that the Québec ' s Legislative Project dismisses the population with regard to the vocational care.
He doesn't believe that the Ontario will stop the step.
On the other hand, the liberal deputy of Gatineau, Stephanie Vallé, states that the concept of the end of life must be clarified before the draft legislation is adopted.
The Chinese press is dealt with the media law.
“It is an encouraging country and it is legitimate to address the following question: would Parliament prevent the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?” said the journal by contesting the draft legislation and demanding what it is unconstitutional.
"This law is dramatic and very punishable, and we reject it," explained Cyrus Kamau, Director-General of Capital Group – CapitalFM's owner, one of the most independent radio stations and websites in Kenya.
He stated that the new Medium Court will “will be partially because it is a long-term government” and that the restrictions on content and publicity would weaken the place of Kenya in the world economy.
"I hope that the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this draft law and send it to the parliamentary," he added.
According to The Star, the new law project will enable the Government to have “manage the media”. The Standard stated to him that the democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya“ had taken a hard cut” and endorsed the law project qualificating the “dragonian”.
The adoption of the draft legislation takes place at the same time as a train of measures to strengthen national security in the slaughter of the attack by armed Islamics in the Westgate Trade Center in September last.
The Chinese media raised the angry of the authorities by spread images of video monitoring cameras on which armed armies were deployed on the scene of the attack, with the luxury trade center.
The police chief David Kimaiyo reacted with two journalists and one of the media responsible for interrogating them, although the convocation has been removed after a ride of the media.
In accordance with the new legislation project, media may be passive to 20 million Chinese shills and journalists until 1 million with the additional risk of being "radied" or not receiving official press credition.
The Court also has the power to enter the goods of a contravenant if it has not paid its amendment.
According to Daily Nation, “a single amendment is enough to paralyse most FM stations. ”
He also said that the measures could have a devastating effect on what he has described as the "animated blogosphere" of Kenya.
By reducing the media in silence, political men know that they can do what they want in any impunity.
"No one will ever know", wrote Mutuma Mathhiu, journalist in The Nation, describeing the Chinese media as a source of key control in public life.
"Fromed to themselves, the political men would put the country in faility and bring us to chase and colleague."
The Chinese legislators were the target of the angry of the population in the past.
In May, they took place against the cuts ordered by the National Commission for Sales and rebuilding their milk salary of approximately 532.000 shills per month exposed taxes, which are among the highest world's world.

He missed about 30 per cent of the necessary effectiveness, making this “excellent” financial year, according to the head of the Department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS decided not to employ independent work, which can cost up to three times more than a pharmacien who is full-timely employed.
We didn't have any remedies for the depanage, explained Mrs. Beaudet.
Some of our activities were racionalized or decreased within the paleral establishment, the time that things are replaced.
It is sure that we have worked strongly to interest our young people [residents in pharmacie] to come and stay here.
There is a concourse of circumstances that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After that period, the year 2013-2014 was clearly more easy for the CSSS pharmaceutical department.
However, three pharmaciens are returning to work after their maternity department and three other pharmacies have been built during the last months.
Furthermore, the efforts made by the Department to retain fruit, since the four students currently living in Laval have also decided to remain in the CSSS employment.
Now, it's much better, stressed the pharmacin.
From the end of the financial year, we will have seven new pharmaciens and three maternity returns.
This will therefore be covered by our departures in the past year.
Beliefs always grown
However, the situation remains delicate.
several factors, such as hospital pharmaciens or predominance of young women in the household, make situations such as difficult to prevail in 2012.
For us [the number of effects] is always precaution, because we have a youth environment that is young and is employed by many young women, so with pregnancy, we are almost always rolled to three maternity seats when it's okay, she added.
Last year, there was much more and no pharmaciens available to make replacements, so it was harder.
The top model of 22 years does not begin his cart on the cinema by the small door.
Lars van Trier chose it to incarnate Charlotte Gainsburg young in Nymphomaniac, his next film.
This Egyptian pornographic dragon, in eight chapters, will come out in two sides (the 1 and 8 January 2014), the erotic memories of an increased gender frame since its adolescence.
The likeness of Stacy Martin with his old age is shocked: a brindile silhouette, a sweet diaphan and French-English origin.
Unless you forget a certain risk enjoyment: the one that was not able to put noise on the glass paper will be shown in more surfurous situations on large screen.
A extrait of Nymphomaniac made up the temperature on the Toile: Stacy Martin appears at the bed and in full expansion with Shia LaBeouf.
If the cinema producer asked his actors to put their puder on the placard, he had recurred to professionals of X for the most shocked sex scenes before fusioning all the body digitally: above the ceinture, it is the star; below, dublure.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsburg, passing by Nicole Kidman, Lars van Trier has a way to put his actors in their last resets, always for the best.
Stacy Martin hasn't finished talking about her.
A Narbonne CGR room evacuated Thursday night
On Thursday night, the first film meeting was interrupted at the Narbonne CGR Mega, as precautional, after pitting at the gorge of the spectators.
In the meantime, the director of the establishment processed the evacuation of the room and prevented the powders for a suspect odor.
About 70 people have been out of the meeting.
Persons have been reviewed and a full recognition of the room has not been given.
Mouvaise lacrymogen on the background of the lacrymogen jet?
Or involuntary incident?
It is always that the direction of the cinema has played the precaution and security of its customers.
The room was shipped and everything came back to the order.
The film has been able to restore his rights and customers to find the enjoyment of images.
Only on screen.
It tries to import 2 kg of cocaine in citrus
As a result of the day of the Halloween, a woman tried to enter the country two kilometers of cocaine dismissed in cyclings on Thursday morning at Montreal-Trudeau airport.
It is during the review of the passenger bags that drugs could have been detected.
Cocaine was divided in three cytroleles previously living.
The drug was then carried out to the Office of the Kingdom Gendarmery of Canada (GRC), which took the rest in this investigation.
The Canadian Border Services Agency (ASFC) has not revealed where the woman had arrived when it was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, stated Jacqueline Roby, the ASFC's talking port.
What I can tell you is she came to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border services agents at Montreal-Trudeau airport have conducted 173 drug inputs, including 10 cocaine income for a total of 44 kg.
In 2012, border services officers in the Quebec region conducted a total of 1653 drugs income.
Aircraft against military installations in Syria
According to the Libanon Army, Israeli aircraft entered in the Lebanese airspace at the beginning of midday, but the shocks took place in the evening.
A short-term air mixture loading SA-8 would have been targeted and destroyed.
This new root of the Tsahal aircraft in Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) was not confirmed by Israel or Syria.
The radius was launched in several circumstances nearly identical to those that had occurred on July 5th: at the time, it was also an anonymous American responsible who confirmed an Israeli attack to CNN, which had this time provided Russians to Damass.
The Israeli responsibilities did not hide their irritation to see Washington reveling the attack, at the risk of abolishing President Assad to react.
Ukraine approaches the failite
The Standard & Poor's Task Force has been able to sell Ukrainian solventivity note, with doubt of the capacity of the former Soviet Republic, receipt for more than one year, to address its financial obligations.
The note of public debt titles of the country is "B-", which focused on the specific investment category.
It is assured of a negative perspective, S&P, which has at least a chance of three if it is re-absented from this year.
"It is less likely that the Government's strategy allows sufficient foreign statements to address its high external funding needs", explains the American Agency.
The Agency states that the changes reserves in Ukraine have decreased from 26 per cent between September 2012 and September 2013 and that tendency will continue.
This complies with the reimbursement of foreign credits.
These reserves, in which the authorities are most useful for supporting the local currency, Hryvnia, explaning, and more likely assessing the Agency, which would fulfil its external debt.
Kiev also needs liquidity to regulate its gas imports in Russia, which accused it of not paying an account of $882 million.
This advertising is a bad news for the Ukrainian power in a lifetime of tensions with its Russian neighbourhood, furious of the will of Kiev to sign a association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was public in the next day of the publication of official statistics that showed that the country's economy had suffered from July to September its fifth quarter after contraction.
His finally, still relatively modest, has explosed the past few years and S&P estimated 33.5% of GDP, against less than 10% before the crisis 2008-2009.
The country, as a budget deficit, has been claiming for months to support the International Monetary Fund, which has granted it in 2010 a $15.3 billion, and has not been released by only 3.4 billion.
However, the Fund refuses to pay any new trading as long as the country will not adopt impopulary reforms to reduce its deficit, in particular by increased gas prices to the population.
As a result of a new infructuous mission in the country, the IMF found this week that "the important needs in external funding" were "unvulnerability", but "the signs of economic improvement".
However, for the economist Oleksandr Joloud of the Political Education Center, "not can expect short-term improvement".
"There is little hope that impopulary reforms are launched in a pre-electoral year," the presidential elections planned in 2015, reports the expert, interviewed with the AFP.
The only hope is an improvement in international conjunction.
S&P also describes the "incertitude" linked to the possible signing of a association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which provided Brussels to the release of the opposite Ioulia Timochenko.
"Subscribe the agreement would be positive for long-term trade but it could have negative consequences for Russia's reaction," explained S&P, who fears "commercial restrictions" from Moscow.
Russia, which represents the fourth of the Ukrainian exports, predicted that in the establishment of a free trade zone between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its border controls for imported goods.
Green fire from the United States at the Publicis-Omnicom fusion
Publicists and Omnicom said the Friday did not receive any objection from the American authorities to their fusion, so that the establishment of the first World Publicity Agency was approached.
The fusion actually approaches the second World Agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Group today announced the expiration of the period of review of the previously announced fusion by Publicis Group and Omnicom, provided by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended," announces the two groups in a communication.
They indicate that they have also received the necessary authorisations in Canada, India and Turkey after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiration of the period of review provided by the HSR to the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in other courts shall comply with several conditions for the implementation of the operation.
"The fusion is also conditioned to obtain other regulatory authorisations and the approval of the shareholders of the two groups," they add.
The Congolean army slaughtered the M23 rebels
The Congol Army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units will slaughter the M23 rebels to their bases in the forests and mountains of the north-Kivu limitroph of Rwanda and Ukraine.
The M23 appears to be slaughtered after being discovered from the northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (RDC) which it was controlled since the beginning of 20 months ago from the insurance.
"We're going to continue the M23 and we'll cover it all around where it's hiding because it's criminals," said the colonel Olivier Hamuli, the FARDC's portal.
We must not let them reorganize because they martiried the Congolean people for too long.
It's time to bring peace back.
M23 responsibilities explained that these military rebellious reverses would not change their returns to peace talkers.
These recently, according to the ungarn mediators, have again been marched in Kampala between the Kinshasa government and M23.
Accommodations are reported in the collines that dominist Bunagana, the last place in the hands of the insured people to be slaughtered this week, as well as in the neighbors of Runyoni, a colline where M23 rebellion saw in 2012.
In November, the insurances occupied Goma, head of the North Kivu province, benefiting from the escape of the government garnison and the passiveness of the blue ships of Monusco.
The fall of Goma has brought the United Nations Unit Mission, the most important to the world in terms of effectiveness, strengthening its mandate and forming a rapid intervention bride composed of South African, Malaria and Tansania soldiers.
On his side, the major state of the FARDC was remaned, and the army has passed to the Ombudsman against M23, making changes in the war course.
The rythm of progress of government troops is now unprecedented.
"M23 seems to touch its end," a congolean business experts, Jason Stearns, predicted on his blog Congo Siasa.
It would be historic - it would be the first time that Kinshasa's government succeeded in fighting a major insurrection.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group in Rwanda would be present in the east of the RDC.
United Nations experts accused Rwanda, who fairly noted it, to militaryly support M23, which was formed at the start of former congolean military soldiers.
The chief of British diplomacy, William Hague, invited the Ruanda President Paul Kagame to make evidence of retention, announced a foreign port.
Last week, Kigali had declared the possibility of military repairs after the bus slaughtered in Rwanda.
Mercredi, Bunagana's inhabitants shipped the bourgade streets to welcome the income of the FARDC soldiers.
"We lived a year with M23 and it seemed to be a day freed by the army," said a people of this limited location in Uganda.
"We lived in the terrific (the M23), we're traumated," added this man.
The Pasteur Institute's tests on a suspected patient to be infected by the coronavirus were negative, announced the Ministry of Health.
He states that "the two cases identified in May 2013 remain the only two cases confirmed in France today."
Thursday, this 43-year-old patient was suspicious to be reached, after being returned from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already produced 50 deaths.
Chevron, the second American oil company, has made a decrease of the trimestrial benefit because of the decrease of its raffinage margins, while its oil and gas production has increased while remaining in relation to the targets of the group.
His net benefit of the third quarter has reduced $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per action, against $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per action, a previous year.
The analysts interviewed by Reuters at average were a benefit of $2.71.
The group has produced 2.59 million oil equivalent bars per day during the quarter, increased by 2.52 million bpj produced a year ago.
The company is 2.5,65 million bpj for this year, with an increase of 25% of the production expected from 2017.
The major part of growth in the coming years will come from its licked natural gas projects in Australia.
As a result of the cost of these projects, annual investment costs increased $7 billion in two years and $36.7 billion in 2013 should be reached.
The benefits of production activities have slightly reduced the third quarter, while the benefits of swimming activities (refining and chemical production) increased from 45 to 380 million dollars.
This decrease of refinance margins touchs the whole sector.
Thus, the main competitor of Chevron, Exxon Mobil, has made a net benefit, despite the increase in its production of gas and oil.
School transport: Received complaint
The School Commission of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) requires from the beginning of the school year of $1,50 per students (for a maximum of $300 per family) for students who receive school transport for two residents, a service that the organization provides when it is able to do it.
Before the changes made to the last budget, no financial contribution was claimed.
" There is a mediation service proposed by the Commission and I was interested," she explained.
According to it, the CSRS was invited to a mediation and requested additional time for consideration.
"It's always better talking about it, concerting and finding solutions," Mrs. Lefèvre believes.
The School Commission of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) did not want to comment.
The organization only means that mediation is part of the process during a complaint.
Immbroglio around the closet of the hotel-Deu urgences
It was a part of the staff and several unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, who decided on 10 July to "develop the calendar for the implementation of the project, and in particular the date of urgence closer that will not be able to intervene on 4 November".
Officially requested "to run any risks on urgency support in Paris at the beginning of winter" but was also intended to not generate the PS campaign for a few months in the municipalities.
Despite ministerial consignments, the closure should also be effective at that date.
Even if A PHP prefers the term "transformation" or "changing in continuity".
From 4 November, the powders who were assured about 400,000 annual passengers at the emergence of the Hotel-Deu will be all received to report to bring 30 serious cases a day to the emergences of other Paris hospitals.
This date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewal of internates.
In Hotel-Deu, the urgency specialized internals will take place on Monday five general doctors.
With regard to the transfer of internal medical beds, it is programmed for the month course.
"The Emergency Service of the Hôtel-Deu must close in the shortest term, and for us, it is 4 November," ensures, without delay, Loïc Capron, the President of the A.M. Medical Committee (CME) of PHP, which supports the project of direction.
"On 4 November, there will be no more patients brought by pompiers, only those sold by their own means, " confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical director of the new Hotel-Deu.
"But we will continue to welcome patients at an emergency level, heavyly, causing the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on place to transfer serious cases.
An older urgency doctors will remain on place, and it will also be able to ensure.
But it belongs to the ARS to decide to close the emergency recovery service.
"The things are progressively done," answered Nicolas Péju, the ARS's portal, for which, on November 4th, "no changes in terms of service made."
"The Minister has lied to us or we lied to him," the urgent doctor Gerald Kierzek regrets.
He departed from his head of SMUR at the beginning of July for having conducted the frode against the reorganization project, he is defined as a "a warning launcher" against a "cynical" decision taken by "the medical and administrative technology".
"They are in ice and asphysixing emergency that have been renewed less than five years ago," he estimates.
For him, "if other Parisian emergency services could absorpte the overpower, there was no problem."
They are regularly engraved.
For example, there are nine hours of waiting at the emergency of Lariboisière.
The ARS states that thirty "dispatched" patients on several sites may not represent a "valanca" in other emergency services, which will also be strengthened by human means.
As ASS, the "new hospital model" is defended since October 7 and should continue to welcome 30 000 to 35 000 patients each year.
From the end of the year, liberalian general doctors should also be involved in the establishment of an "ambulance care persistence".
"Where are we going to ask the people to diagnose self-diagnosis", questions Gérald Kierzek for which "the concept of emergency is harmful" and marks a "medic regression".
It's going to be like for level 3 maternities.
People are not crazy, they're going where there is the best care offer.
If the Minister does not take this Monday, we're going to change brakes, Christophe Prudman, urgency doctor and members of the CGT Health.
We will be more present in the municipal campaign and we will consider a list.
In the Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet team, Vincent Roger, advises the UMP of Paris and elected from the fourth rounding, clearly announces that "if the Parisian UNP was for the maintenance of emergency at the Hotel-Deu, it would be technically and financially impossible to re-open them if they return to responsibilities."
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, once again recalled her on Monday, on France. She was pronounced for a moratorium that was not closed on November 4th.
If that was the case, she would mark its net deal, emphasize Bruno Julliard, her talking door.
Although the restructuring of the Hotel-Deu has its legitimacy on the ground, we cannot accept it without an acceptable report scheme to other hospitals.
Obama ends the hearing of the IMF and the World Bank
Barack Obama ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to finish the hearing of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in the context of its information activities, indicated a United States responsible, Thursday.
This decision is part of the white house's attempt to recovered the NSA's listening case after the revelations made by the former analyst Edward Snowden, refugee in Russia.
It is the first time that the oversight of the IMF and the World Bank is mentioned by the Information Agency since the beginning of the scandale.
Question on this subject, one responsible for the United States Administration said: "The United States do not take electronic supervision for the seats of the World Bank and the IMF in Washington."
Expressed under the box of the anonymat, the applicant did not specify whether such monitoring was established by the past.
Another official stated that Barack Obama had ordered to stop these practices during the past weeks.
This instruction was provided nearly at the same time as that which ends to the hearing of the General Quarter in New York.
In this context, the Senateal Commission of Information adopted on Thursday a strengthening of the monitoring controls on the Government's monitoring programmes, but allowed them to continue.
The Commission has established new restrictions on data authorized to collect and imposed a limite of five years for the conservation of these information.
United Nations welcomes the new objectives for combating poverty
The United Nations will now work on a new series of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (OMD) which had been established 12 years ago to combat poverty in the world.
Australian diplomates have played a key role in improving the “sufficient development goals” to replace WHOs, which will expire in 2015 before the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development, which began the older in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final project of the document, which will be adopted by the world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
The Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon said that it was now time to “more over national interests”.
"I am happy that Member States have agreed to start and approve the process to fix universal sustainable development goals (ODD).
These WHO will support the progress made in the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 Development Framework.
I will do the maximum to achieve the mandate that the Member States have been granted to achieve our vision of the objectives of sustainable development that support the success of WHO.
The security concern in Mozambique grows at the same time as conflicts shrink between powerful personalities
At the foot of the Statue of Samora Machel, the founder of Mozambique, at the towers, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to scanne peaceful slogans during a rare public manifestation.
“We want peace to return; we want stability” said Vanessa de Sousa, director-General of an investment society.
She was concerned about the future of her country, and she changed its working clothes against a tee-shirt, which mentions “We want security” in Portugal before joining the massive people on the place of the capital Independence.
During two weeks we were almost every day of the reports of conflict between government forces and Renamo, the worst increased since the peace agreement that has been signed over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a famous rebellious movement, supported by the Rhodesia ruled by white people, then the Government of South Africa in the context of efforts to destabilize the independent Government of the country.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became a party of opposition.
Analysts believe that the country should not go back to an open conflict, but recent events have broken foreign investors and local populations.
The extent is considerable for the full growth economy, since the discovery of extensive offshore gas reserves and carbon gases in the north-west could affect more than $50 billion of investments in the next years, such as Rio Tinto, Brazil Vale, Eni of Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
Frelimo, the party to power and the main political force since 1975, and Renamo is mutually rejected the responsibility of tension.
Renamo states that the government is the origin of recent faces and that it has launched a attack against its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional base of Renamo, on October 17.
The murders on the ancient rebellians were then degenerated when the government forces attacked the bases of Renamo and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, the Renamo's talking port, according to the Financial Times.
The Government is responsible for the deployment of conflicts by Renamo, and the accused of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza tried to minimise the instability concerns.
Mr. Guebuza declared Wednesday to the AFP that Mr. Dhlakama would like to be a "perdidor" who wanted to use "all the forces he remained to try to prove that he could put his decisions to the Government".
Frelimo and Renamo insist that they both want to avoid war.
But the concern was great after Mr. Mazanga said that Renamo abandoned the 1992 peace agreement.
He said to the FT that he wanted to say that the agreement was no longer respected by the Frelimo.
"We want to take the negotiations again, but with the most seriousest", said Mr. Mazanga.
The previous discussions between the parties have not been able to eliminate the tensions provided by a series of conflicts this year.
"There are two great men (Gubuza and Dhlakama) who are not stopping to discuss themselves", explained Joseph Hanlon, a Conferencier of the Open and Specialist University of Mozambique.
No one knows to negotiate, and no one is ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is in favour of election reforms, had already said that it would shock the municipal elections before being held in November.
The presidential and legislative elections are planned next year.
Some comments interpreted the use of the force as the attempt of a sick movement to obtain concessions and a war treasurer from the government.
The part of the suffrages collected by Renamo has stopped declining since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) which was created by an elderly Renamo member, should be obtained a larger number of volunteers for elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza – which should be retired at the end of its second mandate next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He doesn't want a multipartite democracy, he does not want transparent elections, does not want peace because he does not want to leave the Presidency," said Mr. Mazanga.
We do not know exactly what the capacity of Renamo is, but it has led to disappointing attacks on the police committees and vehicles on a major North-South audience axis.
Most accommodations took place in Sofala Province, which is situated in hundreds of km north of Maputo, but where Beira is the port of mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export carbon.
In June, Rio couldn't use the iron road for about one week after the Renamo threatened to attack the rail line.
Mr. Mazanga was fairly scared when asked if Renamo would react this threat.
Renamo wanted to “advertise the international community that things do not go well to Mozambique” said Mr. Mazanga.
Instability has strengthened the frustrations caused by the Government, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media society, and many people are also concerned about corruption, development lenses and recent vague inductions.
“The people think that the government and the President are responsible for the future of the country, and that it is to find solutions to the problem”, explained it.
Omar Suluana, a demonstrator, said that people only wanted stability.
"No one worry about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to restore peace, they want to have free access to roads," he added.
The author should teach the myths and legends to children as “the models of life,” said.
Thor's Legend could show that “the brutal force does not face the weight of the subtle Russian” while Arturian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
According to many mythes, "too violent, well too scandaleous and in some cases, too much obscene to be taught at the school," Crossley-Holland predicted a "minute selection" of works adapted to age.
"I'm incredible that in America, mythes and folklor already become a part of education," he said.
I enjoy this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that the authors and teachers are “openly doctic” because children are ‘decreasing completely’, the messages are “sublimited” in favorable stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the English-saxon and wrote The Penuin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, stated: “You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of view.”
Maybe the great difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an adult author who writes for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or ended well, but there is an innocent sense of good and bad.
And it must be underlying; revealed through a story instead of declared.
The foundation is known of what it is shown and that it is not said.
A fighter of the Hamas Army branch was killed tonight and another blessed by an Israeli shooter in the Gaza flag, learned from medical and safe sources in Gaza.
According to these sources, these activists conducted an oversight operation in the border zone between the Palestinian territory and Israel when they were obtained by an Israeli blind.
NSA Spinning: the United States are "too far", says Kerry
The United States sometimes went "trop far" in sponsoring, acknowledged the secretariat of the State John Kerry, in the first pool with Europe on the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandale, revelations and dismisses between the United States and their European partners, it is the first time that an American government responsible has explicitly accepted practices in the interception of the NSA of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I conceive you, as the President did, some of these actions have been too far and we're going to make sure that this happens to the future," said John Kerry at a conference in London, which he participated from Washington on Thursday 31 October by video connection.
In his retransmission, in the presence of its British homologue, William Hague, the chief of the American diplomacy longly justified the practices of information and collection of information through the necessary anti-terrorism fight and prevention against events attacks.
Inviting the attacks of the 11 September 2001, Madrid attacks in March 2004 and London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the United States authorities had already issued many expectations projects through the interruption of communications and the collection of information.
"We have in fact prevented aircrafts, that buildings aren't exploited and that people are killed because we were able to be aware of these projects," said the American diplomate's manager.
And John Kerry said to the Europeans address, "I assure you that in this process of innocent people have not been wrong."
But we are trying to gather information.
"And in some cases, it was too far away from an inadequate way," acknowledged the State secretariat, who had already had to express on this international scandale during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He assured that President Obama was “resolutely to try to clarify and to review these practices so that no one feels wrong”.
But the dispute between Americans and Europeans continued to flow this week with new revelations in the press.
According to Washington Post, NSA intercepted hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The journal, which quotes documents from NSA Edward Snowden's former adviser, claims that the “MUSCULAR” program was baptized and conducted with the NSA GCHQ GCHQ Homolog, allows these two agencys to recover data from the optical fibres used by the internet genders.
In view of one of the documents, some 181 million elements were collected during the last month of January – methaned on emails, text elements or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would be held outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google denied all the connections with these practices.
Since ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy have shown that NSA had intercepted massively the data and communications from the United States and their leaders, including the German chanceler Angela Merkel.
As the wrath of European states, and while flights in the American press claimed that the American President was not aware of such hearings, Barack Obama refused to express this issue, calling for national security.
On the contrary, the leader of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, dismissed that his Information Agency has captured tens of millions of European citizens' communications.
He even sent the ball to European information services that would be introduced from such communications before providing them to the NSA.
This would refer to "military operations" in countries where these state partners cooperate with the United States, and it would not absolutely seek Europe, said General Alexander.
And the polemic was extended to Asia on Wednesday.
Indonesia convoked the Ambassador of Australia, whose mission was accused of being used by the Americans in the context of a broad international spanning network that also stressed China's opinion.
The Paris Saint-Germain receives Lorient, without his own master, the Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is blessed, announces the Ligue 1 club in a communication.
The PSG, leader of the Championship before Monaco on the different goals, has spread the list of players held for this 12th match, without having 32-year-old attack.
The Communicator simply indicates that it is "trained", without clarifying the nature of fertility.
However, he suffered from an inflammation of the left genus in his selection return, at the beginning of the month.
A ceremony in memory of created defunts
The creatorium of the Father Lachaise organizes at 11 a.m. a lay ceremony, in memory of all creating defunts in its establishment during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate to the Paris master, must be attended, and will then explain, at the press conference, its proposals on funeral.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own obsessions, more than more French people choose creation, rather than inhuming: 53%, according to an Ipsos study carried out on 6 and 7 September at 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the obsessions of a neighbor, it is the inverse: the French prefers inhumanation (53 per cent against 47%).
If they have the difficulty to lose a child, they're only 15% to choose creation.
In his book La Mort in Cendres, Damien Le Guay, Vice-President of the National Ethics Committee, insists on the "violence" that is the creation, for survivors.
There is, with the creation, "a violence made to the loved body", which will be "reduced to a lot of crowds" in very little time, and not after a decomposition process, which would "comply the phases of decomposition".
There is also "a symbolic violence", which aims at "excellence of individuality and distinct signs" reduced to the "anonymat" of cedars.
Why is what is accepted without punishment in some northern and protesting countries still badly living in France?
"For creation is a new fact," Mary-Fredéric Bacqué responded, President of the Oreatology Society and author of the book Appreciate death.
It is not tolerated since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited the attempts to approve it.
Thanks to the creation, it is for François Michaud-Nerard, Director-General of the Full Services of Paris, to provide a ceremony as well as for which he had been right with inhumanity.
The annual Hipsos investigation shows a strong attachment to the ceremony organization.
77% of French people want to be religious (53%) or civil (24%) for their neighbors.
Today, 73 per cent of the people chosen a creation want the organization of a ceremony.
66% of the athletes or nonbelievers also want it.
Krematoriums agreed to this development of society.
"When a decade of years they seek to avoid the violence of a expectation, without doing, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the remise of the cedars," observes Mr. Michaud-Nerard.
70% of the establishments are now offering ceremony masters, which come, in the presence of the body, to the following ritual: welcome the assembly, calling the defunt, linking him to others, evoking it, giving sense to his death, organizing the adieu.
This is the case in the Creator of Father Lachaise since 1998.
Ceremony masters are often people who have become converted.
There are also ancient Catholic priests.
It is in this context that the Creator of Father Lachaise has organized, since 2010, the day of La Toussaint, a number of monuments, laïcs and non-religious ceremonys, to which he invites the families of persons who have been credited in the year.
For the second consecutive year, one of these ceremonys is re-linked, at the attention of those who could not be moved.
Crematorium has allowed us to relax it.
In La Seyne, the recycling for rats turns to the polemic
In the beginning of the week, a family left his apartment in the Fructidor D2's fashion, due to the presence of rats.
In the urgency of the situation, the head of the South Habitat Office proposed, in an exceptional and provisional manner, to relocate the couple and its three children in a new T4.
However, the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case took exaggerated proportions, estimated Joel Canapa, head of the office.
rats, there's always been in the towns.
The deratization company takes two passes per year, and, moreover, we are in charge, on each request of the inhabitants.
We have done so, since the end of the winter, 64 interventions.
The neighbourhood is not left to leave, and the rats do not pull in the city.
For reasons for the protection of the environment and public health, deratification products are four times less effective than through the past, of course, but for two rats, we will not kill a boy.
"We have not sent rats to us," the family father who left his accommodation to install it in the hotel.
Soon we're free and we're waiting for a new accommodation, the same rate as the older.

Ben Greenman : New York's 16th anniversary Comedy Festival : The New Yorker
It could be said that the city of New York is the place where it is born stand-up in America: almost 100 years ago, the Vaudeville Frank Fay, who took the role of the master of ceremony at the theatre Palace, on Broadway, began to tell the public's breachs directly, on the tone of the conversation.
Fay's innovation continued over the years, until it was recently renewed by the New York comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up Carolines club, the famous celebration of his tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 spectacles presented in small clubs and large theatres.
“The majority of the show heads exploded in Carolines, and have known a great success, until they became too famous to play in a club” said Hirsch.
We have created this festival in order to continue working with them.
The event of this year will see the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of “State Up for Heroes”, a commodic and musical feast for old fighters, organized at Madison Square Garden, which will be present, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival took the wideness, as well as the commodity world.
several of the comedians participating in the festival of this year have been conducted by non-traditional circuits, for example, showing spectacles on small TV chains, such as Comdy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll appeared on the front of the scene in a sitcom on a boxed chain (The League) to the theme of the fantasy football, joyfully decisive of the FXX chain, and now his own sketch spectacle on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate participated in the Saturday Night Live emission and was part of the casting series "Parks and Recreation", but she is still more known for its series of viral videos "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians to the unique voice (the superrealist pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the iranic defender of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of the United States Comedie.
One of the main attraction factors of the festival this year will be a entertainment: David Steinberg discussed with Larry David.
Steinberg started as stand-up commits, but it has become a complete film and television realist, as well as an informal commodity history.
Between 2005 and 2007, he developed a TV Land emission called Sit Down Comdy with David Steinberg.
It takes place in the Ville Hotel, in the centre of Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the cooked DNA of all Larry's work” said Steinberg.
He told me that when he was here, sometimes he went down a rule between two buildings and said well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'd come to live here.

Appeal to the Court of Justice to Texas
A Federal Appeal Court re-established in Texas some restrictions on the right to voluntary pregnancy interruption, which had been blocked by a court of first instance this week.
This judgment means that a legislative text adopted in July in this State and which is widely subject to the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
The arrest made by the Call Court means that doctors who practice IVGs should have a "admission privacy" to local hospitals.
The accession privacy is the right of a doctor, in accordance with his member's status of a hospital, to grant a patient in a hospital or medical centre to deliver a diagnosis or treatment.
Defenders of the IVG claim that the content of the law may be translated immediately by a third of the state clinics because these clinics have not been able to obtain this "admission privacy" for their practices.
It would be nearly 22.000 women who would be privately access to these institutions.
On Monday, a court of first instance had estimated the entry into force of the law that the provisions relating to the accession privacy were anti-constitutive.
But the General Actor of Texas, the Republic of Greg Abbott, who is in charge of the Governor's position, requested the Court of Auditors to cancel the sentence of the first instance which blocked the application of the law.
A plenary hearing on this issue is planned for the month of January.
The New Star has succeeded with a forced return, the hearing side, with 1.3 million TVs behind their television post, or 5.6% of the hearing.
But was the spectacle to make you?
Some 100,000 candidates were presented to the audits of this 10th season to address the jury: Maurane, the wicked Sinclair, the reason for André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, TVs shared their comments.
In view of the exciting finding their favorite programs, many have been discovered.
But why so deception?
No candidate seems to have actually marked in this first prize.
Like each year, the first hearing emissions have a wide choice of herb songers, for the best and sometimes the worst.
Now, on Twitter, we want a spectacle, emotion, originality, music...
Happy, some have found their account.
They're many to have tried the New Star, and sometimes even to be moved to the top.
After the television screens, the success player vocations are still there, season after the season.
Others just have the ambition to ride.
The court blocks a decision on the NYPD control and struggle policy
A Federal Appeal Court blocked the decision of a judge requesting changes in the New York police department's control and struggle.
The Court of Appeal of the United States (second circle) stated that the decision of the judge Shira Khedlin was suspended until the call was taken by the city.
The judge had stated in August that the city had violated the Constitution following its implementation of its programme to control and interrogate citizens.
The city called on its conclusions and corrective orders, including a decision to allocate a supervisor to help the police department to amend its policy and training programme.
The Appeal Court heard the arguments on the application for suspension.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge should be dismissed from the case because it engaged in the code of conduct of judges by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of partiality, in part because of a series of holdings granted to the media and statements in which it was publicly reacted to the critics of the court.
The judge had stated that police officers were violating civil rights of tens of thousands of people by targeting black and Spanish men in the framework of their monitoring and struggle programme.
It appointed an external supervisor to monitor the changes, including the reform of policies, training and supervision, and ordered the establishment of a pilot programme to test body cameras in the districts where most controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York agreed to finish the practice of maintaining the names and addresses of persons whose case is rejected after a police control.
The hearing of the call by the city should have been held after March 14, 2014.
The tactic of control and violence was criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This system of control and struggle exists for decades in a certain form, but the number of registered controls have increased spectacularly under the administration of the independent Master Michael Bloomberg, to reach its higher historical level in 2011 with 684 330 controls that were mainly related to black and Spanish men.
A judicial action was introduced in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and was transformed into collective action.
Participants who have changes in the NYPD's control and struggle programme say they will end up in unjust practices, will have more effective police forces and their trust, and can change the way the police departments use the policy.
The opposites say that these changes would minimize the moral of the police without decreasing crime, represent money gases, and would not resolve the largest problem of the police pressure forces after the effective police have been strongly reduced during the last decade.
The judge stressed that it did not end the practices of control and struggle, which are constitutional, but that it reformed the way the NYPD implemented its controls.
Locators must go to vote, as each of them pay average $100 per month on the price of the housing that goes in taxes to the Villa.
When the owner pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, it shares this amount between each housing.
We are obliged to increase loans to help us pay new taxes.
To vote, we will send a clear message.
We need to make things changed to the Ville.
All candidates told us that they would attack the scandaleous debt.
We don't have the way to pay us artificial fires to $1000,000, terrains from 4 to 5 million for case...
Let's vote, it's the best way to express you and say that it's enough.
Service End for the Chief of the Elysée
In the 500 m2 of the Ellysian kitchen as come after working in ambassadors, the kitchen graved all levels until it becomes chief, nine years ago.
He served six French Presidents, from Georges Pompidou in Francescois Holland, passing by Nicolas Sarkozy, including on their vacation places, and feed an incalculable number of larges of this world in a nearly anonymat that is just today at the time of retreat, at 60 years of age.
The man on the open face, degarni and intellectual light, born on October 24, 1953 to the Saint-Aubin is the title of a pasture CAP.
His mother was sweet in a Sologne's castle.
"I'm passing from a castee the other," Ironic Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the hands of the six presidents for which he officed, but also of their wifes and some of their invited illustrations.
"It's always the head of the State or his companion or wife that chooses the menus," he remembers.
"Ms. Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly to the kitchen," as she had prohibited women in the Elysée cuisines!
It was not moved to state leaders who showed relative indifference to earthquakes, "they are all gourmands", says Bernard Vaussion.
Jacque Chirac certainly had "a little more developed appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the hair, the seats returned empty!
As regards François Holland, who rebuild the damn, "It's someone who loves to eat" and "no big-chose he doesn't like".
The current Head of the State, who regretted the kilos lost before the presidential campaign, has no "no specific regime application".
Bernard Vaussion also recalls the pressure that was painted on his floors, especially during the dinners of the State at the Elissate: " between 200 and 250 people in an hour."
The night before is almost white.
These people wouldn't understand that there are errors.
Today, the former chief of the Ellysée kitchen, who took a drink on Wednesday night with his team, his family and friends, partly with a painting in the heart."François Hollande came to welcome me."
He said elogs.
"The human side is to smile," he says.

A survey will be conducted to determine the origin, but the shoes have discarded the thesis of a criminal act.

Coulson used the phone pirateage to check a tuyau
The former editor of News of the World Andy Coulson would use the "telephone piratege, monitoring and confrontation" to try to confirm a bidon tasting on a connection involved by the Minister of Interior then in the exercise, Charles Clarke.
The Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC declared before the Court of the Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, his “sweet special adviser”.
It was reported to the court that the newspaper called Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, was to shoot the Pawlby's vocabulary box and to "spend on before his door," but Coulson also called it and left his vocabulary messages.
"The accused suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of man to stay before the house of people by expecting to surprise them, is the kind of man to love to present the story to people to see what they say," said Mr. Edis.
He said that NotW used three ways to investigate the subjects: telephone pirateage, monitoring and confrontation.
The head editor is personally involved in the third.
It is obviously clear that it is knowing of the second, monitoring, it can't be otherwise.
But what's the first thing?
Does he know telephone pirateage?
He claims the opposite, but we say, “By sure I do. ”
The rumors on a link that involved Clarke were first repeated by the NotW's editing office when a source tried a sexual attraction against Ms. Pawlby, said that we had said, "Do not lose your time with her, she is with Charles."
A band, in which a pyramid message was recorded on his phone at least three times, was entered in the Marcaire house in August 2006.
The investigators also found entries on the computer of the private detective that concerned Ms. Pawlby and her sister in a Projects dossier.
During the period in which the detective investigated her, the grandparents of Mrs Pawlby received anonymous calls where they were requested for information on her, Mr. Edis added.
Among the time, the former reporter, Neville Thurlbeck, and the former reporter James Weatherup, supervised the oversight of the smaller facts and gestures of Ms. Pawlby.
In a vocal message he left him on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story that we expect to publish tomorrow, which I really like to speak to Charles."
Mr. Edis explained that the integration of Coulson in the history followed the same scheme as with other important men, such as the former Minister of Interior David Blunkett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson had faced Mr. Blunkett about a relationship with a married woman while he himself had the co-defence of Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks did not have skilled with others to switch phones from October 3, 2000 to 9 August 2006.
Marcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup agreed to have performed the telephone pirateage.

"The intensity of combats has reduced a little," he added, "he seems that the FARDC Army Forces of the RDC have retreated a little."
According to this witness who wanted to stay an anonymous, the soldiers had "passed the night" to Jomba before they were going to the front for a "ratification operation".
It was very clearly heard behind him of low weapons sweet creating.
From Bunagana, the fifth political and last strong place of the rebellion slaughter, an AFP journalist could hear detonations of weapons.
According to a source of the United Nations Mission for the Stabilization of the Countries, the fights have entered "in a final phase", the FARDC had "inclined the positions of the M23 residual to move them".
Since the revised, Friday, conflicts between the Movement of March 23 (M23) and the army, Monusco does not participate directly in the fights, but provides government forces a determined support in the field of information, observance and planning.

"We have finished the talks, we have remained only in the ungarn mediation to organize the signature," said Roger Lumbala, vice-president of the delegation of M23, without that this information could be immediately confirmed by the government side.

The musical commedia, this scene beast
Classic, sophisticated, popular, English or French, the changing and dancing productions take their appeal.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds his voice.
It's a revolution: the French musical is as a kind of success.
Longtimes from Paris to Mozart the rock opera, most of the attempts were prevented in the slaughter.
And successes such as Cabaret or The Miseriors brought the mystery's autumn.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin to Chatel and Stage Entertainment in Mogador changed the woman.
Today, these two scenes hold the titles as successful tubes.
The first replies, this Christmas, his excellent My Fair Lady, and announces for the next world creation of "A American in Paris".
In Mogador, "La Belle and the Beast" could be one of the successes of the season.
On the other scenes, musical spectacles such as "1789", "the friends of the Bastille" and the small musical commodities such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" are the disappearance of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Music Historys" and confer to the Chatel Theater, analyze the reasons of success so hardly conquired.
How are French musical commodities evolved?
The offer has diminished.
There is first the musical spectacles that evolve in the grade of producers...
Some use beautiful image projects and a real story as in 1789, the Bastilla Amants.
Others do a 15-year-old bond under pretext that can be served nearly anything when Matt Pokora's head is shown.
Then, musical commits have been made with the sweet productions of the Chatelet that make us recovered the gold age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the largest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popularization of angla-saxon musical commodities by adapting them in French.
Independent French producers have a perception.
But existing projects like "Rent", "The Baiser of the Women Award" or "The Eve of the Sun" are bad to be financed.
Do we have enough artists like the songer Broadway, play and dance?
In Paris, when there are eight musical spectacles in a season, it's a great year.
We have 200 talent artists that turn projects into projects.
In the United States, the musical commodity, it's very different.
Youths are formed in many schools.
The jobs are many between regional theatres, tourned, Broadway, off-Broadway...
As a result, the livement of talents is as well as the number of posts to be paid.
Why are those province tourned so successful?
On the exception of the work, the province remains the poor parent of the culture in France.
Many theatre parts are turned up and it is often a bolevard theatre for adults and not for youth.
The musical spectacles combine this lack.
These are the same young people who love telereality and what it produces as ephemer stars...
Proposal for beautiful young men (which talentous) in the head of a musical spectacle, it is the assurance of a rule of these young girls and often their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these spectacles are well held by professionals who respond to questions.
These spectacles are very waiting when they arrive in a Zenith province.
Mayonnaise is located in Paris and was disgusted by the Provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the large rooms of France in the same form as in Paris.

The aim is to move the M23 of the collines that overlook Bunagana.
Hier, we took Bugina's colline, which overlaps Mbuzi's.
Today, Mbuzi should fall from herself.
It's not gonna stay more than Runyonyi's colline.
"The Chanzu's not very strategic," stated the North Kivu Governor, Julian Paluku.
Mr. Paluku predicted that it would be a Saturday to Bunagana.
Five political and last strong place of the rebellion, this location is located in the Hungary border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was re-membered by the armed forces of the Democratic Republic of the Middle Congo.
Since a few hundreds of M23 irreducible, about 2.000 meters of height on the farm swimming pools of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and the nearby Jomba
To Jomba, a people who had made battles all day afternoon showed that the situation was "called since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the battles of the old and were entered.
One girl was blessed by ball, and three other people were blessed, including a grievely evacuated by the ARDC, added this witness referred to by the AFP.
Since the resurrection of the fights between FARDC and rebels on October 25, the two Belgians gave no balance of losses in human life.
NSA revelations increase the paranoia of enterprises with respect to State surveillance
By a beautiful day of the end of August, a German police helicopter was low-length the British Francfort Consultant, Germany's financial capital.
On the order of the Federal Constitution Protection Office (BfV), the German National Information Agency, his mission was to photograph the Tower of the United States front post, located at least 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Federal Bank.
The German media explained that BfV would expect to identify the presence of listening antennes and that the operation has caused a exchange between the United States and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, the director of American Information Services, reiterated in September that the United States did not use their foreign information capacity to “flore the industrial secrets of foreign enterprises for the account of American companies to increase their international competitiveness or increase their benefits”.
But since Edward Snowden, the adviser, became a denoncer, began to declare its unprecedented treasure of information on the secrets of the United States, European governments and business leaders, whether he must believe on the word.
Reports, according to which the National Security Agency has sponsored the Brazilian Petrobras petroleum company and had access to data detented by American store services providers in Cloud, including Google and Yahoo, have been more than ever understood the paranoia of enterprises in respect of State surveillance.
The revelation that the phone of the German lucky phone Angela Merkel was cut, perhaps even for a decade, was the water shooting that led the vase out.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be seen, business leaders are certainly also potential targets.
Snowden has transparented the intensive cooperation between the United States Information Services and business services.
I believe it is designed to use these data in their mutual interest.
"Germany must wake up," says Oliver Grün, President of BITMI, who represents the German TIC SMEs.
German companies believe that the United States are a risk as important as China when it is industrial and data shooting, according to an investigation published in July by the EC Advisory Office.
However, in all documents declared by Mr. Snowden, nothing indicates that the United States had transmitted industrial secrets of foreign enterprises to American companies.
Political men were concerned about the idea that the EU does not have sufficient IT and Internet capacity and think that it should try to reduce its dependence in the United States.
Business leaders are sceptic to this matter.
A deputy of the German Parliament said that we should create a German Google.
I can just close the eyes and open them slowly...
“This is not the good way to do,” says Hasso Plattner, President of the German business software company, SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, it was not necessary to let her die 20 years ago.
Everything is subventioned in Germany, car carbon, through farmers.
All except the IT industry.
However, the extensive and sophistication of the American Spionage Agencys exposed by Snowden's revelations were a chocolate for some companies who thought that China was the most largest risk of monitoring terms.
A great change is being made in the sky-information because European responsibilities have been aware of the fact that the data conserved in the United States are regulated under the laws of this judicial and, therefore, potentially vulnerable.
According to an investigation carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, some 10 per cent of the non-American members refused their projects to use an American store services provider in the cloud after reports on the American Data Exploration Program.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, says: "Our clients have a question today that they did not have us a year ago: where my data are stored and can you assure me that they will remain physically in this juridiction?”
Many German leaders indicate that the last reports are only a confirmation of what they have already known, and that the powerful states want to shoot their most precious secrets and that these data should therefore be observed at all prices.
It is not surprising that there is economic sponsoring.
I've always been there.
"This is a recurrent issue for many years, and nothing has fundamentally changed in the framework of the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Director-General of the BASF Chemistry Society.
Americans are sponsoring us at the commercial and industrial level as we sponsor them, because it is in national interest to defend our enterprises.
Business leaders are generally unlikely to reveal the prevention measures they have established, where this would leave advantages to an opposite.
The large corporations have been martelling the message that it is at least imprisoned to recover a free USB key in a professional room or to leave a portable computer without monitoring in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Audi Car Builder's Administration Board, states that the collection of portable phones before the meetings of the Council to be used as distance hearing devices is a practical practice for years.
Germany's BfV suggests its leaders to consider use of simple portable phones during their travels to the foreigner because of the risk of reaching smartphones integrity.
The prepayed portable phones are then dropped.
However, we are afraid that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to pirate and monitoring.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their special neck.
"PMEs often miss experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets against unlawful access," warned the BfV in a report.
The United States warn their own companies on economic sponsoring activities carried out by other countries.
The National Assessed Intelligence (NIE) carried out in February by the United States, quoted France, as well as Russia and Israel, in the second degree of having conducted economic information pirateage acts behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the administrative advisory of a German society estimated that when it is economic sponsoring, “Francis are worse”.
Bernard Squarcini, former director of French Intelligence, DCRI stated in a holding this month: “The services are perfectly well known as all countries, even if they cooperate in combating terrorism, are shocking their partners.”
The parents of a georgian adolescent, who was deceived in insolent circumstances, think that their son was killed
The parents of a georgian adolescent, whose body was found in a routine struggle in the gymnase of his school, thinking that their son was killed, declared the lawyer of the Jeudi family.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta in Georgia, was found on 11 January in a smooth supported behind the grains of his school gymnase.
The police investigators of the Lowndes Comte concluded that Johnson was deceived in insolent circumstances, but the family of 17-year-old boys contested these conclusions.
“They are absolutely some who their sons were killed,” said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson on FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as this is indicated in the conclusions of the secret.
“They think that this develops all logics, physical laws, and common sense” added Crump.
They are convinced that these conclusions have been delivered in the only purpose of covering the or the persons responsible for the death of their son.
“They sent their son to school with a carttable and they were sent to them in a deadly shoe,” he added.
The lawyer of the United States Michael Moore said on Thursday that he killed a official investigation on Johnson's death, emphasized that several important questions remained without answer.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore was expressed at a press conference after midday.
I'm going to follow the facts where they're coming.
My goal is to discover the truth.
“I believe there is a sufficient basis” to open an official investigation, said he.
Moore declared journalists that the first autopsie indicated that Johnson was deceived by “postial asphyxie.”
However, a second autopsie identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
"A number of questions still give a response or a confirmation", he stated.
Moore added that if he puts out elements of nature to justify a civil or criminal investigation on Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of Lowndes' secretary office was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A southern Georgia judge ordered mercy to the authorities to remit all video monitoring records that the investigators had considered.
The parents of the adolescent said that they hoped that video images contain indexes on the circumstances of his death.
The CDC publishers allergic advisory in the child at schools
Mercredi, the United States Diseases Control and Prevention Centre, has published a number of directives in order to manage children’s food allergies at school.
This is the first series of guidelines which the United States government publish, since the number of children in school age suffering food allergies have strongly shocked.
A 20-year-old child suffers today of food allergie.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergy in children had increased from 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to sensibilize the professional body and the staff to the food allergy in the child and how to treat them in the case of allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools have an epinephrine stock – the EpiPen autoinjector is the most smoothly used – to react quickly in cases of potentially deadly analysis.
Legislative assemblies of States recently updated the regulations to allow schools to have more epinephrine.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children with allergic reaction.
The children can say, "I have the impression that something smells me the language," "I've the impression of having a hair on the language" or "I have picotes on the language."
The NSA case stressed the total absence of information discussions
How to explain the contradictoral attitude of the French government, which is publicly offered by the embassy of the United States on 21 October, and the other prohibited the overwhelming of the territory by the Bolivian presidential aircraft, on the basis of the routine of the presence at its border of Edward Snowden?
According to me, there are two levels of response from the French government.
When François Hollande phones at Barack Obama or Laurent Fabius, Minister of Foreign Affairs, calls the U.S. Ambassador, react to a real discovery, which is the extent of the United States monitoring over all communications in France.
Isn't it surprised to read in the world's columns a few weeks intervals from one part to the reproduction of the American diplomatic correspondance and, on the other hand, a condemnation of the fourth of Orsay by the NSA?
Didn't there be a vague hypocrisy on your side?
The journalism is not a moral position, but the search for the interest and pertinence of information that allows every citizen to make a view.
When WikiLeaks highlights the analysis by the American diplomacy of political pledges or others in the whole world, we will believe that, in view of the American power, this is an important lighting.
When we describe the American interception systems against the French diplomacy to the United States, it is in no case to mislead us from this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Have France benefited of information provided by the NSA on terrorist operations for our interests?
Can we be free of the American cooperation?
The introduction of technological instruments for very powerful interception by the United States, but also by France, has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
Furthermore, France and the United States have established procedures for cooperation and exchange of information almost daily and are described as essential.
For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French people through the NSA.
France may, for example, be conducted to transmit all data blocks in the Sahel region to the United States services and, in contrast, has already been said - Americans can provide information to the French people about other regions of the world.
Thus, the substantial question behind this NSA case is not both the capacity or right of countries to intercepte, that the question of the total absence of pre-debates, including within Parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter which must be their own, and, finally, the issue of access to freedoms.
What really risks the United States? a degradation of their image?
I don't see how they can be punished.
The risk run by Americans may be double.
The first is when their allies - and it was recently - learned that their leaders, sometimes the highest top of their State, have been monitored.
This is the case of Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have been endured.
Another more economic effect may be to him: more European or South America businesses, in the light of the revelations, give their confidential data to American providers subject to the U.S. laws, and therefore the NSA imprisonment.
The last element: the broad movement of revelations involving global media, which contributes to a discussion on the practices of information services to almost unnecessary values, could encourage legislators, including the United States, to review their powers to their information services.
Intersexed children parents may choose "Indetermined sex"
Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third gender for foods born with ambiguous sexual organs.
The male or women of new births will not be strictly assigned to birth.
In the new law, parents will not be obliged to declare the sex of their children, allowing them to include a "indetermined" sex or "unspecified" on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the Law was to remove the pressure on the parent's sleeves that could take preceding decisions on sexual resignation surgery for their food, and to combat discrimination against intersexed persons.
According to BBC, a intersessional person would have said a few years later, "I'm not a man or a woman."
I'm gonna stay on the patchwork that have created doctors, contusionates, and balled.
It is estimated that two thousand children are born each year, not a boy or a girl.
They are intersexed, intersexuality in the group of seventy diagnosed diseases such as sexual disorders, a generic term designating persons with typical or textile chromosomes, or genades, or normally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersessive.
Sex identification is not always well understood, but most specialists in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, better use the best information available to allocate it, then waiting and follow child's psychological and physical development before considering a surgery act, where appropriate.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist in New York and a specialist of sexual identification issues, said that the new German law “It seems to be a good idea. ”
Intersexed children have an ethical dilemma.
“ Some people suffer extremely serious diseases that require chirurgic acts, but not the case of most children,” he added.
It is possible to make sexual assignment without operation, and see how identity is developed.
Science, which is aware of how a child will develop sexual identity is not very specific.
Nobody can answer the question of knowing why this happens.
It's like the mystery around homosexual people.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 describes intersexual persons as different trans-sexual or transgenal persons, since their status is not related to the sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is not only the one of a man or only the one of a woman, but generally both in the same time and not clearly defined as one or another.
These features may be shown by themselves in secondary sexual characters (e.g. muscular mass, pilotity, petrine and stature), primary sexual characters (e.g. reproductors and sexual organs) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also showed a view of discrimination against intersectional and transparent persons in the field of employment, as well as the extent of acts of harvest and violence and crimes caused by prejudiciary.
Youths in non-compliance with young people are now camps that are specially intended for them.
Australia and Nepal already authorize adults to include male, women or “third sex” on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian Norrie May-Welby became the first person in the world to have been recognised "neutre" after winning his process in call that authorized to keep a "unspecified" sex in life.
German passports will contain a third designation next to M or F – X for intersequent, according to the Ministry of Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are always subject to disputes, according to a report on France 24.
In 2011, twelve legislators of this extremely Catholic country signed a request to be removed from school books.
The American Catholic Online site was also opposed to the German law, writeing that “as the world is in a new government where gender is a choice, but where sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are turned into.”
In Maryland, the mother of a foodstuff also stated about the Baby Zone that she would prefer to be allocated to children to their birth.
"Paternal role is sufficiently stressing without additional restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your child," she stated on the site for youth parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without men or women were called hermaphrodites, according to the name of the magnificent Greek god that had a double sex.
And there's only a decade of years ago, the medical community would consider the kind as an ardoise, which can be removed and which we can resort.
But now, many are those who reverse the ethical foundation of the surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes the doctors may lie, do not know how a child will feel its sexual resignation when he grows.
“In the midst of the XX century, it was called a psychiatric emergency,” said Drescher.
When these children were born, they weren't called the psychiater, they were phoned to the surgery.
The dominant theory of treating children with ambiguous sexual organs was launched by Dr. John Money from the University of Johns-Hopkins, who would believe that gender is malleable.
He dedicated the term “Sexual Identity” and supported the social and environmental signals – the way parents learned a child – interact with the genes and hormones of a child to modify it so that it was identified as a male or female sex.
But in a case of 1966, known under the name of John/Joan, his theories took place in disputes.
He had advised the parents of a young boy whose penis was cut in a slaughtered circumcision to make it fully shocked, also taking the testles, and to remove it as a girl.
“Money presented this as a successful transition case, but it was not the case” said Drescher.
When I was about 15 years old, he became a boy and married to a woman.
But 38 years old, he killed himself.
Drescher said that some doctors “will repeat this model. ”
But in the 1990s, with the Internet arrival, those who survived to the sexual change operations say, "It is not satisfied with the result."
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer of Montana, who is born with young XY chromosomes but ambiguous sexual organs.
The doctors couldn't really tell if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a "friendly life" as a man.
So a few days after his birth in 1976, Bruce suffered a surgical abuse of the external body and tests and was higher as a girl.
He was taken women's hormones at the age of 12 years.
"I knew I was not a girl," he said on ABCNews.com.
I was not happy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
18 years old, he had a vagina.
But depressed and understood that something was not, he asked his medical dossier.
What he found was horrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one never told me.
Bruce is born with a sexual disorder (DDS) which prevented its body to produce sufficient textsteron so that its sexual organs could develop.
After learning the truth, a man came back, after treatment to the textsterron and took away the hands.
The surgery made it steril.
Today, it defends the cause of others in a organization called Interface Project, which is trying to normalize the perception of intersessional persons.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, director-General of the non-profit organization based in California Advocates for Informed Choice, feared that the German law “invites the labelage and stigmatization”.
" Many activists are concerned that the German law encourages parents to take rapid decisions and give their children a "indetermined" sex.
We are afraid that it encourages the interventions.
We think he'd be better assigning a male or woman's sex, and waiting.
But we have not seen what the law would give, so we can only advance hypothesis.
Tamar-Mattis stated that his organization supported the Australian law because “he authorizes adults to choose to be recognised under the third gender calling.”
“ adults should be able to take their own decisions on a legal manner”, she added.
The German law relates to the assignment of sex to birth.
It is not a battle that young children should lead to that age.
When they grow, they can take decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a specialized radiolog in mammographies in Pittsburgh, whose girl has reached a sexual degradation and who helps thousands of people in a support group, stated that the German law would "responsibly" parents and children.
The daughter of Dr. Baratz, Katie, was born with young chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called a complete syndrome of insensibility to androgens.
Because of the deficiency of his Android Receptors, Katie developed women's characteristics.
She's got a vagina, but no utterus or ears.
Today, 29 years old, Katie is married and internal in child psychiatrist at the Pennsylvania University.
Although it is steril, she hopes that children are able to have through the adoption of services or portable mothers.
“The law leaves a certain latitude to parents that they do not take careful decisions,” said Baratz.
This allows them to make some tests and understand them, and a time before you enter "bodies" or "woman".
So, everything's okay – you can get your child out and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the joy of being your parents.
You don't have to precipitate for a surgical intervention that is irreversible.
“This makes children in the heart of the decision and enthusiass the feelings of anxiety that causes parents because they fear not to do what they need,” she states.
Finally, the child will decide with which sex he/she feels more than the eye – and that's something formable.
This allows the child to take the decision for himself.
Letter confidence in the long-term evitableness of his Government
The President of the Italian Council Enrico Letta considers that his government will hold up until 2015, despite the strong tensions between the left and the right within the coalition to the power of the Senate's vote to defeat Silvio Berlusconi from his mandate.
In a daily interview in La Stampa, the left center leader said "openly the intention" is to continue to dominate with its coalition until the next legislative elections of 2015.
The High Chamber of the Italian Parliament will be gathered in the course of the month to decide on the type of the former President of the Council condemned for fiscal fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to retire its support to the government if the Senate, where it is more opposers than partys, proclaims its destitution.
But a part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretariat of Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continued to support the government, as demonstrated on October 2th, his refusal to ceder to Berlusconi's injonctions that wanted to shoot the office.
L.A. Times reports that an agent of the United States Transport Security Agency, TSA, and a suspect was damaged during the shooting exchange.
Pompiers called on the drame's places claimed have responded to a call that made the status of " multiple blessed."
"The order forces are on place", explains the airport on his Twitter account, while TV images show people evacuated in ambulances.
"There's been a fusil," the AFP stated a talking port of the American Transport Security Agency (TSA).
ABC's local antenna showed an embarrassed person on a brochure, and a second transported on a steel.
The incident also took place at 9 a.m.30 local (12.30 in Montreal) at the airport terminal 3, and has also specified the airport.
Los Angeles Times explains that the 2 and 3 levels are in evacuation.
The TSA's speaking port was not able to confirm immediately if one of its employees was damaged.
All flights at the arrival and at the end of the airport have been suspended.
Israeli army kills a member of Hamas in Gaza-ses
An Islamic Palestinian militant in Hamas, Israeli chars slaughtered in the south of Gaza, who had been learned after the sources of health services.
A source of the Hamas explained that battles have been made in this region because Israeli chars have cut off the border and have been seen by your thirsts of Palestinian murderers.
The Israeli army was satisfied to speak a "a targeted action" in the nearby zone of a qualificated tunnel of "terrorist" by the Hebrew State, whose "terror" was crossed to the border and the discovery was announced in October.
Report: The Obama campaign considered the Biden slaughter for Hillary Clinton
The nearest advisers of President Barack Obama considered to replace the Vice-President Joe Biden by Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most marking event in the very waiting book of the 2012 2012 campaign Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, “Double Down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times obtained a copy of the book to appear and told the Thursday evening that the close partners of the President had conducted “deep work in groups and surveys at the end of 2011” to see whether Biden's eviation could help Obama for his choice while his hopes were adjusted.
According to the corresponding policy Times Jonathan Martin, the book offers a detailed analysis of the work of the senior responsibilities of the campaign and the Black House, namely the former Secretary-General of the House-Blanche Bill Daley, to measure what effect the replacement of the vice-President of the former Clinton State secretariat could have on the scrutin.
The possibility of exchange is a secret that has been carefully maintained within the Chicago campaign QG and within the Oval Office.
Only a half twenty-five of the President's councils – including Daley, the former leader of Obama Jim Messina and the former advisors at the House-Blanche David Axelrod and David Plouffe – had known that the change was at the study.
"Double Down" indicates that Daley was loaded to replace Biden, despite their 'extraordinate personal links', before finally decided against the change when the figures showed that he had Clinton on the presidential list "is not clearly improved the chances of Obama's success."
In a meeting with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had effectively planned to replace Biden by Clinton.
“I said I had reviewed a series of questions, and it was one of them,” said Daley in the newspaper.
Remember that at that time, the President was not in form, and therefore it was said, "Lord, what can we do?"
While Daley qualified the review of "conciliation", Martin stated to Anderson Cooper of CNN that the re-election campaign had much invested to discover whether the change would benefit from the election.
“The campaigns do not consum a lot of money for the reviews and discussion groups unless they consider seriously take steps” said Martin on AC360.
However, we don't know if Obama was known that his team reviewed the replacement.
Martin said about the CNN he asked Daley if his boss' boss was aware of the eventual remanance.
While Daley said he did not think that the President was "he was known" of the evental change, the former Secretary-General admitted that it was "is possible" that Obama knew.
Martin added that “Double Down” did not respond definitively to the question of knowing whether political reviews were held at the Obama Bureau.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama did not know that the evasion of the presidential list was considered.
"That maybe," said Martin.
Have you sent a flow glass?
A British entrepreneur created the first fluorescent glass to the world on the basis of medicine.
Charlie Francis took part of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminous collation.
He had the idea after reading a study on the medicines and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate brilliant protein.
The glass cream reacts with the language by increasing the protein pH to make it light.
Chris explains that since the glass cream starts to hear when she reacts to the heat of the mouth, it is lighter, more she becomes brilliant.
Charlie, the founder of the "Lick Me I'm Delicius", said: "It's something unbelievable but we are only at the beginning of production, and 2 g of this thing costs about 200 £."
The protein we use in the glass reacts with the pH neutral language.
So when your mouth heats the protein, the pH level increases and the ice turns to light.
We tested it over the last months and it seemed to have a chance to share it with all at the time of Halloween because it gives an excellent effect.
It's probably the most beautiful glass I created because the light of the medications is four times more pretty than gold.
So every bull costs me about 140 kg.
But she's so excited!
The company at the experimental start of Charlie, based on Bristol, is known for its inhabited glass parfums such as bird, hair, bottle and gold sheet.
But his next creation is even more ambitious.
He added: “I really want to develop an invisible glass.”
It is intrinsically impossible because of the reflexion caused by the glass cristals that represent the glass cream, but I think I will find a way to arrive there.
The glass uses the fluorescent properties of the meduse synthetised by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a meeting of Tai Chi
The songer Lou Reed died when he performed a period of Taichi, revealed the wife of Laurie Anderson in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" and intended for the people of the city of Springs, where the couple had a house.
The artist is deceived last Sunday at 71 years of age.
"He died in the morning, when he looked at the trees and performed the 21th famous Taichi move, with his hands of musicians who finished the air," wrote Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was master or chi, a Chinese martial art.
The wife of the songer also explains that she had promised her husband, the week before her death, to make it out of the hospital and to bring it to their home of Springs (Long Island).
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in the past few years.
And even if we're citizens, it's our spiritual house.
"I was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs on pain and beauty of the world will deliver to many people the wonderful joy of living he had," she added.
Lou Reed had come up in May last year, a phenomenon of fire.
Halloween 2013 : Numbers
When I was a little, Halloween was magic.
My sister and I were allowed to eat bons, go to sleep later and degued to go to the neighbor.
Today, I've become more pink.
In the last two years, I have not distributed a single bonbon and I will certainly not do this year.
But statistics show that I am the gallery sheep when we talk about Halloween.
The majority of the Americans – 158 million in fact – will be famous by Halloween this year, with a total of $6.9 million in bonus, deguise and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I'm waiting with impatience at each Halloween party, that's the trends.
Derogations should be $1.2 million in the $6.9 billion, according to the NRF.
This year, inanimated sex objects are angry.
Women no longer need sexy professionals; they can also be sexual foods such as pizzas, hamburgers and carots.
For men, I'm waiting to see many zombies, thanks to the Walking Dead series, and I know that men of Daft Punk's space will be among our Instagram photos this year.
Google says that the most searching deguizes are the zombies, Batman, the pirates and the whispers.
I think there's no worse to stay traditional.
We've cut our dogs last year and, my great surprise, they were not the only ones.
In fact, the Americans will cost $330 million for animals this year, according to the NRF.
It makes many curious dogs in hotdogs.
When it's bons, we're not glad.
Americans will cost $1.9 million in bonus this year, according to the Nielsen Office.
This represents about 272 million kg of Hershey bars, sucettes, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
It's a super new for the 41 million children who go to the shock of bonbons in their neighborhood, according to the American Trade Division.
In fact, we're going to buy and, we're not talking about stories, consuming 41 million kg of chocolate during Halloween.
Mays bonbons are the only thing that we don't want to eat; but almost 16 million kg are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
This represents about 9 billion measuring grains.
It's a mystery that I've not yet come to elect.
There's nothing more representing by Halloween than the houses stolen.
They have the best names, such as "Terrorッind the Walls" (which is actually a true prison), " Howl-O-Screen" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1 200 houses officially recognized in the United States, which generated about $500 million income, according to America Haunts, and this includes these forming photos of you in shooting you up that your friends put on Facebook and you can't get away and on which a type you're good to leave a comment of the style "sweet head".
Finally, we're talking of cyclings.
Charlie Brown presented us The Grosse Citrouille when we were kids, and sculpt a cycling in the lantern, it's how to decorate a Christmas tree – that's something we're doing since we're all small.
Happy for us, the "trend of the baby" has started only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us have sculpted these pots and have not had to sit down in there.
This year, the Americans will cost about $106 million in cytole, according to the United States Census Office.
The Latin citrus who calmly fled on the pork of your house probably came from the Illinois, where 542 million citrole were cultivated this year.
If you are trying to make you more notice, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to sculpte their circle of 922 kg.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will create an internal deficiency structure ("bad bank") grouping 38 billion books (45 billion euros) of the most risked assets, which will be intended to defeat its relationships with London and to accelerate its reprivacy.
The bank wants to reduce from 55% to 70% the percentage of suspicious assets in its budget in the coming two years and hopes that it has been totally cleaned in the three years.
RBS also stated that it would include a provision for the depreciation of additional doubtful credits of 4 to 4,5 billion books on the quarter, a writer related to the constitution of the cantonization structure.
RBS also stated that this internal restructuring would be free from 10 to 11 billion capital books, thus strengthening its ability to provide.
The bank and London stressed that the "bad bank" would allow a trading on the past, and the government was particularly accused of entering RBS.
"We can now go from before, we care about the future and 90% of the assets that are really good banks and build a large bank for the customer and the UK," said the new Director-General Ross McEwan to the press.
Land Rover announces his talk of a series of rallys
The internal seats and harnaes have 6 points, as well as a Intercom system.
A service provides access to Bowler Works machines, logistical support and the maintenance of the vehicle between two events.
Drew Bowler's director-General Bowler Motorsport said: “The rally lovers who join Bowler have changed.”
They are not all experiencing, some search for exciting and adventure and real access to international events.
We are really happy to offer such a partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we are convinced that this will be a new way to try to various forms of rallys in the United Kingdom and international and to prepare for the raids and realities.
We have had a lot of joy to develop the Defender Challenge vehicle – the championnat will really be palpitant. »
Furthermore, the Defender Challenge will propose a day of training and tests in February and the possibility of participating in events in North Africa and the Middle East.
Exploitants were called to safeguard a lost chiot after resting in 15 meters above the ground on an instable cornish in a carriage
Ruby, a Spanish cocker, missed after a accident of the uncertain road
She was repeated three days later by a person who walked in his dog in the carriage
The pompiers have fallen in remembering along the false to recover the dog and save her from a certain dead.
A chiot had the opportunity to escape the worst after the pomps were called to restore it in any safety while it was because of the instable floor of a false area at 15 meters above the ground.
Ruby, a 9-month epanic cocker, missed after a accident of the night afternoon and survived for three days only before being saved in a merry carriage.
His owners, Scott Alderson, 25 years old, and her little friend Becky Hall, 20 years old, came to the Flappit Carry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thank West Yorkshire's fire and rescue service.
They were desperately looking for their lost dog and launched a call on the social network sites after she was gone in the carrière after a accident without seriousness.
By 14.15 Wednesday, a person at agested view that walked his dog replied Ruby on a cornish in the carriage, rolled up 15 meters above the ground.
A Cleckheaton's powder switch team was shocked on the grounds and went down in memory to save Ruby by using a animal civile for transporting it up to the floor.
The technical assistance specialist Andy Clayton said, “It was in a precautional situation.”
It was in full medium of the floor, 15 m from the top and 15 m from the ground.
She did not absolutely move during the savings – she was gentle.
But she's okay now.
She eating bikes after.
It was a very inhabited call.
It's amazing that someone noticed the dog.
The technical assistance specialist Peter Lau said, "Ruby has had a lot of chances to get out of compensation."
She could have been seriously blessed or worse.
Ruby was conducted at the veterinary for a control; its general status was satisfied, made part of the smiling and dishydration.
Mrs. Hall, d'Halifax in West Yorkshire, said, "I was terrified by observing the help."
I didn't think she was there first.
It was surprising to have it again in the arms.
The veterinary said that if she had been too shocked and that she was shocked, she would probably fall.
The bombs were escaped.
What they did was very courageous.
They are so grateful, each of them has been absolutely formable.
Mr. Alderson, from Keighley, added: “We were afraid that she was gone but she did not move. ”
The bombs were super.
I can't believe she was there.
Mick Jagger said he never draged Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview during an Australian radio emission this week, pop star said that she was chorist about Jagger's song "The Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said he dinnered with the rock veteran and explained, “He draged me when I was 18. ”
She added, "It's been long ago, and he's been very good."
In a Tuesday, a representative of Jagger, 70-year-old, stated that he “not have made progress in Katy Perry. ”
The representative added: "That may be she confounded with someone else."
Perry was one of the songs to make an appearance during the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, Prism, was the first place of the charts this week.
Pekin puts in question an Islamic movement of Turkey
"It was the Islamic Movement of Eastern Turkey based in Central and West Asia," said the Chinese security bodies patrons at a Hong Kong television chain, according to a video set on Thursday night on a internet site.
My Jyanzhu, who is a member of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC), expressed in Tachkent at a official visit in Uzbekistan.
It's the first time that a Chinese responsible designates a special organization after Monday's arrival.
According to the Chinese police, three Uïghors of the same family of the Xinjiang region, the border of several Central Asian countries, have prevented their car of shocks against the entry of the city prohibited in Peking, in a suicide attack that had been two dead and 40 blessed.
The driver of the car, his wife and his mother died in the fire of the car.
The Ethim, who claims to fight for the independence of Eastern Turkey, the former name of the Chinese Xinjiang, was classified by the United Nations in 2002 among the organizations affiliated in Al-Qaida.
This movement is often designated by Chinese authorities as responsible for sporadic problems in Xinjiang, but its real influence is in doubt by several experts.
George Kerevan: Europe's exhibition gives the choice to the ECSCs
Another day, another worried history of independence.
This time we are expected that an independent Scotia would be able to join the European free movement area to enable the EU to adhere.
And here we hear passeport control historys in Berwick and a border of buried sons along the wall of Hadrien.
If it is true that Strathclyde's newspaper indicated the economic events of a larger freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, it was not in the largest titles (and it was to prevail).
No one has said that the EU Member States have a large part of their time to comply with their formal rules when they are arranged.
Since Scotia is not part of the Schengen space at the time, a continuing non-compliance of the rules would be a minor consent that Brussels could, in contrast, offer everything she wants to obtain Scocias.
It is therefore a story that is not one.
And a so old story that she is now fixed: I heard for the first time the bobard said "Independence means the control of passports" over 40 years ago.
However, a interesting point was forgotten in this interpretation of an old powder account.
Why should an independent Scotia follow Europe's instructions, actually?
Why do you exchange London's game against that of Brussels, in particular now?
This is the actuality of Europe: the great sub-guere plan to unify Europe is definitely dead.
With the euro crisis, the European project is officially dead.
Through Europe, parties opposed to the EU or fighting for the abandonment of the euro as a common duty, win from the field.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative Party for Germany, founded only this year and came from no part, gathered almost five million votes during the federal elections of September and issued the Democratic Liberal Party (equivalent to our Democratic Liberals) from the Federal Tag.
There has always been a national opposition to the project to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis marked a tournant.
The authenticity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, associated with the weak carcase on national economies through the accession to the single currency, has led to many people to think that the European Project has gone too far.
The euro crisis did not have a great degree to meet national governments with excessive budget deficiencies – that was only true for Greece.
The European system was worse on its members of the change rates favourable to German exporters – what the German political men want to keep.
Without the possibility of a national assessment, the Southern Europe countries have a problem of intrinsic productivity in respect of Germany.
The only means is to make dark cuts in the wages and public expenditure – encouraged by Berlin.
In addition to the current budget and monetary problems, there is a deepest productivity in Europe.
Following the "great" energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason to subsidie French and German energy companies to consumer costs – the European industry pays two times more for electricity and four times more for the gas than the United States.
This is an inconvenience in terms of costs, as we have seen in Grangeouth.
All wages in the world will not prevent the European petroleum industry to be punished by a good American disaster gas.
Consequently, the fundamental revolution, in particular in France, is one of the major EU men.
After the war, the French political election considered the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on a foot of equality with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport of his political legitimacy and imposed its own economic policy in Europe, letting the French economy go wrong.
Results: The extreme right party of Marine Le Pen, the Anti-European National Force, has come to a crucial partial election, returning socialists to the third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the suffrages – an appropriate warning for the British Working Party, which reminds him that it can't take place from the principle that a disclosure of the right will automatically promote the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with his new popularity at the French white work class?
It wants to serve European elections in the next year to create a single and anti-European anti-month block within the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties are good towards these elections, which is very possible, such a block could control the European Parliament for the first time.
This is what I think: very shortly, the feeling of anti-European and antimonnae in Europe will join and end by killing the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something more like the United Nations Europe (Souverans) freely privileged by the General of Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could keep the euro, but France and Southern Europe will find their own duty.
I hope that the United Kingdom will take its distances in relation to this project, and I hope it will make the U.S. fair eyes.
However, the growing interest of Washington for the Pacific allows to think that Great Britain will be left in Atlantic.
What about Scotia in all this?
We can decide to be a region of the small English (especially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes shipping Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotia could be accompanied by a more free European agreement as we observed our own duty.
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a non-Federal United Nations Europe.
Instead, we should emphasize Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP Government is – and it is to be noted – the anti-audience political movement that has been the best success in Europe, as it has reported a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the proposed dark cuts (and implemented) by the Chairman of the worker, Alistair Darling, and the conservator/liberal-democratic coalition that has followed.
It would now be ridicule for Scotia to vote for independence if it is to accept the authenticity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Previous Puberty: Close up
Studies show that young African and Spanish African girls tend to reach the age of puberty early than young white girls.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent
No evidence is that hormones or other chemical substances are responsible
Experts think that obesity epidemic may be a pre-puberty decleaner
tendency toward early puberty is not even pronounced in boys
The old journalist of CNN Pat Etheridge is a specialized journalist in family and health issues in the child.
Should a mother be worried if the shoes and powders of her daughter start to smile at 7 or 8 years?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics that held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, Pedo-and-crinologist, explained that these early physical changes are sufficiently common among young Americans and represent a new standard.
“I'm going too much to make sure parents – in general, this does not indicate a rapid evolution towards full puberty,” said Kaplowitz.
Evident development signs, such as dragoning, arm pools, and in the pubian area and body odors, appear early in the girls.
But there was only a slight advancement from the age of the first rules in the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age was 12 and half, while it was 12 years of twenty-five in 1970.
“After the skin began to develop, at least two or three years before the first rules appear,” said Kaplowitz, also the author of “Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem”.
The time is the most precise test to know how puberty will evolve.
There is a debate on what is the real appearance of puberty, but it is considered as “precoce” when the development of pettrine is accompanied by a summer growth before the age of 8 years.
In most cases, declining or stopping development is something that a pediator can follow closely.
Fast evolution can justify tests carried out by an endocrinolog to avoid serious problems such as tumors or skists.
There are treatments to delay the appearance of the first rules and to prevent other consequences: prematurated ageing of bones that can shut up growth and small size for adult age.
Medical and hormonal treatment recommendations are based on child age, development rate, growth rate and affective maturity.
The psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is careful with medications but recognizes that “the fact of controlling puberty can cause some behavioral problems and feeling for young girls to be different from others.”
The other big problem is understandable: parents do not just want their very young girls to have their rules.
“They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle hygien issues,” said Kaplowitz.
“It was a shock,” a woman whose daughter had his first rules for 10 years.
Even if there were signs and we had spoken of rules, it was not emotionally prepared.
She came back from the school angry and boleversed to be the first among his friends.
There are many theories brought to the knowledge of the public about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no coherent theory that the hormones contained in milk or other foods, the chemicals present in the environment or the media are responsible.
The kids, like girls, reach their puberty soon.
Kaplowitz claims the most credible hypothesis is the epidemia of obesity.
He participated in a study conducted on 6-9-year-old girls who linked the percentage of grass grass to puberty deployment.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influence factors.
In this country, young African and Spanish girls tend to reach the age of puberty early than young white girls.
There are various explanations.
At the global level, pre-puberty mechanisms seem to be influenced by all, economic conditions in climate, through genes.
Another problem: Despite the kids have swimming pools on the face and in the younger pubian area, tendency towards real puberty is not so pronounced as among girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP Conference stressed the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of powder and pubian pools is common, even in food and all-pets.
“We must be careful about the way we identifie the real appearance of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, an endocrinolog who works in the hospital for children in Goryeb in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask advice to their pediactors to know how to talk to their children.
“This may mean having a conversation soon than planned,” Kaplowitz explained.
If you stay calm, your child will react in general.
The girls whose puberty is soon need to be discovered that even when it happens early than planned, the process is part of life.
The Hommage of the Brothers Coen
"Inside Llewyn Davis" of the brothers Coen, the great price of the last Cannes Festival, is a nostalgic and sweet film on the Greenwich village of 1961 and the folk music that began just to smile, before Bob Dylan arrived.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose movie has come towards a retrospective in the French cinemathetics, had cast the Gold Palm in Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
Unless Dylan embauchers or triumph Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen cast their turn on the star amount of the American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33 years old, but also on the planetaire pop Justin Timberlake.
In this film, where music is a central personality and the directly interpreted songs, Oscar Isaac reveals a musician and pop player, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves the pop for the folk music with a county jubilation.
With regard to Carey Mulligan, she left the rich tours of Daisy Mulligan in "Gatsby the magnificent" for less sweet clothes, a sweet voice when she crys, but she jumped the sweetness to the mine when she talks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" a week tells the tribulations of a people's songer that can't be able to perceive and struggle with the whole earth.
He accepts the replacements on the foot in the studies.
Without housing, he makes the tour of his friends who still want to receive him.
A documentary air
"Their relationship with success is tortured, which was interested in us: a mix of maliciousness, a man who is not there at the right time, which is not carrierist but integrated, with self-destructive behavior," said Ethan Coen press, coronated with his brother Joel of several Oscars and prices in Cannes.
If Llewyn Davis didn't exist, the two cinema fans of folk music built their story about true personalities of the time as Dave Van Ronk, folk musician.
The idea was to show the moment before Greenwich village's event, this New York district called to become the "the epic of the outer of the folk music that would generate international stars" such as the journalist Elijah Wald, a friend of Van Ronk.
The film then takes documentary allusions, invadered positive music labels of 33T invents, used by an unfavourable old secretary, musical choices of the age studys and coffees where the channels were produced.
The magic of the Brothers Coen still works in integrating a person's sweet that spends on the film on a constant basis: a beautiful shooting chat at the eye, a companion of Llewyn Davis.
Questioned about the way he composed of his personality, the actor and songer Justin Timberlake had remembered "grand in the Tennessee, swimming by the blue and the country".
"My first lessons of music were given me by my grandfather who learned to play the guide," he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if the work is necessary to "be considered good", "the haard can also run the career of someone," and "of more today".
As Llewyn Davis, who rejects any compromise on his music, the pop star explains that in a carrière, "the most important thing is not to let us do anything that can prevent us express us."
Gerard of Villiers, the author of "SAS" is dead.
He will never know the word retreat.
The French edition phenomenon, Gerard de Villiers, on Thursday 83 years of age, was just publishing his 200th SAS, "The Kremlin Vengeance".
In February, New York Times was dedicated to him as "the author of spanning romans that knew it too much."
He was then over ten days in Afghan, the theatre of 198 and 199 opposed by the famous series of spy romans.
Physically decreased by a very serious cardiac accident in December 2010, it was moved during the trip with a deambulant.
And before Afghan, he was also divided into Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published annually, Gerard de Villiers, born on 8 December 1929 in Paris, would be ignored the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first series, about a half a century ago.
"Dear doubt between 120 and 150 million countries confusioned," he progressed in March last.
His Birman chat on the genous, in the hall of his great apartment of an avenue Foch on two steps from the Triomphe Arc, he mentioned a few of the languages in which the SAS adventures were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japan or Korean.
"On to account of the pyrate editions," he added, named a book skin on the low table between bronzes or eviers reported from the 130 armed countries to place its Romans.
For the price of a cigarette package, the reader has the right to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman to the advantageous swimming pool, taking a gun or a shooting gun.
In the meantime, his seenistic altar (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, Austrian aristocratic argented and contractual agent of the CIA to pay the repairs of the family castle, launchs the crowds of all the wicked people of the earth, communists of the 70s and 80s, then Jihadids from the 1990s.
A large dose of geopolitical and ecosystem, a few hard sex scenes, a seventh of violence and torture.
"I never intended to be a literary author," explained Gérard of Villiers.
I consider me as a account that wrote to divide people to whom I don't send a message.
He was working "as the big war reporters, like the Albert London type, who were going on and returned with real and long investigations."
The father of the SAS said "making a kind of geopolitical feuilleton."
"I'm still my dossiers (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before leaving," added Gerard of Villiers.
On the ground, I meet journalists, including ACP, diplomas, people of the services I have known for some for twenty-third years.
Of course, the number of his SAS are often premonitors: so one month before the attack of a Syrian order center that killed several high-responsibilities, he had told the story in "The Wade of Damas".
In the "The Fous of Benghazi" he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command center in this city, in the face of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he put the murderer of the Egyptian President Anouar El-Sadate in "The Complex of Caire", a year before it was expected.
In October 2012, in "Panic in Bamako" he reported the 4X4 jihadistes columns based on the Malean capital.
I am not divine, I defended Gerard of Villiers, just doing hypothesis from countries I know well and, in time, some of my hypotheses are achieved.
After these travellers in frequent areas, he was installed for a month behind his machine to write IBM to marguerite by 1976 "in all parts have been changing".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page on the style.
At the walls of his office, AK-47 shooting shooters, erotic photos and photos of the author with African warrants.
Regularly embraced for machism by women and racism by human rights organizations, the Gerard of Villiers disappeared these charges in two words.
Some women are sexual objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I am always very welcome in Africa where I account for many readers.
Gerard of Villiers said, "Malko Linge, as all heroes, has no age."
He won't die and he won't go back.
Not more than me.
The aircraft are shocking about the width of the seats while larger commands are on game
The conflict is rare between the large aircraft buildings about the width of the tourist seats on long-coor flights, opening the way to an awesome confrontation at the Dubai aircraft salon that takes place for months.
The conflict is on the wide range of seats proposed on long-commercing flights to the passengers of the economic class – which are not always the most shortest of airlines, but those whose space is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest equipment presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called the aircraft industry to establish a standard of a seat size of at least 18 pounds (45.72 cm) in the economic classes, but its great American Rival Boeing states that this should be the airlines to decide.
The difference cleared that aircrafts are trying to sell more bi-commerce aircraft versions from their bi-commerce aircraft, eventually expecting a record of commands during the event that was launched from 17 to 21 November.
The way the seats will be available back from the aircraft – in particular there will be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic performance of the mini-jumbo segment.
Boeing states that its revised "777X" can be welcomed in economic classe 406 people in over 17 large seats, and will be configured with 10 seats per round.
Airbus indicates that the competitive version of its A350 will transport 350 people in rounds of 18 pounds of large size set up in 9.
Aviation gentlemen are often exchanged on technical issues by making publicity in the professional press.
Today, Airbus calls the public directly before the Dubai Airport Hall, where 777X should take the step on its competitors with more than 100 commands.
Recently it was possible to take account of what could be the beginning of a new public war with the presentation of the financials of a photo showing three people against the others in the restaurant, entitled "Do you accept that?"
"Boeing proposes long-commerce flights in closer seats than in regional Turbopropulsors aircraft," said John Leahy, Commercial Director of Airbus.
As food habits change, people grow, but aircraft seats have not radically changed.
Between the beginning of the 1970s, when Boeing's 747 thickness defined the modern long-commerce journey, and the average American weight of 40 to 49 years increased by 10 percent, according to the data of the American Health Department.
The average American tour of the 21th century is 39.7 pounds, according to the American health statistics.
Airbus states that his rival is at a seat concept that was given in the 1950s, when the circle of the freshly baptized “Jet set” was closer.
Airbus adds that she has commanded a study that indicates that an additional cut at the level of the seat width would improve the quality of sleep of 53 per cent.
Boeing contests the numbers of Airbus regarding the width of seats and claims that it is not the constructors to decide how airlines balanced the ticket price and equipment.
He also said that the study shows that the experience in the chain is not only dependent on the width of the seats.
"It is really to bring suffix to airline companies and to allow them to do what they think to do to take care of their activities," said Kent Craver, supported by passenger satisfaction at Boeing.
They don't want to tell them what will allow them to be rewardable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is more to have a certain freedom of movement, but for providers, it is more a question that could affect their results.
Once the conflict is hidden by aircraft commands for at least 700 Md dollars to the market price in the coming decades, sufficiently to deal with the balance of American and European exports.
As Reuters has indicated for the first time in July, the seat configuration is exactly what foods the battle between all the last devices.
Airbus and Boeing return to both a seat performance in their last long-coorable bicycle models 20% above that of the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 77-300ER of 365 seats.
The performance announced by Boeing depends on the comparison between the 777X set with 10 ranked seats and a 7777 original model set on row 9.
The gain in terms of unit costs is low compared to the device set with 10 round seats currently in service.
"Boeping do this to make more seats and make its aircraft more competitive for our products", said Kevin Keniston, director of Confort Passager at the European Airbus aircraft.
On the other hand, analysts say that the chains set with 10 seats per row in the 777 existing are suggesting that many passengers are pronounced in favour of more deep configuration, which may go to pair with less cherish rates.
"A 18 pound seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, in the commercial view, the Airbus proposal is motivated by the threat of 77," said the expert in inner chains Mary Kirby, the founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but propose a catalogue of providers among which airline companies must choose.
The aircraft salers that make the world tour have even one metro with them to check the competitive settings.
While offering comfortable devices, all constructors also offer aircraft with strong density settings to low-cost airlines and for regional travels.
Airbus offers a A350-configed with 10 round seats, but indicates that it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for more personalization of the chains by offering larger seats to some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only large manufacturer of modern large devices, experts say that it is unlikely that his call to the aircraft is to establish a size standard for seats, but that it could forget the sale vacuum of 777X.
Ellison's shareholders are irrelevant by the salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted on the proposal for a reward for the founder and Director-General Larry Ellison, in view of the financial performance of its group.
The vote is not binding, but it's turning out the image of Larry Ellison, the third world's fashioned worldwide, quite aware of the victory of his ship at the Coupe of America.
Milliardary still has 25% of the capital of the software group co-funded 40 years ago.
Last year, Elison had been a negative vote on his reward.
The Oakle Patron rejected a $1,2 million for the 2013 year, closed as a result of the bad performance of the group, which lacked its growth goals, but estimated about 77 million dollars related to stock options.
His fixed wage is only a symbolic dollar.
Over the whole year 2013, the net benefit of Oracle has progressed in 3,5% while 27.5% of the Bourse rate, overall the S&P-500 index that took 24% at the same time.
The new anti-nicotine vaccine could remove the joy of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could remove the enjoyment of smoking.
A single dose of vaccine was able to protect nicotine dependance muscles at life.
Other tests are needed before starting the tests on human being, but Professor Ronald Cristal of the Weill Cornell Medical College stated that the first signs were encouraged.
“We really hope that this kind of vaccinal strategy will help millions of smokers who have tried to stop, raise all the current market methods, but discover that their addiction is sufficiently strong to overcome these different approaches” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains an inoffensive virus that has been modified to transport the genetic information required to design anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus is selectively infected by the heavy cells, which then begins to produce a regular anticorps flow.
Anticorps take all nicotine molecules present in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which prevents the smoke of having nicotine dose.
During the tests, the vaccinated mouse that later was given nicotine continued their activity normally.
But the mouses that were not vaccinated “ were calmed” said researchers, signed that nicotine had reached their brain.
Experiences are described in the magazine Science Translational Medicine.
Previous vaccines against smoke were inefficient because they contained antibodies.
Injektions should be repeated so frequent that anticorps levels remain high that they were too nervous and little practical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be well less because it transforms the feed cells into anti-corps plants.
Professor Cristal said that if the future human use vaccine was completely safe, children could be administered before they tried to smoke, which would prevent any addiction to nicotine.
But more likely it is used by smokers who want to stop smoking.
“They will know that if they start to smoke, they will not enjoy it because of the anti-nicotine vaccine, and that will help them to lose their bad habits” he added.
British scientists said that the results were interesting but reported that more detailed research was needed.
The chief of Pakistanian Taliban killed by a drone
The chief of the Pakistani movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a slaughter of an American drone in Pakistan, learned at security services.
Hakimullah Mehsud's death has been announced several times by the past.
But responsibilities of the information, the army and the active movement declared that he had lost life in this flag, which was conducted in the North-Wazistan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a droid shooting," said a high responsibility of security.
The old, Pakistanian Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, moved to London, informed the British Government that discussions had been held with the Tehric and Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the movement of Pakistani Taliban.
Tripodi never be influenced by Obeid
The former minister of Southern New Galles Joe Tripodi will be subject to an investigation of the State's anti-corruption regulator.
The former minister of Southern New Galles Joe Tripodi has refused to change the trade bag policy on the request of her political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had interests hidden in three goods situated in the government's controlled area.
On Thursday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) extended its investigation to know whether Mr. Obeid had made pressure on several ministers of the State to renew its baths in Circular Quay, where Obeid has two restaurants and a coffee, after their expiration in August 2005, without the call for offers.
She is now investigating the allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of the secret interest of Mr. Obeid in these properties, following the testimony of the former Adjunct Secretary-General of Mr. Tripodi, Lynne Ashpole, on Judith.
During the years of discussions held in 2005, the Government has pressured the baths to make an appeal for offers.
The localists were against and also wanted longer duration.
In 2009, the bags of Circular Quay, which reported to the Obeid $2.5 million per year, were renewed without any offers.
Mr. Tripodi, who was the Minister of Ports of February 2006 to November 2009, was a favourable start of offers.
But he refused to change his policy on Mr Obeid's request, who, recognized Mr. Tripodi, recalled a change in the government policy in the field of battle.
The transmission of telephone conversations submitted to the ICAC showed the last calls between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a high official who had arrived in the Department of Ports after working under the orders of Mr Obeid to the Fisheries Ministry.
“It was the issue discussed during these telephone conversations that was the development of trade bag policy,” asked the Advocate Anthony Whealy to Mr Tripodi.
“No” answered Mr. Tripodi.
I don't remember what we discussed, but in any case, it wasn't about it.
Of course not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli war flights aimed at Syria, said a responsible
Israeli war flights reached a target in the Syrian portal city of Latakia on Wednesday night, confirms a military responsible in Fox News.
The director did not specify what target was, but said that there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian manufacturing mixtures SA-125.
At least two times this year, Israel conducted aircraft against missile loads in Syria.
Foreign workers in possession of a visa 497 may have to have a test of authenticity
The Government is currently studying the possibility of establishing an "audience" test for foreign workers in possession of a visa 497, while considering extending repression measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied in accordance with a criteria for preventing the visa 497 to be used to carry out non-called posts or as a means to make his family and friends in Australia.
A government's work document was now declared when the deputy, Maxine McKew, denied the government talk on foreign workers, said that it could violate the neighbors of Australia.
"The unfair statements on the "foreigners returning to the end of the file" and "employments for the Australian first" are an unpleasant return at the time when trade unions requested a protected job market," she said today to Australia India Institute.
Historicly, this means that the work of the Whites should be protected – and I would not be surprised that some countries in the region looked like a shock to this historical art.
The work document took place on 12 measures previously considered by the former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet senior persons to discuss human trafficking, implemented five of the recommended changes, and others were in review.
If the “authenticity” criteria was adopted, a visa applicant could be checked to know "if the job offer is authentic if the candidate is a relationship or a personal association of the owner or the person concerned within the company that sponsoris it."
The companies could also be obliged to declare the number of visa detentors after some of them, with the intention of sponsoring a small number of workers, actually employed hundreds.
In the meantime, a 35-year-old sri-lankais asylum applicationer would die with a heart crisis after being arrived on a ship transporting asylum demanders to Christmas Island this week.
The inflicted son of man, who was nine years old, came to Australia with him and found some comfort from the death of his mercy father at a adult cousin who was also on the border.
The man was transferred urgently by the Australian authorities to the Hospital of Christmas Island, where he was deceived.
A study to multiplie the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotia was launched by the British Government.
The work done by HS2 Ltd lets think that high speed services will start from the opening of Phase 1 in 2026.
The Minister of Transport Barone Kramer said that the project “the United Kingdom would gather.”
The Scotia Minister of Transport, Keith Brown, said "excellent" to work with the British Government on the project.
Phase 1 will take a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government renewed the estimated costs of the construction of a high speed link between London and the north of England, which was from 32.7 Md £ to 42.6 Md £.
The British Government, who is in the parliament with the Scotland Transport, requested HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of the rail capacity and improved the duration of trails for the north of England and Scotia.
This should include the possibility of travel periods between Glasgow and Edinburgh for three hours at least.
The Baron Kramer stated: "Our goal for HS2 is on a really national network that will draw close to the United Kingdom and its cities."
We have the HS2 project because the great advantages it presents are.
Without him, we are faced with a ability problem of our rail network.
But it is also to develop the connection between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, in order to be better connected with HS2.
The British Secretariat for Scotia, Alistair Carmichael, added: "The advertising today is a good news for Scotia."
For the Scotland government, Keith Brown called Mr. Carmichael to support the inclusion of the Scotia in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "The large speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic advantages to Scotia, but also provides the economic weight of Scotia in the global broad-speed rail network project throughout the Great Britain.
"We are therefore encouraged to work in partnership with the British Government in order to consider the options to bring the high-speed train network to Scotia, creating a benefit for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edimburg line that the Scocian government is already planning.
"I'm uncomfortable to read the review report with the British Ministers in the next year, and we will then decide on the next steps."
The rules on the use of electronic board devices remain in force at the time in Australia
Australian air passengers will continue to extend their tablets and smartphones during the decoration and aeroplane, despite the management of the United States to implement electronic devices regulations.
The American Federal Aviation Law left the door open to the United States transporters to change their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, look at videos or play games on their devices during the critical flight phases, provided that they are in a mode.
The passengers can already do so during the largest part of the flight, but many people find it punishable to access their electronic books during the decoration and aeroplane.
Australian transporters consider the decision which obliges American carriers to carry out an important work to comply with the requirements, but reported that they did not intend to change their procedures.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also stated that it reviewed the advertising but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices during the critical flight phases were still in force in Australia.
“CSA does not have specific regulations on the use of electronic aircraft” stated.
The issue is subject to a regulation which obliges aircraft operators to ensure the continuous security maintaining and passengers to comply with the security consignments provided by equipment members.
Virgin, who had already spoken to the CASA of his intention to extend its use of wifi technologie, was open to a change, but said that it would follow the regulator.
"We would welcome a review of the CASA that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really think that this would improve the customer experience now that we have (the board diverting system using Wi-Fi technology) on our aircraft," said a talk.
Qantas stated that she had respect for the current rules.
“In accordance with our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during the decoration and shooting, and we do not intend to change this,” she stated.
The FAA decision shall apply to American airlines.
However, we are always interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will closely examine the FAA decision and the reasons for it.
For American transporters, the impact of the decision will vary from an airline company to the other and depend on the age of their fleet.
Transporters should demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interferences from electronic devices, as well as revision of manuals, training materials, hand bag transport programmes and passengers' designs.
"When an airline checked the tolerance of its fleet, it may allow passengers to use light electronic devices such as tablets, electronic book readers and smartphones at all heights," stated the FAA.
In rare cases of low visibility, the equipment will request passengers to escape their devices during the shooting.
The group also recommended that the higher devices are loaded in any safety under the seats or higher divisions during the decoration and aeroplane.
Pia: at least four blessed in a violent bagar
The small town of Pia known an inhabited inhabited inhabited on Thursday night.
Three gendarmery vehicles, two ambulances and a attractive of 30 people according to collected witnesses...
On this day of Halloween, the evening was shocked on the side of Pia, where a strike involved several people from the Poste.
Four leaked blessed ones would at least be regretted.
Warned, gendarmes came to place to separate the banders and to ensure that the blessed are supported.
Singapore's guest priests benefited from the medium classs involving the ceinture
In the winner of Bendemeer's commercial center in Singapour, Janani Amirthalinga offers a bracelet, a bag and a pair of gold ears to pay the school costs of his girls.
"My husband and I have come to buy a house so all my money went from there," says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
While she won $3,000 from Singapore (2,400) per month as a administrator and its husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, the request is such in some parts of South Asia – where the decline of households – that ValueMax, where it has been performed, became the third company of cash loans to be introduced in Singapore's boundaries this week.
In the case of Ms. Amirthalinga, it's almost good market than non-garant banking loans.
In general, Singapore grants provide an effective annual interest rate of 17 per cent, just over 15.4 per cent offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local fund sharer with a succursale succursale in the same commercial center.
However, loans have the advantage of not requesting a solvability or a wage proof, and the loans can be deleted more quickly than banks.
Thus, millions of people around the region are turning to payment priests while families feel the pressure that increases the life costs and the overcome of households and consumers.
After five years of solid growth since the global financial crisis, and the good market credit provided by a too laxist monetary policy in advanced economys, families of low and medium-sized income are turning to the payment priests to comply with the difference while their economies know a decline.
This week, the Standard & Poor's Rating Agency pointed to the growing household incentive, mainly decreasing hypothetical loans, as a risk factor for Asian bank solventivity.
She stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore registered the final ratio of green domestic/products in Asia.
Malaisia has a list head of 80 per cent of the GDP, while the rate was 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists also fear the high level of consumption of consumers in Thailand, which has just been out of a technical recession this week.
Thursday, data have shown a continuous decline in exports and a decrease of consumer demand.
"The balance is that, with the increase in costs, people at the average or down [of the wages], they are trying to complement their income as they can," says Song Seng Wun, economicist at CIMB, a malaria bank.
The historically high gold prices in the past two years have been understood by people to make their personal effects to touch the value of their skins.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of the items employed in the 200 shops of shipment in the state are in gold.
People say, "The gold price is high, put the gold chain in the next month and will return to the next month."
In Thailand, the largest shopping operator, EasyMoney, has registered an increase of 20% of the number of customers using its shops in the last months.
The growth is such in the loan loan sector as ValueMax, a business operator in Bendemeer and 15 other trades such as Singapore, is intended to develop not only in neighbour Malasia – where it already accounts four boutiques – but also outside Asia, says Yes Lee Ching, its general leadership.
The company will finance them by using 60% of the 66% of Singapore's $66 million that she took this week during its introduction in the Singapore bourne.
While some of the reduced rate prizes were criticized for the exorbiting interest rates they practice, Mrs. Yes indicates that the income allocation offers not only less higher rates than other prizes, but also that it is not directly increased in debt.
"Clients hypothecate the goods they have already, and the fact that the currency of their personal goods does not increase household decline," she says.
Income is better accepted socially as a means of obtaining a short-term financing.
Those who are employed in cash priests are not only those who have financial problems.
The older people in Singapore are also in the guest loans of ValueMax to put gold rings or Rolex clocks, which may represent up to 60% of their price of purchase in species.
We're seeing customers of all the beds of the company.
"It may be associated persons who need short-term employees for commercial activities or investments, or small companies that need teasure to pass hard caps", adds Ms. Yes.
Sometimes they just need money very fast.
An accused juvenile pornography pastor in New Scotia
A young pastor who was occupated in the Halifax region in New Scotia is accused of youth pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, a 30-year-old age, was arrested on Thursday morning after searching for his home and the office of the National Research Council where he works.
The Baptist Church of Timberlay, where the pastor was official, expressed his deep appreciation by this new.
In a communication, the church officers indicate that Mr. Hudgins has dismissed his post.
The passenger was released under conditions.
In particular, it should not be communicated with people under 18 years of age and not access to Internet.
It will compare in Provincial Court in Halifax in December.
It becomes a Nazi uniform at the supermarket, before being cast
A man who was closed by a nazi uniform barried by a bluff with the gammated cross was prayed to leave an English supermarket, customers who claimed to the officer who called the police, announced the winner on Thursday.
"We received several customer complaints, so we asked him to leave the store," explained a talking door from the Asda supermarket chain.
The shop called the police to rescue, but "the time she arrived, he was already gone without saying", she added.
I was doing the cheese when I saw a woman who looked like a shocked.
People were sweet mouth.
"You don't get out in the street except you want to take attention," a customer, Rosina Rusin, 60 years old, showed in Cambridge News.
This incident occurred on Thursday, the day of the Halloween Festival, where it was pleasant to be shocked in a monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a canular.
A man of Cambridge returned the responsibility of this act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
"I take a black SS twice a week in Asda," said Paul Dutton, explaining the suffering of "the mental problems".
Safety Plan of $325 for the Tasmanian Health System
The Federal Government maintains that the $325 million Safety Plan for Vacuum Health is associated with strict conditions to ensure that the Government of the State does not use the funds.
The Federal Minister of Health of Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth currently takes “urgent” measures to end a crisis caused by the ageing of the island state, the high rate of chronic diseases and the contradictions of the system.
The financing, for four years, was decided after government consultations with the independent deputy of Tasmania, Andrew Wilkie.
“The Government has proposed an emergency saving plan that will, as we believe, resolve the unique difficulties to which the State is faced,” said Ms. Plibersek today.
The $325 plan includes a $31 million campaign for non-urgency surgery operations.
2 600 additional operations, including in the field of orthopedic and cataractic surgery, will help to ratify the delay.
Funds are also planned for clinics without giving you in Hobart and Launceston, external care, medical framework training, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical files systems in local hospitals.
“These investments respond to the idea that, according to the first line clinics, it is the best way to cure the Tasmanian health system,” said Ms. Plibersek.
The Minister stated that the Government of Tasmania would be faced with a strict report preparation and accounting process.
The State must maintain the current funding levels in order to receive the Commonwealth money and prepare monthly reports on sectors where it costs additional funds.
A three-person composition will be made to ensure that the State provides services as effective and efficient as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that the $325 will not be counted for large-scale “less they are followed by a real reform that allows to consolidate the public health system of Tasmania”.
He, however, welcomed the Government for having responded to the request for urgent assistance submitted to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
"I hope that the federal aid plan will greatly contribute to the removal of the public health system of Tasmania of the black list," said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the Government of the State, these additional non-urgence procedures will largely involve recently.
But Peter Dutton thinks today's advertising is a "a solution of happiness".
"The reason why we are here is that the State working government has retired $430 million from its health system," he stated on ABC TV.
There is no State government that slaughters almost half billion dollars and the Commonwealth, which is $300, and claims that it is a fast day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar of the Safety Plan will be expendied in additional bureaucracy.

Syria destroyed its chemical weapons production capacity, states the supervisory body
Syria has destroyed the essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and munitions filled with toxic gas, declared the International Chemical Weapons Monitoring Organization, while violence in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are stored.
A group of Syrian warriors also stated that more than 1200,000 people had been killed since the beginning of civil war in the country almost three years ago.
The Advertising of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OIAC) took place with a progress day on the limit date
1 November by the organization based on the Haye order to destroy or make "unnecessary" all the chemical weapons production units and machines intended to mix toxic gas and to fill munitions.
The completion of what is mainly the initial destruction phase is an important stage of the ambitious calendar to destroy the chemical weapons of Damas from this mid-2014.
With the destruction of equipment, Syria will no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damas must still start the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is believed that the country has about 10,000 tons of chemical products and weapons, including moutard gas and sacred neurotoxic agent.
The announcement was made when the battles were rare in the city of Safira who, according to experts, opened a chimical weapons production unit as well as stocking sites, reported the Syrian Human Rights Observatory based in Great Britain.
The armed group, following the development of human bill through a network of warriors based in Syria, said Thursday that 120.296 were dead.
Among them, there were 61 067 civilians, including 6 365 children.
On the side of the Government, 29,954 members of the armed forces of President Bachar el-Assad found death, 18 678 whose struggles were 18,678 of the prosecutive forces and 187 of the Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Among the dead, also, 2 202 were desertors and some 5 375 of the opposition fighters, a good number of foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 1000,000 people were dead in the conflict since March 2011.
She has not updated this number since.
Some 2 million people had to escape the country because of the conflict.
The troops of El-Assad are fighting against the rebellies, whose many are linked to groups of Al-Qaida networks in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory stated that there were losses of both sides, but no specification was given.
The fights highlighted the importance of dangers faced by the inspectors responsible for chemical weapons while they have to complete their mission, which is to defeat Syria's toxic arsenal in the middle of a civil war that loss, within a slaughtered period.
An OIAC statement, which works closely with the United Nations, indicated that its team was “a satisfied with controlling – and destroyed – all the declared critical production and machinery for melange and fulfilment.”
She added that “no other inspection activities were planned for the time”.
Before the week, the inspectors said they had completed the first step of the verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damas.
They couldn't visit the last two sites because of their concerns on their security, the inspectors indicated.
Thursday, the OIAC said that the two sites were, according to Syria, "is abandoned and... the elements of the chemical weapons programme that they had had had been moved to other declared sites, which have been inspected."
It was difficult to know first if Safira's unit was one of the two sites that the OIAC inspectors couldn't visit.
Syria submitted a comprehensive plan to destroy its chemical weapons, which was approved in the month following the Executive Committee of the IAO.
"I welcome the moral force and courage you all have proved in the framework of the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization," said the Director-General of the Ahmet Uzumcu organization, in an comment published by the OIAC.
Now in its third year, civil war opposed the Solar Muslim rebels to the Government of El-Assad and its security forces, which are supported by the members of the Alabaite Section, a chiite Islamic branch.
On the other hand, the Director of the Syrian Human Rights Observatory stated that there had been a great merry explosion in an air defence base in the Syrian Coast Province of Latvia.
The cause of explosion remains unknown, it has added.
Anger caused by the punishment condemned against one of Bali's bomb powders
The survivors and neighbors of the 202 victims killed in Bali's attacks in 2002 reacted with angry against the last conspirators to be translated in justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shocked by a slaughter of execution.
Patek, who passed nearly 10 years of flee, was one of the most seekest men in South Asia, was sentenced last 20 years of prison for his role in the manufacturing of explosive engines used during the attacks.
It could be released to 15 years of age under conditional release.
The 45-year-old man was accused of mass killing for the attacks with two night boxes in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which caused 202 people, including 88 Australians, and made many blessed.
It has also been acknowledged by many other chiefs of accusation in relation to terrorism, including a wage of expectations for churches in the whole Indonesian ship of Christmas in 2000.
Prosecutors requested a punishment of perpetuality, so they would have been able to ask for the man, qualified by "Demolition Man" for his reputation of experts in the manufacturing of bombs, to be sentenced to death.
The decision renewed criminal memories for June Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost his two juveniles of 39 years ago, Jane and Jenny, in the destructions conspirated by Patek and other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
At the board of the laughs, she said that Patek had to be sentenced to death.
I really think he had to follow the same way as the other men.
“It should be traced before the execution ball” said Ms. Corteen to the AAP.
I have to live every day without having other kids, nor see my girls.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded in a garage guarded outside, was explosed just after 23.12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's Bar when a mikaze took a sack with two explosives at least 20 seconds ago.
He stood in the coma next morning of the arrival and remained unconscious for a month, and he is "dead" three times when he was under respiratory assistance.
Mr. Hugues said that Patek had to know the same as the three other members of the terrorist cell of Jemaah Islamiyah, responsible for carniture – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
In fact, this man had to be sentenced to death before others.
Keep him alive, why, there's no reason to keep him alive.
Over 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and blessed hundreds of others, it's not much.
Patek is the last of Bali bomb pools to be translated in justice.
He was able to avoid being captured for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistanian city of Abbottabad, where the United States will kill the former leader of Al-Qaida, Oussama Ben Laden, less than four months later.
During the process, an FBI agent said that reports of information services had shown that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Ben Laden in order to restore links between the terrorist groups of South-East Asia and Al-Qaida.
“He has not come back,” said Ms. Corteen.
Until recently, he was shocking the chagrin that he could cause to other people.
The verdict was held in the jungle of the 10th anniversary of attacks that will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonys in Bali and Australia.
“ There will be a lot of crying this year,” said Mrs Corteen.
Patek may, however, call on his condemnation.
FAA: Air passengers can now use aircraft gadgets (mas do not pass a call with their portable phone)
Aeroport companies passengers can use their electronic door devices to read, work, play games, look at movies and listening to music – but not talking about their portable phone – in accordance with the new very expected directives published by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be established will vary from an airline company on the other hand, stated the FAA Administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference.
Airlines will be proof to the FAA that their aircraft compliance with the new directives and that they have updated the equipment training manuals and the rules on the scope of equipment to be in accordance with them.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airline companies to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are part of companies that have already been subjected to plans.
“In the light of the plan, we could adopt an extensive use of electronic devices very closely” stated the FAA in a statement.
Currently, passengers must exit their smartphones, tablets and other devices as long as the doors of the aircraft are closed.
They are not intended to switch them before the aircraft reaches a height of 10 000 feet and the commander gives the green fire.
The passengers are supposed to exit their devices at the distance of the air prior to the aircraft and do not slow them until the aircraft is stored.
In accordance with the new directives, airlines whose airlines are correctly protected from electronic interferences will allow passengers to use their devices during the decorations, aircrafts and roofing on the ground, stated the FAA.
Most of the new line aircraft and other aircraft that have been amended so that passengers can use the Wi-Fi to higher heights should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, Chairman of the Association of Professional Flight awaitants, was happy of these changes.
“After the new security policy is implemented – and we will work closely with transporters for this – it will be useful to all", explained Glading in a statement.
We are clearly encouraging to feel like “sail supervisors” when this matter is.
But it will always be prohibited to connect to Internet to survey, exchange e-mails and SMS or download data below 10 000 feet, said the Agency.
Passerers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other aircraft devices.
So not always Words With friends, the online online game Scrabble play in which Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he was issued to a large brush of an American Airlines aircraft after he refused to end his device while the device was guarded at the door.
And the worst devices like the portable computers should always be cut because they could hurt someone if they fly through the chain.
The board phones will continue to be banned.
The regulatory power on portable phones belongs to the Federal Communications of the Commission and not to the FAA.
The FAA may interfere on certain electronic devices during the decoration and aeroplane
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transport Security Board, National Transport Expert on CBS News, said that the portable phones were always considered as a risk.
"Portable phones are really a problem, not only because they could eventually create interferences with navigation instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could destroy mobile telephone fronts if they are used on board," said Rosenker.
A industrial advisory committee established by the FAA to consider the problem recommended the last month that the Government authorizes a greater use of personal electronic devices.
The weak pressure on the FAA has been strengthened in the past few years to reduce their use restrictions.
Detractors such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., support that there is no valid security reason for these bans.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to apply, since the use of devices has become a representation.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of the passengers are forgotten to escape their devices, or make it delayed.
FAA began to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 following the interference reports with navigation and communication instruments when passengers transported FM radio, high-tech gadget.
New line aircrafts depend more on electrical systems than previous aircraft generations, but are also designed to resist electronic interferences and approved by the FAA.
Airlines allow their passengers to use the Wi-Fi in crossing heights for several years.
Adjusted aircrafts to welcome Wi-Fi systems are also better at interferences.
The wide majority of line aircrafts should enable electronic devices to be used under the new directives, said Huerta.
Electronic devices today are generally employed by radio transmissions of much lower power than the previous generations of devices.
Electronic book readers, for example, only leave minimum transmissions when a page is turned.
But transmissions are stronger when the teleching devices are money or send data.
Amazon.com is part of those who make pressure for the extent of restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, corporation leaders launched a line ship of children's e-book readers and flyed to see if there were problems, but there was no one there.
This inspired members of the FAA Advisory Committee of Emotions about the question of whether the use of devices is present or not a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he thought that the interferences from devices were real, even though the risk was minimum.
Other members of the Committee said that there are only anecdotic reports from pilots that indicate that the devices can interfere with the aircraft systems and that most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA authorizes pilots to request passengers to defeat their devices during instruments in low visibility conditions.
A group of the travel industry welcomed changes, calling them fullly sensitive arrangements for travellers equipped with technologies.
"We are happy that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with security," said Roger Dow, President and director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A helicopted bird in a North Sea platform was released in nature
A bird helitarized after being found on a pet platform in the North Sea, was left in nature.
A helicopter in the direction of Aberdeen was mounted up last month before it was transferred by the SPCA in Alloa's Safety Center.
The director of the Centre, Colin Seddon, said: “This water race was probably a winter migrator who came from Northern Europe and took place in the middle of violent winds in the northern sea.”
It seems to be successful to find refugees on the oil platform.
He added: "It was unable to go again, so we were contacted to provide our help."
The water rail was in good health when he was left.
Is the European election ready to do business with the Great Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise of joining companies and to define what the rich and job creators want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
In order to do this, we commanded the most wide and complete investigation of British business leaders and asked them what they thought about Great Britain, enterprises and the EU.
YouGov has interviewed more than 1.000 business leaders, overall representatives of all enterprises, sectors and regions of Great Britain.
The conclusions of the investigation will be a surprise for many.
We have found that the vast majority of enterprises are now trying to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that modernize and develop themselves while EU States are staged.
They want to see the Government to give a priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil instead of entering themselves in the long and archae of European institutional archanics.
When their opinions are requested on specific political points – from the regulation of monopolies to products laws – most of them believe that the control of these key skills should return to Westminster's hands.
The unique market has occurred in general miscontinent, and the companies say that the cost of the Brussels Regulation is disproportionate in comparison with the benefits of the European trade area – 40% of the major enterprises, traditionally the most pro-Europeans, are even agreed.
Finally, our investigation with business leaders showed that a major majority wanted to see Great Britain to continue initiatives to change the treaty and development of a relationship with the EU on trade and non-political basis.
This conclusion, which is found in all large groups and enterprises of all sizes, shows that the company's world insists on a “important change” that gives power to the United Kingdom.
The pledges are high – to change the treaty and better represent the interests of Great Britain would allow 16 per cent of the votes in favour of the maintenance of the country in the EU during a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt only one moment: this investigation shows that British enterprises support this plan to renewal the terms of the Great Britain's accession to the EU.
It also shows that enterprises hope that renegociation will be a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of return to the United Kingdom hands.
It is possible, and more necessary, to better represent the interests of the British enterprises, since the euro area is involved in the way of a more closer economic and fiscal unity.
The priority must be for employment and growth in Britain and, as the conclusions of our investigation shown, this means to the companies to reiterate the focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels regulatory approach.
The United States on Halloween Colour
In the United States, President Obama did not derogate to the tradition of Halloween.
With his wife, last night, he distributed friandies to hundreds of invited children in the gardens of the White House to Washington.
Last year, Halloween's festivities on the coast were cancelled because of the ouragan Sandy's transition.
This year, the feasts have therefore begun.
In New York, thousands of usual people participated in the parade organized in the district of Greenwich village.
Everyone's overwhelming, tells one of the participants, Andrea.
I was finally able to put the cost that I had planned last year.
We're kidding as fools, adds Rhonda.
People are happy.
That's a good kid. That's cool.
We really need that.
Halloween is a Palestinian celebrated at the Old of Toussaint, mainly in the Anglo-Sexons countries.
Alexei Miler of Gazprom says that Bulgaria's gas gas inaugures a new era of gas
The start of the construction of South Stream in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said the Director of Gazprom.
“A historical event has been today: the construction began in the South Stream's most important part of the South Stream Gas, the project in Europe,” explained Alexei Miller, Director-General of Gazprom, in a jeudi statement.
This project is a key element of energy security in the whole European continent.
South Stream should allow to diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
A contractial difference between Gazprom and Ukraine's homologue, where the largest part of the Russian gas for Europe is translating, increases the risk level in relation to conventional routes, adds the Director.
Miller added that the direct joinment to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "forever".
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream's gas at a reduced tariff since the whole project will be served in 2015.
Gazprom stated that the construction should start in other countries that are located in the end of the year.
The gas was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion meters of natural gas cubes.
Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reservation
The island of Pitcairn wants to create the world's most largest marine reservation, announced on Thursday day The News of Tahiti, taking an information from the Australien Radio.
This island, east of the Gambier Archive (France Polynesia), is the last British Territory of South Pacific, a mid-chemin between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory measures 47 km2, if three other small islands are counted near.
He is British since his occupation in 1790 by the Mutinites of the Bounty, the episode of the English sea history that took place at three Hollywood adaptions.
A few decades of inhabitants, most of the mutizens of the Bounty, are still living in Pitcairn, and their income depends on 95% of London's generosity.
The Island Council voted unilaterally for the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipel, or 836.000 km2 corresponding to its exclusive economic area.
A member of the island's master went to London to ask the Great Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, the master of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island.
The project should be accepted by the English Governor of Pitcairn, resident in New Zealand and the British Government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanctify these 836.000 km2, however, with the means of monitoring, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft to monitor the area, and there is no port where the military supervisory ships are placed.
With regard to France, it must already conduct the very costly aircraft and maritime monitoring of the five million km2 of the French Polynesia ZEE, near Pitcairn.
FAA accompanies the restrictions on the use of the aircraft electronic gadgets – but it will always be prohibited by calls on the portable phones.

Life Prison for an old Chinese Vice-Manager
An elderly director of the province of Jilin, in the northeastern of China, was sentenced to the Tuesday for corruption.
Excluding the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of touching more than 19 million yuans of pot-de-vin, reporting Chinese official media.
Between 1995 and 2001, the Head of Governing Body, who was also the President of the Jilin Bank, helped enterprises and responsible for obtaining contracts, loans or promotions in the exchange of money or gifts, declared the first Interim Court of Pekin on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took his functions in March last, made a national priority to combat corruption, estimating that phenomenon was a threat to the existence of the Communist Party.
If the Head of State promised that justice would be so intriguable with the powerful "tyres" with the "mouchs" - the sub-altern officials - only one of the high-rang responsibilities were sentenced, among those of the former parent of Petrochina.
The most recent case was the of the former head of the PCC in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after having seen the highest functions in the State.
But the Government did not express its intention to reform the corruption system by creating, for example, an independent body of the party.
Two employees of the ICOCA accused of sexual aggressions following the complaints made against Jonathan Lord at an audit of the Kingdom Commission.
Two employees in the Southern New Galles MYCA were accused of sexual aggression against children following complaints against Caringbah's educator, Jonathan Lord, in 2011, at a Royal Commission's hearing on children's sexual abuse.
But in his opening declaration before the Commission, the ICOC stated that “he had never had treated a problem of sexual aggression against children in his organization.”
Director-General Phillip Hare was interviewed about two cases: a employee of the ICOCA was accused of infringements regarding child pornography and a physical education monitor of ICOC Caringbah Hall was acknowledged in the centre in which she worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare declared to Gail Furness, a lawyer to the Commission, that he had known the first case but that he was not aware of the second.
He also acknowledged that the opening declaration of the ICOCA was incomprehensible by emphasising, “extern controls of the ICOCA have been carried out and said that children's security was an absolute priority for the organization.”
It was demonstrated to the Commission that the ICOCA had been informed that it had received the worst appreciation of four institutions in a auditing quality of the Department of Education and Communities in August of that year.
Mr. Hare, who began working at the age of 21, acknowledged that staff management had failed with the Lord's recruitment and that he was obliged to check that employees knew they had to report any violation of the child security policy.
Before the year, Lord was sentenced for sexual aggressions on 12 boys during the two years in which he worked at the MYCA.
He was sentenced to a sentence of 6 years of minimum prison.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that the MYCA had an cultural problem prevented the staff of reporting the lack of Lord against children's security.
The staff members demonstrated that they had observed some lacks, including the fact that the Lord remained alone with the children, he watched them in private, made them sit on his genius, said he loved them and let them play with his portable phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was covered by Lord and asked for children's protection training because she was concerned about her behavior, said that she found the responsibility of the services responsible for the childhood of the MYCA Caringbah, Jacques Barnat, who would engage Lord "speaking and difficult to approach most of the time".
The Director-General said he rejected the witnesses of the staff that they were reiterate to report these lacks to their higher herarchic.
Instead of that, he said that the friendly relationships that they had met with the Lord broke their judgment, and that they did not sign his acts.
Mr. Hare stated that he had expressed his view before the Council of New York and South Galles, saying that for the organization, the lesson of “the incident Jonathan Lord” should not be regarded 'the signal' by the staff, and the Council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to sign personnel of confidential agreements, short after the complaints were issued, was taken by the Director-General of the ICOC Child Services Office, Liam Whitley.
He stated that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of the evidence elements but that it was an “except of zeal” and that it was not implemented.
The MYCA of Southern New Galles was not a safe organization for children at the time that Jonathan Lord had been employed, namely, between 2009 and 2011, declared the experts on sexual violence on children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of the University of Griffith before the Commission.
He stated that there were “severe problems” in recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was held until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would take the opportunity to return Prime Minister, but recognizes that his return is unlikely.
In a meeting last night, marking the fifth anniversary of his start at the end of his mandate, the 59-year-old man made his opinion on various national policies.
Since his start in June 2007, after a decade to the head of the country, Mr. Blair was widely prevented of discussing the British policy, restricting its comments to foreign affairs and its special role in the Quarter for the peace process in the Middle East.
When he was asked if he would like to return the position of Prime Minister, Mr Blair would have answered, according to the Evening Standard of London: "Yes, of course, but it may probably happen, so..."
When many experts in such manifestations were gathered in Cardiff in order to face and bring the Chariot of the year, they knew that competition would be rude.
But nobody expected to win Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old child.
Not yet at the school and only a few months after having done his first weapons, shetland Toffee poney and Shetland Toffee tried during the three tours with a great facility and returned the first price, left the other 30 adult competitors behind them.
The two unreasonable – which are the same size – have been welcomed for presentation, attitude and style during the annual concours that has been launched in the Sunnybank Headquarter in Rudry near Cardiff.
He was presented against men and women with elegant melon heads, with a little plate box on the side in a decontracted way to deploy his Toffee poney around the piste.
Fenton was welcomed by the judges for his natural quality of little common drying for a child of his age.
And Toffee received very good notes for his presentation and personality.
Fenton had Toffee in gift for his threeth anniversary on March last, and has come from his shetland poney every day.
His mother, Donna, a 30-year-old, said: “Fenton and Toffee make a fine two. ”
They were presented against and against all, but both cut the gold cut and the rosette.
It was only the second time he would converse with Toffee and we were stupid with joy he won.
On the scene, people who didn't know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to do photo with him.
This young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in the south of the Galles country, follows the traces of his tea Sharon Howells, who participates in strike competitions for over 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, "The electricity was in the air and everyone encouraged it and applauded it."
He passed all the length of the current track and even if he seemed to be all small, he made a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy of animals – he loves the horses, tractors and the rural world and has two powders.
By the way he began, he will certainly participate in the manifestation of the Chair of the year – and I am sure he will make a good performance.
A speaking door of this annual manifestation said: "Fenton has only 3 years but he knows how to lead his poney."
They're a good team.
The judges noted that Fenton and Toffee had well presented and how they deployed on the track.
They're looking for an effective team work between the poney and the drainer – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he was very proud.
A Chinese newspaper who launched a call “I will be remaned”
A Chinese journal that launched a first page call for the release of an accused journalist of propagation will be remaned, says a press regulator.
The New Express based in Guangzhou has published a rare public call for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later acknowledged the television that he had accepted powers from to produce stories about a semi-public society.
Now, the New Express will be on a “complete remaning” stated the regulator.
The “remaning” order is employed by the Guangdon administration for Press and Edition, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary survey showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several wrong articles on the Zoomlion company between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The edition of New Express was disorganized,” said the regulator in a statement.
He stated that he had decided to “impose a administrative sanction in Chen Yongzhou by removing his press card.”
He also ordered to the Yangcheng Evening News Group to undertake a complete remantment of New Express, and recommended that he takes a investigation on the persons responsible at New Express and immediately restore the journal leader team.
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express on the financial irregularities presumed by a manufacturer of chanter manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper once again published a first call for his release, writeing that he supported his journalism.
But then Mr. Chen appeared on a public television chain where he agreed to have published false stories against money.
"In this case, I sneaked in Zoomlion as well as the media industry and its ability to win public trust," he stated to the CCTV public television network.
I did it mainly because I run after money and celebration.
I took account of my error.
Following Mr. Chen's excuses, New Express published his apologists in the first page, writeing that he did not correctly check his articles.
Many important suspects have recently been televisioned.
Specialists say that people are systematically binding to make their sisters, despite a change in the law that has been voted soon in the year banning the authorities to force anyone to infringe themselves.
Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft in "indisponibility"
Toulon, the door is on the ray.
The radioactive vapeur flight detected on one of the two nuclear chauffers of Charles-de-Gaulle at mid-October and when the ship was in the sea, it was "the dangers for the sea", but it is not uncompensed for the sea.
The Royale is in effect to confirm the "indisponibility" of the ship to "November", "the time to take the correction measures that are imposing" on the reactor.
On the other hand, the DCNS company, a defence specialist, ensures that his teams and Areva's teams, which were covered in the Var for the opportunity, "actually are involved in the airport."
This is for them, inter alia, to change a pump on the defective chauffage.
"All is implemented so that Charles de Gulle can make its planned deployment at the end of 2013", explains DCNS.
And the national marine ensures that "no matters of the ship's activities programme" to nuclear propulsion.
Remember that the Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft is a intermediary period of six months.
He had appeared from Toulon at the mid-October for training.
This, in particular, is to qualify young chase pilots.
A "aviary request", circumscribed to the reactor's reactor's confinement space, was then produced on the amiral ship of the French fleet.
According to the National Marine, equipment has not been exposed to possible radio contamination.
For more than one year, I am even seeing a strong inconsistent inconsistent part of the people I meet: a monstrual reévaluation of their properties, tax delay, permission costs of all kinds, administrative costs to end it.
Bref, siphoning without the limits of our pockets.
Millions of disappointed dollars could be paid to allow a very respectful tax of those who pay.
All money taken from force to contributions decreases their freedom of consumption and contributes to their advancement.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major enterprises, it is not worthy of the expenditure and the maintenance of wooded skins: a deficit cultural centre, a strong subsidiary to the city of energy, etc.
If these installations are not rewardable, they are sold to the private company or are demolizable.
It is also worth noting the expropriation of several properties to welcome a major industry that has never come.
However, I give an honourable reference to the transformation of the old Wabasso in a kind of industrial incubator, but what costs for tax payers?
This is not the public markets to invest in such companies, but the private sector based on the request of consumers.
Citizens have been happy to learn that fish and Piles will continue to supply the potable water city.
After the department of all industries (grand water consumptors) and the large decline of the population, water use has significantly decreased throughout the territory.
Unlike the gaspiller, the city will never miss water and the severe regulation of its use could be greatly adorned.
Summary, it is very easy to achieve great things with the money of others.
I would be honoured to defend such a balance.
With a brutal debt of more than 200 million dollars, this city is even no longer able to buy a store without passing by a payment regulation.
We are managed for more than 40 years by cravated with beautiful diplomas for most and I don't think that a smooth creator makes worse.
Discovering a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own fertile way
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug traffic between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, venture and electric rail systems, has been discovered.
The United States authorities described the tunnel of 4 feet [3 feet] as one of the most sophisticated passages they have never seen.
The tunnel, zigzagant on an equivalent length near six long football fields, connects tramps near Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, the United States.
The area controls indefinible trailers, which allows to easily dismiss the drug cars.
The tunnel was closed before drugs were resurrected while passing unexpectedly, the authorities declared.
The authorities took 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the tunnel’s discovery, according to the judiciary dossiers.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as chauffers, were accused of the possession of marijuana and cocaine with the intention of sale.
They seek a sentence of ten years of imprisonment if they are sentenced.
In Nogals, in Arizona, trafikers operate large subterranean draining channels.
The tunnel is the eighth important passage found in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered after the marijuana collection in the centre of Mexico in October, with a challenge for drug cards that must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of about 700 meters of fertile roads that were part of the kitchen of a house in Tijuana and went up to two San Diego's traps.
The British police will deliver an extradition mandate against Assange
The British police today delivered an extradition mandate against the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who was refugee to the Ecuador Embassy in London and requested the political asylum.
Scotland Yard said that she had issued a “remise opinion” against Australia of 40 years and asked him to submit to a police committee, adding that if he did not, it would be arrested.
Assange could be extracted in Sweden after the complaints of sexual crime, after having cut out all possible ways under the British law after the Supreme Court invalided the call that he had undertaken against its extradition at the beginning of the month.
Having congratulated that Stockholm authorized his transfer to the United States, he found refugee to the Ecuador Embassy in London on 19 June, demanding that South America's political asylum country.
Scotland Yard “affirmed an advisory opinion against a 40-year-old man who requested him to submit to a police committee at the date and time of his choice” said a speaker.
It continues to abolish the conditions of its freedom under warranty.
The Ambassador refused to comment on the delivery of the opinion by the police.
She was afraid to be extracted from Sweden to the United States where it could be accused of spontaneousness, after reporting more than 2500,000 American diplomatic cable on the WikiLeaks website against secret information.
How biometria is going to invade our lives
Find the password to tapper to access your smartphone or pay his purchase?
American, French or Japanese researchers foretold a future where we will be recognised by the biometric phone capteurs and computers.
Bernard Didier, Adjoint Director of Morpho, even believes that "the century will be biometric."
Only biometria will enable a person to be identical with transactions in a both transversal and transnational universe and the Internet.
The private life protection organizations confirm this rule for biometria, but they are worried about it.
Only in 2011 and in France, the National Commission for Intelligence and Freedoms has authorized 774 operating recognition systems, the form of the veinary hand or the network of hands in enterprises, administrations, cantines...
"All worlds will soon be identified, whereever and whereeverever," said Justin Brookman, responsible for the private life of consumers within the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology), in Washington.
The reasons of such optimism, at ones and pessimism, among others?
Biometria will support new techniques, which will allow new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most useful biometric data are digital presses, the hand coverer and the venture network of palm or dogs.
But each of these technicians has its contradictions.
"For example, some people working in the beton have very sweet denses and their employees are illicit," says Philippe Robin, technical director of the identity field at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection, as well as the verification of the veinous network and the hand-to-level, requires a voluntary and specific management of people.
This is both a security - the data can't be captured - and an inconvenience: the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore take time.
Consequently, research are conducted since twenty years on other approaches, such as the recognition of the face or the leave (the colored part of the eye).
As a result of the increase in the specification of the sensors and the calculation of the computers required for data analysis, these techniques are operational.
The accuracy of facial recognition has been multiplied by ten in the past five years, calculated by Cyrille Bataller, Director of Acccession Laboratory in Europe.
With our help, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have developed automatic border posts using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a face or a movement.
"Actually, we take research on the recognition of the voice or how to walk through the sound captors, but there is a quiet environment," says Sidhar Iyengar, Director of Security Research in Intel Labs.
A unique and unfaithful marker, DNA also produces hopes and concerns.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered as the last biometric", confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, director of the study, innovation and perspective to the CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very costful.
NEC proposes a valuable cost of $90,000 to analyze DNA samples on the place of a crime and in an hour.
Biometric uses are distributed into two groups: identification (reconciliation of one person among others) and authentication (see ensure that the person is the one he intends to be).
The identification was addressed to the delivery of identity papers until now: the biometric elements (impressed, photo, left) are to be compared with the information that the State has on all already established citizens.
This allows us to ensure that someone does not try to use the identity of someone else.
This comparison principle may have other applications.
NEC therefore proposes the recognition of VIP in the entry of a hotel or a shopping hotel.
"We will recover the images of the supervisory cameras and compare them to the photos of the célébrity that freely circulate on the Internet," explains Dany Nassif, responsible for NEC France, the commercial development for biometric identification solutions.
Another use: take in photo a quidam who makes the cheese in a shop, follows its progress thanks to facial recognition and calculate the time of wait.
Authentication was a matter of physical access (frontiers, protected places, cantines...) or logical (opening of a computer).
If there has been, recently, the presence control.
"A biometric point avoids the phenomenon of the companion that points for another," says Cyrille Bataller of Acccessure.
However, the authentication will also refer to transactions, in particular those carried out from Internet connected devices.
In Japan, it is already possible to retire the money to some distributors by introducing his card and sharing his hand on a biometric reader: this gest replaces the fraction of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneve-d'Ascq and Angola by Natural Security Company in partnership with banks and teachers of the great distribution: at the time of paying in shop with his bank card, the customer does not load his code, but introduces his duty in a changing machine.
The experimentation is planned for six months.
If it is concluded, biometric readers could soon arrive in French traders.
Tracks to recur users
There are three ways to make the seducing biometrie in the eyes of the large public.
The first is to explain that it can win from time.
"If, through biometria, a customer remains in the case of 30 seconds less than, it's pretty", explains the director of a large surface.
The second is offering customs services: In a few years, a vocal server will recognise your voice and propose options on measure.
And finally, safeguarding the precautions taken to protect databases.
"Digital prints are stored on a first server; identities of persons are on a second basis: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a high-secure wooder, which is blocked if you try to move it", says Philip Robin of Thales.
But, in need of deep studies, it is impossible to know whether these talks really convince users.
The specialists of the protection of private life, they continue to worry.
"The progress of facial recognition, the multiplication of surveillance cameras, and the great amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, is worried about the worst: a generalized supervisory," said Andrew Patrick, Commissioner for Privacy Life Protection in Canada.
A driver runing 210 km/h with a warm wood between the feet saw a 1,000 £ band
An automobilist saw an amendment of 1 000 £ to run at 210 km/h with a warm wood powder placed in balance between his feet.
Andrew Howie, 35 years old, has been conducting his Mercedes Benz on the A120 higher at Braintree on May 27th.
When the police stopped it, they found the wood to take between his feet.
In the Court of First Instance of Colchester, Howie admitted the infringement of conduct without prudence and the necessary attention.
The seven items retired on his permission led to a 6-month license.
Howie has also been sentenced to pay costs resulting from 90 £ and a surtax for victims of 100 £.
A tax on foreign real estate owners to shut the ball in London
The Treasury provisionally crypted the measurement of capital profit tax but expected a final decision by Mr. Osborne, which, in 2012, inscribed an amount of 7 per cent per cent for properties that cost more than 2 MF and annual costs for buyers who choose to hold properties within a company instead of individual title.
The law of the Timbre is already applicable to residential properties of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea arrangements, and is 708 £ for the fiscal year 2012/13, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Galles, Scotia, Northwest, Northwest, and the New Yorkshire and Humber region.
Mr. Cook stated: "In addition to the increase in the right to smooth on great value properties and the introduction of the anti-evitation law, it is very difficult to advance that large value properties are subject to independence on the effects of the obsolete housing tax system."
"But this change could make foreign investors reciprocal to the idea to purchase property in London or current residents to the idea of sale", he added.
Prestige immobiliary – 5 to 10% of the highest prices of the immobilier market – in the prosper sector situated in the south-west of London, which is from Fulham in Wimbledon, increased by 11.8% in the last year.
The prices in London's center show a regular growth of 5,6% in year, but have been elected by a “inland market” in full growth, the south-west of the city, the north (7,4%) and the east (6,5%), according to Savills studies.
Scientists start to light the way the movements of a dog are linked to their humor.
Recent studies have revealed that the happy dogs have more removed their skin to the right (of the point of view of the dog), while the nervous dogs removed it more to the left.
But now scientists say that dogs can detect these subtle differences and answer it.
Professor Georgio Vallortigar, a neuroscientist of the Trent university, stated: "All knows that, in the man, the left side and the right side of the brain are involved in the stimulations that develop positive or negative emotions. "
Here, we tried to see what it was in other species.
He added that, as in humans, the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and the next verse, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the movements of other dogs disordered, researchers followed animals in view of films where other dogs were.
They measured the heart frequency of animals and analyzed their behavior.
It will not be necessary for a long time before we understand why their cheese is sometimes on the one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigar explained: "We presented the dogs of other dogs – or a naturalist version or silhouette to avoid any other confusion factor – and we could trace the shoe movement and present it as more to the left or right."
When the animals saw a dog without expression to remove the cheese to the right (of the point of view of the dog that removes the cheese), they remained perfectly extensive.
But when they repeated a chain leads mainly to the left (when once again from the dog view that removes the cheese), their heart frequency has accelerated and had anxious appearance.
Professor Vallortigar said that he did not think that dogs were communicated with them through these movements.
He thinks instead that dogs know by experience the movements they should or should not be worried about.
He added: "If you meet several times other dogs and if you notice that, most of the time, their skin movement to a side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react according to this experience."
The researchers indicate that the results could enable owners, veterinarys and closers to better appreciation of the emotions of their animals.
The Canin Comporting Expert John Bradshaw, Professor invited to the University of Veterinary Sciences at Bristol, explained that this was not the first study to consider the importance of the left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team of Lincoln's university found that dogs turn the head to the left when they looked at a aggressive dog and right when it was a joyful dog.
And in another scientific study carried out by the University of Victoria in Canada, he stated: "Dogs went easier to a dog, when his hair moved to the left than to the right, instead of become anxious, the opposite of what is found in the Italian study."
He stated that the differences could come from the fact that dogs who participated in various studies did not consider completely the animals of films or dogs as dogs.
A study on how dogs react to true dogs might be useful, explained.
“ Although many elements, mentioned in different mammals, indicate that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes, a lot of details must still be specificated – and do not make the dogs exceptions” said it.
However, given the facility with which their behaviors can be registered, it will be certainly not long before we understood why their neck sometimes moves from one side and sometimes from the other.
Arctic Monkeys reports a concert in Glasgow because of Alex Turner's disease
The Arctic Monkeys Rock Group reported a concert in Glasgow after diagnosing a laringite to his songer.
Sheffield's group had to take place on Thursday in the concert room The Hydro in the centre-ville.
However, his laringite forced the songer Alex Turner to reprogramme the spectacle.
The announcement was made after the group was forced to report a concert at the Burmingham LG Area on Thursday.
In a statement on their official site, the Arctic Monkeys stated: "Seguince the decision to report the concert at the Birmingham LG Area this night and after requesting medical opinion, the Arctic Monkeys must also report the spectacle to the Glasgow Hydro on Friday, 1 November."
"Alex Turner suffers from a laryngite and regrets that it can't happen in concert."
The spectacle at the Birmingham LG Arena will take place on 20 November, and the Glasgow Hydro will take place on 21 November.
All tickets are valid for these concerts.
We want to apologize with all the ticket detentors for all disgracefully caused.

Pape François names his first cardinals in February
The pape François calls new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on 22 February, announced the Vatican Thursday.
Cardinals are the men of the highest church placed in the Catholic Church behind the Pope, and those who elect it, so François will call his first group of men who will choose in definitive way his successor.
There are 201 cardinals at the current time.
However, as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, it cannot be involved in the election of a pape – it therefore returns to a group of 120 'cardinal elections'.
In a declaration announcing the new, the father of Federico Lombardi, a Vatican's speaking port, said that a meeting with all existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony during which eve will be higher to the dignity of cardinal, known under the name of composer.
"Pape François decided to communicate its decision to convoke the composition of February in advance to facilitate the planning of other meetings needed to participate in the cardinals of different parts of the world", said Lombardi.
Jack Valero des Catholic Voix stated that in February the number of electoral cardinals would probably be decreased.
He stated that a pape was generally called as cardinal cardinals that it was necessary to reach 120 and more than 80 years older cardinals.
The composition of the next year will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pope François in March of this year, Valero said.
At the time there is a kind of tendency to privilegle Europe and in particular Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pape would name the cardinals of the rest of the world to restore the balance” he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a few cardinals represent them.
Cardinals will also be the first chosen since François has formed the Cardinal Council, a group of eight cardinals in the whole world to consider the ways to reform the church.
Before, the pape decided everything alone.
"But now, François has chosen these eight cardinals to help them", explained Valero.
He added that he was “totally possible” that Francois requested the career advice.
But we have never known such a situation – it is totally new.
Valero stated that the papas were generally raised by the Hebrews representatives of large communities at the cardinal rang, but François was “complete of surprises – so we don’t know who he would call. ”
GM recalls some of its new collections in the United States to repair the seat record
General Motors Co recalls nearly 19 000 of its new pickups Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 to solve a problem with inclinable files manually, according to a sale statement from the United States vehicle security regulation.
In some pickups, the seats were able to present a default at the level of the inclination mechanism.
Consequently, dossiers do not respect the federal vehicle security standards for head support.
“If the vehicle is covered by the back, the head support may not be properly protected by passengers, thus increased the risk of wounds”, according to the statement shown on the site of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
Remember models were built between 1 August and 10 September.
The deployment of GM pickups began in June and represents the most important launch of vehicles for the first US car manufacturer since his facility and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the owners of the default during the first hour of October.
NHTSA could not consider the information letter to the owners because of the arrest of 16 days of government activities, which increased the growth of vehicle sales in October.
The sales of Silverado and Sierra, which were resigned for the 2014 model, increased around 20% during the first 10 months of the year, said GM vendredi.
In October, GM sold 42 660 pickups Silverado and 16 503 pickups Sierra.
The GM's actions rated by 1.4 per cent to reach $37.47 at New York's bus on Thursday after midday.
A worker dies severely under beton blocks
An employer of the construction is dead in securities under decades of beton blocks, Thursday before midday, in Montreal.
The drame occurred at 11 a.m. on the Marquette Street, near the Beaubian Street intersection, in the rounding of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
Indeed, work on foundations had been made in this place for a certain time.
A mitoian foundation wall came to be enriched over the past days.
The accident occurred at the time the victim came to arrive on the chain to restore his tools.
I passed in the car, and I saw the wall run with a big cloud cloud, said Sylvain Jean, who remains near the chanter.
I'm disabled and I'm going to get out of the big bricks.
We only saw a part of his two, that's so bad.
According to the authorities, the victim is an old man in the 50th worked for a coffee company.
Reanimation manuals were tested by emergency services, but without success.
The man hasn't survived his serious wounds.
An Inspector of the Committee on Health and Labour Safety was discovered on the places to investigate the circumstances of this drama.
The cry of disappointment of a Obama elector
I voted two times for President Obama, believed in the possibility of change
He said that Obama has made pleasant efforts made by the Obstructionism of the Republican Party
Obstructionnism does not apologize the difficulties of the Obamacare site, nor the drones attacks
The memory of the 2008 Obama campaign is a tragic memories of what could happen
Nathaniel P. Morris is a doctor in the Harvard Medical Faculty.
I'm reading a painful book in these days.
It's a book that I thought it would encourage me during the morousity of the second year of physician and give me hope back.
He's called The Audacity to Win and it's the memories of the Presidential campaign of Barack Obama in 2008.
When I finished the medical accounts of my patients last night and I'm sleeping, this book brings me back to the time that policies inspired millions of people and where the speakers could cut you out.
The election ended by a scratch victory and the presenters of the newspapers took the time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My friends cryed to joy, and my parents stood all the newspapers they found.
A young visionary team was advanced to the White House and the nation was ready to change.
During the transition period of Obama before his function in 2008, he had 82 per cent of favourable opinions.
And then I'll close the book.
The return to the present is a difficult wave, it's like coming out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, which are like far-remember memories, a tragic memory of the possibilities of the past.
The change has really been made in the years that have followed the first time when I voted.
It had nothing to see with what I had imagined.
I put Obama's credit from great achievements, from the pass of the Affordable Care Act, until the end of our army, through the end of the 'now see' and the murder of Oussama Ben Laden.
I also believe that the partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the field of immigration reforms, public health care and the closerness of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after I maintained the Obama administration faced my couples and colleagues, I am not able to explain.
I am on the border of political desire.
The Republican objection cannot explain the hearing of foreign leaders, nor the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the private life of the Americans, nor the accusation of accused persons who reveal the faults of the Government.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Aukla, an American citizen, without proceedings, nor the evasion of public funding and the overriding of the expenditure allowed during the presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report which says that the efforts of the White House to reduce the silence media are the "agressive... since Nixon's administration".
And more recently, she cannot apologize the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act has been ratified.
I don't know if that's what I expected.
If I was 18 years old, I was supposed to understand that governance could oppose the political campaigns previously.
Of course, the election function is not predictable, because the political party of opposition and events that occur, like Newton's masker, affects our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have made above seem to be largely the choice of the administration.
That's what I'm worried.
I again voted to Obama in 2012, but not because I was encouraging by his candidate.
Mitt Romney presented a confused and unrefined alternative that seemed to not allow its policies or positions to determine.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second mandate by being released from the pressure of future elections, would hold the promises that we had heard for so long.
However, while the rate of favourable opinions has slowed by 45 per cent this week, it is still more difficult to return to 2008 through this book.
I would like to wish the many promises that have been engaged.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama had lost huge losses in the benefit of Clinton's Primary of Pennsylvania.
During a sub-Canada meeting, he said to his team that they had to go on the good way and remain faithful for their causes.
"I want us to recently on our talent," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
We are here five years later, Mr President, and I am no longer agreed with you.
The views expressed in this comment are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
Thursday, at 15 hours, a violent collision between a motor and a car was produced from Retinne to Fleron.
The motive, Jonathan, 26 years old from Fleron, wasn't shipping.
Despite the rapid intervention of aid, it is deceived during this border collision.
Clive Palmer claims that Mr. Tony Abbott had a conflict of interest in the parental congestion system.
Mr. Clive Palmer progressed that Prime Minister Tony Abbott had a conflict of interest in the parental congestion system because his daughters could be pregnant and benefited from this system.
The master of the mining extraction, which contests the payment of a carbon tax of a $6, has made that argument to try to defeat the issues relating to a possible conflict.
Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial at the time of decided whether carbon and mineral taxes should be removed.
But Mr. Palmer said that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and stated that the girls of Mr. Abbott were ready to personally benefit these policies.
"He will have an important conflict of interest when he works on paying the parent's seat because if one of his girls is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in the fact that she obtains or not a license," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after its election, the election committee officially stated that Mr. Palmer returned the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax by 53 votes after recompense.
Mr. Palmer has advanced the idea of remaning the suffixing system to accelerate the process.
The girls of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote was completed?
“We need a better system” he said.
Why could we not have a system in which you can enter, enter your coordinates in a computer, vote immediately and have the result at 6:30 next morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of paper crayons to mark votes.
Is it to be able to remove the result if someone isn't agreed?
From today, having a paper crystal seems to be extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has studied the possible options for electronic vote and recently published a joint reflection document with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59 years old, said that his political project would include an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take its new functions “a very seriously. ”
The exercise of public functions is an issue of public service.
“We are not looking for rewards, except for the reward of the history, because we must serve the community at a critical moment” he added.
The Wildlife Conservation Society of New York identified a new species of forest dauphine along the northern coasts of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, scientist mission at the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Animals and Good Marins (OCEAMM) returns to the Express on this discovery and explains the long process for the identification of new species.
Does the discovery of this new species of boss dauphine you have to be astonished?
It's a good news, but it doesn't really matter me.
In the past, species have been described and identified on morphological, anatomic and geographical basis, today, the development of new tools such as genetics allow us to improve our knowledge in sciences of the classification of species.
It is also not possible that these progress in genetic and molecular biological depend on the classification or possession of a species to a kind, a family, or even a order.
At the beginning of the 19th century, morphologists classified animals, based on morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these classifications are made due to the progress of genetic progress.
Similarly, two very nearly morphological species have been distinguished by genetics.
This is the case of the new species to be identified.
For a decade ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this sub-familiar family: the Pacific boss dauphines and the Atlantic forest balls.
Recent analysis allowed to distinguish four species.
Why is this a discovery of importance as the Wildlife Conservation Society stated?
From a view of conservation, it is essential to know these genetic differences in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability.
If this population was already known by researchers for a long time, they did not know that it was part of a new species, only present at this place.
As a result, if a massive mortality problem caused by viral or accidental epidemia is in the region, we might have been subjected to the extinction of a species, rather than to a local disappearance of a population of a more widely wide species on the Earth.
This loss of genetic patrimonie would be much more difficult.
A species is considered threatened or in a way of extinction based on the number of existing individuals on Earth, namely the stock, and the possibility that it has to be restored from neighbour stocks.
For the species of Sousa Chinesensis, whose population of the newly discovered species, its stock has become automatically weaker, making it so vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
The marine mammals are located above the food chain.
They live in homogene habitats, in which there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This gene breast limits the creation of new species.
Instead, the most closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can lead to the creation of new species.
We need to know that the marine environment is the least known environment.
We prefer to send robots on Mars, to know what lives in the sea of the Mariannes, just 11 miles (11 km) from the surface of the sea.
More money are spent in life research on other planets than in marine research and it is much time to change it.
RBS suspends two traders on the market of changes
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two tradeers from its market department of changes according to two close sources of the file, which shows once again that the overall survey of regulators on the debt market manipulations began to bring its fruits.
Some of the largest banks in the world, including UBS, Barclays, German Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperate with regulators in the context of the most important financial market investigations in the world, where $5,3 billion are handling every day.
The two traders are the first employees of RBS to be suspended under the expansion of the investigation that has failed to scan the Libor interbanking rate manipulations.
The bank, which refused to comment on the suspensions, confirmed that the requests of the regulators were received.
"The current investigation on this case continues and we are working fully with the FCA and the other regulators," said a representative of the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the dossier declared that RBS had transmitted e-mails and e-mails, sent to and by an older trade, to the British Regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and would have been suspended from his European accounting post for debts at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, who was responsible for the Citi Account changing, was entered this week, while Matt Gardiner, buying higher deals at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
No of these traffickers did not have any accused.
The dossier of Mr. Usher included immediately sent messages to and by banking employees at Barclays and Citigroup, added sources near the folder.
UBS explained this week that she had intended to take action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma stated that he was investigating the survey of change market manipulations in a number of Swiss banks.
In the world, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the United States Justice Department and the Monetary Authority of Hong Kong – are reviewing the claims made on bankingers that would be heard to handle change market rates.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Swiss Credit also started internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, reported close sources of the file.
Banks switch the instant messages and emails sent for years to find cases of reprehensible acts.
The news regarding these investigations has been the salers in a sector which has been one of the largest growth engines in the investment bank trade units over the past few years, but has been sent in question this year because of the low volatility of debts that limit the opportunities for the specialists.
Some bankers tried to minimise the case by saying that it is almost impossible to handle the broad market of strongly liquid changes, but senior traders explain that this is not necessaryly true.
A senior trader said that, despite the high volume of daily change transactions, liquidity frammentation between trade platforms and use of more frequently by banks of their own internal platforms explains “is possible to start having an impact on the market in a few costs”.
The news occurred at the same day when the Swiss Credit has announced that a worker was returned to its office of the funds negotiated in London this week after he lost $6 million at the end of the last year.
The bank quickly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with regulators.
“We are convinced that the trade has acted alone and that the case has been managed,” said a representative of the Swiss credit.
The investigation on Major Rob Ford was undertaken, supports a lawyer
After the police was confirmed to have put the hand on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford fuming from the crack, My Clayton Ruby has never seen a "bacalized" investigation.
My Ruby said to believe in the Canadian Press that the police had not known or minimised the evidence of the master.
On Thursday, the police stopped Rob Ford's occasional friend and chauffeur, Alexander Lisi, aged 35, and accused him of extortion about the video.
Alexander Lisi, formerly accused of drug trafficking, was in contact with the master.
The police also observed the man who delivered colis to Rob Ford, which indicates new court documents.
My Ruby was able to "inexplicable" the fact that the police had never disrupted Rob Ford or his home vehicle, or put on listening to his phone, supporting that the police manager Bill Blair had chosen for knowledge of not acting against the master.
In accordance with the law, the police, who had been witnessing of suspected transactions in his own hands, had been very well able to intercepte the vehicle of Rob Ford, to stop the master, and to investigate, even without mandate.
It could also request an instantaneous investigation mandate, if necessary.
The police chief did not comment, but Mark Pugash's portal has qualified Me Ruby's proposal of "blood and unexpected tendency" to be aware of the media in a case that does not matter it.
In the press conference, Mr. Blair stated that there was nothing in this video that could be "reasonable reasons" that could be carried out by a criminal accused against the master.
European Bourses at Middle Session except London
On the exception of London, the major European Bourses evolve in low-seventh seventh-seventh, slowed by some news of deceasing companies, while Wall-Street is expected to increase.
In addition, investors remain careful because they believe that the American Federal Reserve could renew its quantitative absorption policy as early as planned.
In turn, after advertising an inflation to 0.7% for the whole euro area, the idea was undergoing among the market actors that the European Central Bank (ECB) could enhance its monetary policy.
The future of Wall Street continues to preserve an opening of American actions, after two consequent reply meetings.
In values, Renault (-4.63%) records the strongest replica of the CAC 40, plotted by warning on the result of his Nissan Motor partner on Tuesday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6,26%) marks the worst performance of EuroFirst300, after having also published results in lowing this morning, and announced the creation in the internal structure of a bad bank ("bad bank") grouping 38 billion of risked asset books.
On his side, Vodafone (+2.45%) was headed by the EuroFirst300 skins in response to a press information that would like to study an OPA possible.
On the market of changes, the speculations on the development of the ECB's monetary policy will be good train, such as John Hardy, Strategy at Saxo Bank.
The only mandate of the ECB was always on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reasons to act at the meeting of the next week.
We are expecting a strong decline potential in the euro.
In this context, the euro continues to respond to the US currency and has touched a lower of two weeks to $1,3517.
The same concepts support the euro area's compulsory market.
The Supreme Court valids the Obama Health System reform law
The great victory for the administration of Obama: the Supreme American Court today stated that the reform law of the system of health ratified by Obama was constitutional.
By 5 votes against 4, the judges valided the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Admissible Care Act (the Act on the Protection of Diseases and Approximative Care), which requires citizens to submit a health insurance of this 2014, unlike to pay an amendment – and stated that it was constitutional in accordance with the Government's tax power.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, was raised to the four most liberal members of the Court, while the judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed their inconvenience.
The Court also fixed the other sections of the Act of 2 700 pages and also considered that the provisions of the Health System reform law, which claims that it must be subjected to the liability of Medicaid, in spite of losing all federal fundings of the programme, were coherent in accordance with the Constitution.
The procedure to block the law was undertaken by 26 States and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All the major Republicn candidates in the presidential election during the primary 2012, including the named Mitt Romney, were fairly opposed to the law.
Vibrat Hommage returned to old fighters in Menton
In the heart of the Trabouract semestre, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, the Friday after midday, a hamper of the soldiers and disfellowshipped from all wars.
The Deputy Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities were placed in two of the three military carriages of the cemetery.
Acrobacy between Palestinian and Israeli borders of Gaza
Four fighters of Hamas were killed and five Israeli soldiers blessed on Thursday 31 October 2013 at the evening at a violent slaughter of the border between Gaza and Israel, the most serious incident in the Palestinian Territory for a year.
The only electrical center of the Gaza flag stopped working on Thursday, 1 November after the expansion of its fuel stocks, announced the Palestinian Energy Authority.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam, Khaled Abou Bakr, and another framework of the Hamas Army branch Rabieh Barikeh, was killed by a chart bus shooting at an incursion of the Israeli army in the east of Khan Younez, in the south of the Gaza flag, according to local medical sources.
Two other local officials of the Al-Qassam, Mohammed al-Qasas and Mohammed Daoud found death when a Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same region.
They were found later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters conducted a supervision operation in the border zone between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack against a tunnel crushed by the Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, a Israeli chart and a blind bulldozer made a incursion of a hundred meters inside the territory before they were then retired.
The resistance was a half hour, according to witnesses.
In a communication, a Hamas's parliament, Sami Abou Zouhri, hampered the four "heroes" and claimed that Israeli soldiers had found death during the conflict.
Hamas welcomes the heroes of Al-Qassam who have fallen by defending the territory in the incursion of the sionist employer in Khan Younès.
several enemy were killed and blessed during the operation.
"The Hamas ensures that Gaza will be a hell for the employer," threatened the speaker.
On the other hand, the Israeli army stated that the target of its operation was at the start of a large tunnel section crossed into the Israeli territory since the Palestinian enclave, discovered on October 7 and intended, according to the army, to "terrorism activities".
Hamas returned to the use of tunnels to fight against Israel, clarifying that the purpose was to remove Israeli soldiers to exchange them against Palestinian prisoners.
The operation aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, explained an Israeli military communication.
During the operation, Hamas deployed a explosive initiation for the forces of Tsahal (Israel army) and slaughtered five soldiers.
Israeli attack in the northern Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of use of the terrorist tunnel for attacks against Israeli civilians," stated by the army Peter Lerner's speaking port.
In addition, Israel shocked a military base in the northwest of Syria for a load of missiles for the libanese Hezbollah movement, reported on Thursday 31 October the Satellite Chamber Al-Arabia.
A U.S. responsible confirmed a "Israel flag" but did not give details on the target.
"For the past, targets were transferred to Hezbollah", he was pleased to add.
The responsibilities of the Israeli government refused to confirm any information regarding such a attack.
Regarding the "exclused sources" that she did not name, the Saudi capital chain stated that "the bomb was launched by solar mixes that was intended to be used to Hezbollah in Lebanon," referring to the powerful Libanon Chiitan movement that fight against rebellious sides of the Syrian forces.
Before, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, had held several marvelous explosions on the east in a air defence base in Sonar Jabllé, near Latvia, on the Syrian coast.
This organization, which was supported by a network of medical warriors and sources, was not able to identify the origin of explosions.
Back to black and white for Mary Chouinard, who presents in Dane Dane his two new group choreographys: the first inspired incredible and poems of Henri Michaux, the second insufficient by the famous Gymnopedies of Satie.
A evening that allows to see all the capture of Chouinard, art to tics and black white-and-wheel.
A white screen set of background wall.
On the mass, too white, in the imnse space that is the Housenew Theater, advances, profiles, ends like a line and black clothes, a body.
On the screen, an enclosure of Henri Michaux is designed.
The body, simple trace, take his shape.
And this is the form of the entire room: an enfilade of physical designs.
The dancers, totally black clothes, only hands and faces discovered, wait from each side of the game air, slow up when the next graph appears, the incarnant, ressorted in the current.
This black and white game of Henri Michaux is made in relief of solvents, in a group at the Unisson (a single mass) in a large group of 12 singles where everyone performs its sign.
It is thinking of "First Gloria" where Chouinard was only performing a series of choreographic tasks written on cards, put online on the front scene.
It's the same principle, PowerPoint version.
Here, music is strong, percussions and electric guides.
Energy is high, rythm is always fast.
There will be cake when Carol Prieur will fly under the dance mass, to deliver, micro in hand, without sovereignty or retained, a part of the poem of Michaux, monocord and monotone in the cry, and continue to dance.
And the music to divide, and the sequence of getting back.
This sound and energy discharge, long, if it can, end by breathing and smoking.
As it also makes the regularity of visual rythm.
There are some beautiful flashs - the creation of images has always been a strength in Chouinard - such as those hairs that swear or black tissue that long the lines.
But choreographic approach lacks composition.
The choregraph, instead of go to the meeting of Michaux, was imposed, with its tics.
Result: The body seems to be flat before the drawings.
Michaux's crowds, such as Gestalt's forms, open a larger and giant imagination than dance, more porous.
Only the end, negatively, with its dancers touched by a stroboscopic light and the white signs in a suddenly black theater, touchs the magic.
The public loved, the accommodation was warm.
The Gymnopedias, after the contract, are more rich.
The scene is partly draged by green, dancers and a plan are collected of tissue, such as furniture in a timely house.
On the floor, dancers were relaxed to play partitions.
Their bad addresses in music, touching, give true fragility.
On the scene, pass the couples, in loved doubles, very sensitive, even erotic.
Group work, small transitions, assemblies that move, sweet, the writing is less binary.
Bouffons appear, also the families of Chouinard, wooding the red nest, in lovely polarized men.
Love is carnashiers, flighters or players.
The smile, the rise and the small crys are beautifully transposed by the archaic, thanks and strikes of the body in coit, of beings that are found.
But the room takes his real fleet after the salvation.
A crown comes to scene when the public leaves.
There, everything becomes permission: the fourth wall falls, the explored universes are superpowered, the cloud dancers, fall among the spectrums, swimming, smoking, short-circuiting, playing applaudment codes, embracing the skin in a sacredly calculated disorder that remains sensitive.
The joy and fool overcome, and it's the art of Chouinard, here, to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are the object of judiciary progress on Nortel patents
The group that has thousands of former Northern patents has engaged in a shock of jury patents against portable telephone manufacturers, including Google, the company he coffected to the shooting during the sale of patents that took place after the Northern Failite.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired the Northern Patents for 4,5 Md$, has been complained against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent violations before the United States Assistance Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly detained by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents contain technologies that allow advertising in relation to terms of Internet research, indicated the conclusions of the process, which is the goal of Google.
It was not possible to join the representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture phones operating under the Google Android exploitation system, which frees a fellow competition to Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made a initial offer of $900 for Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offer to several times, finally proposing $4.4 million.
After losing the Nortel patents faced at Rockstar, Google purchased the Motorola Mobility suite for a amount of $12.5 million, a part market based on the motorola patent library.
"Only if Google failed in his attempt to purchase the patents during the investigators, he has violated and continued to violate these patents," said the conclusions of the case.
Rockstar claims the most important damages and interests against Google, because it claims that Google patent violation is obtained, according to the complainant.
Exploration of a house in Gesves: a defect water heat from the explosion
The grandmother would have driven a cigarette at a gas fleet.
The explosion of a apartment in Gesves, which made two serious damages on Wednesday morning, a mother of 52 years and his 5-year-old boys, was due to a gas fleet from a defect water heating, indicated the replacement of the king's contractor.
The expert deployed on place by the park ensures that the origin of the exploitation is totally accidental.
The grandmother had a cigarette while there was a smoke and gas accumulation.
The vital prognosis of the two victims is always involved.
The grandmother was designed by the exploitation and is shockly burned.
The little boy, who stayed at his grandfather and his companion, was on his side and was slowly burned.
"The two victims were entered and long-termly conditioned on place before they were brought to the Liège CHU, she was helicoptère, helicópter,," explained the Bargster José Paulet, descending on the places.
Traumated, the grandfather was on the floor at the time of the explosion.
He was able to join the shooting shooter remained intact while the back wall of the house was totally destroyed.
The grandfather and the locator of the neighbouring house, fragilized by the explosion, were registered by the President of the CPAS.
The pompiers of Andene and Namur and the Arches police are involved.
The civil protection of Crisis has established the two buildings.
Egypt requests the first President freely elected to priest serment
Mohamed Morsi was prepared for investment, but it is unlikely that his triomph day marks the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a "new Egyptian" when he prepared the seat of investment to the presidency, thus became the first freely elected and successive President in Hosni Moubarak, who was taken from the power 16 months ago.
In his investment before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mr. Morsi has also become the first Islamic president freely elected from the Arab world and the fifth Head of Egypt since the reverse of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He was fully prepared before the 18 judges of the Court with the building located in the border of the Nil to look like a Egyptian temple.
"We'll be able to shoot the best next morning, a new Egyptian and a second Republic," said President Morsi during the solemn ceremony, which is distributed directly on public television.
“Actually, the Egyptian people has put the foundations of a new life – the absolute freedom, a real democracy and stability – explained Mr. Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer in the United States, is of the Muslim Brothers, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years as an illegal and hardly repressed organization by the following Governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police were watching the building when Mr. Morsi arrived short after 11 hours, local hours, following a small convoi.
Only hundreds of supporters were gathered before the Court for the new President and, starting from the rapid President of the years of Moubarak, the movement was only slowly interrupted in order to allow the transfer of his convocation to the very frequent streets connecting the city to the South Banks.
Bearing in mind as the "Health Rail" of the Muslim Brothers, his prestigious personnel has been significantly strengthened since his victory and sales talk during which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only of Islamists but of all those who want to end the work that was endeavoured in 2011 against the authorized President Moubarak.
"Egypte is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state", said Mohamed Morsi, in blue and red cost, addressing the judges present in the boise room where he has been prepared.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to the University of Caire where he announced his investment talk.
He has been officially welcomed by a military fan who played the national symne while he was put to the guard to you.
Hussein Tantaoui marshall attended the ceremony.
At his arrival, he was welcomed by the song "The people and the army, the hands in the hand..." shocked by thousands of people assembled in the great amphitheater of the university.
The University of Caire became a fifth of Islamic students groups in the 1970s.
Mr. Morsi made a symbolic slaughter on the Tahrir place, where he went to the submission that ended the Moubarak's authorisation regime last year, and he pleaded to restore the Presidential powers of which the military council, who replaced the former President, deposed it.
But accepting officially priestly before the Court, rather than before Parliament as it is useful, it turns into the army's will by showing that the fight against power has not been completed.
Mr. Morsi's talk on the Tahrir place was composed of spectacular popular gestures.
The shutdown in the United States slowed the increase in the auto market
The closure for 16 days of most federal administrations has weakened the growth of car sales in the United States in October, showing the numbers published by the constructors, five of the six main performances that have been less than expectations.
The three major Detroit constructioners show a growth in two figures in October 2012 but only General Motors did better than expected.

Do you think travel agencies belong to the past because of Internet?
Flight Centre seems to turn the trend.
The company revised its net benefits previsions to increase and hope record results by the vacants of Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel agency is now expected to achieve a sub-jacent benefit of the whole year between $325 and $340 before taxes, against a previous prevision of $305 to $315.
If the current previsions are reached, it will be 12 to 17 per cent of growth compared to the profit of $290.4 per cent in 2011/12.
The Director-General, Graham Turner, stated that Flight Centre had made 8% benefits in the first half and that the second half of the seventh had started into force, in particular on travels other than business travels in Australia and the United Kingdom.
“Seen the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present are rewardable, and several of them are good to achieve record results on the whole year before the deduction of interests and taxes” said it.
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally countries who generate the greatest benefits.
In Australia, the travel sector has rebonded during the second half, which allowed to compensate a home market of business travels in low-scale.
Similarly in the United Kingdom, Flight Centre’s travel sector has registered good results while business customers have less expenditure.
His subsidiary to the United States has recovered losses during the first half of the year in which the request of season is less and should benefit from the whole year for the third time.
Flight Centre's actions increased $3 percent to reach $38.20 last.
Unbelievers shoot on a hotel near the Caire pyramides
Unbelievers opened the fire this week on a hotel near the pyramids of the Cair in Egypt without doing victims, resulting in an outstanding outstanding with licensed salary.
The shuttlers took the shuttle, specificated the parliamentary port of the Ministry of Interior, General of Police Abdel Latif.
This attack happens when Egypt has almost no tourists received since the army has established the Islamic President Mohamed Morsi early July and repressed the manifestations of his partisans in the blood.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, orthographs and gramms
In the context of English literature course, students must study at least one part of Shakespeare, a Roman of the 19th century, a Roman and a modern British fiction work in 1914.
The review will also present "new texts" to encourage more diversified reading.
A combinating literature and English course will be removed.
From 2015, students will have to pass an independent language GCSE and will be strongly encouraged to choose separated qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education must tomorrow publish its new English and math programs – the first materials to undermine radical review.
It will make changes in other fundamental materials in the next year.
In addition, Ofqual, the Review Regulatory Office, will declare a remaning of the GCSE's structure, with a new and less currency system.
In the summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, said that there was a “wide consensus on the need to reform our review system to restore public confidence”, insisting on the fact that the GCSE would be“ more stimulant, more ambitious and more rigorous”.
Studies show that English schools have less time to maths (116 hours per year, or 3 hours per week) than most of the other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools propose a average of 143 hours per year, and the students in Singapore are about 138 hours.
Although there is no formal obligation to dedicate more hours of employment to maths, close sources of the coalition government indicated that the GCSE of Deep Maths – even as the most important of the materials agreed in international classifications – would likely encourage schools to ensure more ranging hours.
The programme will emphasize the “the problems of the real world”, including the financial mathematics.
This judgment means that a legislative text adopted in July in that State and which is widely entitled the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
A 8-year-old children with a gun at the Muy for Halloween
The age of nine and 13 years of age made the door to claim bonbons on the night of Halloween.

The former Head of Gestapo entered in a Jewish cemetery
Muller, who disappeared at the end of the Second World War without ever finding his trace, was actually entered into a common being of a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, claiming the leader of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Image.
Muller hasn't survived at the end of the war.
"One body was entered in 1945 in a common era of the Jewish cemetery of Berlin-Mitte," he was assured at a large shooting daily, supporting archiving documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of the nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, would respond to one of the great crowds of the African-Guerre.
The German secret services, the BND, were assured as well as during the summer of 1949, Muller was located in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Image.
Secret services were entirely wrong.
"After August 1945, the body of Muller was found in a provisional tomb near the former minister of the king's Aviation by a command," said Mr. Tuchel.
He was taking a general uniform.
"In the left pocket, in particular, his service status with a photo," he continues.
Image also publishs a document of the Mitta rounding quarter in Berlin, showing that it was entered in the Jewish cimetry of the neighbor.
The President of the Central Council of the Jews, Dieter Graumann, declared that revelation.
One of the most brutal nazi sadicals is entered in a Jewish cemetery, it is an emermality of bad ghost.
"There's greatly the memory of the victims" was insured in the newspaper.
Heinrich Muller is part of the important personalities of the Third Reich who have never been captured.
He participates in the Wannsee Conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final resolution" and was in particular under its orders Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistic" of the exclusion of Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in Cameroun villages
Dr. Bwelle and his team are almost all their weekends to see hundreds of patients
There are no many doctors in this West African country, at least 1 to 50,000 people.
You are here or through your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the 10 other heroes, for the election "The Year's Heroes".
This person will receive $ 2500,000 to continue its extraordinary work.
By 21 years of age, Georges Bwelle looked at his sick father to change the time of conscience and inconsciousness and became in hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was blessed in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroun.
At first, he had only a fallen arm, but he contracted a infection that propaved up to his brain, creating a hematome that he would take the rest of his life.
“ There was no neurochirurg in Cameroun” said Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought it to the foreigner if we had enough money.
Instead of that, Dr. Bwelle has been able to accompany his father in clinics and hospitals in order to obtain any treatment that he could benefit.
“It's not easy,” adds Mr. Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5:00, run to the hospital to be the first, and you are not the first.
There are many patients.
People can die because they're waiting too long.
The situation has not been much changed since the death of Dr. Bwelle's father in 2002.
In Cameroon there is only 1 doctor for 50,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
For comparison, the ratio to the United States is 1 doctor for 413 people.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Camerounais could not pay the consultation.
Two persons of five in the country live under the poority area, and almost three four of the country ' s health costs are carried out in the private sector.
“The only problem they have is poverty” explained Dr. Bwelle.
And because of poverty, they cannot benefit from life.
After having seen his father and both his companions suffering, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team practiced more than 700 surgery acts freely during the last year.
It became a physician itself, working as vascular surgery at the Central Hospital of Yaundé.
He created a non-governmental humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which takes place in rural areas during the weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his voluntary group have helped about 32.000 people.
Almost all sales, with a thirty-first people, are shocked in forgonnets after they have established the medical material on the roof and crossing difficult lands to become in villages who have the most need for help.
The chance is not always following them.
They were able to push vehicles to cross rivers or swimming tracks.
But when they arrive, they are received in heroes: the community organizes a celebration, song and dance and offers them the best available accommodations.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bwelle – with its great dream and outstanding energy – is more pleased to join to the festivals.
On the next morning, the team started receiving hundreds of patients.
“We receive 500 visits,” said Mr. Bwelle.
They sometimes live at 60 km from the village, and they come to foot.
In this hospital, various health cares are produced.
Many people receive treatment against poverty, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmissible diseases.
Others may receive sweets, a couple of lunets collected or a free birth certificate – the necessary document to go to school, but many poor families can not simply make it possible to buy it.
Tonight, the practical team of simple surgery acts under local anesthesia.
Operations are generally practiced in a school, a mature or a house; after the intervention, the patient is up and returned to the wave room to leave his place to the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the electric group, the operation room and the sterilization of the material, Dr. Bwelle and its volunteers work until the first hours of Sunday morning.
It's a surprising rythm, but village musicians generally help the team to remain motivated.
“They thrown around the night to keep us wake up so that we can continue to work,” explained Mr. Bwelle.
Sunday, the team returns to town, fatigue but proud of the work she did.
The group, composed of physicians and physician students, practiced 700 surgery freely during the last year, and knows that their presence can make all the differences for those with whom they are helping.
One man explained that the free operation he had been carried out to treat a hernie would allow him to work again.
"This will change my future and my family's future," said the man.
In addition to living in this indoor hospital and working as a hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works the night in private medical offices around Yaoundé.
This is the second job, it explains, which finances to 60% of its association; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I don't know when it's there," said Katie O'Malley, a doctor student in the second year of the University of Drexel in Philadelphia, and volunteered in the group of Dr. Bwelle.
It's always in the hospital or in trying to find money for its association to be able to conduct these campaigns.
For physician students and nursing students like Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions, is an opportunity to learn on the ground that they have not home.
“We could have been involved in operations to help put the blood or pass the instruments to Dr. Bwelle” explained Ms. O'Malley.
It's not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are a doctor in the second year.
Voluntary students generally pay their travel to Cameroun, and often arrive with collected medical material.
But once in Yaoundé, their pension, their transport and education are supported by Dr. Bwelle.
"He's a hero, there's no doubt," said Katie O'Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Camrounian people is not close to extermination.
For Dr. Bwelle, relatively constant workload is not a difficulty.
Help others to live happy by holding the promise he made to his father is something that gives him a great joy.
“I am so happy when I do this work,” added Mr. Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he's seeing what I'm doing.
Make people rise and stressing pain are the reasons why I can do this.

The two France of Peter Nora
Perplexes, universities have long painted to define and place Peter Nora.
Professor in amphitheatres and course rooms?
Nevertheless, but by urging his weak for the cross roads, Sciences-Po, the High Educations.
Arbit other works in the Gaston-Gallimard Street office?
Indeed, but ignoring the hidden work and the subterranean writing of the editor.
Heritage of the slaughter that Occupies Source at the French Academy?
Of course still, but as a sacred one could not replace the true oil, the thesis, which happened.
They have recognized in him a great swimming, animator and federal supervisor of their work, but noting that it was little slight to produce himself.
Incertainly, the monument of the "Memory Places" to which he attached his name also contributed.
The wicked languages could see a big market on the pockets, presented by an intelligent commenter, with a fif shock of edition, but uncertainly dilecting.
The two books published by Nora Soon two years have already found that the one who passed to not write had much and well written.
The book that this is to make him ultimately justice.
However, once again, the temptation of skill, the intellectual vagabondment, the jubilation used to save as joint feet from one to another.
But rapidly it is understood that the disappeared objects assembled in this book to so beautiful title bring the brocaner to a single and the same passion: the discovering the constitutional nodo of French identity.
Why these dramatic calls to national unity?
Identity: It's a time concern.
Here, we were collectively invited to give a definition.
But in the perpetual spirit of our value leaders, the French identity was an intemporary essence.
The case was obliged to deploy accidents, and the case, jacobinism obliged, was granted to the prefects and sub-precedents, authorised interpretations.
Those who take Peter Nora is everything else.
It is not a heritage of everlasting frankness, it rejects the definition.
Analyst worried about a family strangety, it is wrong in a symbol forest, arrested at each step by an object in a rebuilding form, tormented of irritating questions.
Does this, who is born by the company itself: why, in a so sustainably installed country in its borders, if old charpent and solidly maconed, do these dramatic calls to the unity?
They're not so pressing, Peter Nora suggests that to conjugate the native problem of French history discords.
Francs and Gaulois, Armangnacs and Bourguignons, Catholics and Protestants: Division forces, here, are very old.
And of course the most embryotic is of course that ends in two the national history.
From Revolution, the French people have two stories and have two nations, one monarchic, the other revolutionary.
The second desired the death of the first, but without reaching the nest; worried in the contrary to find sacrality and so more slightly of unity and indivisibility that she had cut the head to him that was the obvious and powerful incarnation.
And from there, a widespread binary nation, shared between the left and the right, layness and Catholicism, worship and hate of the revolution.
To feel this uniqueness of French identity, nothing is the four steps out of Hexagon, but the American escaped Peter Nora could be the heart of his book.
Because America and France have a revolution, issued a declaration of rights, wanted to establish a new society.
But the American cousinship makes it just better to emphasize what we're own.
There, men who left their Old Regime in England and had no longer been worried about it.
Here, men composed of an Ancient Indigenous Regime, and so more radical.
There is a consensual revolution when she seed the dragon and trusted him here.
There's always honored founder fathers, and here's the former revolutionarys whose templates are deceived to make models, and the rest remains inter-stituted.
There is an institutional consistence, and here is a box of constitutions, such as errors to ratify and try to recur.
France that's gone, France that comes
However, there was a time in which the French people believed to be able to shut up the wheat of their history, and to win the maldiction of the two numbers.
To this III Republic, central and creator, Peter Nora showed much interest and even tenderness: welcome those who were then employed to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching the students everything in the former France was so darkly preparing the modern France and proposing a unique version of their history.
But this peaceful identity had only a time.
This is again discussed by immigration of a new type, threatened by the increase of revolutionary minorities, absorbted in the European space.
The book therefore offers both the fascinating French port that goes and the surrounding of France that comes.
With, first, the portrait of the historical, which should reserve some surprises.
We find out that the road was a household.
The man of multiple interests turned, slightly obsessionally, around the same idea.
The reader was at the center of the center.
And whoever had put, this is more than a half-century, a subject on the idea of the nation, but was underlined to the initiative of the thesis, trusts us, how great it was out, that he would end up.
Some in a less root form, more eclated and subtitled.
But we're not wrong with it, but too binding.
Because even more than the figure imposed by the university cursus, this thesis says the internal need for life.
An old man in Lebanon: "Return is sufficiently complex to manage"
In Beyrouth on 8 March 1986 with three members of his "Antina 2" team came to film a demonstration of Hezbollah, the journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released near 21 months later on November 27, 1987.
Since 2008, he participated in the establishment of the World Days Defence Association, which he has been presiding for several years.
Its main objective: obtaining the possibility of complaints and bringing their opposers to the International Criminal Court.
More than 1,000 days, the four decades of Aqmi (Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Feret were released march.
After medical examinations at the military hospital of the Val-de-Grice after midday, they have been able to restore their families since.
And try, a little, to get back to their course of life.
"The New Observator" questioned Jean-Louis Normandin, 62 years old, former major reporter, retreatment since 2008, President of the World’s Days.
From the evening of your release, you were on the plateau of "Antinne 2" at 20.00 p.m.
What are your memories of your release today?
In particular, in Beyrouth.
When I'm free, I'm in the cover of a car where I meet - without seeing him because he makes dark - Roger Auke.
He said to me, "We're released," but I'm not sure, and I'm saying that we can still be killed.
We're very excited, but too tendencies.
It's war, and those leading us are also very tender.
They're putting us on the board of a throat.
There are Syrian militarys.
Then we arrive on the Summerland Hotel site where the press is presented.
Francens bring us to the embassy of France.
It's the first time of filling to parents, family, friends, presses...
I remember I took a bathroom for an hour.
And dinner in t-shirt at the ambassade of France.
I also remember a short night to discuss Roger and Martini.
The tension is still there because we have no means to evacuate us to the Larnaca Airport in Cyprus.
Getting there in helicopter, we take a private aircraft that brings us to France via Corfou and Solanzara, where Pasqua is shipping.
How did your arrival run on the French ground?
We're shooting to Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's a little brutal.
There's an incredible bossulade.
And many media.
When I went, there were three TV chains.
I'll go back and it's full.
The decline of the planet of the aircraft, the shoes with my son and my parents, my friends, all this is extremely strong in emotion.
Among the airport with me, many motors follow our car that Roussin drives.
The motards shooted the shooting to make photos and follow me home where I have to make the police a little to prevent some of them to get up.
The mediat pressure is great.
It's not stopping. We're good to know...
But the state of emotional and fatigue is so hard to see it clear.
We're out of a garbage and we're cut down under the median fires.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, enough complex to manage.
But we did the hardest.
The evening itself, I'm at 20:00, I'm also at the TV next morning.
Then starts a kind of readaptation to life, very quietly, for one or two months, which are a little like holidays.
How were medical reviews and debriefing of DGSE occurred?
I had the right to first medical control in Corse.
The rest was done in the Val-de-Grice in the following days my return: radios, reviews in all kinds and meet a psychiatrist.
It is not a meeting that makes everything but we know that we can account on him, remember him if necessary, that we are not delivered to us.
It is part of the procedure.
I also met the information services.
They asked me questions about the winners.
That was logical.
That didn't hurt me.
How do you react today to the release of the four otages of the Niger?
I'm listening to what it says.
The debate on punishment, in particular.
Some things are worried about me, and others are less.
I'm trying to do the part of the matters of my past as an hotage and my president's chat of the "World Days" Association that allows me to get away, and I seem much more interesting to do.
I ask for example about the definition of resilience.
At the same time, I fight with others for the recognition of the legal status of the opposition.
I think there is a semantic problem.
It must be qualified to take “political” oppositions - which is the most time - and allow the oppositions to have access to justice, to complain and to bring their opposers to the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and is joyful of the liberation of these edges.
But who said that these oppositions may also have access to justice?
A court in La Haye is done for this.
Why wouldn't you say to the pregnants of opposition "You have cut the war rules, like those of all Geneva Conventions, we're going to bring you to justice?"
But it seems to me to be found, legitimate, shocked with good sense.
This message is heard, but not listening, and that's my shame.
It's my main fight.
Egyptian Islamics on the street to condemn Morsi's proceedings
The angry found on the ranks of Egyptian Islamics.
Two days before the opening of the procedure of President Mohamed Morsi, they went down in the streets.
Mobilization in the whole Egypt to claim the reconstruction of the first democraticly elected President of the country.
This is not a proceed to emphasize this warrior of Muslim Brothers.
Until the lawyer couldn't meet him and no volunteer could take a copy of the documents of the case.
This isn't a case, it's a bitch.
The procedure of President Morsi is a false prosecution, which is to be judged by Sisi, not on the other hand.
Morsi must judge Sisi for Rabaa's masturbation, Nada's massacres, and the massacre of the Republican Garden.
He's a mentor and a trailer.
In Alexandria, the police used lacrymogen gas, 60 manifestants were arrested.
Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed before the Caire Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be judged.
Hagel reiterates 9 American States to violate homosexual rights
Since the Federal State recognised homosexual marriage, "to all military partners have the right to a identification card of the Defence Department and the benefits that come with", he recalled the Minister in New York in an allocation to the Anti-Defamation League of Combating Anti-Defence.
"But some States refuse to deliver these cards to the same sex partners in the installations of the National Garden" which were set on their territory, it argued that those States would violate the federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from many social or health services provided on these basis, or access to their shopping.
The secretariat to the Defence has ordered the head of the National Garden, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the Federal Law.
The fraud of nine States started by Texas which refused to implement these benefits on the installations of the Texas National Garden, due to a conflict between the Texas law and the Federal Law on homosexual marriage.
He was joined in his refusal by India, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Caroline and Western Virginia, according to a high responsibility of the Defence.
Pentagon estimates the population concerned by the recognition of homosexual marriage to about 5600 active persons, including the National Garden, the Reserve and Retreatment.

Don't really lie us.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djemoune, his founder, the "Part of the Banlieue" is not only addressed to the banlieusards.
I chose a map from France as logo, justify it.
When I talk about bathroom, I'm addressing all those who are excluded from the great national family.
He does not prevent his project, presented on Thursday press conference in his national Community of Aubervilians, from the will of better defending multiculturalism, this great medium cultural pound that characterizes before all the districts.
My proposal No 1 is to create a ministerial of Multiculturalism, it indicates.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50 years old, territorially attached, is now returned as "100% political" even if it has not always been neutral.
By 2002 on the side of Jean-Pierre Chevenment, he later supported locally Dominica de Villepine between 2010 and 2011.
I know well that the equality values I do in my program are cut on the left, but if the right people are ready to support me, I will also listen to them.

It remains to find candidates to form lists and defend their ideas on the political scene."For the 2014 municipal elections, it may be just, he recognises."
It's a problem of time and money.
The Bathing Party should even be represented in Aubervilians through my candidate and I hope also in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Dhermoune has seven list heads in France metrópolitan and Martinic.
"And the support mails I received from last not all bathrooms," he welcomed.

I assure you that innocent persons will not be victims of abuses within this process.

He added: "We live in a new world where people are ready to save themselves."
There is a radical extent in the world that is determined to try to kill people, to explose and attack governments.
And if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We've been beautiful and well prevented shooting aircrafts, buildings to explose and people to be murdered because we've been able to know about facts in advance.
