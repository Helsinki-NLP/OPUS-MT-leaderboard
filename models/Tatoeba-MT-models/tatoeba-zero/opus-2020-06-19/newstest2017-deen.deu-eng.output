Jennifer Anistones: I'm always shooted in shoes
Jennifer Aniston must not always be perfect or successful.
This has made the Hollywood Star clearly in an interview now.
"I'll always be shooted in shooters, or beat from external labels, which are mostly little to do with me and the reality."
"I have no desire to always be perfect and successful."
"Really say, these things are worse to me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only smile that she applies as "Miss Perfect" as she is declared in the current "cosmopolitan".
The most likely the shoes cut their time home, forming television with locker dust and mexican food, namely in the magazine.
To the white glut she asked the child's desire, "We don't have to be married or have children to be perfect," says the Hollywood Star.
In their new film "Mother's Day - Love is no child game" Aniston is to see a single mother of two sons.
The film runs with us from August 25.
Golfer Langer receives sport pyramid
His experiences on the horse are overviewable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues were looking for a little disappearing in the beach.
For 58 years, it was a premier.
CHIO: "Goldene sport pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses recalled their feier, and they gathered at the fast gallery home to the food trails.
One kilometer at this time, I've been afraid.
"It wasn't a good experience," says Langer.
And that's why the reit carriage ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfers were all times - 101 Tourisms - again near horses.
He and his family led himself to the ALRV installation, to a horse he wasn't weaked to shoot.
Longer was the first time in Aachen and also at the CHIO.
The reason was convinced.
The German sports aid delivered the man from home in a small gallery the goldene sport pyramid.
Unless the sympathical sporter is unlike the signs.
Federal Service Cross, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has joined him.
The 18th prices of the sport pyramid are long.
In Aachen, he met the first priceholder Hans Days Winkler on Saturday.
"This marking means much of me," says Langer, "if it will be forgiven not only for sportive success but also for social commitments."
For decades, Langer has promoted the education.
And so he also gave the price payment of EUR 25,000.
Another 15 wonderful sporting students was included on Saturday on the "Hall of Fame of German Sports".
The magnificents of Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, Turner Eberhard Gienger, Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-Fahrer Myhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the priest Alwin Schokemöhle and the posthum of the handballer Erhard wonderfully.
Many of these sports members came to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustration society moved to the spring stadium where the Lavazza price was gone.
Bernhard Langer was a distance to the great animals.
Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy in comparison: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - that wants both Clinton and Trump.
However, one of the two US Chairpersons is the tax and energy policy and a principle question.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a basic, more philosophical difference.
That's about the role of the State.
Trump wants to keep the people in doubt more smaller and warns how the State of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and to regulate death, he says.
However, he would be very different, said Trump.
He will raise regulations massively, and makes himself for a wide tax reform with lower tax rates - for privates and for businesses.
Clinton, however, says: The State has to fulfill certain tasks, he has an opportunity to open and needs money.
That is why the taxes for the rich would be increased, says they.
Interestingly, both are very close to the theme infrastructure.
In which you should be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost anything.
The democratic applicant announces the greatest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policy and are strictly rejected by the state critical Teaparty flags of the Republicns.
Thus, on Trump, there could be even part-party discussions.
People are the differences in the energy and climate policy.
Trump wants to build coal powers and restore carbon production in the United States.
Oil promotion is also to be possible in protected areas that would like to announce the Paris climate protection agreement.
Clinton, however, wants to develop the renewable energy with its investment programme and calls for: "A country will be the super power of cleaner energy and create millions of jobs."
"It's probably gonna be China, Germany or America - I want us to be."
However, not only in the infrastructure, but also in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not far away from each other.
TPP, the transpacify trade agreement, does not want to sign both.
At the same time, the United States will not isolate the international trade, but only protect American jobs better.
Then they should be better paid, about Clinton.
The current minimum loan of 7.25 US Dollar is a huge loan.
He wants to increase $15 per hour.
What Trump wants to do in this question is not very clear: once he says: The minimum lounge must be slow, then he says that he should not be changed.
However, the broad debate of the next months should be better to develop the tax policy of the two loans.
On the one side, the trumpet is which wants to decide the economy and the citizens to cultivate growth.
His critics have to keep him so that the budget deficit would be greater.
On the other hand, Clinton is the one who, at least, wants the riches to pay more taxes, and whose critics say: more taxes are not the solution.
Fire: "Ever flighted woman has experiences with sexual violence."
Sexual violence belongs to women who flee only, almost every day.
If they arrive in Germany, they are often traumated.
A house offers refugees.
There are four women in a large kitchen.
Everyone has a baby that is up to one year.
One put her little son into the arm.
He's incredible with great eyes in the room.
His mother is on the table plate.
Until she notices she's watched.
She's laughing short and kiss the little ones.
The scene works normally.
Before you talk to Katrin Bahr.
It is a field business manager of Condrobs, a firm for social aid offers in Bayern, and is employed with the subject of women on the fleet.
The four women in the kitchen are flights.
They live in the Middle North in one of the few decental accommodations for single-free women and their children in Bayern.
In January Condrobs, the establishment was held together with Pro Familia and the Muncher Women's aid.
Until long, she was officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There is no men - not even as visitors.
The exception is a watchman before the door.
"It's not over to say: Each woman who comes here has made experiences with sexual violence,” says Bahr.
"Mans run for wars because they are politically persecuted because they are threatened by torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe."
Other reasons for the fleet are overwhelmed by women: "Those are shooted in the home because they do not see any other way."
In their homes, they have experienced sexual violence, pregnancy, honor, slavery or pregnancy prostitution.
That's what she's going on.
It's on the flight.
"The slapper, for example, requires sexual action for a slaughter water, is not rare," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they will not be protected by their families.
Who believes that it ended when they come into Germany, it's irreversible, Barr.
The only women in refugee accommodations would often be considered less valued and the worst infringement.
This results that some 90 percent of women who live in the northern municipality are traumatized.
" Some of the children have not certainly been voluntary."
Many women are so common that they say nothing.
"or they don't believe to speak openly about the experience, because the shame is too big."
Since she is often not aware of helping, there is only more accommodation for her, she demands barr.
In Bayern the seven district governments are responsible for the submission of refugees.
The question of whether they are aware of a similar project as in Munich in their responsibilities, some respond to No.
There is no way in governments' accommodation in the top palms and overfranks.
In Schwaben, only refugeed women are not subjected to separate, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, the Government's speaker.
In top bathrooms, under- and medium-sized hospitals, there are Stockworks or own houses for single women and their children.
The exemption is the Netherlands, there are two central accommodations only for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women separated from men.
In a study published for the Committee, it says: "It is very important that men and women be hidden separately."
"If the privacy is wrong, or men and women will join, it may be too - continuing - violence against women."
In particular, the wash spaces should be separated and easily available for women are available in the study.
How much the women are doing this protection needs, you can be given on the Andrang that it is on the house in Munich.
"When we talked about it, we have a long warningist," says Bahr.
It's easy to draw up a second house.
Assistant physicians: Requirements after new work camps
The representatives of the Assistant Assistances have called on their work to appoint new working combats in their strictness with regard to a new treaty.
The Juneor Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) requested its entire Council to authorize more work-up measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC stated that it would have been the Minister to deal with the concerns regarding the Treaty.
Assistant doctors and medical students agreed in July on the rejection of a treaty agreed with the BMA.
He was rejected from 58% of his members who voted at the elections.
In a letter to the members who were published on Twitter on Thursday, the President of JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government would be "speakly" to problems, which resulted in the rejection of the treaty.
She said: "In view of this, the JDC has agreed to completely suspend the proposed new treaty and request official negotiations on all of your concerns."
As a response to the Government's slaughter, the JDC Administration has today made a formal request to a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to authorize a current programme of scaling working combats that starts early September.
The strictness resulted in the six times that the assistant physicians were stricted this year, the first total accidents in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA assistant doctor Dr. Johann Malawana returned after the election to reject the treaty conditions recommended by the BMA.
He shared the members of BMA during the meetings still held by 54.000 assistants and medical students before the vote, with a view that the treaty should be benefited and accepted.
After the vote, the Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the Treaty on Medicines would be introduced in England.
Russia and Turkey: "A Aliance of Foreign Seaers?"
It was a spirit that ended a crisis.
The Russian leaders and Turkey were meeting on Tuesday to give their hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight months a long-term war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish opposers in the rewarded hall of St. Petersburger Palasts, I can't imagine that Ankara wants mostly to condemn this condemnation.
There was the shooting, yeah.
But Putin's laugh worked smellly and he shocked little warmness, even for his remaining situation.
Recep Tayip Erdogan, however, repeatedly spoke of his " loved friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.
I couldn't tell it anymore.
He also promised that the relationship with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but also improved.
On the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would be called as if it would never happen anymore.
I think his exhusiasmus is more likely to declare the opposite.
But one of Putin's extraordinary, sustainable kits showed that the head of the State had nothing forgotten.
Moreover, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductions: the cutting of a Russian fighting instrument on the Syrian border through Turkey.
Mocaus reaction at the time was burned.
Putin divide and accused Ankara to be cut into the back.
The conduct was even greater, since it began from a pleasant friend.
Reconstruction of the vetration will be difficult if not even possible.
The public opinion in Russia has turned into place since November.
For months, stately controlled media have caused a strong, unlimited attack on Ankara.
On one occasion, it seemed like the Turks would take the blame for everything.
Most seriously, the accused of leaders were that Erdogan’s own family had benefited from the illegal oil trade in Syrian areas that were controlled by the Islamic State.
He's struggling this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting was only because Putin received the apologize he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia could win a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a weapon stand are clearly on the hand.
However, first-line, all the friends he can get after his last month in a deceived state status almost take place.
Repeat terrorist attacks against Turkey have also shocked him.
But there are also economic motivations.
Russian sanctions have taken the Turkey hard - in particular the prohibition of charter flights that usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coasts each year.
The number has decreased about 90%.
In Russia, travel events and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are recovered.
They are counting on a late seasonal shift to the Mediterranean.
This week prognosed the State obtaining more fruit and vegetables when the Turkish agricultural imports were re-accepted.
A report in Vedemosti formulated as follows: "Tourists there long, tomates here long."
But the visit had a additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry on the western, since it considers its reaction to the tried power overcome as a weak answer.
The continuing crowd of the EU-accession negotiations and Putin, which is intended to take advantage of the cold stimulation and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West.
The Russian Head of State wins in Ankara with security a bonus for requesting support for the chosen State bodies.
This is a self-consciousness for Moscow, which has a deep fear of regime changes.
The meeting in this glass palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey, one of the way I was described an analytics, "Aliance of Foreign Seaers": two countries who disappeared from the western and treated badly, and now lifted themselves.
However, despite public condemnation, there are still large differences between the two.
The largest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently provided the role as a peaceful offender, but where Russia and Turkey supported contractual sides.
It could be noted that after almost three hours on the first debate, both Presidents had taken a comment on the press conference that they hadn't ever discussed the topic.
The President of Turkey avoided responding to a question on its differences while Putin decided to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common namer to Syria can be found.
But after months of open enemy - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster than the NATO member of Turkey has taken the Russian fight - it is certainly better that the two heads of State speak at least with each other.
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Skotlands no longer available
Marke RBS is intended to be reduced by the head of the bank only to a backoffice role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will not be available for customers outside Skotlands.
Ross McEwan shared the BBC Scotland that the Marke RBS was linked to the global areas of the bank.
The bank has been distanced since it was almost collected and saved for eight years.
In this time, RBS brands have used to protect other final consumer financing brands.
She supported the international sport with millions of pounds at Sponsoring, from six United Nations Rugby to Wimbledon Sieger Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to turn more national brands into the focus.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be available only for customers in Scotland but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentral headquarters and the Börsennotification to NatWest will be changed.
Marke Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for private business that will be more important - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan has been interviewed during a observing chair of customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He shared the BBC Scotland with: "The brand RSB will be to our investor brands and to the brand where our employees will be employed, as we now become more to a bank of brands."
As the bank was only to a global market, RBS became the global market.
I now say that we are not global targets, but the local goals.
Each of these brands will be in their own communities for something perfectly different, and our employees will work with the customers.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sixth United Nations sponsoring and that it will increase the reliability of the various brands in its sports sponsoring.
"It is time for us to develop to the bank of the brands, because how do we focus on the internal (which asked) to make this to a better bank for customers?" said the chief.
It would have been very zynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have started these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think, you will see many changes.
We can start these brands again, so I think the time is coming.
Frankie Dettor reached his 3.000 winners at Newmarket
Dettori speaks of Champagner after a double at Newmarket that brings him 3.000 wins
The Jockey Frankie Dettor saved his 3.000 British wins at Newmarket on Friday.
He placed on Predilection trained by John Gosden on his local renards with his second winning night a milestone.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth Jockey, which reaches the milk stone in the floor.
He followed Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-year-old victor, who wins on Ghayyar, said, "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family's here too.
I am very happy that it happened to Newmarket because I've been here 30 years ago.
It's not a great meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal freeday end with 20,000 people.
I'm easy and very discreet.
Dettori takes the jubel when he gets the victory on prediction
Two jockeys have reached the milestones in the hill - Jockey Richard Johnson and the 20-year-old winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who reached over 4,300 seats in a recruiting career.
Lester Piggott, who had a nine-year-by-by-earth carriage of 4.493
Frankie is one of the best jockey of moderns and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that has just reached little before him.
He has style and is strong, but it's his tactical intellectual, which differs him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic messenger for rents, his exhusiasmus and Charisma has been intriguing fans for these sports for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he had helped 6000 wins if he wasn't only a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie has been in GB almost 30 years of winners, which is great.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British journey, but also he is an incredible jokey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical flying dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettor has been the escape of the British Flachreens for two decades.
It was nervous.
A whole series of great tournament winners, including his famous "Glorreichen Seven", in Ascot 1996, but he also survived a aircraft abuse and received a drug ban.
three years ago, he had difficulties when he returned from his six-month sperre, but he showed a impressive characteristic strength to fill his dubbles and return to his best form.
And he hasn't yet been on the end - Dettor has previously said that he wants to continue with competitions to at least 50th year of life.
Russias Putin Stab Chef Sergei Ivanov
The Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly left his head of office Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of the most closest confidence circle of Putin for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed to the Special Officer for Environment and Transport Affairs.
In an opinion of the Kreml, Putin has not indicated reasons "the release of Ivanovs from its obligations as Chairman of the Russian Presidency".
Anton Vaino, who was the president of Ivanov since 2012, was appointed to his follower.
Mono, 44, is former diplomat.
1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he finished the named State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the message in Tokyo.
On the website of the Kreml, it is (the Russian) that he was later Head of the Government staff.
For his name he said to Putin: "Thank for your trust."
I think it is the most important task of the Government to support your activities as the Head of State on legislation designs and controls for the implementation of your instructions.
Putin shared the Russian TV sender on Friday that Ivanov had requested to leave his posts and recommended Vaino as his follower.
Are the crazy faces convinced?
This step has made a secret place in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was one of the most closely trusted Vladimir Putins and works as he worked for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.
He was one of the most powerful men of the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was extracted in the television, both men stated that the head of the stakeholder returned to his own desire.
But despite the laugh for the cameras, only few of them are convinced here - especially now, short before the Parliament's choice.
So this is the consequence of a kind of power fight?
Nobody knows that now.
But the official statement - that a man who was first as a potential president would want to lead to Russian environmental policy - is on a large skepsi.
In his comments on Putin, which is sent on the website of the Kreml, Ivanov said "It's true that I prayed you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to trust me these very complex posts - you could say nearly - for four years.
As it is clear, I am the President of the Russian Presidency for four years and eight months.
Ivanov adopted the posts in December 2011.
Before he was the Defence Minister and Defence Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and like Putin's wives member of the State Security Service KGB.
In the late 1990s, as Putin President of the Federal Security Service (FSB) who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his representative.
As a putin to the power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he mostly trusted.
First, Ivanov was accepted that after Putin's second official period could be President of Russia, since a third official period of Putin would have disfellowshipped against the Constitution.
But these posts were taken by another close friend Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became President before he was returned to the President for three and a half years.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson shooted after producers
Gibson was involved last month in a physical interview at the seat of the series in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced its advertising in a common opinion.
Gibson, who played the Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, regretted himself on Thursday before announcing his proclamation.
In the Set, it came to artistic differences and an opinion variety.
I blend the incident," he said in a communication.
Details of how the Character Gibson is described from the series, which follows a FBI team, will be published in accordance with the opinion of the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old-child played in the Setcom Dharma & Greg has been with it since the first stage of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and I had the last twenty-five years my whole heart blow in the sight," said Gibson in a communication published on Friday.
I hoped to be on the end, but that's not possible now.
I would simply like to thank the authors, producers, players, our wonderful crowd and especially the best fans you can want for a series.
The planned extraction of the twelve stake is set on 28 September.
Racing for fish in gardens in Banff
A population of Banff requested for the identification of fishing aid in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that it could be the 75 fish on the sandale that were cut off by a spring brown.
Mr Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published a video of the spectacle in Periscope in the hope that someone could cut some light on the appearance of the two dull fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to fife
The £ 1,35 billion tea project will be completed until May 2017
Ingenieries have linked the north-deck of Queensferry Crossing with the Viadukt - which means that the bridge is now connected to fife.
It's the first of four closures of the "deck planes" which close to each of the three doors of the bridge.
The pump part of fife is now 600 meters long and grows 30,000 tonnes.
It has more than 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of beton and 46 sleeves.
The £ 1,35 billion tea project will be completed until May 2017.
Keith Brown, Minister of Economy, was a visit from the building today and was one of the first ones from the country to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a really epical measure in this project with over 30,000 ton Beton and Steel, which were used only for this part of the bridges.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the Viadut and the bridge end is a heavy activity that requires extreme tolerances for the path.
Overall, almost 79 % of the whole bridge ends on their place and the last section of the box today in Rosyth is a part of the box, which means that the whole box is ready to get up on the bridges on its place.
Michael Martin, project leader of Forth Crossing Bridge Construtors said: "The first end is a significant milestone in each bridge project.
In this fantastic project the closure represents high- and deep construction.
After the installation of the last road deck section and its connection with the northern Turmdeck located in the construction, we had to close the still existing clouds on the north or country side.
This has been reached through the seats of the northern bridges at the south of 700 billion.
This was a massive and simultaneous activity.
Massive, since the Viadut is 222 meters long, about 6.000 tonnes and must be taken up to the top by about 3%.
Hekel, since the tolerances on which the team worked, were changing - on each side they strike just a few billion meters.
Happyly, everything is very good.
Reservation in the Moelfre Bay: Three men have "Third to be alive"
Three men have "speaked to be alive," after they were cast by their fisher boat before England.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station took place on Friday at 13:20 BST alarm after a crowd observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulties to shine in safe while their ship continued out of their own power.
"We saw the boat turned around and put us the worst place," said the chief of Moelfre Vince Jones' Reservation station.
"Nevertheless, the strong winds have shocked the ship out of their sky, until we leave to water," he added.
Two of the men were saved by a local fisherman boat while the third man was shocked in the age of 60 and was found on a good shock without saving west.
They all arrived at the board of the coastal boat and were taken back to the rescue station.
Mr Jones said, "The three men who were cast into the water have been unfortunately and still lived.
The boat engine had an emergency board, but it was resolved at the ships of the man who controlled the ship.
Somebody has waited about these men today.
Strong - Man stands on his ex-Family
A man has attacked his former friend in Hamburg-Harbourg with a shock and hard hurt.
As the police reported yesterday, the 50-year-old boys had received the key to the apartment to take his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholized murders disappear the clothing of his former friend.
When that came to the apartment, he went into her twice.
The 44-year-old kids were injured in the hand and in the body.
The police could arrest the murder.
While the 50-year-olds destroyed the clothing of his former friend, he called his mother.
This warned her sister.
With their lives dangers, the 45-year-old boys wanted to calm their brother.
But she couldn't move him to leave the apartment.
That's why she went out of the house with her lives.
On the street, they met the man's ex-life maritime.
When the two women retraced the apartment again, the 50-year-old sister took his sister on the side and took his ex-amid.
Who builds swimming apartments?
I think the SPD and Green: the investors must be taken in the future much more.
How do we react to the bad news that swimming in the next few years will lose almost 1300 good apartments?
The SPD proposes a "concept of relief" at the next Council meeting.
But the strict is programmed.
First of all, the question is: Who will actually build the favorite apartments?
There's no arrangement.
SPD Chairman Christoph Bratmann said: "We are joined with the green: Who wants to build on urban areas must present 20% of all apartments as social housing in the future."
However, the favorite apartments may also be in stock.
However, the large point of struggle in the Council is, Bratmann says, "What is going to be transformed with investors who want to build on private areas?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 per cent in such areas, but it may be 20 per cent of the apartments as social housing."
A new urban housing support programme, which is cost-building and financing for millions, is intended to ensure encouragement.
The problem is, so Bratmann: "These are still no agreement between the groups."
The CDU wants to make the investors a few rules as possible.
The left wants to be worse for investors.
In spite of this, Bratmann said, the situation is strengthened in the apartment market.
If the action approach is implemented, it shall be ensured for additional tasks in the construction management.
More staff is needed.
It's not clear if we'll get the experts.
However, the program is not available: for about 1260 new apartments should be built without any other.
But how does it compare the loss of about 1300 favourable apartments whose promotion will be made in the next years?
Only until 2020 will be 500 apartments.
To prevent this, the planning policy speaker Nicole Palm should now be purchased out of the city.
Moreover, it should be considered to get apartments back to the price connection.
This is possible in Western city.
On a shock, the problem resolved.
Because in the Western city, it's going to be the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be taken back in the price connection for pleasant apartments.
Only: This does not want the owners, the housing companies.
Because the number of social housing in the Western city will be drastly increased, and it will be removed from the objective of the so-called processing.
A concentration of social weakness in only few cities should not be given.
The green claims that it will still be moved in the debate.
The President of the Group Holger Herlitschke says, "For a wide majority, the CDD must be in the boat."
It has focused on more buildings for individual homes.
But what does not mean that it is not yet possible to find a compromise.
Pokemon Go, a Jagd for Health and Happiness, who rejoice
It's fascinating to see how the world changes.
That teenage and kids do not go out of games, but is more likely to take their free time to shoot on screens in the last decade of many.
In Pokemon Go, it is about to take people from Sofa and become more active.
The time on the screen was initially on the television, then on video games and finally restricted on smartphones.
It is therefore nice to see that technology and activities are not excluding mutually.
I think of the Pokemon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that first were created for video games in the 1990s (which later occurred a character trick series, game cards and other spin opens).
As many popular phenomenons, the interest in publishing the game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand starts July.
The marketing in other countries was moved by the mass demand that the server was overlooked.
In the meantime, Pokémon Go had more users than tender and almost so much as Twitter.
How does it work?
Shortly said the players are walking out with their smartphones and searching for pokemons that are followed with a GPS and when they are found once, "fotographed" (for a screenshot on the phone) or "arried" can be taken.
A generation that played the game when she was younger, closed the shock and spotted for the search of the Sofa.
In the United States, the game led to a significant increase in steps that returns the "medial" person every day.
Cardiogram, a app for Apple Watch, which follows 35,000 users, recently shared Washington Post that within two days after marketing the game, the number of people who are following training each day from 45% to 53%.
The company does not know who's playing Pokemon Go - it only looks like the Roh data to increase performance.
Many public declaration campaigns for health that people want to "to take 30 minutes" and "come to be active" and "days to be active" are focused on babies ears, because many public news are disabled for health and from people who are quiet.
However, the importance of sports cannot be exceeded.
Who regularly takes sports reduces his opportunities to cure cancer or depression.
Physical confirmation helps the weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of advantages that are too long to take them here.
But the wonderful of Pokemon Go is that it brings people to do something free to make them fun.
So three pillars of health will be discovered - movement, fresh air and sun appearance, and fun.
Some people close even new friendships on the jagd.
As always, there are more more players who have to be disappointed about something.
And yes, somebody could walk against a door.
What's going on?
It's been a break.
Even though Smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to follow our activities previously, they gave us no reason to drive sports as it does this game.
The new will lose his journey and leave the use with time.
However, the success of Pokemons will be given more games, which will combine apps and virtual reality with active competitors in the real world, and that helps many people in the jagd, to be more active, fair and sinner.

Simone Biles creates gold in the dump
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hip.
Simone Biles is on all the immune.
Dynamically on the floor.
Unfortunately on the balcony.
Food on the ground.
On the whole line, brilliant.
And now finally also Olympiasi.
The 19-year-old American tournerin took place on Thursday to the multi-scale title and increased the lake between himself and the rest of the world before all the eyes under the Olympic Games.
Its total result of 62.198 was clearly before the Silver Medailler winners and the "Final Five" Managing Room Aly Raisman and the Russian Bronze Medailler winner Aliya Mustafin.
The Americans Simone Biles turns to the Swiss bar during the individual swimming pool of women in the art tour at the Olympic summer games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth theerosexuel American who wins a multi-floor combat title and totally sets her call to be the best of her generation or even even.
She showed her final results and found her long journey at this moment.
This success is in the same liga as unique athletes as Michael Phelps who brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated their sport type, 15 world medailles - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing practices that make a mixing of honor and precision that the Olympicsman of 1984 Mary Lou Retton told her that she "the best tourner that I ever saw."
She expected a last test in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between the Biles and the rest of the athletes, but much more between her and a late overdimensional expectations.
Not with a handful gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be seen as an enthusiasm.
The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman, after they win each gold and silver in the individual meal campfinal of women at the Olympic summer games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, 2016
Biles took the first medaille on Tuesday, while she served on the appointment feast, Martha Karolyi, in peaceful state coordinator.
Although Biles was there, while their long way towards the spots, never planned the future, it is not really true.
A part of their landworks, which contain their typical tumbling pass, is agreed on Latin America's music, which would be at home on the road outside the Olympiaarena in Rio.
That's not a accident.
This girl who was adopted as a little child by her grandma and found by Trainerin Aimee Boorman's mother during a school flight in the Tower Hall, in Boorman, was trained to be forced.
She has no longer lost competitive competition since summer 2013, a victory that will be stopped as long as Bales wants.
Even though mustafin was easy to lead through two shoes, the image was triggered.
Swimming bars and ground tours - in which Bile holds the world's master title.
She reared with 15,433 on the swimming bar, and put up a 15,933 on the ground.
Raisman turned her up when she expected her snake - a pure form - and stroke on a blue red, white and blue eyeliner, when the vision which she first described in its collection book was realized.
Raisman's performance was a struggle last four years ago when she struggled around the third place, but the bronze medaille went to a helmet to Mustafine.
This time, the 22-year-old men's captain called "oma" by the Americans had a pre-passion.
After its landwork, she was able to be the public, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes appeared doubtless.
As regards Biles, it has a very new importance for the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week:
Police: 3 victims in a series of murders at the music hearing in the car
According to the police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girls who have been shot in one of the most dead attacks since a decade in Phoenix's first serial murder, while they were in the car and heard music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Elis daughter Maleah were shot on 12 June, while the car was parked in an invasion, the authorities said.
The murder fired eight shoes from a handfire weapons, while he stood on the car's side and then fled with another vehicle, is to read in the report.
The police shared that the murder had not appeared to have been the result of a shooting accident because the slaughter did not take the hands or $2.900 that were in possession of one of the adult victims.
The police speaker of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shoerei had the investigator to make a closer view of whether it is connected to four previous attacks.
Overall, seven people were killed in Spanish residences within four months in nine attacks and two more injured.
"It happens in a residence before a house," the KHPO, a daughter company of CBS, shared the beginning of the month.
It is accepted that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a green nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to open the evidence that they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and started by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter Maleah are still dead.
One Witness shared the police that it was not uncommon to sit in a parked car and to hear music.
The authorities also issued a police report on the shoerei, which led to a empty pickup track a half hour before the murder three times and out of the fact that it was the work of the series murderer.
The investigators found balls and secured a ball from the seat, as well as furniture from the motor space.
Mother of a 6-year-old man with microcephaly: "It will be better"
Like the most of the 6-year-olds Edmund Piccuto loves the song, game tools and of course his mother.
But as the least of his age, Edmund has microcephalie, the result of a genetic disorder, about which his mother Elizabeth Piccuto didn't know during her pregnancy.
When he came home the first time, he was my first thanks, I don't do it.
I don't do that.
I didn't let it.
What isn't true -- of course you have left it," she said.
Your husband Vincent and she were informed that Edmund will never be able to recognise them under circumstances and that it may not be ever survived.
Some doctors were even so far that they suggested that they would institutionalize him.
"My first answer was to," I didn't know that the people are still doing", explained Piciuto.
Edmund can run with help.
Edmund could not sit nor sit or crabble until his third life year and he can't even speak.
But he makes slow progress.
He can walk with support and drive.
He also likes to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund thought about "Bite sing something before me."
"We bring him sign language with him," said Piciuto CBS News.
But it's not a typical character language, she says, Edmund has created some signs alone.
Microcephalie has a variety of causes: genetics, such as Edmund and infections with virus such as mass or zikavir during pregnancy.
The symptoms and prognoses can strongly vary.
It is too early to say how it will affect life of the cycavirus infected.
Piciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I always asked what would happen?
What's going on?
And she still doesn't know.
I haven't asked for a long time after the prognosis because I don't expect that she can really tell me someone.
But Piciuto has a hopeful advisory for mothers of heroes with birth damage caused by zikavirus.
It'll be better.
You know that it will be better for you.
You'll love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rainfalls, overpowering offers availability to relief in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rainfalls and large swimming surroundings in Louisiana, the Gouverneur began to call the emergency on Friday. It will be calculated throughout the Saturday with more rainfalls.
Many rivers in the south of Louisianas and the south of Mississippi crossed their woods and threatened large overflows to extreme rainfalls, reported the National Water Service.
The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards reported that state officers are in permanent contact with the local authorities and are already undergoing assistance to the communities concerned.
Mike Rowland, a speaker for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparation of the Gouverneur, shared the demands for highwater vehicles, boats and sand sacks.
August said that only the Tangipao community had requested ten thousand sand sacks.
A surrounding warning system is used by white parts in the south of Louisianas to Saturday.
The weather service was relievable that additional 3 to 5 rain tariffs could be fallen in this area.
On the south of Alabamas, a flight warning system was used on Friday, while it continued to be reinforced in the mobile area.
The river committee near Baton Rouges and the River Office near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, will be reached after the weekend.
The meteorologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could overcome many houses near Baton Rouge near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a stromabwart surrounding in Ascension Parish is a risk, since these are only slowly flying to the lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw river, south of the Mississippi State limit in Liverpool, Louisiana, has already reached about 09.00 the highest position that has ever been registered.
Reservation teams still offered people from the river water in the area of the office and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his son, were among those who were saved on Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which normally stands away from his house, was strongly increased overnight.
He said he had warned him another son who lives near.
"We are waiting and the water stripped and stripped in there," said Hansford.
It reached my size.
His wife Hansford told her that she had never seen such an elevation of the river in the 48 years in which she lived there.
Hansford said that he and his family members would have all difficulties and he would be the only one who can be hampered.
Hansford said that all three Nothelpers had saved in a great military LKW and had brought them to the next firewave, where they were brought to the freeday.
Krautmann said that the overflow had "speaked" because it continued to be serious rainfalls and that the authorities consider evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, a observer reported near Livingstone from Midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 dry rain.
Krautmann said that the land was significantly completed by rainfalls since midnight.
The authorities acknowledged that serious rainfalls and road transits caused the salvation of inhabitants from their homes in Tangipaoa Parish and educational disorders in five school areas.
The CBS WWL reported that a participant in Tangipaoa 200 was overcoming houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated in two churches, which were now both exceeded.
The chief of the Commonwealth Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven householders that were buried by high water.
In the cities of office and Hammond, emergency was established to hide the evacuated.
"When the water starts back, they'll be able to return to their houses," he said.
In the town of Hammond of the Commonwealth of Tangipaoa, almost two twenty roads were closed because of the high waterstorm, and the sand swimming pool for the inhabitants hopes to keep the water from their houses and business.
"The latest overcome we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum from the city management.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississipp, the Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy of the Harrison Council said it continued to rest at the golf coast.
According to his details, a household should be reported as overwhelmed on Thursday, but on Friday has not been reported until now.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I have seen water in places where I never saw it before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "Speaking from balls", survives shoes in Philadelphia
The police shares that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, this week has been the second time that a 6-year-old child was shot.
The grandfathers of the boy identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandma said that Brown suffered several shocks, including in the lens, skin, arm and bottle, but he was at a consciousness in his transportation to the hospital.

The state of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to take several operations.
The family of the boy shared the sender that he was expected to be cured again.
He should start the first class in a local basic school.
Brown was one of four people shooted in Germany.
Similarly, three men were shot: two in the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical state; the other two victims are according to CBS Philadelphia in a stability state.
The boy was shot at the front of a car together with the 29-year-old boy who is in a critical state, reports the sender.
The other two victims were not in the car, and the police just determines whether they could be among one of the lost men of the murder.
The investigator shared the CBS Philadelphia that it seemed to have come to a cross fire between several shoes.
Powers for storm wears that were followed to different storm weapons were transferred to the slaughter.
It seems that it has been clearly treated for a long fight.
On the street, on both sides of the journey, swimming up.
Thus it seems to have given several armed fighters who were very actively involved," the police addressed Anthony Ginaldi to the police in Philadelphia.
There were also several houses and vehicles taken in the area.
There were no prisons and the police reviews reports, according to the video of monitoring.
On Thursday, another six-year-old girl was taken into arm when she played before her house in the West Oak Lane residence.
She's getting back and the police's still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I'm presented under the Women's Olympic team in the tour and for more than one reason.
First of all, I'm at every summer olympiade since 1984 and the United States never were so dominant.
And secondly, this team has three tourners, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie", which inspired for many young girls of other skin colors.
The structure of this manity, Aly Raisman, the Jews, and Madison Kocian, the Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has improved the black and Spanish woman’s presence at the pitch of this sport.
In the past four years, the number was a African American under the women’s tourners.
Last year, Simone and Gabby #1 and #2 were.
That shows strength.
During the last Olympic games Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and jubeled America.
Now the world was in a position to witness the incredible performance of the world's three-fold master Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as it was unexpected, but delivered master gemasticroutine.
On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, theerosexual Americanian who won at a individual multi-food event for women.
Member Aly Raisman won Silber.
We experience the spots of this sport, but in this way we don't see the turk loads throughout the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie are all the same way as Aly and Madison to create it in the olympic team.
They are the "last Fifth", because the next Olympic team will only have four tourners in the manner. Furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.
But the reality seems to be a turn sport and towers in the main line in private tower agreements that are maintained by parents, which are used for training, facilities, traveling costs, competition and hotels (for trainers and their families). The list can continue.
The majority of these towers is in favourable places that can support the business.
The tourners receive all their training and this is a sweet and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, has both trained their athletes since they started with the tour.
We have to allow the communities to make a more lower and easier towards tourist training by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I found my tour office for 20 years.
In my events, we have offered free and enhanced tours in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people (especially black and Spanish) and trained national and international victory.
In September, we will expand after Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth of high-qualitative tours that will gain the possibility of learning and benefit from these so-called olympic sports.
Turners develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the spirit.
This combination provides long-term benefits for health and educational success.
It is the inspiration of this manity to bring thousands of young girls to interest in the tour, and that's great.
It is so important to participate in the sport, especially for girls.
It's so sweet time.
Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real exhibition of "Girl Power" by the wood of the Olympic Manity Gold and thank you, so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way, healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant doctors want to organize further strikes after they rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal
The Ministers hoped that the fighting changes could be completed by adopting a reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58% of the 37.000 assistant doctors voted at a choice were delayed.
In July Hunt plans were enthusiasmed to introduce the treaty and said that the NHS were invaded in a "Nemandsland" and that any further delay for employees and patients would be harmful.
The first assistant physicians should receive a new treaty that contains amendments to night and weekends to improve the weather time.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, President of the BMA Commission for Assistant Aids last night, communicated in a communication: "Assistance physicians have the proposed treaty as serious concerns, especially that it will enhance the current involvement crisis and will be decreased to treat all the doctors fairly."
Only eight weeks that remain, until the first group of doctors falls under the new treaty, must be made progress and the time goes out.
In view of the efforts made by the BMA to solve conflicts through conversation, the Government has to participate in opposite wildlifes and sometimes towards an exercising sweet.
The result of a promise that Jeremy Hunt had made last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, decreasing the inclination and talking to the concerns of the assistant physicians."
If it does not, the assistants have clearly shown that they are willing to carry out further work camps.
The last strike end of April saw an injury of nearly 1,000 routine operations and 100,000 terms, as physicians and experts were included in order to give physicians to the strike posting chain coverage.
The Ministers hoped that the fight on the amendments could be completed by adopting the reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants to make a better weekly delay for the 54.000 assistant physicians that will be subscribed to the Treaty.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of NHS employees, invited the assistant doctors to end the strike.
Mortimer said: "Occupation measures do not achieve any of the few, but they are already overwhelmed teams and services and prepare patients, employees and their families only concerns, emergency and interruption."
In the past two months we spoke to me to the Committee of Assistant Medicines, with the Ministry of Health and other ministers positively responded to the concerns about the predominantity and Whistleblowing.
The employees hoped that the continuing positive commitment to other important topics, such as detection, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a professional time, training courses, mutual recognition of the education plan, continuing training and sexual rewards in the medicine, were a sign of how serious workers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health were in terms of compliance with the BMA agreements in November, February and May.
The £2-pro day medication that can cause heart-infarctic risk
Thousands of heart-infarct patients will benefit from a £2 per day medication after recommended by the authorities to adopt this more people for a longer period.
Ticagrelor medication reduces the risk of repeated heart infections for persons with heart disease.
The medication is administered for 12 months after a heart infarction, reduceing the risk of a slaughter case or another heart infarction.
The NHS regulatory authority has recommended a period of four years to continue to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS regulatory authority has recommended a period of four years to continue to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Around 140,000 people each year experience a heart infarction and a fourth of them experience another heart infarct or slaughter accident.
heart infarcts and slagan accidents are caused by assemblies of fat materials in the arterian walls, which form the slaughter.
If the beerag interferes, it may cause a blood blood blood insecte that stole the blood flow up to the heart and causes a heart infarction.
If the blood nervous is resolved, it can flee through the blood strom and hide the blood flow to the brain, which causes a smoke accident.
People who have already a heart infarction have a higher risk.
Ticagrelor, which is produced by the British company AstraZeneca and is distributed under the market name of Brilica, reduces this risk by making it uncertainly to the education of blood nerves.
The leading project of NICE, which is now published, recommends a 12-month receipt of 90mg ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a double-day receipt of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: "In view of the availability of secondary prevention, four hundreds of people who have suffered a heart-infarction, another heart-infarction or a slaughter accident, often with extreme consequences."
The fear of a renewed heart infarction may have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person.
The experience shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirine is effectively in reducing other heart infections and slaughter in people who already had a heart-infarction.
With a provisional recommendation of Ticagrelor, we are glad that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people that can benefit from it.
The information on the effectiveness and security of Ticagrelor - especially the blood risk - is limited to a period of up to three years. The guideline project recommends no treatment that depends on this period.
Cultural of Political Correctness allows election fraud in muslim areas
The former citizensman of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman has been removed last year on the event of a government report because of corruption from the office.
A culture of political correctness has resulted in the knowledge of wide election fraud in muslim communities as a destructive government report today.
The former Cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles greeves the police, election observers and Council chambers to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse because of "exceptivenesses regarding ethnics and religion".
The former Minister for Integration and Community Government, who is now a king of corruption, said that the threat of elections from religious reasons would be so terrible that the police should be allowed to set out countries outside the electoral cabins to protect protect protect protected elections.
It recommends that the choicers should conduct a reference with themselves to demonstrate their identity in elections.
At the time, a choiceer must just call his name and address.
The report proposes that not removed density to the feet of a person if they leave their votes to prevent someone two times chosen.
Whistleblower should receive more protection, says Sir Eric.
It calls for more access to joint documents and decisions of non-official committees or working groups.
"This does not only serve against elections, but also to protect the common government before the broader corruption and financial drug culture which is income," he said.
The report was ordered by the Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet's election channel in East London.
Last year, a special vote decided that the official master Lutfur Rahman should be deleted after a Lithuania to corrupt and illegal practices of his office.
The court claimed that Rahman had had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a zynical way," and that his critics had been shocked with racism and Islamic admissions.
Rahman intended to "her campaign on the basis that it is the reliable obligation of Muslims to choose him".
Up to 300 votes were doubtless or the consequences of a posture, where a person chose as someone else.
Sir Eric said it proved to be fraud in the whole country.
In particular, he expressed an alarming opinion for the preferential letter election - in the oldest members of the Muslim Community pressure to choose a candidate.
Sir Eric, trained, made several recommendations to cut the selection system, including the leadership of instructions to prove identity
The report states: "On the evidence that the pressure on the protection of some ethnic minorities was exercised, especially women and young people, to choose, in accordance with the will of the elders, in particular communities with Pakistanian or bandladesh background.
"It was worried that... public institutions would have ignored such a behavior because of "politically corrected" overwhelmings regarding Ethia and religion."
Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to switch the system, including the prohibition of editing political active letters to stop "Women".
The report taken into consideration by Theresa May also requires worse registration reviews to prevent the electoral directory of immigration and social drugs.
Select options to ask the choice before your choice.
Use not removed tits on the finger of a person when she left her voice to prevent someone choose two times.
Systemal reviews on nationality of a person to ensure that they are right.
A three-year-old limitation to applications to an automatic letter selection.
Prohibition that political activists edit full letter choices and advertisements of letters.
The police gives the power to establish restrictions to election stations.
An amendment of legislation that facilitates a complaint for injury under the Representation of the People Act 1983 (Volks-Representation Act 1983).
Photographer ban in selection stations.
Require that only English may be used in the election stations (except Wales).
Intensifying the training to ensure that the employees apply the rules that the electioners only go into the selection box.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan police and finds it "surprising," that after the Tower Hamlet's case, he wasn't sentenced.
"The election court declared Lutfur Rahman and his stakeholder, because of a Lithuania of corrupt and illegal practices", he said.
It has been known because of a number of reasons for sufficientness - in accordance with the high requirements of criminal proceedings -.
It also criticizes the disadvantaged "aftaking controls" of the members of the Council's registering departments.
Sir Eric said, "The court in Tower Hamlets in the last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of Parliament, is a proud heritage, but the careful and disclosed expansion of election fraud and leakage of some authorities threatens this good call.

Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Has the CBC commenter just said that the 14-year-old swimming swimming from China "Where is a skin died?"?
The idiot has not captured that they were still on sending."
Ai Yanhan from China was described at the final 4 x 200m free swimming stahl for women: "This small 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard in which many were talking to him
Twitter users did not turn back when they heard how our usual Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists. #angekel.
Shortly later, Scott Russel, who modernized the CBC sending, lived for the comment of MacDonald and said, "We forgive us that the comment was extracted on a weakness."
It was a unfortunately chosen formulation, it's sorry that it happened."
CBC regretted about 90 times in the people who responded to Twitter's comment.
The commenter College Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and inserted his apologize with more than 90 other Twitter users that were dealing with MacDonald's comments
The network also decreed quickly and gave a message out.
We regret that these sentences have been made and that it has been allowed to be excluded.
Last night, we were soon apologizing with our observers on sending and followers in social media.
To clarify one, Byron's comments relate to the performance of the swimming pool and not to them as a person.
However, they were inadequate and unfortunately chosen formulation. Byron does what he said.
On Thursday afternoon MacDonald regreted himself in the sending and tried to justify his comment by he suggesting that it was not his hope that it would be issued as a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize a moment for my comment, which I made after the CBC Olympic Exhibition in the CBC, to apologize.
"I've been on the performance of the snake and not on them as a person."
Of course, it wasn't inquired and I'm very sorry."

All products in question were taken out of the sale.
How to protect Krav Maga against arms attacks
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make him something more secure for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to run with armed buildings closely removed.
Independence on whether you're close to you from front or down, this video will show you how you turn the skin for your skin.
If you're close to you from down, then you should turn around as first, so you can see your adversary and "she give you out of the shooting line", Mizrachi says.
Then take the weapons between your frontarm and your shooter before you shoot him with your free elbog face.
Put him up with the skin into the shoes and turn back, while the smells swimming up for pain, the weapons from his hands. Shut him into the face and move back while they put the weapons on him.
When anxieties that are closed from the front, the technology is similar - move your body out of the shooting line, take the weapons and turn it up, so that the shooter can't shoot it.
Reduce the weight on the weapons and shoot the shooter on the breast, then turn the weapons out of his griff before they move back and put the weapons on it.
Klingt hard?
See the video to see exactly how the Mizrachi is.
But think that it's the safeest to overcome your money - if you don't be Krav Maga Grand Master.
Traveller Ian Wright slows his language to the most comfortable places of Europe for a traveller
A British traveller understood his immune system and flexibility of a serious test by cutting some of the most sweet and exquisite places of Europe.
The moderator and traveller Ian Wright, 51 Suffolk from Suffolk took his trains on a euro, a country at the Piccadilly Circus, a wheel button and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system.
Before the switch of each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he is going on.
But the experience, which was drawn under the title “The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength”, brought some surprising results in daylights.
The gratitude to decline the smuggle button that has already been used by thousands of others may be totally shocked, but in fact there are more bacteria in a kitchen kitchen.
At his trip through Europe, Mr. Wright said with doctors and medical experts about the promotion of darbakes and his own health.
Unfortunately, nothing left that he turned away, more than a bad smell in the mouth.
Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his darkness by he traveling through the world and eating uniquely and wonderful things.
From public countries to rail floors, the task of its immune system was definitively under a test
In the film he said, "I was pregnant for me as a child, and I had cut all the possible things in my mouth, earth, wolf and water."
In the film, he was just asking for every case.
The only thing he rejected was a smooth public toilet in Russia.
His trial showed a number of luminometers of over 4000 units.
In comparison, the number of luminometers is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to stop, after their luminometer number over 4000 units, while fresh hands show one of less than 60.
Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the bacteria number in different places than the bathroom
In the film he says, "This is the worst thing I smokeed in a toilet, nearly."
There's nothing more funny than that!
I'm not gonna do anything here, because it's pretty in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio.
The company allows Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both milk and vitamin C and D, to support the promotion of dark batteries and immune systems.
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Snacks and New Categories Niko Kaurenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer the consumers something new.
something that is fascinating to look and at the same time declares the advantages of probiotics.
We conducted crazy brain turmings that ended that we said, "Lat call us Ian."
They said that the interest in dark health will be a global phenomenon.
Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a greater context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of dark health and how it is connected to the immune system.
The growing interest in soil health is a global phenomenon and with the documental film, we could provide the consumers more information in a interesting way.
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense for humor!
Tom Hakala, who led the film region, added: "Let me tell me so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had chosen some of the things I had given him to shoot, as the exquisite Russian toilet that is shown in the film."
Of course, there were things where it was easier to bring Ian into them, and others that were very difficult.
I am glad we have included some of these smiling leckers on the film."
In a 2015 survey of Valio, 84 per cent of all demanded milk acid bacteria, especially with the well-being of magn and darm and 58 per cent, said that they use at least available products containing milk acid bacteria.
Social family destroyed in Saltash, Cornwall
A social family left their home after a description with a damage of 500,000 £, because they terrorised their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were captured after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.
After they were violently removed from their presence, shocked firms of the accommodation found the property in an irreparable condition.
The walls shocked, wooded woods were shocked, the mould was cut on the foot ground and the graphite was shocked on the walls.
The families were turned up and it will be accepted that they live in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the house management at Cornwall Housing, said that she feared that the apartment was not reparing.
She said, "It was a absolute living room for people here, and I am thinking that people don't have to live in this way.
There are many things to be taken into account, since this existence probably will be viewed as not so beautiful part of Cornwalls.
The family's behavioured, and her call is also.
The couple had three sons who lived interimly in the apartment and the police said that the terrorism that the family had added was struggling streets with baseball slaughterers, smoking people, drug abuse, drug traffic and overwhelming crystals, riders and shoes.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the Meeting Treaty, endorsed a order for anti-social behavior in June.
In some places of the house that is deleted under circumstances, old mull was found
There was a place in which the drugs were treated in the past, the woods were cut off.
Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly called the police
Cornwall Housing described her and her partner this week of violence from the residence after she gave them a extended period of 11 weeks to go voluntary.
The description was triggered by easy neighbors, who said that their life was made to hell.
One said, "They were shocking for no one."
We lived 20 years next to them, and it was always bad.
The incredible cases we're telling the police here are incredibly.
"We couldn't sleep tomorrow."
We stopped because it was so calm here - that's not we live!
Now where they're finally gone, it's gonna be beautiful.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighborhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have cooperated with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house where the police was called in regular distances for 20 years
On the overwhelming side of the municipality house, milk and old game tools were subjected to
He added: "It's a shame that the midder summoned, any responsibility for her behaviour and its family to accept, as a description is always the last step that the Cornwall Housing is taking into consideration.
This was a very difficult case, since the behaviour of the conduct was extreme and their acts were terrible to their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as the members of the community who have been courageous to reach us and have allowed us the information.
I hope that this development will make some neighbouring comfort, and the message is proving that anti-social behavior is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house, but that they were all more than 20.
A smooth matrix that was left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delogation on the ground
Employees of the house management will now have to displace Müllbergs to run the house
2014, the police passed a razzia in the house and found over 70g cannabis and wagen, paraphernalians and bargeld higher than £1.700.
Skeldon received a currency sentence after her ownership of a drug of class B in trade.
She said that the money for a Grabstone is Lee Skeldon of her son, who came to life at an accident of 2013.
After they were without obdach, Tanya and her partner are out of their lives in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the room walls of the house were shocked with graphics.
The police says that it will be delayed by Members who do not hold up the budget regulation.
Angela Crow from the police of Devon and Cornwall reported that the delocation was a clear warning to the other members who did not hold on the budget.
"This is about those who think that they can be taken without self-defense, as well as to those who have been damaged by such a conduct," she said.
The police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviors that will continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities.

Solar worshipers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their life
A português P-3C Orion flight of the aircraft moved to an incredible shock flight
The airlines acknowledged that it was on a train flight, but warranted that no security risk was presented.
This was the moment when the decreased tourists began to be born in panic after a deep jet dropped over a full beach.
Dramatic video records showed how the military flight aircraft was almost slowly close to the sun providers on the Strategy part of Aero in the Northern Portugal.
The vacants are shocking when they are understood to be worried about the swimming works, without first seeing what happened by the swimming clouds to them.
The incident occurred afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many vacants who posted the videos about the dramatic Fly-By in the social media, said, "It was very deeply slow and there was a moment as it seemed as it would shoot it."
Nowo Arroja added: "I was just on the circle, and it felt like the flight would turn away on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were moved to Panik when the aircraft came from the darkness and incredibly flew deeply
The Portuguese airlines today found that the P-3C Orion flight pilot was on a train flight to identify fishing boats before the coast and so deeply flighted that this was the only way to identify them.
The speaker said that the Jet was more deep than normally, however, that the airway forces were threatened to security at no time.
Area burdens have destroyed the português Festland parts of this summer year, with four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Airlines today pointed out that the pilot was due to the situation - strong neck and burning smoke - so deeply flying, which limited its view.

Furthermore, Goalie Marc-And is lacking in stages.
In the training, the Germans experience a landmark in the kit, which has been declared at least for the first time for Claudio Bravo.
The Chile International and Ter Stages in Barcelona has been one of the states for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique refused to make a clear decision and left Bravo in the Liga, but so the most other claims were the presentation.
Before the first game of the new game time, the Spanish Master doubts about the fatness state of the manity was suspicious on Saturday in a Liverpool test game with 0:4.
In Probegalopp 3:2, Lionel Messi and Co. did not really know Lionel Messi on the midnight.

Ma Long in a own link to Tischtennis-Gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new Tischtennis Olympioner.
The 27-year-old day at Rio de Janeiro was a single final of his countryman and "Tititel defender" Zhang Jike 4:0 (12.5.4.4).
In this way the World Landlists had the "Golden Grand Slam" with success at WM, Worldcup, World Tour Financialists and also Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chineses have done it as expected in the end game and made the title one another.
This was clear that, for the third time, a Chinese would take the individual title in the sign of the fifth line.
The last non-Chine on the top of the Olympic Trip was the former SVS-NÃ-Legionaire Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left on the plate alone, between the rates and at time-outs they had no coachs with themselves.
They had turned back to the tribunes and left their shooters in the right competition fight alone.
"I have played the matchs until here for my country."
"I'm the Finale I'm playing for me," Zhang had sincerely said.
After the party, gold and silver medal winners were placed with the Chinese farm.
The match itself was unexpectedly unexpected.
But his 28-year-old enemy had to fight only in the first word.
Then he specificated the time on the plate and left the Zhang from there only 13 points.
With the overwhelming of Ma, the expected match was not developed.
Nevertheless, there was no reason to see enough ball change.
Mizutani wins the game for bronze against the 40-year-old Wladimir Samsow 4:1.
In his fourth final, the whiteruses had brought up a ripped injury to the German Master Dimitri Ovtcharov, and then had been in medical treatment, and he had to "last" to seek.
The Swedish Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) have also become similarly higher tissue plants of Olympia.
Donald Trump emphasizes powerful problems in the election camp
The leadership of the United States Republicans is put on a majority by massive concerns, including in traditional conservative states.
President Donald Trump now gave the weaknesses of his election campaign in the former Republic of Highburg Utah.
A rare moment in which multimillionarys who were normally large and self-secure expressed such as concerns as the co-responsibilities reported.
After he took 16 rivals within the own Republican loggers, the doubts of his success in struggle for the white house.
"We have great problems in Utah," said Trump before evangelical Christians, which he asked for support in major states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
If there were wrong reports on his candidature, he re-examined his well-known media school.
Republious Hochburg wake
Utah is normally a safe bank for the Republicans.
A SurveyUSA survey from June was the Trump and his competitor from the Democratics, Hillary Clinton.
Other institutions are seeing Trump before, however, not with the distance used for the Republican candidates in the State.
Arizona and Georgia are also dangerous.
In an interview of the Senator CNBC, Trump answered the question, as he wanted to stop the Premarginal Clintons: "Genause, how I did it until now."
And go back: "It's gonna be successful, or I'll make a very beautiful, long holiday."
He does nothing else than telling the truth.
If it is not rich for him at the end of the political correction, it would be okay, Trump continued.
Then I'll come back to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the party would have threatened Trump to strike money in support of his election campaign, he should not be able to present better survey values.
Instead of that, the candidates of the Republicns would like to be stronger under the army.
Olympia: Three fraud at Doping Test
The IOC wants to set up a discipline committee in the case.
Kenias Lechtathleten threatens the second Doping job at the Olympic games in Rio de Janeiro Ungeach.
After a fraud survey at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenia sent a trainer home.
The International Olympic Committee shared a discipline committee in order to investigate the case.
A Kenian official reported that the former speech and today's coach, John Anzrah, had issued an Urin test in the Olympic village under the name of the 800-metre-four Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported by the Kenias team by the Doping Controls.
The IAAF World Association has requested the IOC information on the case to undertake its own investigations, shared a IAAF speaker.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC will take an evaluation to the IAAF", said a IAAF statement.
"Her (Anzrah) went to the Doping Conpulsion Station and was deleted as Ferguson Rotich, issued and signed the test," Kenia Head of Mission Stephan Arap Soi explained.
He was in the possession of the accreditation of the athlete who was on the list of training controls of the World Anti Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich was grown in 2015 in Peking WM-Väteer over 800 meters.
Four days ago, the Kenyan Lightthletic Delegation Chief Michael Rotich was taken from the Rio games.
He should have informed against money payers of his country about existing doping tests.
According to media reports, it should be arrested when returning to Nairobi’s airport.
Kenia has been under special observance in the IOC following numerous Doping procedures for many years.
In the announcement of more than 2000 Doping target controls provided by the IOC, it was uncomfortablely indicated that special athletes from Kenia and Russia are taken into view.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had performed a lot of pressures on the African country to create an anti-doping site and a functioning control system.
The law was adopted a few weeks before Olympia begins.
As a result, WADA Kenia was taken from the list of countries whose Doping fighting is in accordance with WADA rules.
Kenia's applies as a great guifer nation.
The slight thresholds of the country won at the WM 2015 in Peking most of the medailles.
In a series of RRD television reports, it has always been suggested that the amount of Doping is easily available in Kenia and that it is to give a significant mentality of sports.
IOC member Richard Pound recently requested a similar investigation in Kenia, as he had appointed them in the Russian light-artistic.
It could be demonstrated that this sports type was slowly and systematically baptized.
Russia's slightthroughs were excluded from the summer games.
Salzburger "West Side History" with Cecilia Bartoli
In Shakespeare-year, the Salzburger shows the "West Side History" with Tony and Maria as a tragic pair of love, like Romeo and Julia.
A surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical harbors Salzburg: the "West Side History", Leornard Bernstein's Masterwork.
The artistist leader Cecilia Bartoli wanted to put the musical temple into the classic temple and filled a youth dream with the role of Mary.
In the orchester grain, the Simon Bolivar Orchester under the leadership of the Venezonal Dirants Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of Rhythmus," he warms.
We always say she was very late American.
There are many Latin American additives in their time and melodie.
It's a wonderful mix, the perfect reception for our orchester.
I would say we have a music of Bernstein in our blood!
In this incense Bartoli plays a older Maria.
She remembers her love with Tony while the young Maria plays and dance.
Mary's role has always shown me fascinated.
First, because it is musically extraordinary!
And then there would be Mary's personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel so nice, oh so beautiful, I feel beautiful, sweet and bright."
So it's awesome, of course also naive, and very painful.
"He looks like me, my Italian character that I have as a Roman," said Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of the glory for the Oper song: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's so honour to work with her.
She's an unforgettable man.
And Bartoli returns the complex: "Double is such an extraordinary artist and very painful!"
Direction is a need for him.
You see it in every movement, in his eyes, it's his life!
It's so a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a higher southern temperature, a fire, a suffering, and also a joyful approach to life, which is really very important!
For the American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side History" is currently highlighted: "In this part it is about prejudices and fanatism."
Today, we have the refugees, then the Porto Ricanes went to New York, and the New York people did not want them.
It's the same topics, and they are exactly as at the time.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
Londra's school girls, who joined the IS, were killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British school girls, left London last year to join the IS, died reports in Syria.
The lawyer Tasnime Kunjee said that her family had experienced her death a few weeks ago in Raqqa, Syria.
It was confused that she was killed by a Russian air attack in Raqqa, the Bolletwork of the group in the country, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and murdered after her family was planned to leave the warfare and return to England.
"We can only hope that the only good is there - as a record and warning to others that these are the risks that are linked to go into a war area - people to take this decision ever," said Konjee.
In February 2015 Sultana and two other school girls from East London entered into a airport direction to Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian borders.
The Sultanas family was informed that she married a ISIS fighter in Syria, and became widow within less than months.
Reid says Clinton will remain a candidate for the Supreme Court in the case of a election seat at Garland
Harry Reid, leader of the Democratics in the Senate, is convinced that the Presidential Chairman of Democratics, Hillary Clinton, will be appointed the judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicns of Senate have confirmed Garlands since his appointment by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader at Senate Mitch McConnell is the view that the next President will be appointed to the follower of the murdered judge at the Supreme Court of Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a phone conference that he expected to select "with a certain measure of consciousness" by Clinton.
A speaker of Reid later said he wouldn't even talk to Clinton whether they would name Garland and speculate.
He glorified Garland and said that the Clinton's team would not care for unreality with a new candidate.
Garland is the Supreme Judge for the United States Appletation Court for the Columbia District.
Raid said, the Republicns blocked the Garlands' Nomination, as Lakaien and helpers of the Republican Presidency candidate Donald Trump.
He also determined that Donald Trump was inadequate for the President.
Treats wants to Nackt Calendar for "Women and men"
The Treats Magazine works together with the photograph David Belmerre to deliver Pirelli-Inspirit Calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous Nackta people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Museum Calendar for 2017.
The director of Treats Steve Shaw told us to begin this year that his nacktmagazine was different from Oldschool Playboy, because "Playboy is for men".
I'll do it for women.
It seems to be that it's the calendar.
"We have to return to show timeless and classical nakness, where both women and men are well feeling and feel inspired by these images of a woman's body," said Shaw in a press communication on the publication of the Calendars.
Women will want to participate in this project because it's a beautiful art work.
Models can receive their images online or personally when open Casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkish: Curdial community calculated with mass flight
"Whoever does not adjust and glorify Erdogan, sits on packed coffees", says the President of the Gullen-Cheen Foundation dialogue and world, Ercan Karakoyun.
The Curdial Community has shortly calculated with ten thousand visitors flying from Turkey to Germany.
Medium-term it could even become a hundred thousand, believed by the President of the Association Ali Toprak.
In view of the heartful action of the President of Turkey Recep Tayip Erdogan after the Putschweek, the Korean community expects a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term I contact with tens of thousands, medium-term with hundreds of thousands of protection visitors from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the Association President Ali Toprak of the World of Friday.
Because the government has overlooked the Curdial Highburgs in punishment months ago, 500,000 curves within Turkey were flying.
After the digest, they do not have secular and opposite ethnic towers.
Many will want to start again in Europe if they are continued to be stressed in Turkey.
"It cannot be that a State that takes refugees itself produces refugees in its own country," said Toprak.
The head of the Association declared the targeted seat of Syrian Arabs in the Curdic but also in alevitic cities.
In this way, Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining rates.
"Here the last major minority in Turkey, the Christian Army and Greek were already destroyed or destroyed in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a member of the CDU.
The head of the Association requested that the federal government “posite as Austria against Erdogan and its members”.
In Germany there is also a "hexenjagd" against Erdogan critics.
I don't feel safe in the last months for the first time in Germany.
The German branch of the Gelen movement also fears the refugee of many towers in the foreign.
More Turks are searching for asylum in Germany, especially shorts and oppositions.
The brandmarking as Gelen attachers destroys teachers and other academics the professional existence.
"Whoever does not adjust and glorify Erdogan, sits on packed coppers, otherwise the chemalists and secularists," said Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Neighbouring Foundation Dialoge and Education, "the World".
As the newspaper reported on the numbers of the Federal Ministry, Turkeys already put the largest group of asylum authors for political persecution in Germany before the Putsch.
On Thursday 30 June, this was 11.386 people, and therefore 29% of them were as a rights of asylum acknowledged (39.625).
In this encouraging, the war, poverty, or perspectiveless rewards are not flewed.
Asylum, in accordance with the basic law, is only political, by state side, individual persecution.
Mecklenburg Powers: "It go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg pools: Inhabitants receive nothing from summer wave with - and the holidays from Northwest Rhine cannot choose the landday.
They understood in Mecklenburg pools.
2021 the landmarks will not be taken directly at the end of the summer feasts, and the Schwarze Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
For more than ever, it's not: summer vacation, heating, and landscape battle, that's a help.
The locals to be convinced by the fighters are in vacation.
The most largest vacants in the country, on the way of using, swimming or the Hiddensee, are not inhabited, therefore don't have to choose the landday.
There are practical problems: In the holidays there are helpers to put places, shoot airballs, distribute fleeers and finally spend vows, just to swim.
Up to September 4th, 2016, the election and last day, the Mecklenburg Championship has to be held by the people.
The warm phase, if you can say it, has just started.
And it's also about something: President Erwin Sellering, the leader of a SPD/Cdu coalition, must be afraid of his office.
The SPD, since 1998 the strongest party, is now clearly behind the CDU.
It is shocking how strong Neuling AfD down and what remains at the end of the coalition rate.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008, makes a nearly unexpected election campaign, looks out of its grand platkats.
He travels through the country, distributes Rosen and enjoys a little with the people, as it did his legendary preacher Harald Ringstorff.
On the other hand, Sealering has obtained cold feet and offers Kanzler Merkel the schuld on the fall of the AfD.
Your refugee policy, you "We make it", has accelerated the increase in the legal populations, which is probably now the beautiful office of him.
The CDU with its spot candidates, the Minister of Internal Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced as it is when you make it wrong at the right place of choice.
She has invited Kansler Angela Merkel two times to grandcomings; the centre is located in the northern.
But the target group did not have to be true, there were more North Rhine-Westfalen, Berliners and Sachsen because it was not Mecklenburgers and Prepomers.
"It was probably the majority of other federal countries," Vincent Kokert, Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg, recently complained.
But there is also no damage to hear an Angela Merkel from other edges of Germany.
On the other hand, the Northern CDU is widely refusing to the ordinary election campaigns on market places and before sales centres with sun screens and airballs.
That means Kokert only plays a "subdesigned role".
In addition, the Union has noted that you are depressing the basis on the country that it has to be extremely endeavoured to find a channel towards people.
You're like the left, the SPD, the Green: there's no place in the west of the country.
However, the Council of the CDU fighter Kokert is self-employed: "They must go where it hurts, namely where people are: villages, goldene weddings, every birthday feast must be used."
Because many are on the game, Sellering has now called its SPD to a specially engaged campaign.
In surveys, social democracy was 22% behind the CDU (25) partners, just before the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had still winned 35.6% before the CDU (22).
The green, a small party with seven percent in the surveys, should make the swift on the land day.
They make a modern attraction from the holiday note and make their selection camp largely in the Internet.
"Online Water Camp" is called President Claudia Muller.
Instead, green choosing fighters are allowed to search for incoming urbans under the holidays.
Silke Gajek, the Spitzen Candidate, runs with a house boat through the Mexileburg Sea and finds it still beautiful.
Your impression: "The holiday in Mecklenburg is not punishment."
B27 Power: guests suffer under sperling
The speed with which B 27 is sanized, there's nothing to meat.
For the responsibilities of the construction work, which starts at 5:30 tomorrow and ends only before 20 hours, there are half lobs.
"They have done everything quite fascinated," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet channel.
It's a super team.
There is no interference.
The building was able to be planned towards the south at the start of the week, until October ends, everything was done.
Promised will also be the income of the workers responsible for the construction, at least if it goes to the establishment of aid finances.
Since the building is changed on Monday to South and the switch of the aspergstraßes was also cut down in Oftities and thus the connection to Rotenburg has also been re-established, the transport site has been dispersed within the place.
The citizens can now re-interrupt from offences from the B27.
It seems to be back to the exit.
"There was partly significant complaints", says the principal chief officer Florian King, responsible for the transport technology management of sanctions.
The inhabitants of bag-up roads, stone stoneways, ports and Weiherrain had to fight with more airlines, because many of them were searching for swimming roads and confidenced in their navis more than the slaughter.
What leaded to some of the Lkws to residential areas.
Since the speed limits were not maintained, the Community requested the measuring vehicle to increase.
"There were significant overwhelmings," says King, who once conscious of the situation.
There's been two to three per minute.
The fastest was about 77 hours per hour in the time-30-zone.
Since the building has continued, however, if it becomes quiet.
For business work at B 27, it is only a small comfort that the road is now open for customers from Rotenburg.
In the cards it doesn't like to look at business.
But that the B 27 representation has led to overwhelming injuries with them, everybody you ask is able to look at.
However, some are more and some are less affected.
Those who have to do less to do with the "end", so produce for other companies, for which the sanction has little consequences.
In the house of Mayer, Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "highest decline", but it also claims that, of course, "this lack of driving".
The most strongest places are along the street.
J. Albert Göhner, Head of the Steakhouse, Krone forms, finds clear words.
This is already threatening.
Not just him, but all the guests have hit it "hart".
The customers were missing from heatings, balings and rottweil.
We must be glad about every euro relocation.
The income is "more than 50 percent".
The road sanction has "returned two years."
The half of his employees had to leave.
If I had a company with 4000 employees and the half would be left, the policy would be differently reacted.
Instead, President Jörg Schmidt has asked for a question of defense, whether it could give a financial compensation with the indication that the guests will benefit otherwise from the benefits of the situation at B 27. Now they should also take the parts that are given by sanctions.
He knows from other land crystals where some of them were handled more widespread.
With all boxes, the gods are sure that his guests will continue.
Finally, the family business has been settled here since 1715, he refers to the long history.
That other stakeholders now are less often predicted because of the complex transport management, it can understand.
If you can't come out, it's also nice.
In order to return his stamming clients after the end of the sanction work, Gods have no doubt.
In spite of the crisis with BSE and birdsgrippe, gods have the impact of B27-bauworks on its clientship for the greatest crisis that has experienced its guest centre in their long-year history.
Six months of construction, it's already brutal.
Forever, in the name of terrorism combating laws.
Following the recent proposals, the Minister of Industrial Maizière presents a slight security package.
But what's a duplication status to do with terrorism?
And what's the coalition partner say to all of that?
Thomas de Maizière gives the prosecutor.
All of its proposals are "politically useful" to the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister in the presentation of his new security package.
They're not demanding anybody.
Other, continuing points would first be discussed within the parties.
I also participate in it.
However, as the Minister of Internal Affairs, he is located on results and on a "reasonable consensus" within the coalition.
The Maizière has left some time after the recent consultations in Wurzburg and Ansbach before he presented its conclusions for security in the Republic.
But these are now more extensive.
Some are already known, proclaimed, assigned, that a new security authority should take care of the skin encrypted communication is not new.
It is not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU proposals on flight data and arms law.
The call after more video oversight and staff for security authorities is also not surprised.
In part, the Maizière starts a second start of proposals that were not to be made with the SPD: he wants to punish a sympathy for terrorist groups and to switch the Dual State Citizenship with the German Pass.
"This will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU man enters.
However, it was worthy and requiring nothing to do with coalition partners without any chance.
A few new ideas are also presented by the Maizière.
They are partly in themselves: he plants rapid procedures for admissions and more opportunities to arrest people before the departure.
Refugees who are targeted in the country should before check their smartphones and open social media accounts for a security review.
In the case of debts for rejected asylum applicants, he wants to make some more worse than for a long time - some of those who act to crimes or make out their papers conscious to swear their identity.
Some of them are political and legally heavy.
Some are still insufficient and letting questions open.
And in some points, for example, in the inequitable treatment of patients, the question is: what is actually to do this with security and terrorism?
Yes, the Majester says, it's important to differ between the issues of refugees and terrorism.
But it couldn't be disappointed that the murderers of Ansbach and Wurzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people faced high refugee concerns for security.
And the things that people have been deeply busy now do not have to declare themselves at the time of election.
The internal security is shocked in the focus.
First the advice in the neighborhood: Paris, Kopenhagen, Brussels, Nizza.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The insurance is great.
And yes, there are choices.
The Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly engaged in internal security.
In the past days, there was high among the two parties.
First, a warm fight on the expense of the Federal Police, then on a assembly of security policy ideas of certain ministers of the Union, where the Heads of Residents also call for a Burka ban and an abrogation of the double State citizenship.
The Majesty also wants to be here for deceasing tones.
He didn't think anything from a double passing.
We have satisfied the debate in Germany.
They're gonna stop, don't be sensitive.
And with a Burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is at all sides of constitutional feast and whether it's really "supportable" for the coalition partner, it's still need to be shown.
It's putting some in what can be careful for the war.
However, the SPD also is currently trying to profile internal security on the subject.
Participant Sigmar Gabriel just signals carefully a conversation and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that is involved to continue to increase security."
People's car is still slow.
Despite such chandals, the supply numbers are increased in the world.
However, it does not run around in all markets.
In the back-up action, there is a meaning.
People's car starts in the second half year of delivery.
In the past year, the largest automotives of Europe can continue to present a further extent, despite the slaughterers, thanks to its many brands and some good markets.
However, in July, the Kernmarks VW slowed mainly in Western Europe, and deceived the total sales, as notified in Dax.
Worldwide, the brand VW sold in July with 449100 cars 1,8% less vehicles than in the previous month.
Only in Western Europe, after China's double market, the sales were 14 per cent under the previous month.
In the home market Germany, the delivery was almost a seventh set up.
Market-in-law Jürgen Stackmann has returned the weakest numbers from July in particular to two sales days less in Europe.
Furthermore, in some key markets, it has undertaken a purchase in the "changed economic framework" market.
In addition to the situation in Turkey, the British vote on departure from the EU also explained a speaker.
In the United States, where the exhibitors are first excalled, there is also a minute to Buche.
Great support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the main housemarks of the Niedersachsen are involved without the chandal: After the first seven months, only a decrease of 0.9% to 3.37 million vehicles to Buche is available.
Concern sales chief Fred Kappler could continue to submit a sales rate from January to July.
1,3 per cent of more vehicles delivered people from this time, 5.904 million in the world.
Volkswagen managed with a software degas test.
Only in Germany VW calls about 2,5 million cars to rebuild in the workplaces.
In the way of the rearing, VW confirmed that the reconstruction of the cars has no negative impact.
After the rebuilding of the vehicles, there is no deterioration for fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or motor service.
The auto-builder describes a "garantie equal" certificate after the rebuilding of the customers, but not speak of a "garantie", as it was called on Friday in business crops.
The reasons are legal fenomena.
The "Focus" had reported that the Volkswagen guarantees his German customers now a guarantee for overwhelming thermal models.
This had been confirmed last Monday VW Deputy in the Federal Transport Ministry.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was a meeting.
"WE has to completely comply with the installations of my Commission and the BAB."
"The derogations are not accepted", declared the Federal Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) under the Ministry.
The VW has agreed that the consumption of fuel, CO2 emissions or motor power does not have a deterioration and all type-approval vehicle values have unchanged.
Volkswagen itself uses the term "Garantie" but not how it was called in business crops.
In the widespread term "Garantie" the people's car is the possibility that customers, for example, come in a half year after the installation of a motor chain - and that could return to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do.
It is also important to avoid that any other damages that have nothing to do with the disappearing channel are insured in respect of possible safeguard arrangements, as it was said.
Therefore, the term "garantie" does not declare the term.
The Raifeisenbank Gmund at the Tegern's Sea requires rigorous swords in the future - as a second Institut in Germany.
Bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday, "It's only about 139 customers that park for 40 million euros on Giro or daily payment accounts."
The German Banks speaks of a single case and does not see a signal: normal spaers should "not be afraid to pay for their sparrow punishment."
If banks pay money by night at the European Central Bank (ECB), they must pay for 0.4 per cent of the penalty.
This expenditure requires the Gmund Railfeisen Bank to return from September from private and enterprises for funds over 100,000 euros to payment accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 costs in the future 400 euros in the year," said Paul.
He stood 40 million euros from a day to the other and could not be evaluated.
"These are with me on the Central Bank account and cause 0.4 per cent of costs", said the bank head.
"I can't add $4,000 for each million."
The costs are now continued in accordance with the principle of insurance.
The bargeld is simply to leave the shoes of the rail bank would be too dangerous: "I've already experienced four accidents, I don't like the fifth," said the Bank's standing.
Most customers had understood and changed to other installations.
Only few were turning to other banks.
Bayern's Society Association stated: "The extreme monetary policy rate of the ECB causes significant costs in all banks."
They are alone "indefinitely impossible to operate."
Some German banks therefore increased their costs for accounting, credit cards or transfers.
With a penalty for installations from three million euros, the Thüringer Peoples and Raffiisenbank Altenburger Land had made skatch lines in 2014.
Michael Kemmer, head-in-Office of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect privacy to pay for funds so much that competition in Germany under banks and Spain is too strong."
One banker said that the Tigern Sea gives it "A customer that has been equipped with the ownership something more slower."
"This can be a problem for a small bank", if they find free money.
The 1911-based Communities Bank Gmund has furniture in Bad Wiessee, Rottach egers, Creuth and Tegernsee.
In the region there are famous players, sportors and entrepreneurs.
The Bayern Communities Association "before there are no further banks that calculate a loan for private installations", said the speaker Ernst.
The President of the Federal Association of German People's Banks and Railfeisen Banks (BVR), Your Fröhlich, declared the end of June: "The wealth to go to the negative towards the privacy is very high."
Competitiveness is hard, and it threatens the immigration of employees to competitiveness.
The customers in Germany will not be allowed to delay it in the width.
Destination plates: Who actually buys shoes plates?
One man in a mid-year-old age loves plates.
Before you earn the commentary to overcome it under the Pseudonym NonAlleAinmenorsMethodual olders with rare sweets, this explanation depends on the current data.
According to YouGov, the many spoken resurrection of skin plates is not to a tree in Millennium which wants to welcome the news of physical objects but to return to Midlife Notalgia.
Those who have recently purchased a plate are all the perspectives of age between 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most probable buyer group.
It is also not horns through hobby samsing - it has a emotional importance: older plate buyers keep their feelings better for themselves (56 % s. 53 %) and enjoys delivering only time (69 % vs. 66%).
But the results of YouGov agree?
If this blog would be a news report on TV, the camera would follow me, while I walk in a busy street in Soho, spend a slightly shocked grey shoot and switch up before I stayed, my hands stand, and say something decisive, "Anyway, let us see closerly."
So let us look at that.
Even if the heart of Sohos slowly enters its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which one of the independent salers was able to purchase, there is like a handly fantastic platform special business.
I would probably ask the cameraman to switch the camera for the next part, in which I stand directly close to different men in such business and try to evaluate her age and beaten by observing.
Steart from Glasgow, 55 whom I by Sister Ray (Datean number: two young women, three men ages) in the Reckless Records (Date number: eight men age, a woman, probably around 20), is a day because of a meeting in London and walks through business to fill the few hours.
He's a Sammler, will I ask?
"I think it's right," he says.
I have about 3.000 or 4.000 plates.
These ball plates, set up (he sent me the shooting shop by email, I didn't follow him home), clothes out the walls of his living rooms.
The reason why he has such a huge number of albens and Singles is the result of his available income: he is now in the ability to buy places that he couldn't sell when he appears and acquire again objects that he sold when he was young and pleasant.
"My things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12, things that I probably was too young to buy me," he said.
It is true that those who purchase the plates are worse introverted and like to spend only time, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.
That's my laster.
Wez, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he is going to meet youGov profile.
However, he has also noted a new wave of people who are influenced by the media help, people who have heard the comeback and seeing themselves to buy their old plates again.
From the discussions I have conducted, people have normally completed their collection by 1998 or 1999.
Customers who first sold their plates to buy CDs, now sell their CDs to get back their plates," he says.
This would explain the tree to adherents of the plate revival of a certain age.
But what is the emotional significance of plates?
It is only a few seconds in a business such as Phonica to recognize that platform business offers a peaceful community of equals.
According to Wez, some of the elderly customers were inclined to the uncontact payment system.
Some platforms feel overcome from the digital world and want to turn back to the stability of trusted skin platforms, from objects that guard happiness of youth.
"I think sometimes it can be the fulfilment of a empty or the possession of material possessors as a kind of comfort," Wez says.
That's me as a Sammler, and I think it's like a lot of people.
It's a simple way to work spiritually.
"We are like their social workers!" a employee from a plate.
A survey of the ICM in April understood that nearly 50% of the people who bought a place in the last month have not heard.
The survey also found that 41% had a plate player that they never used, while 7% of those who buy a plate have no plate players.
At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried, while I'd blow through a stapel at Bossa New Complections.
Johnny, 42 who works at Sounds of the universe (Datean number: three men average age) has noted a "trophene spectrum" of the Revival.
"Another one came in here recently and said, "I don't have a plate player, but I would like to buy a radiohead ball plate so I can put them in the regal," he said.
This is not a large percentage, but it is definitely happening.
More productive, less musical.
We have people who say, "I don't have plate players."
These are young people, not older, who first entered slowly.
Fopp, who had almost a whole eye of the ball plates, has a good public when I go.
There are couples around the 70th, tourists, photos, adolescents and women age.
Even if the atmosphere is something less disappointed than in the previous businesses - the wild Beasts's new synthesizer and sex packing pop instead of experimental jazz drew from the voice speakers - it's good to see such diversity with customers.
Nobody else seems to be alone, but native psychological traumat is difficult to determine if you are close to someone 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, walks in business for a few minutes and considers the variation of the places to sell.
She makes a creature boom than a big invasion.
She does not pay much, so the collection of plates is no real option, she says.
It costs much.
It's easy to hear music from a computer or otherwise, but the beauty of plates is..." she depends on a loved sweet.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stand is a business that will be said that a new generation of plates lovers has to inspire: Urban Outfitters.
While I looked like to need Jeans Hotpants, I observed a group of young teenagers who group themselves for a moment on Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter turned up to buy a Crosley plate player.
On the left, a floor house, a full wall of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac, is a mixing of temporary music and classic skikers, the essential plates for a medium collection.
Nobody looks like it - maybe because they are just decorative, some are so far above that it is impossible to touch them.
It's pure "platten art".
But in view of the fact that every attraction for these objects means more money for the sector and some customers could send to the deep Sohos for more, there is nothing to shut up.
It is not surprising that a group of people who have more time and money than other, even those who are mostly experiencing for luxus products such as plates.
Even if my research shows that the results of YouGov are voted, they will not take into account at least in platte business in Soho, the large number of women's collectors and placeholders that exist in reality, platform business and online forums.
These people probably work hard in school or offices.
They're not safe with the booms by plates of the Berwick Street and the Fields by plates, while they meditate on the shooting view of an unclean, 30-year-old moderner who calls no men who have a medium-year age over the shoes.
The Grönland Hai is the most longest workshop - video report
Scientists say that the Grönlandhai has the longest life level of all the workshops on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who investigated the Haie, says that the record was at a woman from which it was out that it was between 272 and 512 years old and five feet long.
French Court refusal offers on absorption of businesses in the Dschungal refugee stock
A French court rejected a offer of the authorities in Calais, twenty-first provisorical business and restaurants in the Dschungel of Calais, in the county of thousands of refugees.
In a court negotiation this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the State should be able to spend 72 provisional businesses in which persons in the loan, from cigarettes to energy drinks, to sell fresh services, or to sell tea for 50 cents (40 Pence) or to sell for a few euros in provisor restaurants.
Calais prefectures argued that these places should be disrupted because they would be a parallel economy that would not be paid taxes and mount a fire and health risk.
Humanitarian groups shared the Court that businesses and restaurants are important, since the free food time offered by the State supported association and other groups would not provide sufficient food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also concluded that provisor business and restaurants would often offer an apartment and free food time for people.
A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for the instruction of people employing the 72 provisor business, but found that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were absolutely "complete".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food business, coffees and restaurants would play a much greater role than only to feed people who live in extreme pre-conditions.
He said that the areas offer peaceful points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the Niederlands was the Jungle Book Kids' café of the Lager, which will be employed commonly and offer 200 feettimes on the day, English and French class, as well as a advice for the hundreds of protective, uncomplied minors.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to make the kids' coffee.
In a letter to the Guardian, the closure was called "for these children to be a catastrophy of whom the last eight years are."
The two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge of the Migrant estimated on Friday that the number of lives in the dschunger lived over 9.000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steady increase in new congress during the summer.
Trotz Olympia Expedition: Martin remains struggle
Despite his enthusiasming events in the Olympic period, Radprofi Tony Martin will not be able to submit.
"I keep the WM further in view, remain trusting and fighting," wrote the 31-year-old age on Thursday before his leave from Rio de Janeiro at Facebook.
He has no statement for his miserable twelve place on the sugar hot.
"I think it's really hard to comment from yesterday," said Martin.
He should analyze the reasons for the debacle.
At the newspaper WM in October in Katar, Martin actually wanted to fight the title.
"I'm gonna look at everything we've changed last time."
"It is also my position," the three-time Time Meister, who had lost about 54.5 km at midnight more than three minutes on Olympiageer Fabian Cancellara (Sweden).

Concerns increases when start-up for Live video transfers
Other people to look at video games, it's a remarkable - that wants to benefit Microsoft too.
The Technology Concern buys the start-up Beam that has specialized on this hobby.
How much money it runs for the transfer, Microsoft did not share on Thursday.
Beam went with his offer just in January and has already been more than 100,000 users.

Here the Enforcement Trailer comes
Germany's Raser must set up the next generation of speed heat: in different federal countries, including in Hesse and Brandenburg, new swimming devices will be tested to carry timers specially effectively.
The futurely effective enforcement trailer of the Vitronic Company of Vistronics can, for example, be used to emergency points where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, there is no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a stationary blitzer to maintain speed limits.
However, a sustainable mobile construction may be too dangerous or emerging.
The Enforcement Trailer is antark: His battery holds five days in uninterrupted measuring operation, the case data are encrypted through a modem.
The laser measuring technique can also be examined by all vehicles through several samples at the same time.
Variable speed limits and driving bans after hours, driving and vehicle classs can also be monitored.
In higher state, the manufacturer can be moved according to each car with an appendix.
In order to not simply shoot, it is deleted in the measuring industry, so that the routines in the shooting and otherwise disappeared foreign shoes.
Furthermore, an integrated alarm device is intended to protect the blisher before Vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer is tested according to the information of Vitronic in various federal countries and is also used in the meantime.
Foreign authorities also lit the new technology: Youth in France has run 100 pieces, after a order of 150 pieces in the last year.
Britain takes silver in the 7th Rugby, after Fiji Masterclass Gold holt
The impressive performance of the British rugby at the 7th Rugby ended on Thursday at the end of the last garden in the form of the Fijis, when they were struck in Rio with a result of 43-7 in the Deomor Stadium.
Fiji distributed a master class in handling, seat set, spins, line loops and strong strength to win gold - their first Olympic medals every color.
The swimming place was sweet by the unlikely comfort price of silver medaille - the United Kingdom fourd on this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they tried New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The significant decline of the boks, 7-5 in half-final on the same day, could return to them at the end.
But independently, Fiji would have buried a 15-man team in best form in this form.
It could be a comfort for GB - but it will probably not - that at least one British medaille will have a gold medaille for his hair: Fijis Cheftrainer Ben Ryan, the former Chief for England from Wimbledon.
GB had a hard way behind.
8 years ago she lost every game under Ryan at the Adelaide Sevens.
There's only one lost her.
This sleep is hurt, but progress is surprising.
Fiji began wonderful and left the GB's attacks from the path.
It was feeling for the Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. to walk in bus. The World Series winners went up to 5-0, as Osea Colinisau looked at the edge.
With four minutes of play time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right edge that he turned.
12-0 and GB did not take the ball.
A heavy ball of Mitchell stopped reaching a third gate of man Leone Nakarawa, but it was just stopped by Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua left a touchdown in the right edge and was 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the reappointment, and there was still a minute of game time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravovo published further weak bands of the GB team and shooted up to the line to make a gate.
The shift took a 29-0 to the pause.
It's like Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB still learns.
That's too.
GB carried out basic changes to half-time and closed the Fijian laugh for the whole four minutes, which was good for the first half-time, until Josua Tuisova went through a brilliant inter-play of Fiji.
Dan Norton began a trial for GB, made a touchdown on the left edge for a 36-7, but the game has been lost for a long time to benefit from the South Sea Universe whose fans were sweet, smiling fingers and dancing on the tribune.
It was not hard to admire the player's approach Fijis.
Mata Viliame put the i-connexion with another attempt in the last seconds.
The Pilf shocked the Fijis and GB kicked the morning in the races.
Before the day, Fiji Japan was in half-fill, with 20-5-five, and South Africa sloped South Africa in a nice half-final mach from the red - British change of the difference.
Kyle Brown took the boks in the first half, but Dan Norton passed the line with a impressive footwork and reached a door among the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-aside team, saved the win - and thus the silver medaille.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the trainer to ruderside
No emotiary gold will be given than with these games and it wants to call something.
From the first round to the last, 220 hard hairs in the history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found additional significance in their golden moment at the Stacio da Lagoa.
Even if only there were the pains that were on the ruder, there were three voices in the ship. The echo of the trainer Robin Williams was first found as they were to the second Olympiagold in the two without tax race, the first women in the history of the British sport, which took such a measuring table.
Their dominance was absolutely its 39th unclean use, which is also unprofit.
What we're seeing is two brilliant athletes that spend over the surface with the elegance of skins, which does not reflect the type of triumphis on snakes.
With each gold in the routine, a bathroom of wanting helpers contribute to the incredible progress that makes the difference and there was no helper than the trainer who didn't know if he would survive this day just before he was diagnosed with cancer.
As he said, he was risking.
I had a brain cancer that's operative and that's what they did.
If you don't do this, he's wiped out all over there.
It would have been a very bad situation.
It changes a little the look.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The Trio was lucky that he had been treating the beginning of 2014, outside the season, could start what the interruption was at a minimum time if it was in such circumstances.
I needed money, so I had to get better back.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I was on the station about 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet in a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient.
So it's starting.
The ruler is already a challenge, but it makes it even greater.
In the inmediate victory of the victory, their first thoughts on Williams, who had a nervous morning, used something to speak more than others and thus tried to handle his own fears.
Stanning, who was the principal man in the Royal Artillery regime in an Afghan, said, "I was a emotional rake this week, and that may be something extreme, but it means so much."
It's just repeating how much this means I, Helen and Robin worked.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we wouldn't be, so we're going to thank him, and he's the best trainer of the world.
I couldn't want a better person to train or a better trainer.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost rent in the past five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm with which they could not keep their enemy.
Even in the last 500 meters when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close, Stanning and Glover were too much in reserve.
We've been very busy at the moment.
Helen calls "Keep in the process, stay in the process."
It's really important not to let himself smile.
We had a good start, and at the same time we weren't going to do something good.
We wanted no firework today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, to go out and win the rain, which we did too.
The couple will take a time for a year before it takes decisions on his future.
Glover has to appear on a wedding week next, his own with the TV advisor Steve Backshell.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say that it was my last time.
That would mean too much pressure.
In London, it was about six months to understand that I was a Olympiagester.
It was so new to me and I was so stressed.
There's about four minutes.
That feels so much better," she said.
31 years old for clarity
The head of the Waterweck Group "Veitenstein Group", Ruppert Göller, is in the peace.
The association is "simagely" to be used.
A small fresh drinking water association as an example for the large water producers.
Thus it was called in the originalton for a contribution to the Bayerian Rundfunk.
A week later, the Water Forum of the Government of Africans acknowledged the Joint Association.
The work of the Veterinary Steel Group called "bayer-wide as an example".
All of that is Rupert Göller, who was 31 years of the purpose of workers, has 28 years as a business leader.
Now, when he was 65 years old, he was adopted in the peace.
The drinking water association of the veterinary stone group with seats in cottendorf, the community of breadbruns, promotes about 150000 cubits of water each year and provides 32 places and weilers with approximately 5500 inhabitants.
Memberships are Kirchlauter, Breitbruns, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city Baunach.
For other cities and communities there are water supply contracts.
The current President, Breitbruns Citizens-Minister Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller 1985 was set as water stock and was already appointed to the Head of the Goal Association in 1988.
"Their tasks have been very numerous and have been undertaken by the waterbuilding and maintenance work on offices and organizations, budget planning, calculation of expenditure and contributions until weekends,” said the Chairman.
As an excellent event, she called the inclusion and involvement of the new burns (1994), basic purchases in the field of the new burns (1998) and the deterioration of farmers, the sanction of the High Reserveers (1999), the renewing of a central computer design (2004) and the part-time performances of water guidelines.
It hasn't provided a smooth condition and has always been renewed because waters were depressed and drinking water is the most important food.
In her laudatio she loving gods faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has used a lot of hearts for his water-scale association and has regularly lived the water-scale association as it would be his own company.
A few weeks ago, however, he could introduce the concept of the Veterinary Steel Group on the Nitrate Reducing before the water forum of the district of underground diseases.
For this, he has received a lot of recognition and loving.
Rupert Göller, who worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best water expectation and he's been a faithful button.
We were together a shooting team.
As high points of his view, he called the brain construction and restructuring of the Association.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult use of this was, however, the raw burning on the upper holder at Kirchlauter at the Kirchlauter on 3 January.
Here, at least 17 degrees, the whole night will be worked in order to enable the areas to be supplied with water.
Also, the supply of new bruns has only been able to keep the maintenance because you filled the high conservator of Pett City with smokes.
The business management of the drinking water association was transferred to Daniel Stormer from Lauter, which joined the follow-up of Rupert Göller.
The soprancist Anna Netrebko is open to the autism of her son, Tiago, and moves to other parents concerned: "You must have the courage to speak about it."
"The medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old age of the Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera".
When the disease was recognised with her son, she thought she should die.
However, the eight-year-old Tiago has been good before and now teaches privacy in New York where it is the best therapy.
"To give an example, if I ask him what returns two years when I sang Scala at the mail country, he remembers nothing," Netrebko said.
But he is the most happy man on earth.
Tiago is connected to the basebarite Erwin Schrott.
She now married Tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relation state in Bargtenesse - Man shoots on life dangers
A 35-year-old man shooted on Friday at 10:45 in a multi-familiar house in Bargteitye (Kreis Stormarn) on his partners and died.
"The man has called himself with us and stated to shoot his life threat," said a police speaker.
The murder is on the fleet, after him is publicly banned.
It's a lot of buddy, because Sven S. could be on the car.
The man is about 1,80 m large, muscles, bruned and has a glass.
The police has published a photo by him.
However, it's a few years old.
In this way, the man's taking a sweet.

Steel - Light view for German steel industry
The German steel industry of crisis and energy intensives remains decreased by additional costs in millions.
Financial burdens threatening the sector from the ecostrom promotion are from the table.
It remained in the release of the renewable energy environment in the stocks called the German steel industry, said the Federal Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the Western General Journal (WAZ, free-day output).
"I'm really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years."
At first, the European Commission had planned to ask the steel producers to use the gas from the hochof to generate electricity for their own consumption.
The steel industry threatened additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year in the German sector.
Gabriel said that it is now a principle union with the Commission of the EU in discussion with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
First, when the generators are replaced in the steel works, an EEC environment of 20% should be increased.
But this will not be decreased in the steel industry.
The IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the EU Commission on the Provision of Electricity.
This is widely set out by the status Quo of the current rules.
It is particularly important that Gabriel has successful efforts for the steel industry.
"In view of our campaign 'Star is the future', this is the first step."
"We have to follow."
"All in the reform of emission rights, the climate and employment goals are to be decreased", explained IG Metall Chief Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel sector in Europe has been under supercapacity and a significant price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.
In the past year, the situation continued when the world's largest producers in China faced the weakening home demand of a massive steel on the world market.
European manufacturers propose Chinese steel convergences.
During this spring, the situation has been disappointed.
For a demonstrated import duties on import steel effects, the economic perspectives in China have been achieved.
It is not clear how sustained the price refund is.
The German Branchen Primus Thyssen Group remained careful on Thyssen Group on Thursday.
Lastly, the prices would have been re-established.
The sector reacts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssen-group did not lastly want to exclude the closure of individual works.
In the German steel industry, around 86000 people were employed at the end of 2015.
In July, the German steel manufacturers are careful despite increased prices and increased orders.
They produced with 3.4 million tonnes well six percent less raw steel than in the past month, as the economic association shared the steel on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the quantity produced now returned to the second month.
Since the beginning of the year the production is two percent below the previous year value.
In the next months, the association shall be calculated by a improved term of contract with a increased decline.
Community, Spirit, Health: Singen keep senior good
The Singen of Ursel Kipp has joined her whole life: As a young girl was in school, she taught the Music Fach at the school, and today the 78-year-old girls in a senior chor.
"Singen moves me - emotional and physically", she describes.
After a test, she feels balanced, pleasant and overall more living, she says.
Besides her health and spirit, she does something good.
Because Singen is just from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the German Seniorenga.
Most seniors sing in the chor and share the joy of the music, describes Hackler.
The regular collection of seniors can link and plant social contacts.
Because often solving social and family structures in age, a chor is an ideal opportunity to spend time with others.
This experience also has made the Ursel Kipp in their chor: "I'm going to talk and organize to leave the others and learn to each other - a chor is a very special form of meeting."
Singen can be positively encouraging, I mean Hackler.
Because the senior trains a deep and controlled breath.
Whoever regularly demands his lungs is not so fast every day from the bridge.
Even if this is to get the voice in age, the song is a optimal hobby.
A very special effect on older people often has the singen, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labor Community of the Senior Organizations.
In the old generations, the common song had much higher places, it belonged to every day, both in school and in the free time.
Lenz often observes that the songs or hearing of songs in older people are cutting many memorys, often associated with positive feelings of their youth time.
With song texts and especially melodies, themselves demended persons have a long-term reverse event.
The head is also requested for a special performance in singen, explains Lenz.
It is a great cognitive challenge to concentrate on your own voice and on a prescribed rhythm and adapt to the other songs.
Some older people who live alone are so that they are not only focused on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the acknowledgement that you're obtained by the song in the chor means Hackler.
An excited public is a great loving.
The feeling of self-value also increases through the song in the chor.
If I work for something, I'll be better and wake out of me - this experience strengthens.
Good reason to start with the song, there's enough.
Whoever wants to try a new hobby shouldn't smile - even if he means to have a little talent, Lenz.
You're not sing alone - with 50 sing people, who's there when you get a voice?
In search for the appropriate offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler.
When someone from the known circle in a senior, you can simply connect.
Many cities also offer overviews about the Cuts in the area.
Whoever wants to sing in a church chor can directly go to the congregation or to the priests of the church.
Many artists are also found on the Internet.
Those who do not have access to the Internet may ask the family, friends or neighbors for help in the Internet search.
Whoever has lust to sing should unless a chor, he's sweet Hackler.
Sing the soul does good and has something free - it applies to each age.
Kats react sensible than cats on the cry of the youth
Biologists have studied in Hannover which effects have the call of Katzenbays on adult animals.
To their surprise, the mie also did not fry, but they were always equivalent to women.
Women's cats can recognise the degree of catzenbays at the mile of the small ones.
They react on 10 percent more faster on the laundry of kitchens that are in great emergence, such as scientists from the animal health school and the medical high school Hannover (MHH).
Caters also respond to the call of kitchens - however, it is always equal.
"Openly, the acoustical differences between the mie of less and strongly administered young men are not real or not", said the biological Wiebke Konerding by MHH.
It is a study statistical, published at this Friday in the "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In an previous investigation, the research team had already found that the duration and sound height of the kitchen swimming cry was different with the urgency of their assistance.
Overall, nine adult cards and eight kitchens were observed from MHH's animal maintenance.
You were predicted for a call of small people taken from the box for three minutes and separated from Mother and Brothers.
On the other hand, they were faced with crystals of stronger cuts that were further higher.
The researchers keep their results despite the low-scale tests.
"All women, even those who have not yet had their own practice, have reacted to the cry," said Konerding.
They turned back to the sound speaker when this call of the very sweet kitchen.
This capacity may be born or developed with the sex.
"It was a surprise that the men have reacted", said the biology.
In the past, scientists have already investigated the reactions of women and men on baby-care.
In addition, some studies showed that women reacted more sensitively to sweetlings, even if they were mothers or not, reported the biological Marina Scheumann.
Podolski greefed with "Gaala" to Supercup
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, a prison order was taken against the only football star Hakan Sükür.
He is intended to be a member of a terrorist group.
The first time after the swimming pocket, in Turkey again is a major football game.
Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul on the supercup in Konya is clearly the official line: "Business as usual".
Until the derogation in July, the Government has not been affected daily by normal citizens.
However, this is not for those suspected to listen to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, which is responsible for the slaughter.
This will not be done before the football.
Under the previous Starkicker Hakan Sükür, the State Authority made a arrest order.
This will then be proposed to be a member of a terrorist group in the middle of the United States.
In short, it is to be an ambassador of the preaching worker Fethullah, responsible by the President of the State Recep Tayip Erdogan for the slaughter.
Although the exemption conditions for the first 90 days are passed until October, it actually has no effect on the life of most Turkeys.
The "democracy wages" on public places in the whole country has declared Erdogan on midnight to end.
The sport is - like the whole country - divided into adherents and enemies of Erdogan.
Special fans of the workshop Besikta are not traditionally among the friends of the President.
What the green of Turkishs, but in view of dramatic experiences in the history, is the strict rejection of military pushes.
There are even the fans - unlike their hearts for Galatasaray or Besikta.
In Pokalshigger "Gaala" it will be particularly at Lukas Podolski.
His sportive value was made by the Columbiars in the past season under evidence: With 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-olds ended his first game time as the topscorer of its agreement.
In the end of the game against Fenerbahce, he achieved the 1:0 sequencies.
The "Fanatic" newspaper triggered him: "He was the best on the place."
He closed the season in an excellent way and secured his manity the pokal.
Thanks "Poldi" the swimming season for the register's register found a slight end.
The "League" in the Champions of League also spent early in Europe League.
In the super Lig, it was only to Raang 6s.
The season wasn't good.
The pokal was the only way to win something.
"It's what we did and that's the most important," said Podolski.
For Master Beektas, the game year is better.
Especially thanks Mario Gomez, who met with 26 seasons as a super-Lig-True King the base to the 14th Title.
This is also the reason why the fans continue to hope to return to the 31-year-old.
In this way, the Gomez only had announced in the AC Florence treaty and in the Besiktas only after the slaughter, not to return because of the political situation in the country after his EM vacation.
"When Mario wants to come to us, he must only say it," said the "Kicker" club chief Fikret Orman.
However, this should be ready to reject around a third of its $7.5 million annual year-year summarized, but Orman clearly stated: "We cannot pay his content at Florence."
Nevertheless, these athletes have medal cancers at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already broken two times because of Dopings (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblowerin Julia Stepanowa may not start in Rio.
Other transferred lightathletic sinners can just laugh in it - they fight in Rio through medailles.
The Doping theme determines as before the shock lines at the Olympic games in Rio.
The Russian swimming sister Julija Jefimowa, who had sent its starting rights shortly before the games, was evacuated and exploded when they started 100 meters of breast.
It was a scourrier scenario: with a laugh she was still stolen in the hall and had tried with her reception.
When he found that she wouldn't get gold, the public took out into a jubel tower.
But there are still many other sports, despite the past doping in the Olympic games in Rio.
Here's an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-staffel/USA): The 34-year-olds belong to the most surrounded figures in the lightathletic.
He was already broken two times because of Dopings (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his bathroom runs the Olympicians of 2004 and the ex World Meister even more fast than before, it is 100 m in 9.80 seconds the number of one of the world and applies to the greatest challengers of Usein Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100,4x100-m-Jamaika): The second Olympiasiher and seven times World Master of 2010 had to rest a six-month sphere after she was demonstrated to take the pain of Oxycodon.
After an operation, she had strong dent pain, the 29-year-old boys defended.
Sandra Perkovic (discuss/Croatian): 2011, the Olympiasier of 2012, World Master of 2013 and European Master of 2010 to 2016 has been tested positively on the prohibited stimululans midst of methylexanamin.
Perkovic has received the scientific receipt and was discarded six months.
The four most wide bears in this year go to the account of the large gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-staffel/USA): Peking Olympiageer and twice as 400 m, 2010 was positively tested, and 21 months were locked.
A means for penis increase has been responsible, Merritt rewarded.
In this year the 30-year is over 200 and 400 meters of the fastest man in the world.
Iwan Tichon (Hammerwurf, Whiterussland): Never one athlete has been so many medailles ever known.
Thus Tichon lost his WM title of 2005 nine years later after testosteron doping was identified with him.
The average 40-year-olds had also to be allocated to Olympia-Silber 2004 because of steroid dopings and the EM title 2006 because of testosteron misuse.
The also known bronze medaille of the Olympic Games 2008 was returned to the CAS Court of Sport.
With 80.04 m, he's on the ring two of the world's front lists.
Liu Hong (20 km Goen, China): The world redirector and gold favorite were only tested in May, but it is possible to start in Rio.
During the 29 years of old World Meeting, there were indications on the adoption of a prohibited food supplementary, which the WADA WADA spres of the World-Anti Doping Agency was decreased and slowed on July 13th.
Bombenterror in Thailand - Austrian blessed - More dead
The Austrian message in Thailand was in contact with the woman, said the speaker of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thomas Schnöll, freeday few.
They have suffered snippets and were treated in the hospital, but they have already been able to leave it again.
Her home trip planned her for the beginning of September.
Whether other explosions on the holiday island of Phuket, and in the southern towns of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian state citizens, it is even unclean.
In this regard, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs continued to contact the local authorities, so slightly.
About 200 kilometers south of the capital of Bangkok, Hua Hin, first on Thursday, were explosed in two bombs.
According to the police, a Thai country was killed and about 20 people were damaged, including Austrians, three Germans, three Netherlands and three Italians.
On Friday, two springs were up again, and the authorities were killed another person.
The bomb explosion was also reported by Phuket in early.
In the detonation near the Badestrand Patong, who was favored by holidays, a taxi driver was damaged after police instructions.
In Surat Thani, on the south coast of the country, we explosed another bomb that killed a city officer.
The spectrum has been in the air, according to the authorities, in a flower bed before the coastal police reverse.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang at the south-west coast and in Chumphon at the South Coast requested several injuries.
You go from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, called it.
"The bomb captures take the same document," said the Armee General Danai Crimethavee freeday fee before journalists.
"We're going out that it's a coordinated attack."
It is too early to express possible reasons - however, it is probably to handle the acts of muslim rebels.
The Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern that is typical for the bombs of muslim separators in the south of the country.
The Thai police, however, declared that the attacks were not related to Islamic resurrection or international terrorism.
"This is only local Sabotage that is limited to limited areas and provinces", said one speaker in Bangkok.
Moreover, the bombs of enemy of the dominant military junction have been placed.
In the past days, the authorities had received a secret indication on the predecessor action in the south of the country - however, they had not been informed of the exact time and place.
It's still unexpected what group behind the appeal.
The police advised its officials in the whole country to strengthen the security of important government buildings and aircrafts, rail heights, tourist attractions, restaurants and awards.
In Thailand there are still smaller bombs, but they are not usually against tourists.
In Hua Hin is a palace used for years by King of Thailand Bhumibol Adulyadej.
Following the current explosions of bombs, the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends that the Tayland Security Authority guide the instructions of its homepage.
High security risk (security level 3) indicated for the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla and Preah Vihear and Environment.
After interferences between the security forces and the Muslim population camps, it is not necessary to travel in these provinces.
Increased security risk (security stage 2) has been in place for the rest of the country.
The proposals held on Thursday and Friday few days after a restrict reference on a Constitution developed by the Militaryjunta.
This is also the great impact of the military in the coming years.
Junta-Chef and Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs had been an attempt to switch chaos, while the country is in a direction to stability, to improve the economic situation and towards tourism.
The military runta, who had taken the power after the 2014 phase of blue distress, was very favorable to have brought the Kingdom back to stability and order.
Nevertheless, the military has not been able to obtain the situation of muslim rebellious rebellion since years in the outer south of the country.
In the conflict, more than 6500 people were killed.
Only one year ago, in Bangkok, 20 people were killed in the attack of a popular Hindu grin - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the worst attack of the recent history of the country.
The right "identifiant movement" is in the visibility of the Constitutional Protection Office.
After a number of country officers, the Constitutional Protectors have also observed the group.
"We see the 'identified movement' points for complaints against the free democratic rule", said the Constitution Chief Hans-Georg Maachten of the German Presse Agency in Berlin.
Thus, immigrants are dismissed extremistly from the Middle East of Islamic faith or from the Middle East.
That's why we also look at the movement.
The "identified movement" is a grouping with French roots, which is also active in Germany since 2012.
It turns against "Multiculti-Wahn", "uncontrolled mass migration" and "the loss of his own identity by transmission".
Constitutional protectors in nine federal countries - Bremen, Bayern, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Niedersachsen, Sachsen and Thüringen - already observe the "identified persons".
He said that his authority had agreed closely with the country officers in the decision.
"Groups like the 'identified movement' try to take their target group where it is", said the Constitutional Protection Chief.
Generally, extremists try to speak to them with youth right language, often with poppier music.
This was also the Islamics as well as the legal extremists.
This is not a good advertising for the own thing.
The Propaganda has to address the people emotively.
Young people are in a special way attracted.
That's dangerous.
Lastly, it was given from several federal countries reports on "identified" contacts on AfD policies.
He said he didn't have any knowledge of it.
Constitutional protection contacts have only been relevant from a certain point.
It comes to the fact that each party - in this case, by certain people extremistly change their goal and become so extremist.
It is therefore indicative if such persons have an impact on the parties.
This is not recognisable.
In view of the clear increase in legal motive crimes and attacks against asylum applicants and refugee events, Maasser said that he would not speak in this regard yet of the new right terrorism.
But we have found in the past years that it can give legal terrorist structures.
There was the "Old School Society" group or the freetaler group.
It may be reasonable that other legal terrorist groups or small groups are planned against asylum demanders, refugee homes or attacks from other legal extremist motivations.
However, a German or European control of law terrorism is not recognisable.
The existing groups were located at the regional level or in social networks.
It was concerned that many of the controversies were on the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scenes.
That's the worryful thing.
Many of the actual suspects in attacks on asylum events had not previously been known as criminal, politically motivated criminals or actors of the right scenes.
"Those have therefore started crimes that had no complaint with legal extremists that may have been politically indifferent, or have chosen, for example, CDU, SPD or links, which, however, have raised themselves by an extremist stimling machine."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte will be on the internet
Not always determine the Olympics or World Records the slaughter lines at the Olympic games.
This shows the courageous arrival of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the lightly overwhelming swimming swimming from Ethiopia was so late that he was not to see in the TV images.
He simply disappeared - unlike the expense was chosen.
In the social networks, Habtes became viral internet stream.
In fact, the 24-year-old age ends with a decline of 48 seconds and engaged in the 59th place of 59 Starters.
However, it was not just his sporting figure that moved to the attention of international media.
Why, however, the 24-year-olds participate in the Olympic games?
The Ethioopians received a special starting law from the international Swing Association.
This is distributed to make skins more known in sub-represented countries.
Since the majority of the sports in Ethiopia runs, Habte just wanted to do something else.
Preparation is all: Robel Kiros Habte makes himself ready for the great journey.
Quickly the first piece names made the round.
Some media called him "robel of the Wal".
The English boulevardblatt "The Sun" was sweet about him with "Pad Bod".
His time, he was just a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter free style, did not play a role.
Compares with "Eric the Eel" were also taken.
At the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney, Eric Moussambani was careful for the mediaal attention.
Indefinitely, the invasion of the skin from Equatorial-Guinea, when he had to occur in a course of over 100 meters of freestyle alone.
Frenetically Moussambani was shocked.
At that time, only eight months ago, the 22-year-old teenage learned to smile Olympia and had never completed such a distance before the coast.

Trump does not look close to the threatening elections
The Republican Presidency candidate Donald Trump speaks of an election meeting in Florida.
If it's nothing to be the president of the United States, Donald Trump has already a alternative.
Then he's walking into the holidays.
If Donald Trump lost the US Presidency election in November, it would be relatively equivalent to him: "The last time I'm going to cut it or I've got a very beautiful, very long holiday", said the Republican candidate in a phone interview with the US franchisman CNBC.
If it is not rich for him at the end of the political correction, it's okay, Trump.
So he called the US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democratics, Hillary Clinton, as the founder of the Islamic terrorism State (IS).
Within his party, it was still more resistance.
Post increases in the trade with electronic transporters
An Electronic Training Vehicle of German Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the danger is obviously great.
The post plants to sell their electric vehicles StreetScooter also.
In Korze, the concert wants to start the trade with the transporter.
The post wants to offer its electronic transporters from the next year also on the free auto market.
"We want to increase in the sale to thirds," said a post speaker on Friday.
The company has been checking for months whether it should also be sold to other operations by its own developed StreetScooter, with the letters and packs.
Post-president Jürgen Gerdes had said that it was always re-interviewed by handworkers.
According to the information of the News Machine "The Spiegel" the Bonner Concerns will involve in the mass production of vehicles.
In the post-fabrication plane, the company will build up from up to 10,000 cars per year and shock.
Gerdes had announced that the concerns would clearly increase its fleet of electric vehicles and spend a full conversion in the environmentally friendly vehicles.
"We're going to make a very robust step direction 2020", he said end of July.
I can imagine that we're gonna get the full float.
The StreetScooter is active on German streets since 2014.
GfK Guide is delayed after payments of business
The GfK Consumer Research company cut off his chief Matthias Hartmann.
The retreats were suddenly, but not very surprised.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK acknowledged that the steel of heads of Matthewhias Hartmann will be more insecure, as long as it was promised.
Turbulences at the ring of the Nürnberger market research company GfK: After re-interrupting business numbers and the retreatment of the company management, the world number five of the sectors will be held before a personnel restart.
GfK-President Chief wants to leave the company in the end of the year.

The leadership in the State was already overlooking the previous member Gerhard Houseruckinger in September, with the company.
He must officially take the function of a "president speaker" until a follower was found for Hartmann.
As a reason for retreats, the company called "divergent opinions" on long-term business policy orientation.
Detailed did not want to call a company speaker on Friday.
Who will lead to the market research company to be still unexpected.
On Friday, it was said that the shareholders had recently been depressed about the continued success of the restructuring covered over the years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been on the GfK split since 2011.
"But the fruits of restructuring are not yet seen after five years," said it.
In view of the last bad GfK business payments, each shareholder will eventually be unreasonable.

In the second quarter of 2015, the GfK has produced a concert win of 19.7 million.
Accidentes - Bus swimming in snakes in Graben: 8 slaughtered
On a travel bus accident with 43 seniors as passengers, on Thursday, 8 people are injured on Thursday in Krummmhorn (Landkreis Aurich).
Two of the infringements suffered seriously, the police shared.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a traveling company from Eisenach had to exempte its information from an incompatible laster that was carried out on the trail.
The bus came down right from the street and switched into a snake, as a speaker of the Aurich/Whitmund police reported.
"On the basis of the bus situation, people couldn't leave the bus autonomy," she said.
The fires freed the insects.
Six relief cars and a notar tank came to an accident on the country Street 2.
The untreated travelers were returned from a line bus to the crowd of the crowd of Pewsu.
They should wait at a replacement bus of the travel company.
The investigators requested the rail drivers and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The costs per cubikmeter waste includes from 1 October 2016 for the area of the Newdorf/Reuth/Welchenkahl 3,44 euros; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3,36 euros (before 2,26 euros) and for Azendorf 3,64 euros (of 2,18 euros).
The installation in Azendorf will be increased at the late time when appropriate improvements are needed.
After an overall calculation, the water price in Azendorf will then be 4,37 euros per cubicmeter.
As Master Bernd Steinhouses (CSU) reported, the Country Council of Kulbach has been determined that undertaking for these waste installs was undertaken.
The Casendorf market has been obliged to operate costlessly because of legal basis.
From 1 October 2016 the citizens, as well as the shopping and industry firms of Wolchenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg, will have to be entered into the currency hotel.
Tax increases are between 48 and 67 per cent.
As Head of Director Herbert Schmidt showed to the body, a new calculation of the expenditure for the market sector was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over-related sub-detections were compared from the previous calculation period.
The gravity rate increases founded in order to ensure that there were relatively small plants for all three waste plants with a very low water accident, which was between 6800 and 12000 cubitmeters per year.
Thus, due to the low distribution basis, for example, the applications for necessary repairs of several thousands of euros would be seriously affected.
In addition, it is easy to relax in all three plants.
Furthermore, in the returning calculation period, all three plants have not recently occurred because of their age of sanctions and reparatory applications.
The installation in Azendorf was nearly 30 years old, the facilities for Wolchenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth and Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years old.
Schmidt noted that in the Azendorf installation, the mechanical relief plant was to be discovered because of a damage.
In the pumpwerk of Welhenkol, the nearly 20 years of age had to be removed, and Lopp had to be evacuated after about 20 years of exploitation of the first cloud, swimming the cloud and struggling an additional relief opportunity to keep the water laws in a future manner.
Schmidt: "This extraordinary applications came to the continued care and maintenance costs to be taken into account in the new calculation period."
The equivalent applies to electrical costs that are still significantly below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Steel households clearly made that in the low downfall in the three installations, the applications for the exploitation and maintenance were "complete".
In addition, Schmidt, the market community of large maintenance costs remained in the last 20 years.
The situation for the plants concerned will continue to remain precarious to the end of stone households, such as the supply area of the Water Training Association Friesen Watch to these installations, because it is a deficiency institution.
Bulgaria benefits the first time in 8 months of inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July 1% was a monthly basis.
This is the highest value (of June 2012) and the first over 0 since October last year, as a positive 0.2%.
The annual average inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was measured according to the CPI -0,8 %.
The consumer price index compared to June 2016 was 101.0 %, i.e. the monthly inflation was 1,0 %.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (Juli 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 -0.2%.
In July 2016, a price increase in the following groups of consumers was observed in comparison with the month: food and non-alcohol drinks (1,7 %); transport (1,8 %); free time and culture (6,3 %); restaurants and hotels (1,2 %); different goods and services (0,3 %).
The prices fall in clothing and shoes (2.2%); mobile equipment, budget equipment and routine expectations (0.5%); health (0.1%).
The prices remained as in the month in alcoholic drinks and tobacco; apartments, water, electricity, gas and other fuel; communication; and education.
Snapchat "animal effect" criticized as Asian carriage
Snapchat says that this filter is animized, but some observers say it is unsecual to races.
With its filter tool, Snaapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change the reality and play with identities in a way that is already limited to absurde.
You can turn into ananas, a dog or a figure that might be sweet from a roy lightenstone.
The filters are uncompressed, properties rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All failures have been achieved to publicity.
Snapchat filters have made themselves critical in the past, in which they were accused of propagering the App Blackface or white skin as a beauty side.
When this week some users predicted a filter that gave them slippers, false teeth and shocking angles, some critics called a racist carriage of Asians - "Gelb face".
They asked whether these repeated contrasts showed a greater problem that the company has diversity.
News and reputation were widely distributed at midnight, with reports of The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat reported that it had been disabled.
The company gave an apologize: The filter was a hommage of anime charaker and not as a carrière of Asians.
But foreigners who have experienced the racism reminded the filters of harming clergy.
Others decided the anime comparison.
In a email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose Twitter was widely distributed that the filter was "trained and pleasant".
She added that "that is difficult to argue with the opposition of a very opposite Asian carriage and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not slight, but that the face of the skin has been taken into an appreciative extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that overcomes this cultural steel ratio.
The American culture seems to be confused in an unfinished diversity and integration fight, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all keep in the hand.
And Snapchats, a large public of young people - who are different in race matters than their older opposers - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat filters creates a image that is political for a user, "that's much harder that such things remain unremarkable than previously was the case," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu decided to remove its Snapchat account to others as a product manager and engineer for media.
In an appendix for media and telephone interview, she said she believes that racial contrasts reflect the lack of diversity in setting practices in Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the white, only men's leadership and finished their opposition with a Hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Only, they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their skin, so they can take such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but are not in positions where they are safe or like to say something."
Others share their views, a complaint that mostly unresponsively left Snapchat.
The company does not publish numbers for the diversity of its involvement, and is on its status as private enterprises.
On Thursday, the Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but a speaker recently established a staff responsibility that focused on sub-represented population groups and internal integration efforts.
Zhu said to her side that she will be letting her Snapchat account closed and added, "I ask me whether they need more users like us to say that this is not O.K.."
Army Management False ISIS Secret Service Information, the Committee of the Congress
Military members of the United States Central Command changed information in order to describe a optimistic image of the war against the Sog Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it would have allowed the actual situations in place, reported a study committee of the Congress on Thursday.
The provisional report, prepared by a Task Force of the Republic of the Force of the Force, the Secret Service Committee and the Committee of the Peacebudgetary, reports of great inadequacy under the Central Command of Secret Service Analysts, which reported how their evaluation was made on the United States' efforts to fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarter in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Lakes.
A newspaper article reported the report. "Aviation services, which were typically transferred by higher Centcom commands, regularly marked a positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism than it had allowed the real situations in place and were more positive than analysis of other news services."
"What happened at Centcom, it is inacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analysis are presented to our political leaders," stated Ken Calvert, the Republican member of the Representative House.
The leadership errors in Centcom are available to the best part of the organization.
The tenth report shows detailed problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analysis of the United States' efforts in training the Iraqi forces.
Although it does not provide direct instructions for government spots under Obama's instructions to change the reports, analysts showed how to draw up a more optimistic image of the threat of the Islamic State, including known as ISIS or ISIL.
"After the first half of 2015, many Central Command Press Communications, opinions and comments were significantly positive than it corresponds to the facts."
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military return of Moscou could already start in April or May 2015.
Mossu, the second largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"In the months of investigation, it's so clear", said Mike Pompeo, the Republic of Kansas, in an opinion.
From the midst of 2014 to the midst of 2015, the central command sponsors changed the public service reports in order to reverse the risk by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicns called the Task Force in life after they were resigned that analysts were concerned about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday is still completed by more detailed expertise during the investigation.
Furthermore, the Centcom reports are investigated by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
On Thursday, the Democratic members of the News Service Committee published their own recognition that agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republic of Task Force.
"In 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an excessively limited process for the creation of ISIL and the Iraqi security services", reported the higher democracy in the Committee, member of the Representative House Adam B. ship, in an opinion.
This process, as Mr. ship, "declined the publication of public services reports", damaged the moral under analysts and "gab very little space for dismissing opinions".
But Mr. ship and the democratics gave no indication to have found the white house in the Centcom Analysts about a "determined political opinion".
The preliminary results of the conference's findings were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast".
In August last, the New York Times reported the investigations by the Pentagon Inspector General, which were registered after complaints of Centcom Analysts.
Mr Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a speaker of the Pentagon, stated in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the reports of the Congress, while the investigations of the general Inspector are still in profit.
But he also acknowledged that "experts sometimes have different opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the news services and the defence minister welcome a controversial debate on these important issues of national defence."
The investigations have reacted to the question of a successful air campaign under the American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a holding which is made in this respect by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).
The accused of the last year, however, took the question of how President Obama can leave the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State recalls stricts over over ten years, as a Centcom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, was a copy of how the current government under George W. Bush made the recommendations of many analysts only predicted a small placement instrument in Iraq and a little time to think about the consequences of 2003 invasion.
Mr Hooker also played a key role in opposing the current reporting on the Islamic State.
In the past year, Mr. Hooker reported that the Government's statements against the waste of the Islamic state had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorism group, as these provisors had been employed in order to sell oil on the black market.
However, this recognition was not published, reported the Times in September.
Centcoms then command chair, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislatives because of his extremely positive assessment of the war at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin went in the rest of April and was replaced by Gene Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
The United States wins the fourth match in the field of women, a showdown with Britain is before
One day after she shot three tours over a 6-1 wine over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two towers for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans wined with 3-0.
Five towers in two games should actually be a thinking performance, but Bam (27) said they couldn't remember what they had ever done.
"I don't know." She said.
I don't listen to those who keep their door in the memory.
However, it knows that the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic Competition fight and are in their group with the Britishs on the first place that remains slaughtered after their twice-0 winning against Japan.
Britain and the United States will meet each other on Saturday on the last round game.
Both teams have already been qualified for the fourth-final, the game will decide which both of them will reach the first and second place within their group of six teams.
The first placed will go away from the strong hole lands that lead to the other group.
Like always the game can go on Saturday, the Americans have solved a surprising mixture through their success history, four years after they landed at the last 12 places at London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She took up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and the first time with three years of a hockey shock in hands (that's two old sisters played the sport at the Drexel university), with 16 years of age, she became a national player in the United States, the most recently in the history of the team.
She passed the Olympics in 2008, as she could not qualify for the Framework.
Then the year 2012, in which she and her team slaughtered everything for her and her team.
The following year, Craig Parnham, a English country, trainer of the National Team, began to apply the things to better.
"An cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We didn't have the jobs in London that we had now.
We've been able to get the ruder completely.
On Thursday Bam opened the Torrents in the first half of the game with a backup from the native area.
While without winning in the tournament, the team showed himself surprised, and maintained the level of play of 1-0 to the third fourth, until Bam took the game into their hands.
She completed a sprint with the flanking ball over the left flanke, then moved to the middle and led the ball into the gate to make a 2-0 lead to the Americans.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last neighborhood.
The Shutout was the first of the whole tourner for the United States tournament Jackie Briggs, who had to get a gate in each of the previous games.
She's got a way.
Just like Bam.
"We're in a good position," said Parnham, but how good it's going to go from the next game on Saturday.
In the round of the Olympic Games, the center of the Trampolin
Whereever you are, how late it is, they're the Olympic games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel a slightly and uncertainty, a rather stake between competitive and trials.
It's like the olympic fake itself a broken stab that is available from the arm's shoes to the swimming to the tourner to the triathlete.
You can't enter the TV to read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the waiting shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the conflict between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's still a Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who was the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman's warm with sweet, could be through these known names that were sent to the first time, built by sponsors and well-being TV if he was a swimming, turner or even swimming.
But Dooley, 28, from the Lake Forest, California, fights in the Olympic Trampolin tours.
The Olympic flag does not light any event equally.
More from the center, partly in the shadow, the sports that are not generally recognised: air pitoles, boats, bath minton, Taekwondo.
We'll always have the shooting and we'll be able to rule it for a long time.
But if I do awarely arguments for my own love, then let me spend the attention on the discred shape of the trampolin.
Although the trampolin spring has been an olympical event since 2000, as it had been in Sydney, it was so ridicule in the last 16 years that many of the people I asked had not knew that it was an olympic sport.
This could also be a regional ignorance.
Although the U.S. Athletes sent to the competition fight, there has never been a medaille in the trampolin springs and had a athlete that has done it until 2012.
The Chinese and Russians are to share the prices for men and Chinese and Canadians to share those for women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLenan from Canada this year will defend their gold medals from London.
The trampolin spring has a certain foreign charm, partly because it is suitable for the unexpected ears for a clown school than that for the Olympic games.
At this point, I should admit that I'm not an expert, but just a connected discovery.
It has a humoristic potential - the cartonic quotes to never end its opposition - but also thanks to the tourn and smoking, the two sports, which join it in the most important.
The word "Trampolin" is from the Spanish El Trampolin, which means so much as "Sprungbrett".
Encouraging winners are shocking on a giant trampolin, shooting nearly 30 feet in the air and have to have a number of movements (which, heat and salts), before they are on the feet countries.
They are evaluated according to the official Olympia programme following implementation, difficulty and "floor time".
Twenty-third atletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will come to each other in Rio.
The most common olympic vector is just out.
Medaillers need to continue to gold in their strikes, faster, up and up, sometimes to go, sometimes to go back, to the top and down on the game place.
They are not only the target lines or the starting channels, but also a higher goal in television transmission: the world or the Olympic Record.
The targeted goal is novel, admirable, even fanatically - and it is enough to smell even a observer to smile.
But it's also what I think of myself when I look at these games as something embarrassing.
The trampolin offers a breathpause.
The vector of the trampolin springer is above.
A previous movement is not the goal.
He or she pleads, like a astronaut, goes up, then go down, then unwantedly go to the top.
There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wheels in the television, just the dreamer, elegant relief of time and weakness.
It is so nervous as the competition in the Olympic games can only be.
The qualification and final rounds of women will be held on Friday, in the strife at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00 p.m.
NBC will be extracted as a part of a afternoon block at two days from 14.00.
Within the Olympic Machine, they promise a quiet, nice moment, a who will probably be overlooked in general tumor.
If the consciousness increase can only be achieved by the arrival and the objetion of men's acts - as the men's tourner said the Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr. Dooley expects his ringing, new fantasy community.
"A generation protests" in Ethiopia, a member of the United States
Protest force in Ethiopia
Demonstrators who call political changes in Ethiopia are on a violent resistance of the government.
The Witnesses say that zig protesters were killed during the compositions with the police in shock changes.
Is Ethiopians just going to break together?
In the past ten years, it was one of the most stabil African countries, a solid partners of the West with a fast growing economy.
But in the last few months, protests against the government were assaulted by the country, and in a larger range of areas.
Last week, thousands of people were on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
The government's response was unclean, according to human rights organizations.
The Witnesses told the police that zig unarmed demonstrates shooted and killed.
Simply in the round of the videos about the Protests, which are probably from the last or early this year, show how youths shocked with shocks, while they were forced to make a action against a wall.
The Chief of UN Human Rights Auditors now requires an inadequate investigation.
"It was always hard to keep this country together and will be even more difficult,," said Rashid Dib, the project leader of the African Horn of the International Crisis Group, a group of research.
Ethiopia is estimated to Nigeria the most popular country of Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.
American military and secret services are closely working with the Ethiopias to fight terrorism over the region, especially in Somalia. Only few countries in Africa, if they are sure, receive such western assistance.
Ethiopian economy expanded in a considerable time.
His infrastructure has been drastly improved - there is a new break-up in the capital of Addis Abeba.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia was all other than a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continued to undermine the government - the opposition in the country was limited to the opposition, which has been effectively imposed by dissidents.
Many were sent to exile or in prison, killed, or tried to the deserts.
But that could change.
"If you push people and have no other options to protest, it says Seyoum Teshome, a dozen in central translathiopians.
The whole youth protests.
A generation protests.
There are numerous complaints that cover all of the terrestrial use to the deterioration of the power of the government coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the Governing Party and its associates received the last seat of the opposition and now controlled 100% of the Parliament.
At the same time, the swimming swimming over the borders of Eritrea increased; a fight against this shocked, surrounded line requested hundreds of lives in June.
Analytics fear that separators such as the Oromo Liberation front or the national freedom front of Ogad, which have been more or less angled over the past few years, could use the turbulences and can be weakened again.
A number of factors explain why the feelings of advertising are now explosed under the surface for years.
The first seems harmless: Smartphones.
In the last few years, very many ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media, since more smartphones were more frequent and improved the Internet services.
Even if the government shows access to Facebook and Twitter, what they are doing in regular distances, especially in protests, many people still can communicate through Internet processes that hide where they stop.
Many young ethiopians acknowledged that they were so assembled to protesters.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnics in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since the Yeons, the Amharas, which come from Ethiopians overly high Christian countries, prospered in the policy and economy, while they exhibit the oromos, many of whom muslims are and live in flags.
But it's just changed.
"We are there to coordinate under a shift," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The largest protests found in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos have felt that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which are around 6 percent of the population and dominated in the military, secret services, trade and policy.
The third reason for the disappointed is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, an ex-revoluntary leader, was until his death at a non-public illness in 2012 for 17 years, the first minister of Ethiopians.
He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think about the edge.
Analysts say that he was specially distributed in the way to observe early signs of inadequacy and to use special advisers to edit the enemy and make them unfortunately.
"The current regime has lacked it to this fundamental ship," said Mr. Dibdo, a conflict-nalyticer.
The Ethiopians of the new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was elected in relatively unconscious reasons to accept the position of Mr Meles.
Instead of Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray North Ethiopian region, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analytics say he does not enjoy trust in the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more blood damage.
The last time the Ethiopias experienced such a rise in 2005, after thousands protested against elections, which, according to the information of analytics, seemed to have been threatened by the government and then stolen.
During the following races, many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in the last months and this time of disappointment was relatively fast.
Development experts gave the Ethiopia leaders for their visional infrastructure planning, such as the new Pendal League, and for their measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal inutility of the Ethiopian government.
And she takes a dangerous ethical form.
Last month Protestants in Gondar, an amharic city, took businesses from Tigray, and Hass against Tigray becomes more common in social media.
Analytics say that the Protests bring the U.S. and other Western associations into a unique position.
The United States government used Ethiopia as a base for drones flights over the nearby Somalia, even though recently she informed that she closed this base.
While westerns clearly want to support democracy, he does not want to join his partners in a already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Divid, "it's a very thin grain migration."
Donald Trump declared his statement Obama founded by ISIS or "Sarkasmus"
Donald J. Trump tried to destroy the last contraverse around his campaign by acknowledging that his repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, wouldn't have been seriously common with the "groen" of the terrorism group of the Islamic State.
This explanation made new questions on the communicationsability of the President of the Republicns, whether it could be clear and comprehensive with the American public.
It also brings its partners to protect him during a appropriate stage, in the own position to declare comments that he couldn't have shared.
After he had done the enthusiasm at a election campaign on Wednesday, Mr. Trump returned to the holding on Thursday and was in Interviews that he really not accepted the President and Mrs Clinton had created ISIS.
But in a premature week on Friday, Mr. Trump said he's just sarcastic.
The twitter was the opposite to the previous day in which Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said that the accused was completely serious.
When the conservative radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to defeat the speech by reminding him that Mr Obama ISIS wants to destroy, the Republican Presidency candidate wanted nothing to know about it.
The last stage of the criticism is declining on Mr Trump, while he tried to spend the focus of his campaign because of falling survey values on the economic situation.
Mr. Trump and Mrs Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this issue again.
On Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found their speech.
Mr. Trump has already provided Sarkasmus to his defence.
In the end of July he had a strong criticism when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's Emails, but later he explained, "I mean the sarcastic."
This method allows Mr Trump to move the language borders in the policy and then call back after need.
"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken from his fans as they arrived, and then to "exply" according to how the response comes." Ruth Sherman, a expert of communication that observes the language of both candidates.
But I believe that it is also clear enough to keep his words low enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of renewing the sound for the election of the presidency, Mr Trump has adopted a more slightly sound, since his values have continued.
A new survey from NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a leading guide in the United States of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-an-rent in Florida.
While Mr Trump generally tries not to apologize for his caused statements, he often accuses his critics to destroy his words or to understood his humor.
However, while he is strengthening the attention in the last few months of his presidency campaign, Mr Trumps' Scherze has brought his loyal partners into the uncomfortable situation to him, independently of how to cause his statements.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former citizensman of New York and one of the most prominent preachers of Trumps, has made great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I think he's the legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was asked on the rightness of Mr Trumps, whether Mr Obama and Mrs Clinton had found the Islamic State.
It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an unknown, nearly unknown, small organization, he called her interfaces, completely wrong, and because he took out the troops from Iraq.
The majority of the Republic of Mainstream tried to argue that the government under Obama, Mrs Clinton, served as a Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to extend its expansion by enlargeing the situation in the Middle East.
Before the election campaigns in Pennsylvania, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and proposed to spend on each of his words and to be taken against him.
He increased the "weapon, weapons" television experts that try to understand him and said, "You can't!".
Some democratics urged Mr Trump's apologize just a further evidence that he was inadequate for the President.
Once the price of the market is broken, Café returns to Greenpoint
Verb coffee was a sweet coffee in Williamsburg, where you could only pay a bar that had no Wi-Fi, but it served a good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices from Bedford Avenue Ladenefront have been raised.
The Soap Cherie business, replaced the Verb in the summer 2014, sells in the form of Cupcakes.
Inhabitantly it was the last loss in a generating city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "I know, New York is a change, but I can't still believe that CBGB is dead, out of the Chelsea hotel and Verb is now a seventh business."
But if New York is changed, it's also a new regeneration.
A rebuilt Verb cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than one kilometer north of his original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but there are still some of the same employees and a similar slow atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employer of the old coffee, the owner and business leader of the new coffee.
He began to work with the Verb 2001 and remained there until the end.
When a customer offered him to provide money for a new outdoor, he was urged to do it, said he.
Rodriguez, 36.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels buyed the same Espressmasin model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try too.
He brought new additives.
On the food map, there are sandwiches with spectacles and kitchens and there are garnitures such as captures and saubered swivels.
There are natural shoes.
The coffee no longer serves bird, there are fried skins.
After nine months, Rodriguez said that he had noted a steady electricity at old seeds.
"A lot of old customers were also slowed by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
On Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, was previously living in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she was taken to Greenpoint, she would take the way.
After closing the complaint, she gave the coffee for a while, she said.
"I was clear that it was on the coffee and the culture in the verb that was pleasant to me," she said.
Now she drinks again coffee, even when she ordered a Blended Chai Tea instead of its usual iced coffees, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal is another long-year customer since the beginning of the Verb in 2003.
He went there before the work and, unfortunately, assigned the same.
"I came fourteen after seven, every day, like a Swiss taste offerer and they prepare my allthing bag with Butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and take new ingredients into the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still receives his usual order, but sometimes it changes its allthing bag with speck, egg and kitchen.
Rodriguez said he wasn't denied about the fact that the shipment has taken the old business room.
Indeed, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to produce a special sweet for sweetness with the cold coffee of the coffee.
"I think we will still take on her offer," said Rodriguez.
And the traditional, Polandese Greenpoints also accepted the coffee.
A new customer has translated the food card to the Poland and Rodriguez said he intended to make them so that his new neighbors would be welcome.
The location also has further proposals.
A local saftlocal wants to fill and sell the cold coffee in the floor.
There is an opportunity to expand the coffee to a nearby building.
For many customers, there is a new ban to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a folk and said he was destroyed on the ground when the coffee closed.
When the new coffee opened, Whitt said that the involvement of the local and the order felt a new coffee like a homekee.
"I had to ride it," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich food time"
In March 1933, after his presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his breakfast in the Oval Office.
As Feinschmecker, President Roosevelt had a facility for raffined delicts of the Fifth Avenue, such as Patate de la fera grass and Maryland watercraft suppe.
His menu at this day was something more discreet: pleased eggs in tomatesauce, cartoffelpuree, and as dessert a plume pudding.
"It was a act of collinary solidarity with leading people," said Jane Siegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes the last book "Chop Suey" was conducted by the Chinese kitchen in the United States while Zegelman in his book "97 Orchard" about life in a residence house at the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Your latest cooperation, "A reliable breakfast", which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of the American kitchen during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met a reporter in the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich, a small, slightless imbis in the Flatiron district, which has already been in business since the Börsencrash 1929.
Zegelman, 54, ordered a fresh swimming swimming with oil bags, while coe, 57, swimming with card-felpure and mixing.
When the reporter named Hackbrot, the couple found it appropriate for a debate on the food at the time of the Great Depression.
"The rich foods were very popular", said Siegelman.
There was soil brown, lever bones and bottle brown.
They were prepared from an additive and something pleasant that strikes the adventure.
Probe to eat so many earthquakes that they serve them as a dinner.
You're shiny.
"It must have been put in the magic as a blowing," he said.
In the years before the great depression, the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, a All-You-Can-Eat Buffet.
Managers of women purchased for men's field workers and it was freely backed paste for breakfast, breakfast and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first World War War. "A Square Meal" marked the ways to which the country turned to be no longer the slaughter country.
"It was a time when the food was a central, encouraging theme for the Americans," Coe favoured why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget was also encouraging: secret foods, such as bread and caserolls, were made to basic foods that casserols were "a great type of food-review", noted by Gigelman, since the kitchen was able to hide in a creative sugar.
Fresh fruit was replaced by bigger seed fruit.
The meat of the United States kitchen was a rarely served Luxus.
Personal misconceptions were tested because a calorian rich and slight satisfaction was priority for smell or even healthy kitchen.
During their search for the book, which also includes the receptives, the seeds prepared a court from this epoch, backed swivels with groundsbatters.
"It wasn't a favorite addition on the midst", says Coe.
Seegelmann continues to say, "It was surreal."
Boilers and backed swimming swimming swimming snacks do not match each other.
It was typically for many of the budget receptions.
As never before or since, budgetary managers - including Louise Stanley, Leader of the Federal Office of Home Economics, between 1923 and 1943 - are the habitats of the country.
In publishing receptions and articles in newspapers and magazines, women encouraged them to become "budgetary politicians" and to be justified by the challenge of transforming pamps such as creme spaghetti with karotes in cooking times.
"A Square Meal" is a festival of historical lecker beasts.
In particular, the reports on the response of the Government to the poor citizens, such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-mich-Cine-Essen.
While he publicly loving the simple Iowa farmer house cooked his kitchen, he spent like the million thick man of the world to which he became.
"He might have a continental kitchen like fish with guckensauce," said Coe.
He eated in a almost rolled food room and took a smoking.
He was greatly reality friend.
President Roosevelt may have started the same error if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to make an example with his mages.
As described in the book, a householder had no interest in smells by Mrs. Roosevelt made the white house the most longest food in Washington, but also one of the most comfortlessly prepared."
Many of the species from the era of the Great Depression were rejected when the country returned to the leg.
The resources are on our continuing focus on calories and food, said Zegelman, and how food science has been applied.
The couple gave a better understanding of the habits of Siegelman's mother's swimming mother, for example, how they couldn't remove food.
"He had a real fear of the abuse of food," said Coe.
Zegelman remembered: "They actually made people sick."
There was the wind-wheel event.
After the teachers were displaced at Eisenberg, they and Coe moved a dessert that they had prepared at home: the floor swimming steel, the President Roosevelt eat at midday.
"It will be called Prune Whip," said Vegelman, and added that it was a common trick to pass a sent name.
There was no shoes shoes, only plants, some meat, sugar, water and Zimt.
Everyone slaughtered a lift in the dense, brown lebbers.
Awesome, it wasn't bad.
Coe tried to get a shock.
As a can-do-budget-budget said to his wife, "A few haired woods would help."
Murdered by bomb attack: He was the herd of Aleppo
He put his own life on the game to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the herd of Aleppo: Khaled Omar lived the people in Syria.
He risked everything to save others.
Now the 30-year-old one died at a fassbomber attack of the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group that saved the life up to about 60,000 people.
2900 volunteers make their own lives on the game to drive people from shocked houses and to provide the first help in the war area.
You're the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: a video of the civil protectioner, which showed him in a 11-year-old salvation of a slugling from a house, went to the world in 2014.
It made the Syrer to the lighting symbol in the grain of the war.
When he himself never saw himself, he said, "For me, this is the true Jihad."
"When I die to save life, I think that God sees in me a martyr."
Shortly before Omar himself lost an attack on the victim, he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria.
The helikopters have made four fass bombs over the Alzadia area, one was filled with chlorogas.
One woman and two children died, seven people suffered from an Atemnot.
"We remove now the giftous remains of the bomb, so that children do not play this," the image cites his last words before he died.
The mortal bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists.
Grönlandhai: The oldest workshop is almost 400 years old
Rare look.
Grönlandhaie is usually in winter only on the surface.
This Hai returned to the sea after an investigation on the board of the Sanna research ship.
He was born 1624 and was born with a good 1 km/h through North Atlantics - up to today.
Grönlandhaie has only been received with 150 years of education.
The Grönlandhai slows on the ground of the North Atlantics, in a hour he comes just 1.220 m in average.
Only when it arrives, the 5 meters long animal is speeding on 2.5 km/h - and is with this maximum speed half soon as a robot.
But this long-term life style seems to be a patterncept for a high age.
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reports in the Section "Science" every case by a Grönlandhai that could be 392 years old.
"Wahnsinn" comments Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max-Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock this life level, which means a world record for the workshops.
Although the evolutional biologues had long been shocked by Grönland’s stones.
Only the evidence missed.
Grönland Haies are difficult to observe, finally they live mostly in the Eismes before the swimming coasts of Canada, Grönland, Norway and Spitzbergs.
Because they prefer water temperatures for the six degrees of Celsius, they are mostly in winter.
Regarding the lifestyle of the Grönland Haie, researchers do not know anything accordingly.
They made their time of time when they equipped six animals before Spitzbergs with a sender.
Nevertheless, these hairs do: in the magnificent of a animal, researchers found the rest of a robot, another had shooted the shoes of a young irongart.
They may be kissing sleeping animals or patropulating it on the basis of the eisme and searching for cattles from higher water swimming down.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now investigated 28 Grönlandhaie, which helped fishermen from 2010 to 2013 to Grönland or Spitzbergs as part of the depth of North Atlantic.
The smallest Hai was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimeters was.
To identify the age of the animals, they analyzed with the carbon-14-methods the lineners of the hair.
This center of the eyeslinse is already undergoing before the birth of the Haie, the proteins containing there are no longer renewed later.
The two smallest hairs had a lot of coal-14 in the linzener.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, as the nuclear weapons surveyed more quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere.
However, in which with 220 centimeters of the three-century animal the lingery was a low overcome of carbon 14 from the nuclear weapons request, it should therefore have been celebrated in his study in 2012 at its 50th birthday.
However, all the larger Grönlandhae had normal carbon 14-mans in their lines, which were in the atmosphere by cosmic radiation.
Indeed, the CO2-14-uur showed a age of 335 years of age, while the record-hai with 502 centimeters should even be 392 years old.
That Grönlandhai women were known only then when they were more than four meters.
Now the researchers were able to order a age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters per cent standing at the slee of sex sleeves and his age with 156 years of age, Grönlandhaie is obviously allowed to measure at least a half a century.
It should also be for the weaker today.
That such methusure lives primarily in ice waters is no accident.
The previous recorder, a 211-year-old Groenlandwal, in which a 120-year-old spectacle was captured before Alaska.
By low temperatures, the organism of the living animals often runs on sparflooms.
So they're late and older.
To keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, by which the heat of the animal.
The warm loss of a gram mouse is therefore much greater than a gram elephant.
Another advantage: You have less enemies.
"A smaller animal, therefore, is more dangerous and should concentrate on it, as soon as possible, to have many births as possible", says the Evolutional Biological Scheerlein.
However, a very large animal should invest his resources in a long life.
Built in double package
With the issues around the buildings, the Council of the Communities has severely discussed in the recent meeting.
With facility, the body noted the communication of Mr Robert Putz that "the marketing of recent residence plants can end up."
After closing the base, parcelling and resolution issues and the applications for measuring could be made, the sale of the bases in the residence areas "Straßweg" and "Sönau-West" (Ambiguous Binderstraße Section 1) is no more interested in the way.
The Council is convinced that the buildings in the rurally prescribed and tranquilous housing area are equal to young families and strict seniors.
As it is said, there can be immediate reports on the Council's house, on the delivery of the parcels, the Council will be consulted in its September meeting.
In order to be able to follow requests for other enterprises, associated with the creation of jobs, the Community Council decided to amend the area-use plan established first in the early year of this year.
In this way, there are two parts of the State Strategy 2112 expansion in the area of the sub-time area.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city in Main has the best chance of entering jobs and enterprises from London in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt benefits mostly from Brexit vôtum," says Michael Voigtlland, Chief of the Financial Market and IW Income Market.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain that money households can continue from London from financial business in the whole EU.
For the so-called EU pass, they have yet been authorized in Britain.
That's just useful US banks.
several banks have already announced to reduce jobs.
The Lobby Association "Frankfurt Main Finance" calculates 10000 new jobs at Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, in this case, the European Central Bank (ECB) speaks of the responsibilities for the monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks of the euro area, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Monitoring EIOPA and the Risk Council.
In Paris the OECD Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its main meeting, but this is less important than the ECB.
"The nearness to the bank is important for banks, since they can communicate so directly with the supervision", said the IW Profesor.
However, Luxembourg has a large fund sector, but also decreased as Dublin in infrastructure.
Frankfurt, thanks to the great airport, is clearly easier to reach.
Moreover, the city has easy shopping real estate.
"In Paris, it is not so simple to find high-quality offices", says the Voigtle countries.
In his area, the expenses for first-class shopping real estate are also up to 50% higher than the main.
Frankfurt also offered a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical supply and infrastructure and less criminality.
Mercer was located at the seventh places, Luxembourg on place 19, Dublin on place 33 and Paris at 37th place.
Although the quality of life is a question of the preferences: "In the case of his strong position as a financial position for the European market, Frankfurt could join further banks and investors," says the WI.
However, in spite of Brexit-Votum, London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe, I believe the economic researchers.
For this, the forces relates: In London, there were about 144.000 people in the bank industry, which were 62.500 in Frankfurt.
Gilead receives legal costs from the Hepatitis C Patent Streit with Merck
A US Officer decided that Gilead Sciences Inc had access to the refund of the legal costs which she had been established from the Hepatite C Legal Force with the Pharmacist Markk & Co Inc.
In June Gilead was released by a damage payment of $200 million for the injury of two market patents, which stood in relation to the Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after a US-relator had a markks model of misconduct, including my idea and other non-thetic acts.
On Thursday, the complainant at the U.S. Officer Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead has access to the exemption of costs during the defence of the case.
Merck tries to equal Gilead that controls the market of hepatitis C drugs that can result in over 90% of patients with hepatitis disease.
The case returns back to 2013 when Gilead and Merck were declared mutually and ownership in labor work, which was based on Sofosbuvir, the active content substance in the medicines of Gilead.
The United States supported soldiers say that they have returned to full control over Man near the Islamic state
The full control over the northern city of Man near the Turkish border, after the last IS fighters left them in the city, said a speaker of the group on Friday.
The democratic forces of Syria (DKS) are now the city after the exit of the remaining group of fighters who have been buried within the city.
They have freed over 2,000 civilians who were held by the fighters as a shock, Sharfan Darwish shared the man near the DKS.
"The city is now under complete control, but we are just conducting rooms through", he said Reuters.
Clintons won 10,75 million in 2015 and pay 34,2% Federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published its tax statement on Friday 2015, which took a revenue of $10.75 million and a effective federal tax rate of 34.2% for the Presidency candidate of Democratics and their husband.
In 2015, Clintons depended on the Clinton Foundation 1 million USD, mainly on the Clinton Foundation; the former President Bill Clinton produced almost 5,3 million USD in Redehororans; the former Foreign Minister has increased a income of $3 million from Simon & Schusster for its book on its official time in the foreign minister.
Clinton's Candidate for Vice-President, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, publicly announced with his wife Anne Holton his tax statements in the last ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continued to set standards for financial transparency", said Clinton's campaign helper Jennifer Palmieri in an opinion.
In a weird opposition, Donald Trump is hiding its tax statements behind false explanations and backfalls regarding its previous discussions.
It is common to publish their tax statements for the US Presidency candidates, although they are not bound by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and its lawyers, as a reason for his refusal, have stated a tax examination by the tax authorities.
"He's on the train," wrote Clinton's election assistor Ian Sams on Twitter, with regard to the publication of the Presidential Chairman of Democratics.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, the Special Adviser of Trumps, said to CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish something before the tax tests were completed.
Trumps Critics, including the Republic of Presidential Chairman of 2012, have already endorsed that his refusal to matters relating to property, its costs for engaged organizations, its business opportunities and various links, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already discussed the topic and published a video on the Internet on Friday, in order to publish its tax statement on the high-ranging Republican Trump.
On Thursday she also spoke the topic during a talk to the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every other candidate has done in the last decades and to publish its tax statements." she said to the amount.
Political reported that Trump has not paid for two years or only very few taxes, and a New York Times economic journalist quoted a number of tax applicants and tax advisers that indicate that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become a subject in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme that is appointed after the billion and investor Warren Buffet, which would ensure that people who pay more than one million USU would pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a election event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, a buffet requested by the Berkshire Hathaway Industrie Conglomerat, whose seat is here to discuss a meeting on their tax statements.
Buffett said he was also subject to a fiscal examination of the IRS and Trump had a "trump" before the electors and not before the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has published a tax declaration back to 2007.
The Clintons, who are now living in Chappaqua, New York, at average payed a effective federal tax rate of about 32% between the years 2007 and 2014 and a effective combinated tax rate of about 40.5%.
The tax statement of the Clintons in 2015 showed that these only shared 100 USD of their income as a loan, other than the majority of all Americans.
Your main currency allocation was a more cost-required index fund, from which the Clinton's Dividents and Income from US 109.000 taxed.

Condome with chilipuder, fire body promotes Tanzanias Elefanten protection
Natural protectors in Tansania use an unorthodox type to stop elephants to go in people's population seeds - they shrink condomes that are filled with chilipuds.
The method has proved to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which has been the idea for years ago, has intensified its promotion together with the US Natural Protection by training volunteers in villages in Northern Tansanias to use a weakening method for protecting their homes and rewards without harming animals.
Many of them have used to defend themselves.
Friday is the world's celebration of animal protection.
"When we developed the toolkit, we could observe a change in their position within these communities, while they are much more convinced that they can stop the elephants from their fields without harming the elephants," the director of Honeyguide Damian Bell expressed in a communication.
The first two steps include the shooting of the elephant with a shock and the blowing into a horn.
If it's not crazy, a cyliwolke will be shocked.
Chilipuds mixed with earth are packed together with a fire body in a condom, which is turned to the end to the thread.
When it is sweet, the condome sets up with a kidnapper and splits a sweet steel on chilipuder into the air.
A swimming shooting is normally in order to spend the elephants.
The last option is an advertiser that shoots a golden light fire work into the air and causes a slight, light explosion.
City Council decides unilaterally: No Kiosknbau on St. Goarer Rheinufer
Normally, St. Goarer's investment projects of customers with cuss hand - but the individual trade in the nuclear city applies to be significantly developed.
However, with the request to rebuild a sale shop at the Rheinufer immediately near the rock baron in the construction of the city’s shipping baron, the Council now declined.
"We welcome new competitors, but at this location in exposed position at the Rheinufer, this Kiosk does not pass", explained Michael Hubrath for the CDU Group.
Jewish Governor destroys the Berlin Hotel, because Israeli pre-selection was removed after "Arabian" invitation - RT News
A French government with Jewish roots tried a media survey after he surprised that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pre-elect, since it had been an Arab guest "required".
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust Documentation "Shoah" left his injuries in Kpienski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing a open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the country office of the hotel.
However, the country was not listed between the countries which can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and removed?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel through a own call centre.
After a statement, the government went to the hotel reception.
The answer he got there, "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said that the measure is a "absolute decision on the management of the Kempinski Hotels".
The reason that was there was, the government resolved more wrath.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have requested that the war is removed," was sent by Lanzmann.
The Israeli poster in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame", reports the Southern newspaper.
We were cut from this event and struggled.
It's really awesome.
The fact that this in Germany has reached in exactly this hotel chain is even more harmful.
This does not require any declaration.
We hope that the hotel is "the right conclusions", said the Officer.
The incident made a very large resonance on the Internet, where people were called a scandal.
Some understood the Kempinski Hotel that it had been the suitable demands of Arab guests "only given".
"Shome you," said another contribution, in which it was indicated that the hotel situated in the noble curve dam, is near a synagogue.
The hotel slowly shocked all the accused of himself and called the incident a "tradition" and "speaked" at Lanzmann, reports The Spiegel.
"There was never a direct instruction," the Southern newspaper quoted a speaker of the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country's preference has now been added.
Police places Tenengas and Gummi Shots against protesting Brazilian students
Students met the police together on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo, when they gathered together to demonstrate the reforms of the government for the public education system.
The police put the shooting gas and shoes against the demonstrates.
The difficulties argued that as police officers tried to interfere with students, which resulted in the use of Gummi shoot and gas.
Many hundreds of students participated in the demonstrations to express their threatening over the plans.
According to the proposals of the Government of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, a little less than 100 public schools will be closed while 300,000 students are implemented to spare money.
Some of the protesters were seen Graffitits against the provisional President Michel Temper at the wall.
The most recent protests came on the streets after a few days after the demonstrators in Mass, to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been deleted by a senator's vote to their departure from the office.
Trade between Russia and Iran is suddenly increased by 71% to - RT Business
With the restraint of sanctions, the Russian messanger in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade rate between Moscow and Teheran in comparison with the year 70.9%.
Since the international sanctions against Iran were decreased, the interest on Russian enterprises in business in the country was strongly able to share the messagers.
Russian enterprises take existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to create access to the market.
Of course, the further trade development is one of the major priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,” said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that the trade sum between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 and $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports in Iran increased 91.5% springly and $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased 16 per cent of $158 million.
The trade was reached by delivering machines, aircrafts and weapons", said the messager.
Dzhagaryan is exhibited by a number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year.
Last year, the Russian foreign association exhibited around 35,000 visas, in the main line of travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
On the other hand, Iran reached the top 20 of the countries with regard to the tourist number in Russia.
It could be said that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia have been broken last year," he said.
At the same time, only few Russians visit Iran, something from which the messager hopes that it will change.
"I can personally recommend the visit of the towns of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd that the monuments of old Persian civilization have received in a good condition," he said.
Tests Search: Overcoming the drinking market in the bowlbr oil
On Thursday Thursday, on the drinking market of Rewe XXL on the forest blower trails, a smooth accident has been displaced.
With the maintenance of a shooting weapons, three darkly closed persons who had conscious of their faces were requested the production of bargeld and then flew first on foot and then probably with a silver VW-golf.
The police does not share the money.
The murders should have been large between 1,60 and 1,70 m, so relatively small.
The drinking market is directly accessible and badly adjustable from the parking of the rewe market.
The murders have to be shooted in direction towards Gerber Streets, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and flyed by the shotter park in front of the parking house in the silver car, perhaps in direction B 256 (slaughtering).
Those who have observed at 19.45 hours in relation to the shooting accident must be reported urgently to the police.
Nagold: Game and fun at summer free time
Eight beautiful and happy days, the children and adolescents of the social-day/social work of Nagold with their employees at their summer time in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In a quiet free-time house Hardtwöldle, the life-friendly group was rounded during the first school feast night.
several full-day explosions were on the programme.
To one, it went to Bretten with the visit of the Streichel Zoos.
For the other part, after the Moul sources, there was a special child management in the world's famous club.
The third flight leaded to Pforzheim.
In the hochdorf museum, the group has produced much over the daily and food of the caves.
At the hot days, the group was enjoyed in the Deep Sea in the Moulbronn, which was called to spring, swimming, and plants.

Hagerloch: Pilgers for the strength of the mercy
The Ministers of the Seelorge Unit Eyachtal-Hangerloch St. Anna were on a four-day migration of Virginia to Freeburg.
In common cases, four steps were stored.
In order to overcome the time until the next Romwald flight of all ministers, two years, the Supreme Ministerround St. Anna has decided to prepare and implement a multi-term migration process.
Several Wallway targets were tested and finally decided to be the Bishops City Freeburg, where, in this year, the holy Year of Barmherity was offered a special pillar to be opened by the cure of mercy at the Freeburg Münster.
16 Mines of supplies, gruols, hairbows, and sacred rooms were made on the path.
On the evening Pharaoh Storost sent the Pilger to a small party in St. Anna, blessed the Pilger Cross and distributed the pillars.
From Horb was moved to the start point of Villing, where a monster of Our Love Women is, and so the pillar journey was taken from the monster.
The individual day tours were rounded by a short impuls with various prayers, songs and texts.
But on the way, the minis of field crystals, caps or churches continued to sing together a song of their own-composed piller song.
For the overnights, the Pfarr houses of the local parreies were available.
At the stages, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller were careful for a sweet and strengthening dinner and breakfast.
On the second day, it went on fortwangs to Goodtenbach.
On the day, the step went to St. Peter, who was the most strict road, had to get up to about 500 meters of height, and then to be shocked again.
The winning reward was finally a common grill on the bathroom.
After the morning's impetus on the fourth pilgrim day in the imposing clergy of St. Peter, it was on the closure table to Freeburg.
It seems to be easy and happy to enter the minis afternoon on the Freeburg monsters and continued the efforts of mercy.
With a small impuls, God has been grateful here.
In the midst of the monastery, the Minister of Cooperator Markus Obert arrived at the Pilger target.
After God’s service, the pillars were able to view the sacred and the higher.
The next day was still time for the Breisgaumeterpole.
The afternoon it went back to Horb.
All participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong Community experience were presented.
Shotte Callum Skinner shoots home when British Gold for Radsport
Skotlands Callum Skinner last night at the men's spring team in the Velodrom in Rio to the ruhm when the British team defended London's title in 2012.
The 23-year-old boy of Glasgow took the role of his countryman Sir Chris Hoy. The boy point was proud of the legends when he went home to a win from the favorite New Zealand.
England requested a shocking victory four years ago, while today the fifth of six Olympiagold medailles.
They repeated the trick after they had helped only a clear sixth place in March at the Railway World Meetings in London, despite the return of Hoys.
The problem between Peking and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
They did this at the time as Hindus.
Hoys Refrigerator created a laugh trying to close Kian Emmadi and Matt Crampton.
Skinner was the man where she remained when she saw the potential in the shoot that now disappeared.
Inded, Kenny, who had seen with Hoy four years ago - and Skinners, put an Olympic receptor in the qualifications rounds, but in the standard rounds, the new countries were swifted in the first round.
And the British Trio wins the dual with gold.
Indeed, after his round, Kenny was back, but Kenny brought the team before and Skinner took it.
A strategic change made a large part of the transformation in which Hindus went into a higher gang to delay it and enable Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the time.
Hoy looked out of his position as BBC experts and switched Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they stood on the power.
The 23-year-old skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a weird comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.
We have set an Olympic Record at the end of the end, and the world's master.
It was just unbelievable.
There is no better way to win this.
After the triumph 2012 on the Kenny and Hoys side, Hindes gave him a weak start on the train.
He later returned this statement, and there was no invoice of England's rivals.
There was no such problem at such an overwhelming victory this time.
Inded said, "It feels like the whole GB flags on the tribune like London."
We've been together as a team in the last three months.
We've been so bad with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again with the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, who won seven of 10 titles both in Peking and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the past five months, we are expecting a successful five days in the Velodrom.
With the form of Kenny is in the area of the possibility that he can win from three olympic gold medals in a competition.
This would be for Kenny, which was just 12 years older than Hoy, which was also born on March 23 (a apparently sacred date for the British sport; on the day, also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - means an exhibition of six gold medals and a silver medal.
That's the same thing by Hoy.
Kenny takes the next part in the sprint that starts today and goes over three days.
The 28-year-old of Bolton said, "I enjoy this only for the moment."
The team heritage is always the best.
You can win it with his colleagues.
It feels a little uncomfortable to win alone.
Inded said, "If he wins two other gold medals, he should be shocked to the rider."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owan Doull were qualified with the fastest performance of four-kilometers.
They reached the objective in 3:51,942.
The World Reorder, winned in London's gold 2012, was at 3:51.659.
The first and final round (22.42) is in place today on the second day of competition, where Wiggins will be safely focused.
Last night he had struggled with officers before qualification when he was calling officers to measure his body size.
In the corresponding competition that is continued and ended tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milgavia in World Record at 4:13.260.
The GB team is on its strong station radar team to dominate the average period of the Olympic games and take a sharp of medailles.
After a truly extraordinary exhibition of absolute dominance in Peking and London, the expectations for Rio were understood.
There were dramas in the background, so the retreat of the technical leader Shane Sutton in April was in the midst of sexism and mobing, as well as the rest of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first night of the Velodrom, it seems to be repeated as the legendary call of GBs that has reached its point at the perfect moment.
The future of Portland's sleeves is a questionable cause of reducing the energy contract
The future of Portland's Aluminium Skills in Victoria, as well as hundreds of employees' jobs, is on the game because the installation operators announce the energy delivery contract and will thus decrease all delivery contracts, as provided by the supplier's energy companies.
This step followed the decision of the Government in Victoria at the beginning of this year to forgive no further subsidies for the operation of the installation.
A subvention set for 20 years shall expire in November.
Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa installation in Portland are on the game.
Not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be threatened when closing.
Furthermore, it could be to domino effects, as the smell series consums around 10% of the entire generation of Victorias.
2014 Alcoa closed the point Henry Schmelzerei, which leaded to a closure of the English power work last year.
The seal of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.
This step follows the annual speculations regarding the future of the installation, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar, and finally because of the strike for the installation.
AGL, which delivered the large aluminium ring with its Loy Yang A Kraftwerk in the Latrobe Valley, shared it that three other owners would be announced their contracts.
The installation is located in the majority of a Joint Venture of Alcoa and Alumina, where the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp is smaller.
"AGL describes that the installation in Portland will continue to be employed, which means another physical demand for electricity through the steel seed," the company shared.
AGL continued to declare that the contracts, as called "safeguards", should have entered into force since November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month proclaiming period so that they will end 2017.
"For this reason, AGL concludes that the contracts will be contributed to the income in the commercial year 17," said the supplier.
All potential effects on AGL revenues from GJ 18 are currently limited by the prognoses of the strong terminal markets for large-scale trading routes.
AGL shared that it had already registered the value of the contracts in its annual decree of $187 million in "Warning a claim".
Alcoa said that the decision to register the treaties, the "Capitacy Alcoas... or the supply of electricity to the sleeves" does not affect.
The US undertaking said that it had concluded a 20-year treaty with Loy Yang, which had to enter into force from November this year, even if there is still a statement why it was returned to the Treaty.
Analyticers warned because of the bad economic situation of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland Schmelzerei in Victoria and the Tomago Installation near Newcastle.
As regards the comments of the analytics at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consums about 600 megawatt and Tomago about 900 megawatt in electricity.
If both installations disappeared from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in the demand on the [Strom market].
And for us, it wouldn't be good," he said.
More than just a cardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September Exhibition of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clans Crisis is on the cover of the employed September issue of Vogue.
Kenndall, the Markenschafter of Estee Lauder and delivered to the Fashion Weeks in Mayland, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on their instagram account.
"In a room full of people I loved, I brought the view of this copper to wine," wrote Kendall.
The integration of the covers followed a strange (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar), scripted reality video that shows the whole kardashians family (except the problems of Rob and Caitlyn, as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz shoes and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), how they forgot the cover of their sister and ends with a classic view: they all planned a part of surprise.
This represents the clinical detention nearly every birthday seventh of a child's seat (Seacrest said, "Do you think we had forgotten you?", with the honestity of a sign trickcanin on a seller at 8:00 a.m.), but the crisis had to make her other girls a part in this publicity.
With regard to the September issue of Vogue, a new era of the Kardashian began with security.
Kendall's large sister Kim likes to have struck the Vogue-Cover (see and her husband Kanye West had to see it in April 2014), but the Cover of September’s magazine is a liga for himself.
The expenditure for September is the most sales expenditure of the year.
A large number of advertising advertising advertising (See Fashionista was 832 pages of the tree 615 pages of advertising).
The enthusiasming of his coverstars is so slightly expected that in the last two years, pictures of the magazine were still overseeing before the official advertisement.
Women already on the copper include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In the past years, obviously, there were more "models, models" than "models, which are famous" on the cover.
Oscar-President and Dior-Markebourer Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even the small opportunity that Ms. Jenner, which is described by the magazine as the "Durchbroch model" model of its generation, falls under the previous category, is located in a good society.
These famous audiences are not associated with famous people or reality Stars or youths from today, who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (such as it applies everything to Jenner).
They are really talented women who are representing themselves in the entertainment sector.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, was published by Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.
Of course, Jenner's success does not like everyone.
With its reality TV history, Jenner's position in the modern world was always encouraging.
In June, the one Victoria's secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid critised her "the midst of the moment".
These feelings come back up when the message with the appearing Jenners on the Vogue Cover came out.
But it seems to be overlooked at the point.
Kenndall Jenner is on the cover of the September Exhibition of Vogue.
She is a super model in the real sense of the word.
She's walking for Marc Jacobs.
She makes advertising for your foundation of Estee Lauder.
You and all their sisters sell pictures of you on their own Paywall apps.
She sells from her images from Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her free time she's to see in the reality TV. Probably only to see her sister Kourtney and her children.
Community law centres indicate each year 160,000 people
More than 160,000 of the aid needs of the country are declined annually by the Community law centres, while the sector has taken place on the effects of further means-free transactions already exceededed.
In Queensland there are already three of five persons - most older persons, immigrants, helping workers, victims of violence and those who have no funds for unrighteous delegations and similar - when requests for free legal consultation and legal assistance.
The legal services of the community, which are already exceededed, are prepared for further burdens.
Since June next year, these legal centres are expected to lose more than 30% of their federal resources.
The Director of the Common Rights Centers of Queesland James Farrell said that the last recovery of the National Association of Common Rights has shown that thousands of people are already discarded each year.
Farrell said that the situation would be worse without a delay of the Federal Government's decision.
"Queensland's Common Rights Centres are chronically financed, which means that thousands of people from important services you need," he said.
People who abandon violent relationships, people with unspectacular and impressable debts, families that go through separations, workers who have been dismissed unjustly - all of these people have problems of legal nature, and this explanation shows that they are not able to receive the help they need.
Since June 2017, the Federal Government will shorten the resources to 30 per cent, which means that thousands of helping people from Queensland will be forced to respond to their legal problems without any assistance.
We call on the general lawyer and the Federal Justice Minister and Senators of Queensland George Brandis to spend these shortages immediately, so that people can receive the aid they need in legal problems.
Last year, the country government complied its contribution to increase legal aid in the national average.
It is now at the time to look at the needs of the Common Rights Centres and its customer communities and that the Palestinian government investes in this important work.
Donald Trump Select campagne acknowledged after employees to go to the weapon
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was accused of an inactivity, after you were informed that her Championship Chief for North Carolina in February had launched a shooting weapons on a employee, while they walked in a Jeep in February.
The case is described in a letter of appeal submitted in the country court of Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software program for the campaign in this State.
Bordini said to have expected for months that the matter would be regulated within before he realized that "it wouldn't happen".
The Championship Chief, Earl Philip, moved a pistole, put his right guard fingers on the depth, and took the walk in Vincents Kniekehle," gave Bordini in his arrest.
After he considered himself at the local and regional campaign, Bordini realized that at least four other people had done the same experience with Phillip, he acknowledged in the appeal.
"The weapons should not be shooted to harm", said Bordini.
The accused comes only two days after the Republican Presidency candidate, when he said a human dimension in North Carolina, that the "Second Amendment People" - shooting and weapons friends - should take action if his rivalin Hillary Clinton is chosen and the judges should be called.
Trump's campaign clearly stated that the media would have left his words from the context and that he would not attack violence.
The complaint demands the injury of the campaign to violate the responsibilities and by Philip because of physical damage and remaining seal damage.
Trump's prestigious Hope Hicks was not reached for an opinion.
Try to contact Philip also missed.
WCCB, a local newspaper in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is not long-term employer of the campaign.
The calls at his consulting companies, innovative consultation services, were not reacted.
The Republican Presidency candidate Donald Trump has leaded to a controverse campaign.
The procedure was established by Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Oberstes Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Sween: Countries: Lost SPD and CDI
In the subsequent elections in the Federal States, Mecklenburg Forums (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), there are significant losses for the Government party SPD and CDI.
This provides representative investigations from the InSA Opinion Institute for the "Image" publication (Freeday).
While the red-free government coalition could soon be registered in the north, this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin.
In two federal countries, however, the SPD would have the strongest party and would have a good opportunity to continue to put the government head.
In Mecklenburg, the SPD was 35.6 per cent of five years ago at 24 per cent.
The Party, according to the survey, was only just before the CDI, which could return to 23%.
The third place is between the left and the ADR.
The left was 19 percent (before 18.4%), the ADD would first be 19 percent in the land day.
In spite of easier losses, greens returned to the black landday of 6 percent (before 8.7%).
NPD and FDP would not be represented by 3 percent on the land day.
In the Berlin Deputy House, the SPD is only 23% of the survey (Warning 2011: 28.3%).
The CDU only reached 18% after 23.4%.
It was still behind the green with 19 percent (2011: 17.6%), but before the left of 15 percent (forwardly 11,7%).
The AfD would first be a 14% in the House of Deputy.
With 5 per cent, the FDP could hope to return, but the pirates would, in contrast to 2011, pass the income.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first Smartphone
E-mail and Internet in Timelupe: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came on the market.
The followers dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device was almost half kilograms and was more than four times so hard as a iPhone 5.
It was smooth and larger, so it was not good in the hand.
On the contrary, it was very flexibility.
The building memory was first eight megabytes, which would be available for about two selfies with high resolution today.
A iPhone is supplied with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, in business, and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can buy the devices still on the Internet, but they are somewhat from the stone time of the Internet age.
However, 20 years ago the Communicator was a sense.
The Finnish mobile manufacturer has announced the product a few months ago on the computer measuring Cebit in Hannover as "Büro in the Western Tower Format".
In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received for the current standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent, even by fax, to reach the communicationr.
Even the access to web sites was possible by HTML browser, even slowly.
A load computer was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small Antenne, and the phone could be stored like a laptop.
Then a small keyboard and a black-wheel screen.
The price was very proud: 2700 D-Mark, so about 1400 euros.
The average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was EUR 392.
Nobody could admit in August 1996 that the Communicator would be the start of the Smartphone era.
Since then, it's different.
The sound phones are a success story, even if not for Nokia.
The phone part of the Finn experienced a slightless disaster, was finally sold and completed to Microsoft.
Today the market dominates providers who were all later coming as Nokia.
Always and everywhere online, this is for many people today.
2015 has been worldwide nearly 2 billion Smartphone users.
Only 555 million pieces were sold for about 1.4 billion devices, on collection and apple.
The global transfer with the devices is around 400 billion euros.
These are the good run-up businesses of countless app providers and telecommunications centers.
A whole industry has been built around the Smartphone.
The crucial interruption to the mass market was first early in 2007, then the head of Apple Steve Jobs announced on the Mac World the introduction of the iPhone.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and a Internet communicationer, everything easy to use by touch screen.
Apple's victory began, even today the iPhone is the most important product of the concert.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the view.
Finally, they missed to fight Blackberry.
The seage now has Apple and Asian providers like Samsung.
The Smartphone is an autonomy than 20 years after its introduction.
In the switch today each German looks 88 times on the day on his phone.
"We all have to learn to get out of the smartphone again," just said Janina Kugel, responsible for staff in Siemens.
Persistent accessibility applies to wickedness and blessings as well.
England has to spend the olympic spirit and extend Heathrow
Heathrow is not only in our local communities and in the whole of London, but also in the whole country renewing and well-being.
For me, this was the greatest attraction Heathrows, as well as in 2012 in London, when we employed a great encouraging to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympiade had great advantages for Stratford and Eastern End.
And this will be re-established by creating new opportunities for local accommodations and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities, we'll be alone with 10,000 new schools, create 40,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment.
As they were forecast in London in 2012, it will be given that the challenge of Heathrows extension is too large.
I was said that England will never be ready for the games and that we will burn on the world's blows.
The dubbles had injustice 2012, and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question that he has made.
Like the Olympic Games Heathrow is a infrastructure project for many and not individuals.
Advanced is a possibility to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion to wise growth and leave a risk of ability and employment both in the airport and in the whole GB.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion teen infrastructure investment program in time and budget, was chosen from T5 - the five years after the world's best airport terminal, up to T2, which was built in the midst of the world's two most frequentest routines.
Now they are willing to provide a third stage, which is supported by US$16 billion to private investment.
The London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am convinced that Heathrow's expansion will be also one.
It is time that we spend this olympic spirit and expand Heathrow and ensure our future trade and create a richness of skills and employment that can be proud of England.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook on "Katz and mouse game"
For enterprises who are providing the money online with one of the software manufacturer's attempts to implement an indication block, a "catz and mouse game".
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blocks on its desktop site, Adblock Plus published a blog post where it reported that users could update their filters in the program to re-block the advertising in the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook shared that his desktop page would change the encoding regarding its advertising advertising in order to detect the display blocks of which part of the page of advertising is to be identified.
But Adblock announced that there was a new way to run the new codes.
In a blog post, the speaker of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "This kind of fight between the spectacular open source Community and the circle is already in the gate, and that it is possible that Facebook comes soon with a new solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has been struggled is a strong indication for how more careful display blockers have become for the sector.
Worldwide uses a study from the last year of Pagefair and Adobe around 200 million people's show blockers; almost four times as much as 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook on their mobile advertisements, 84% of the Facebook advertisements are available.
The company has seen it on advertising blockers on desktop PCs, since mobile display blockers have no effect on mobile Facebook's application for the social network and instagram, he shared a speaker.
Advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of revenue, so Facebook seems to invest such a step as a loan.
On Thursday, Facebook shared it would update its "preferencies center" to have more control over the people about them.
On Thursday, Facebook said that Adblocks would be worried about new filters because they would also block contents on the side that are not advertising.
"If users don't have a positive experience, so we plan to discuss the problem," a Facebook speaker shared in an email communication.
Offers are a smooth means for us, instead, on development tools such as Ad Preferences to put more controls into people's hands.
Women in Swiss's conscious suicide on cars
The victim was in the middle of the night on the train.
The police calls witnesses after a woman was passed on Tuesday at a convictional suicide of several vehicles on a train on Sunday morning.
The incident was held on the A1 near the Morges in the Canton Waadt after midnight.
One woman put himself in the darkness "in an act of destruction" on the street and was taken by several cars, said the police in Waadt.
It is obvious that a Swiss age of 49 years, which had been overlooked by several vehicles, including a car, would have been killed.
She's still slow.
Many drivers have already been identified, but some have not yet been identified, the police asked them and all the Witnesses of the incident to report.
It was opened by a investigation procedure which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter shared Le Tribune de Gene.
However, it remains expected if one of the drivers is shown.
Was it possible to avoid a constraint?
This is something that the lawyer must decide," said the Court.
Two similar cases are shown in the past five years that the drivers are not responsibilities.
In each of the two cases, in which one in the dark road delivered a person on the road, it was decided that the drivers do not need to get out of the football in the night, as it was called in the newspaper.
Last year, a policeman was released to speak of the aircraft after she survived and killed a man who was a night on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been buried and became unconscious on the street, near the court.
The Court stated that the police -- who had responded to an emergency -- was in a fair way and that the presence of a man on the street was a "excellent and unpredictable situation", said the Judge.
Each person who has further information on the event on Thursday near Morges should be reported at the police number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus was one of the time available
The Venus, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, was probably a living one day.
Scientists at Goddard Institutes for Space Studies in NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus through tools and algorithms that differ from climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether the venus could have found its hot, water-free surface and CO2-diving atmosphere.
Scientists previously indicated that Venus could be declared by its deep atmosphere.
But the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have had a thick, desperate atmosphere and, however, slowly turned up.
The model also lighted the topography of the early Venus.
The planet probably had more severe areas than the earth, but first had enough water and geographical variability to hide life and protect fast consumption.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30% of the matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, the long tour of Venus exposes its day page of the sun almost two months long," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press communication.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a swimming swimming swimming clouds, which works like a rain screen to decrease the surface of a large part of the sun warmth.
The results are average temperatures that are some degrees more coal than the earth today.
The model showed a history of Venus, which plays the Evolution, which was previously stimulated by planet researchers.
Although she was certainly habitable, the Venus was exhibited in the course of thousands of years -- too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans were drunk and their water snake was burned from the ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogens enhanced only a dick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a mortal trend effect -- the Venus, which we know them today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate models in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy comes back as an avalanche trainer
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche, and adopted a small co-determination law in the decision process of the team.
Alternative Chairman/General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the Agreement will immediately search for a new trainer.
"In the past three years, I have filled my obligations as Chief Representative and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy, sufferance and certainty", said the 50-year-old Roy in a opinion.
I have thought in the summer long and much about how I could improve this team in order to give him more deep, that is necessary and to bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the trainer and vice President of Hockey Operations must be perfectly agreed on the organization.
He must also have a co-determination law in decisions affecting the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not fulfilled.
Sakic, who was swearing Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me today about this decision," said Sakic.
We appreciate all that he has done for our organization and want him only the best for the future.
Roy was exhibited as a winner of Jack Adam's Award during his debut session at the Avalanches 2013-14 as the best trainer of the Liga.
He led the agreement on 112 points and on the first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was shocked at the first round of the Playoffs of Minnesot and passed the sequence in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches marked a 39-39-4 mark in the season 2015-16 and returned five points behind the wild for a second wild card spot in the Western Conference.
As the Hall of Fame Torwart, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadians and the Avalanche.
Northeasy oil workers have again discussed, strictly set up
The workshops on the dislocation of North Sea workers were exempted, while all the parties were put on the table for a new conversation round.
Streiks against the Oil Servicer Wood Group were spotically performed on platforms in the North Sea, which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the Units and RMT companies can confirm that we have joined us to start restarting the current struggle process", says a common statement.
We will hold some full-term meetings in the next weeks, which will start the beginning of the next year to re-establish the problems.
The workshops said that their last strike, which was the first in more than 25 years, was a protest against possible reward shortages from up to 30%.
Wood Group has reduced the rates of its contractors in the North Sea around 9% because of negative market pressure.
The rate reduction of the company follows a 10% decline in 2014 by Onshore advocators.
The company said that additional rates to the company are the necessary space to come through the market decline.
She has left thousands of people and announced plans to give its oil and gas business in up to 10 countries, as it rationalizes its business as a result of its mega collection with the British energy company BG.
Energy enterprises are under pressure because of the lowest oil prices, a economic situation that had been strengthened by the decision of the Britishs in June to leave the European Union.
The Scotia Parliament, Dave Anderson, met with employees in the beginning of this week, to discuss one of the largest jobs that have occurred since a generation in the North Sea.
The North Sea is important for regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and in the whole country we need a economy that works for many and not only for few", he said in a statement.
2016 less than $1.4 billion in expenditure for new projects in the North Sea in comparison with a average of $7 billion in the past five years.
Kepler missing rotation rate of stars in the purchase of the pearls
The latest mission with Kepler World Space Telescope has helped astronoms to gather the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the shoes of the Mediterranean.
The new data helps the astronoms to understand why stars are switching on different ratios in stars and in which the rotation periods are linked to the increase in the planet.
"We hope that we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of its sun systems," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's infrared Processing and analysis centre in Pasadena, in a press communication.
The star shops of the Mediterranean are 445 light years away from the earth.
Many stars in this star shop, which had been about 125 million years ago, now reach the adult age.
They're turning the fastest now.
To split rotation rates, these slightly swimming stars shock great amounts of star winds.
Since these winds travel through the magnificent fields of the stars, they have a fragrant effect on the stars.
When a star is old, its rotation rate starts to delay.
Kepler misses the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between appearing a recognisable star fleet -- like sunfalls --.
The latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that massive stars are slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars of lower pirates than smaller.
"The Ballet of the Mediterraneans we see that slow rotors tend to be massive, where faster rotors tend to be very light stars," Rebull said.
Since the stars are close to the pearls, it must be an ideal cosmic lab to compare star qualitys such as rotation rates.
"The star buyers of the universe offers an anchor for theoretical models of the star rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
It's still much before us about what we want to learn more about how the way, how the time and why stars slow their rotation rates and so to shoot their "shoes".
Rebull and their colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports about their recent analysis of the rotation rates of the Astronomical Journal, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
An overwhelming baseball star is decreased
The clouds were faster at Alex Rodriguez than the US Basseball Star in the best day of base to base.
After his emotional return announcement, the 41-year-old Profi will take the Tricot of its New York Yankees on August 12th against the Tampa Bay Rays last time.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'Goodbye' both," the 14-year-old All Star Game partner of Major League Baseball (MLB).
Three times, Rodriguez was chosen to be the most precious player of the Liga, he wined with the Yankees World Series with the Yankees.
His subscription under a ten-year contract was estimated to him from 2007 to $27 million.
To the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he functions as consultants and youth coach, in full content.
As player, Rodriguez paid long time with performance.
With 696 Homeruns, 3114 Hits and 2021 points for his teams ("runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994-2000), the Texas Rangers (2001-2004) and the Yankees have created a few miles (Yenkees) stones since 2005.
With the Hall-of-Family members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two more baseball players are shown in the most important statistics similar values.
However, the 41-year-old boys should not be included in the roll hall of the baseball.
Because so successful Rodriguez - Spitzname "A-Rod" - was on the field, so sharp is his appearance outside the place.
In 2009, the superstar was able to take place with "ESPN" for prohibited steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, it was disrupted for 211 parties because of a development in the so-called biogenesis scandal.
Rodriguez is the principal suspect to have been obtained from an anti-aging clinic in Southern Florida.
After a legal strike, the sperm has still been reduced to 162 meetings.
"The liga could have done me even a accident for 2014, because I have played 20 years without pause," said Rodriguez at the time.
Also, his decision day does not pass slowly.
While many Baseball legends in their last games received the big bottles again, Rodriguez had to sit on the bank often.
"My job does not contain decision-tour."
"My job includes the attempt to win every game", last Yankees-Coach Joe Girardi.
Rodriguez was always married with the shore player Cameron Diaz and was subject to the relationship with Popstar Madonna and the player Kate Hudson, sympathy comments of the fans of Yankee-Erzrival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the adherents read at the 4-9-related team against the Rodriguez team.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silvia Danekowa and Adrian targetinski are the first doping accidents
Note: Because of a positive doping test, Adrian targetinski should not start from Poland in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are exceeded by the first official doping accidents.
A surprising athline would have won almost a medaille.
Before the seventh Wednesday, the first official doping cases were known the Olympic games in Rio de Janeiro.
The Chinese Smalling Chan Xinyi, Silvia Danekowa's 3000-metre-in-Shirt-Shirt of Bulgaria and the Poland-weight Adrian targetinski were tested positively and excluded in Brazil - directly before the start of the lightthletic competitive without critical disappointment, these messages will come unexpectedly.
In Chen last Sunday the diureticum hydrochlorothiazid was demonstrated as massing means for doping substances.
The International Sport Court CAS confirmed its exclusion of the Olympic games on Friday.
On Sunday, the 18-year-olds had the fourth place in the finale over 100 m smetterling, only 0.09 seconds she passed the bronze medaille.
On Friday, Chen had to participate in the proposals over 50 m freestyle.
Chen requested an opening of the B test and a hearing to the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
The national Association takes the matter "speakly and seriously demands Chen's full cooperation with the research", quoted by Xinhua, "We will cooperate with the International Sport Court of Auditors and accept the judgment."
The first time in the history is not more the IOC, but the CAS is responsible for the sanction of sportors with positive cases.
At the same time, in Rio's night, the news about the positive test at Danekova, the 33-year-old boys went to the open.
"I had three tests, all negatives, and my fourth test was positive," she said to the Bulgarian TV Sender BNT.
She is innocent, "the only declaration could be food supplementary", explained the Leichtathletin.
According to the report, it should be the EPO for the prohibited substance.
Danekowa was provisionally suspended, according to BNT, the BT test should also be positively disrupted.
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojko Borissow urged to speak with a criticism at the athline.
"I don't understand why the sportors don't get the right closures," he said, "We're the Bulgarians standing under observance, so many are already excluded."
Thus, almost all weight captains from the chronic doping nation cannot participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case "Adrian targetinski" was also known, the London Olympicist in class up to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tomasz three days ago on the anabolic steroid nandrolon.
Both of the adoptions, however, should not begin in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the starting of the light-offs, the Danekowa case is a further severe shock for the reputation of the whole sport.
The World Association IAAF had understood the complete Russian manity until an exception of the systemic dopings, also the implementation of Kenia has produced numerous bad news in Rio.
Moreover, the previous conduct in China for intense interferences were also carried out between the athletes.
So the Francose Camille Lacourt took the Chinese Olympicist Sun Yang hard.
"Sun who smells lila."
"If I see the podium over 200 m freestyle, I want to send me", said Lacourt in French radio.
Sun also was at the center of an interview with the Australian Mack Horton.
"I don't have time and no respect for Doping shopers," said it.
Sun was tested positively at the Chinese masterships at the stimulans Trimetazidine, but only one three-month specimen was required.
Data key: so perfide printed hacker her loss
Programmers of Press-Malware are currently engaged in enterprises targeted and are successful.
According to the current survey of Malware-Specialist Malware Bays under 540 companies in North America, England and Germany, 40% of the undertakings in the last 12 months were at least once a number of victims of a attack with Erpresser software.
In Germany, only 20% of the companies had already been targeted by a ransomware press.
40% of the victims were willing to pay the losses requested by the murders so that they could reuse the attacked systems and data.
The murders specialize their empressor software according to the observations of malware bytes, looking at attacks in company networks.
If it is successful, the potentially pressed loss payment is significantly higher than in private users.
"We currently observe a huge rapid evolution of the damage software," Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski explains in conversation with "the world".
The majority of malware programs were still designed to send advertising.
Then the murdered was discovered for themselves.
First, privacy users were the goal, but the changing to firms had been shocked in the last few months.
Ransomware works after a simple template: once on the computer of a victim, it is looking for long-changed files such as Word, Excel, or database files, as well as files of images and videos.
These files encrypt the Ransomware and remove the originals sustainablely.
Then the software presents the demands of the printer.
To get the final encryption code to the files, the victims need to send money - mostly in the form of the Bitcoin cryption.
However, where private users are on the game, there is a sensible customer data or project database, without which the production is slow.
Indeed, the damage is higher when a rail machine applies.
22% of the companies concerned reported the expenditure losses by ransomwares, 13% had to be completely interrupted to business, in a case of people in life.
In Germany a number of times of hospitals were victims of attacks whose patients may have been affected by the loss of nurses.
"We always say the victims: don't pay, you're only promoting the problem," says Kleczynski.
But 80 to 90% of the companies paying their data again.
For the manager, it is difficult to derogate the demand for the murders, faced with a slow state in the operation.
The hacker knows this again and trys everything to build a good reputation.
In a current study, the F-secure security researchers have studied the user surfaces and the contact with the printers and have come to the result: The killers really try to build a kind of customer service to get more money.
They explain their victims by chat how they can pay by Bitcoin, provide free support websites to or decrypt examples of files.
And privacy will be solved after payments of few hundreds of euros, enterprises must so hardly be negotiated and pay fifth amounts to return their data uncrypted.
In view of the potentially higher and relatively riskless winnings from the ransomware press, the hacker will always be professional and shared with the work, explains the security experts Chester Wisniewski from the Antivirus provider Sophos: "A individual person can write a ransomware about one week."
However, it is probably three or four persons.
The programmers then sell their damage software in the form of a software bag to the real printer.
The previous Malware kits were created by purchasing the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a single, fixed price between $000 and $10,000.
"The delivery contains an adjustment tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and burning can be changed", says Wisniewski.
The pressers then search for further hackers to distribute the freely purchased software under the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you can log in one of the forums under the base, buy the seat of a crime and use another to install the software on the most possible PCs.
The payment is followed by infected computer.
"Besides, the crimes are involved, then spammer with the dissemination," says Wisniewski.
The risk of ransomware is often known in many enterprises which make their data better safeguard.
More than 50% of the company-IT responsible for malwarebytes searching trust in rayware software to be able to switch files backups and scanner software.
In this way, the murders are already undergoing new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is no longer sufficient threat to successful recognition, the murders are threatened by the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations", says Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleczynski.
This means that the damage potential is more than previously higher than the type of data.
The murders could also take fullly new goals in the Internet of things.
At the Hacker Conference of Defcon demonstrated security researchers, how they could have obtained a thermostat associated with the Internet.
Within the winter, the freetenance of such a blocked heat could be valued by some of the victims.
If the murders block a whole factory strategy instead of heating in the future, the railware could also be a theme in the industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and daily
In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the diversity of a minivan.
It seems quite overloaded, but the HR-V, which was built on the same platform as the new jazz, is actually flexible every day.
Although the HR-V is only smaller than 1.60 m higher, the passengers have a lot of places in the first line and the foundation, it does not work closely.
The materials of the internal space are well processed and affected, only the cockpit surface depends on something.
Multiple than comparable vehicles is the HR-V at the stairway.
It is not only available for a copper room of 453 l at high-standed and 1026 l in rounded back rounds, but there is the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it clings: The seats of the back bank can be cut up like kinossel and provide steady that is up to 1,14 m from the ground to the board.
The coffee room can be good, but the load height of 650 mm is something higher than the comparable peugeot 2008.
The tested 1,6-l-cell with 88 kW/120 PS accelerates the HR-V from up to 300 Nm in weighing road number ranges very powerful.
However, he would do something less.
Happy is the consumption of 4.7 l/100 km daily.
There is another motorization: a 1.5-l benzine with 96 kW/130 PS.
Not offering an all-ray drive.
The conduct of driving is balanced, a good compromise between dynamic and comfort.
But it should be a little more direct.
The equipment can not open desires in the tested top variant "Executive".
The City Notbrem Assistant (hereinafter 32), the collision warning system and the Spurware Assistant.
The collision warner is sometimes irritating because it evaluates many obstacles to the ring as "recent objects".
Very reliable the television assistant works.
And the intelligent timer reacts to transport marks and drys the speed when needed.
The full connection is only for the top location: 7-Zoll toyscreen, Navi, App integration and more.
Two USB and a HDMI browser are under the arms and are therefore going to reach something outstanding.
The EUR 29000 for the good equipped top is okay.
Those who do not want to invest such a lot receive the benzine from EUR 20000, which is from EUR 23000.
The engines comply with the Euro-6 gas standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a wide and daily car.
Airline not captured: Storage on flight bridges
A airline does not arrest a passenger on the flight bridge.
Because a detention is only possible for risks that are typically for air traffic, the Supreme Court of Düsseldorf argued (Ac. 18 U.124/14).
The shooter had shocked a shooter at the shooting.
However, the accident could happen overall - it is a general risk of life, so the court.
The aircraft did not have to pay the man a damage.
Cases of disease: When the events pay
Hospital holidays will only be returned after their travel when the cause of disease is uncertainly found in the hotel.
But it is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests show the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, a family was difficult for disaster and crime on the second day of its Turkish permission.
She spent almost all the holidays in the room.
The vacants returned to a defective placement that seemed to have polluted the sea water.
The family was the view that the journey was missing - and complained against the event.
The applicants had no success before the court.
Even though the clarification was defected in fact.
But the event was just a short time before the applicants were dismissed from it.
He had to find out that the sea water was okay.
He therefore did not harm his information obligations, so the judgment.
There were no pollutions found in the samples of the water.
The disease of several hotel guests - possible by packing between - listen to the general life risk.
Of 691 guests were only 38 sick.
The Maizière said that after the banned acts of violence in Wurzburg and Ansbach in July, many people had worried about further attacks.
The State should be shocked and decided to react in terrorism.
Indeed, our country will not answer the violence of the murders with hate and disappointment.
This triumph, we're not gonna give the terrorists.
If criminals should leave the country more quickly, it increases security and also strengthens the approval of the population for refugee policy.
The Maizière wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals to the Federal Day of 2017.
He also announced a further staff strengthening the security forces, namely “in a mid-fourth dimensional order over a few years”.
Sympathy for terrorism must be sentenced again.
Video monitoring is intended to improve the weapons law so newly, especially the purchase of weapons on the Internet.
The last many discussed urgency for doctors should be maintained according to the Maizière's words.
However, in dialogue with the doctors, he wants to find solutions as to how the risk of citizens can be reduced, he said to be aware of psychological accidents.
In order to enhance the radialization of refugees, the Minister will provide better social care.
Learning forces should be better prepared for the treatment of traumated people.
For the persecution of crimes in specific areas of the Internet (Durknet), the Maizière places the use of declared investigators.
SPD Chief Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that is involved in increasing security."
It is important that the Minister of Internal Affairs have expressed a clear opposition against actionism.
"This was an earnest for the sharpmakers in the CDO/CSU," Gabriel said the newspapers of the Funke Media Group (Freeday).
The Maizière had previously rejected the vow from the Union following a Burka prohibition and the abrogation of the double nationality.
A general prohibition of full-releasing was a problem for constitutional law.
You can't prohibit everything you're rejecting, and I'm deniing the tragedy of the Burka.
Regarding rules, you can talk about the rule or for the witnesses.
Green Chief Simone Peter said to the minister that he would always simulate the effective power and conductivity of new anti-terrorism packages.
The left party Bernd Riexinger said: "Flotte Spruchs and a strengthening of the residence rights do not bring people to security in this country."
Improved transport flow on the car rail adjacent
It is regularly on the environmental strategies - this is a picture of November.
However, this should be changed: the law enforcement should be extended.
This is a good news for all car drivers that are located on the circle road every night when they walk through the trains to bridge (A 43).
The country's construction of roads is extended on Thursday and Wednesday (16/17 August) in the area between the Hammer Street and the Weseler Street, the law endorsed at 700 metres.
The car drivers can shoot right from the Hammer Street.
The great advantage: the transport will be more prematurely, improved by the total end of the overall section of the Federal Strategy 51.
The idea with the extended exhibition was the CDF in the district of Munster West.
The train drive on the train driver is mainly nervous between 17 and 19.00 p.m.
Workday, the backup is enough to bridge over the alberslope and sometimes out of it.
It is reasonable for the Nade resort on the B 51 short before the Weseler Street.
From here, the transport is only slightly flowing through the car bridges.
The second scene was to be rebuild for a goodty-first years ago.
The reason: Statistical calculations had shown that the bridges did not have the necessary trag force to cover, in particular, the loading.
As long as this engpass and the related working steel will be duration, the competent country business cannot say.
However, with years to recognise, because the bridge has an official use of the remaining period up to 2034.
For the prorogation of the law enforcement, the country industry has consciously requested the detrimental time in the schools because it was to be acknowledged with disabilities.
The transport shall be carried out on Thursday and Wednesday at the building.
Intercultural travel: Cultural offers for schools
The international class of the forest school visited the theatre room "The invisible house."
The Nima's Unit and the boy theatre are planning a music project now.
The Nima's Convention allows youths to visit the Migration and Refugees to visit cultural institutions in Munster.
The "Class International" of the Forest School of Children has visited a view of the price-created "The Invisible House" of the boy Theaters Munster.
In the context of the Nima's "intercultural travel" initiated between 11 and 15 years, 19 students visited the insertion in the small house.
Since the beginning of the year, the Agreement offers the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee interface to visit schools with welcome classes in the context of this project cultural institutions in Munster.
The majority of the classs came from September 2015 to March 2016 from Afghan, Iran, Serbia and Syria to Münster, and little disappeared from German.
Thanks to the choreographics, the scene images and video animations could have been possible to follow the event of conduct, so the press communication of the boy Theater Munster.
The Nima's Unit, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the young theatre will work in the next game time in a music theater project.
From October to December youths will receive the possibility of visiting professionally dedicated courses in the fields of sing, dance, showing and music with no refugee and migration interface between 14 and 20 years.
Provisions for children and families in the field of the theatre game and theatrale communication are in the planning.
The "Interculture travel" project continues.
In view of the increased refugee numbers, the agreement with many classes wanting to participate.
Sleeves instead of stars: hope of weather deterioration
The weather has made the star shoes in the south-west Germany in the night a strike through the account - but there is still hope.
The night was badly able to observe the sky spectacle because of rain and rain, said the Chairman of the Starwarte Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller on Friday morning.
Our hope is on Saturday night.
The weather should be good, then we will see many stars on the sky.
The star shoes are Perseads belonging to the fastest shoes of 216,000 kilometers per hour.
They have their name because they seem to come out of the star image Perseus that appears in the Northern.
Small night: Tips against sleep disorders
Tonight, if you're going to be eternity, you'll be wake up for a midday night, and you're not going to think about sleeping in the morning before the shopping kids.
It's all different than it's repeated.
There is always such problems in good society: According to Robert Koch Institute, about a fourth of adult sleep disappearances and more than ten percent of their sleep is often or permanently repeated.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders feel?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be a variety of causes based on them, highlights Hans-Gues, member of German society for sleeping and sleeping medicine.
What you understand, but the insomnie is, therefore, an insomnia and a sleep disruption.
While the sleeping is inadequate or inadequate, Jens Wagenknecht, member of the German household association with practice in the Netherlands.
What's going on behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
In this case, organic, psychological or conductive factors can be covered, but also medicational.
Not rare is sleeping expression of another disease.
"True early wave is especially often at a depression," said Weesch.
And it may be that different factors are different.
For instance, the one who has a band shock may be bad, waits every two-third hours and begins to shoot the whole day's problems and -sheres, there is an example.
This leads to adjustment, and sleep is not possible.
When should you have sleep disorders to your doctor?
Whoever not sleeps well over a month in at least three nights per week and is affected on the day should go to the doctor, sweet.
The inclination can look very different: It is shocked, laughed, unsoned, has difficulties with attention and concentration, it is easy to relieve, has stimulation smiling or physical complaints such as magic or head pain.
It is important to discover the causes of sleeping.
The treatment options, among other behavioral changes, a cognitive behavior treatment or even medically - classic sleep tablets are questioned only in exceptional cases and at least for two weeks.
In Germany, there is little sleeping medicines, Dr. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleeping center of the Charity University Medicine Berlin.
So you should first go to the home physician when sleeping problems.
It can explain with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should be in the bed laboratory, and what's going on?
For the study in the sleep laboratory, for example, physicians, for example, in snacks with athemaus seeds, in sickness of day, in sleeping channels, or if you don't find the cause of sleep disorders, fietze.
Preparing for the investigation must not actually be prepared.
You should get the day normal.
"No, please don't sleep at midday," says Fietze.
After the castle, you're going to bed at its normal time.
Besides the electrics in the body, you're taking a nase brill, a brown and a leg on the finger.
Moreover, a camera on the board will open the sleeping.
How can the interested people get the problems in the griff?
There are a lot of shoes in which you can be able to make a better sleep.
It includes: Regular sleeping and retreat times, not being too long in bed, not sleeping on the day, not look close to sleep, spend alcohol, and not watching at night at the watch - then then you start to recall immediately, and that's all and not even promoting.
What is the dschungel camp with lacking medals in the sweet
The former German summer Markus Debiler has been expressed by Facebook for the detainee of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he had helped the short-term rail masterships in Doha first time, put his first World Record at the same time.
Now the former DSV atlet Markus Debiler was protected by Facebook before his former teams in the criticism.
"In a country where a olympiazeeper receives a premium of $20,000 and a sweet king of 150,000€ should not be wondered about missing medals," wrote the 26-year-old boys on his Facebook page.
The promoting system in the swimming port is bad, but the doping controls are very good.
In this way we cannot competite with countries that promote very much and doping is not so precise or even acting on the subject.
"I don't say that the controls should be set here," he continued.
If he starts a competitor, Deabler should be reported for nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
That is how we should keep it with countries.
"If a certain time before WM/OS may not be controlled by WADA/FINA independent controllers, it may not be involved," the election-Hamburger calls for a iron diet in the middle of the year.
Airport: bands of bags
Professional Diebe at the airport Düsseldorf
On Thursday, two women and two men in the age of 50 to 61 years of age were civil servants of the Düsseldorfer police.
The defenders had started as bands with a number of tasting and packaging storms.
At 21.30 p.m. civilian officials were renowned by a band known by the police from the last slaughter crimes.
The two women and two men have started a number of crimes since the mid- July of this year, and there was a community, working and specially professional.
The criminal committee's specialists 34 may prove four acts to be taken by the committee of crimes to Germany.
They were totally invited to EUR 15,000.
Altbauers, a few line trees, between the rest of a stone floor: the Rigaer Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not act on the first sight, but the police is part of the "safe places" of the city.
When you go the street from East to West, you go to game places, a fried child garden and a biolade.
At the fassade of a green house, somebody has "happy!" spent.
With regard to a member that will also be deleted soon, it will be built: until 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new accommodations.
Articles on this "treatment part", as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain calls, are, however, designed with brushing cars in the last few weeks.
It was reasonable for the house with number 94: At first it was placed, mostly the people who lived in the subsequent contracts, however, there are still rooms and are used for events.
In particular, the Berlin Entersensor Henkel has spoken several times since the beginning of the year for a hard step in the police against the project, named "No-Go-Zone" for police police and 94 as an autonome start point of violence.
On June 22, the rooms in the earthquake, the chairmanships, with 300 police officers, patrolized the police for three weeks officials with 30 to 40 employees and three cars on the ground, cut parts of the road and took visitors to attend the house with number 94.
During the time, renewed construction workers as part of the unknown householders are the rooms.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court decided that the residence was illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers went to the jubel of Sympathists and inhabitants.
On this summer Sunday, the street is peacefully active: parents go to space with children, people sit on the citizen shift before the houses in the sun, others maintain a spoil.
In the immediate proximity of the house projects, a basic school and child farms are available.
Left violence is not the main care of many inhabitants: Kerstin Newbauers, who have lived since 1999 in Kiez, and Jana*, who are here larger, are particularly covered by the police presentation.
With the householders, they share the concerns of increased wages and genderization.
It doesn't sound after a kies, which mostly desires the police protection before the slaughtering links.
The crowd that the Berlin inner senator and the police between householders and their neighbors clearly does not exist so.
Friedrichshain in East Berlin was a traditional workshop, which also has a low average income and high poverty risk today compared to the rest of the city.
The households and the household projects that were born are already in Kiez for a long time: 1990 many houses were placed in the former DDR, including the whole mainway near the Riga.
While the maintainer was slaughtered in a regular street slaughter, many of the projects in the Rigaer were legalized and are still inhabited by the people who had been employed 26 years ago.
At the same time, in the last few years, the city has become more Magnetes for Tourists and Electoral Berliners from all the world: there are now populations from DDRs and former householders.
This is also noted in the wages that have increased almost 60 per cent since 2009 in reimbursements.
Many of the reconstructors in the Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: they are recognised for cuts or freshly stripped fassades that were covered with color shoes.
No other street was mentioned this year so often with the words "links autonomy violence".
A reason why not all neighbors consider it as a problem could be that they are not inevitably affected by criminality: criminals such as corporate infringement are almost exclusively against police.
The largest part of the crimes depends on the damages that tenderly meet the reconstrued and freshly renewed houses.
For Kerstin new constructioners who have been living in a house in a hill house next to the 94 surrounded, there can be no talk of insecurity for 17 years.
As regards violence, the people in the 94 are their neighbors who have not been determined.
Also, the famous brushing cars don't give it directly in the Rigare for a long time.
For the studied architects it is no criminal burning point, in the opposition: "Here you can help each other, live together on the street and get more of each other than any other."
New constructioners have been cut into the Riga Street - and remained.
That was why she was so important that the people returned to their road: from police, policy and media, which recently demanded all the Germanity over the city in July.
However, in the eyes of the inhabitants as new buildings, the street is continued to be removed: through visionless reconstructors in former buildings that disappear the old inhabitants.
"These are the last property accommodations that are not interesting for many here - more people living here that are not so well", they say.
"Government and destruction, I can't absolutely be good. "
But what should you do if someone never listens to?
It's going to put it on all sides, also at the police and the inhabitants.
For additives who were poor about color bombs, Kerstin Newbauer has little understanding: the house projects and the left scenes belonged to Kiez.
This should be aware of it - just like someone who stands in a swimming snake in there can be badly shocked over the laugh.
All persons presented with pre-names have requested not to be called with their right name
Urbach: Anniika Godchle is a new refugee deputy
Annika Godchle is the partner in matters of integration and organization.
In addition, she is a local social worker.
Since July, Annika Godchle is the Refugee Officer for Urbach.
The Social Pedagogic supports the management team of Ahim Grockenberger.
It seems to be a partner for all actors: refugees, workshops of refugee aid, administration, authorities and others.
Regine Customs of the working circle states that honor officials are more than thankable that God's cloud is now, the sweet milk milk, which is especially a problem.
Thus, some - less slower than the number of task areas were commonly, as the administration wanted to describe the office.
An administrative power has been requested with a talent for languages and people, linked to a long-year experience in social work, or an evil milk.
But administrative work is not her central area, I mean Annika Godchle.
In particular, it is about organization, work with people in place and behind the cultures and network activities.
The 31-year-old is around six weeks.
She has spent a 50-per cent stage for three years.
"It was the highest time," Regine Customer says, "Annika Godchles supported honor and primary actors.
There are major and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
Shortly new containers are located in the wash road
There is a serious problem since some time to find apartments for the refugees who have been recognised.
The communities are responsible for the connection submission.
They need to enter the refugees in their own or accommodated living rooms.
The costs for the construction, currency or renovation of these accommodations must take the communities itself.
The responsibility changes from the Country Board to Communs and Workcenters.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every host wants to offer its apartment.
Search is very difficult since some time.
In fact, the management does not find private apartments.
It doesn't work until now, if you are ordered to private housing, so God’s crowd.
Therefore, communal apartments must be equipped as it is so nice.
So soon new containers will be placed in the wash road.
But only with apartments it is not done.
Perspective is the sign, the Regine clients and annico Godchle are agreed.
In addition to a fixed stay, there are practical places, training facilities, school places, euro works and help activities for refugees and migrants who have to be found or established.
"More plans would be good", says Regine Client.
Many work in the building court or help homemasters, complete common work - and it motivates and very ordinary, as Annika Godchle reports.
It hopes that the work for the Commonwealth leads to a positive external impact.
That's "no job therapy".
But the activity does not mean only work.
The day needs a firm structure, say God's clouds and customers.
People should develop a sense of persistence.
So you need offers such as sports, contacts with local and especially language courses.
Professional courses are rar.
So switch the administration and the honourable officers here.
It is central that the refugees are feeling that they wished and welcomed in Germany.
The long time of the procedure is a problem.
They need to explain the refugees that it is the same time and they can fully overcome the time, for example, with speech courses.
Whoever ever develops the feeling, he cannot help anyone in the urban city, should not work and be unnecessary, who will never be integrated.
The clear majority is motivated.
But there are problems, however, are also, honestly said customers, "Leaves where there is nothing." The work of God's spirit and customers is therefore always motivating others.
It's all a "Mammut motion."
A difficult question: Do the two fear of radialization, even in a small community such as urban?
"No," Regine Customer says quite clearly, "what some can call naive." A restriction can be made, but they don't want to exclude.
The helper's being sensitive.
These events were also the subject of refugees.
They were afraid that the murders were completely invoked.
"You want to show that they have nothing to do", says Regine Client.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
As a result, primary and honor officials must be viewed in the area and in the region.
In this way, they always have the background that immediately a new stage of refugees and migrants could come to urbans.
Germany needs an overwhelming level?
This question is clearly answering the policy.
Indeed, it is unfair to help them in place.
"In the city, we're not here where we're going," says Annika Godchle.
No new refugees, which would relax the situation.
Regine Clients also clearly shows that the urbans have already been loaded to integrate consciously the people at the time.
These are now about 100 people, most young men.
But if people are in need, they should be helped, both women agree.
The political situation is so complex, there is no simple answers.
