Parliament did not support an amendment to Tymoshenko
Parliament of Ukraine has rejected today the proposal to derogate the amendment of the section of the Criminal Code in which the leader of opposition Yulia Tymoshenko was condemned.
The amendment would open the doors to the excarcelation of the Minister's expression, but the parliamentary rejected the proposal to reduce the punishment for economic crimes in the second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years of prison for the presumed sign of an agreement with Russia that was deceived to Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The sentence is not yet strong, the court of appeal has the obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko has proved to be convinced that it was a political income of the regime, and even in the West, there have been doubts about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to be retired of paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code condemned to the former Prime Minister was supported by 147 Members in the vote.
For its approval, 226 votes were required.
Libya's victory
The history of Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, has already losers.
Muammar el Gaddafi was entered in a secret place in the wilderness and without him no more war.
It remains to define who the winner is
As it is already habitat in the region, Islamians gained the elections, but now it is to dilute if it is moderate or radical.
The National Transition Council has entered into force the traditional law, the Sharia, which we already know in a certain manner.
Libya will become a country without crime, because the ladrons will be cut off their hands.
Women can already be forgotten to evacuate and posts by waiting for their implementation and so on.
Instead of the person of the dictator, the society, composed of war tribes, will be joined by the Coran.
In Libya, a order will be set that we can't imagine and that we can't certainly.
However, our life form is not the only or objectively the best, and I probably did not agree to the already mentioned libraries.
It is true that it is not surprised that Islamic fighters accept the help of the unfaithful dogs.
The only justification was that, from its view, the attacks of the OTAN did not lead them to a United States general, but the greatness of God, whose greatness had been held after each of the successful interventions.
When they're looking for winners in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are attracted in a shooting of the Islamics and our politicians to disfellowship a dictator in the person of a political partner without having guarantees of benefits.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not take care of Libya militaryly.
In this case, local authorities do not have a problem to exclude the "created"
But, without occupation, will the oilers be made with the light black gold only with good words?
It is quite possible, but it may eventually be that the West may eventually presum the protection of human rights.
Always the followers of the share do not cross us.
Starting a new era of the crisis
France and the rest of Europe are going to the cast of the investors searcher
A statistical torment has been extended by Europe
The individual States have published their data from GDP for Q3.
The Czech economy has been launched during the inter-quatry period while France and Germany have grown.
However, the market of goods today has cut records.
Investors are not only fixed in Italy but also in Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of Eurozone, Germany, Czech and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates on economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP increased by 0.5 per cent, from France to 0.4 per cent
Both countries have publicized the data of the second quarter, and in Germany increased more than expected (0.3 per cent instead of expected 0.1 per cent), although in France there was a slight reduction of 0.1 per cent (original data talked about stamping).
Czech economy has grown a total of 1,5% in the third quarter of this year.
However, during the inter-coast period, the brutal domestic product (IPP) has been established and, according to the SUU, the tendency to gradual disadvantagement in the growth of economic development is complied with.
The results are even worse than the analysts' predictions.
Main events:
Indeed, Checa economy has grown in the third quarter of this year by 1,5%, but quarterly it has been established.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to the previous and statistically revised data, increased 0.5%.
The economy of the Eurozone and also of the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, increased a 0.2 per cent, with the expectations of analists.
The Greek economy has fallen internally at 5,2%.
The interest of their goods to ten years is 28.45%.
The interest of Italian and Spanish goods has grown up to critical limits.
The problem began to affect Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
The interests of the cheques to ten years are maintained in 4%, although the situation is in the area.
In Germany, votes have been made to say that the ECB should grant loans at the latest time.
Cheques are classified for the Eurocopa.
They won 1:0 and celebrate the classification with a first 200 million.
The fatball team complies with the hardest committee of the whole time!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent śech and the brilliant port Petr Jiráček, the victory was given for 1:0.
The Czech team, together with a good dose of luck in the second time, was fantastically defended by the attacks of the local team, so that it will not miss the quote of the European campaign.
IHNED.cz continued detailedly the development of the party in a minute reporter.
There was almost no emotion in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The checo team, thanks to the slope of the local team towards the end, and also to the excellent game of śech and the Jeráček hero, wined by 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrated his step at the Campeonato of Europe.
Because of the checa’s fair defence, the montenegrins did not press until the second half.
The two offenders of the party were Damjanovič and Vučinič, which left two great occasions.
In addition, thanks to the Genial Petr śech, the 11-Cheek will not miss the quote of the Copa of Europe, so that the ships of the national fatbol will reach a nearly 200 million corones.
Since the first minutes, a good game was given.
Both teams were played so only in maintaining the lines and playing nothing more around the center of the field.
There was no pressure of local players in the first half, patented to another field in defense, just what the Czech defense would have to avoid.
Iranian students are ready to die for the nuclear programme of their country.
They formed a human shooter.
A number of hundreds of university students formed human sculptures around nuclear installations in Iran.
They want to express their support to the nuclear programme of their country to a possible Israeli attack.
Students began to pray on Tuesday at the midday before the installations and then drew slogans of death to the United States and Israel.
Several hundreds of university students formed the march in the Iran City of Isfahán human schools around the nuclear technological center in which they worked with uranium.
They want to demonstrate that they are willing to defend the nuclear programme of their country with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a recent report, noted that Iran, according to all the indications, was able to achieve nuclear weapons.
In Israel, it is a possible attack to Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students began to pray at the average before the nuclear installations of Isfahan and then launched slogans of death against the United States and Israel.
In case of attack, whose goal would paralyze the Iranian nuclear programme, would be achieved, according to Israeli sources, not only the center of Isfahan, but also the Natanz installations, where uranium is enriched.
Daymenu of a obeyed child: non-desay and buried dinner
More than a third of the children under the age of 9 to 13 years have overweight problems, where overweight affects 9 per cent of the school population and 5 per cent obesity.
Obedient children are conducted in most families with a lifestyle that is not healthy, according to current investigations.
There is again evidence of the importance of the environment where it grows to a healthy development of the person, as well as of the models that serve a reference.
In the table, for example, obsessed children are feeded by embryos at least two times that family children with normal weight.
To dinner, more than 19% of the obedients had fresh patates on the day before the analysis, which is linked to the prevention program "Augurity is not a possibility".
In children with overweight there is no habit of sporting, which is applicable to most of the current families, where only 15 per cent of the children responded that their parents, at least once a week, find time for the physical exercise.
Inquisition carried out at 900 children
The survey was carried out at the end of the last school year and participated in almost 900 children of all the Czechian basic education.
It was already the second edition of the program of "Augurity is not a possibility", which supports the General Health Company and the Unilever Company.
To date, more than 12 000 children have participated in the project from 4 to 8th course.
A suitable and sufficient food in the family are decisive factors, which make significant reduction in the number of children with overweight and even obesity.
"The only half of the children surveyed have responded to five daily foods according to the regime: breakfast, lunch, food, mere and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet," collects one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast but with enbuted for dinner
Experts advise that, in a healthy development, the details are also important, such as having a fixed time for family breakfast.
Nevertheless, only 23% of the school families are disappointed at the same time.
In most families, each one is alone.
But the worst was to find out that in 10% of homes there is nothing to be disappointed.
The breakfast, however, is the basis of a good daily diet.
The study shows that in the families of obedient children are much more often consumption of fresh patate humans.
Almost all - independently of weight - drinks to dry newspapers (70%).
In general, more than 40% of the children who have been surveyed are sported, however, this result is reduced by less than half, only 15%.
Manufacture your diet
The next stage of the study was possible to create their own diet from all possible offers according to their guests and opinions.
"The food preferences of checa children under age between 12 and 15 years, from the point of view of healthy food, are very disappeared from the ideal."
Between your favorite food, the pasta, the flesh and the sweet are found
"It's about all alarming popularity of sweet refreshments," warns in the final report of the study.
As the main food, the palm takes the pasta and continues to be near the bird flesh.
Practically, children are always rejecting fish and vegetables.
Change to healthy habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their food habits if they receive the right information.
"In the monitoring group of participants in the study, which filled the questionnaire after the prevention program " obesity is not a possibility", in many cases, a significant change was made in favour of the principles of healthy food", is pointed out in the results of the study.
It calls attention, for example, regarding sweet refrigerators, where many children would begin to prefer normal and flowing water.
The children would also choose more frequently in the questionnaire of birds and fishing for the main food and restrict soft food consumption and milk derivatives.
The stylelist must also be a good psychologist, support professionals
In the introductory article, how to learn the stylelists, I already requested a little that the initial lessons were already pretty loaded.
I didn't know how I would go to that.
Conferences of three ramo professionals, how to dress problems and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the world of the spectrum.
And it'll be worse.
How close the final reviews are, more information and practical tasks are waiting for us
And although the course is developed every Saturday and Sunday, there is no longer one alphabet.
We have once studied with the director, Alena, (in course there is no man) about how to clothe the woman who has no perfect symmetria.
And that's the great majority.
Someone is culinary, someone has a slighted figure without the appropriate curves, and someone suffers overweight.
The stylelist has to know widespreadly some width shadows, extend a hair or recree the necessary curves
We have given some tricks about how to emphasize the body of women of the type of Jennifer López, of huge but close skin and at the same time not clothe it too unfaithful
If, for example, the difference between the skin and the chairs is so much that the floor or the pants are not adjusted, it is important to make at least one extra screen switch to measure.
Uncertainly, they will not be repented, because the clothing that she feels perfectly is implacable.
With a measured floor, you will feel much better than with one that is not to move, get up, dance in the skin, etc.
The isolated body can be enabled to clothe with sweet, sweet, strip or dramped clothing.
There are certainly many different types of information and body, so I'm happy that I have all the week to order in my head all this information.
And even so, I am afraid with the assigned task, I have more than sovereignty.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two famous people, which should design two clothes: one for the day and one for the night.
It is necessary to take into account the current aspect, the mode style that is appropriate to the person concerned.
She touched me "walking" in Miranda Kerr, maybe you know the Victoria's Secret campaign.
I crie inside, it is much better for me than, for example, Brinny Spears or Christina Aguilera, which will recently have shooted hundreds of kilos (Do not take account of the exageration), or the youth Selena Gómez.
The clothes have to recover them from the magazines or seek them on the Internet and print them, to then develop them graphically.
The moodboard, which is called the complete result, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with the graphic design.
It is also important to think on the graphic part of styliism.
The stylelist has therefore not only seen physically, but also the product pages in the magazines (of specific topics, such as trends, balls, boards, etc.).
From all that he spoke to us the styleist and designer Mario Kameník.
But all this remains for Sunday.
The stylelist must have a global vision.
The three specialists encouraged the Saturday conference with information on all types of bodies.
The Honza Pokorný stylelist, Jakub Polanka mode designer and the Ben Renč mode photographer.
Jakub recalled us that mode is an illusion and the styleist should know you to get out of this.
And a good stylelist can work with the same clothes of different forms.
The variability is in this case fundamental.
Thus, the such hammer (or, as they say in English, trench-coat) can be clothed to the classic with vacuums and shops, but also serves to clothe the body with tacon shoes and to photograph it as if it was actually a clothing.
Or it's enough to recover it and up the hair to get a completely different image.
"Jugad with that," he stressed us.
What's more value is the following counsel: "To begin working, it doesn't require you first know all the rules."
"You can already break them," said Jakub.
Finally, I am clear why we remember all these formulas, which is combined with why, why, if then results in the mode magazines, we find different results.
That's without talking about the disfiles.
Thanks to the Ben photograph, I know that a stylelist has to have more types of clothes in the reserve of which he intends to photograph.
So, for a mode history that has ten pages (for example, ten outfits), there must be prepared, lists to use at least 15.
In addition to the pictures, the clothing works in combination with other weapons, all of which are used in reality.
All of this has to be taken into account at the time to design outfit.
Honza Pokorný has assured us that the image and style are only, in many cases, half of success.
Look at Madonna, which is not exactly a extraordinary song, but the image and the marquetin have made it a world star.
In Czecha there is no clear trend to use the styleists' services.
Even the famous persons also find it inutility (I have enough my skills, my physical aspect does not have so much importance).
And when someone asks us our services, it must be taken into account that it is very likely that they show us a very different tile to your real (minor).
Then it's only being guiled and wondered if the newspapers of the heart have already written on the subject, if a certain celebration has been engraved/developed, etc.
Sunday, Honza and Mario stressed that the styleist was not enough to guide him in mode, but that he must understand outfit.
During your work, especially it must be communicated with the people you saw, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows appreciation for people, he does not make it less, defends their opinions.
"When a director contracts you to classify the clothes and complete it with good taken, you could not cook and take everything I had and say, "What's horrible."
"Thank at least a couple of things that you can consider and recommend that someone can put it", says Mario.
He also showed us that everything must fall in the "placovka", i.e. the cup of work.
This is fixed around the skin and there are all the necessary tools.
It is objects such as tigers, tigers, quitapeluses, or imperdibles. There are also nailon hills (which serves to the styleist during the session of photos of products such as cups or gorge), special shoes of shoes by front, if it is higher (the alphaelars and other types of gangs are not allowed because they may harm the teeth), or a swimming game.
To not stay in passive listening and put something in practice, we learned to reverse the sun of the skins.
Even during the photo sessions at the study, on a planned surface, the sun could be damaged and much more outside.
And we didn't do more than revesting and revesting.
We couldn't touch the shoes with the tissue to don't hurt them for accident.
So I had to be very hard.
Mario gave me a joy to congratulate my work without reservations.
The truth is that it's not really good to me that skill.
This is only a small part of all we have heard during the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I have already understood that my dedication to the stillism at the professional level is not a rock path, but it gives me exactly what people say.
En Need for Speed: The Run works throughout America.
Reference
A travel, in principle unfortunate, is complicated because of a series of unexpected discounts of a rutinary journey during the morning round.
In some measure, it was possible to cover the expectations, but it does not serve anything, if, in fact, it was not intended to do anything extraordinary.
The new delivery, which was added to the title The Run, took great expectations before its star.
I promised that I would give new ages to the ancient Need for Speed shop and, due to this shown, appears as a game that should not end again to be a kind of action without any more.
We also wondered how to stay the inserted scenes, where the main character drops from the car and walks through his own feet.
As normally happening in the NFS series, the results did not vary much about what we expected.
There are carries that can be given for acceptable, but in the total bond, they are lost points because of absurd failures, which are already appearing in the series for years.
In fact, it is not possible to be called errors, but it is better for the uncomprehensible decline of programers.
Aventure starts very well.
If you introduce you in a history, whose protagonist, Jack, has some personal problems; to solve them, you are offered to participate in an illegal career across America.
You sit the flight in the west coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to reach the first to New York.
The idea is offering something interesting.
The road is divided into ten stages and then in over 50 cars.
This deduces that each cart has a different road and the stages are located in different environments, which results very different and interesting.
Thus, one does not have the sense of the game always offer the same.
Some of the environments are even pleasant to view, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to the previous delivery of the series.
So it's nothing of the other world.
But the pastee through the desert, the autonic landscape or the high neighboring mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
Furthermore, the carriages are differentiated once by a typical element.
So, for example, in the wilderness you find a sand torment that reduces visibility.
Instead, the mountains have to be careful so that you don't throw a snake.
According to that, each of the cars is very well developed.
There's only a couple of models, but it's enough.
During a moment, you try to go forward to a quantity of required rivals (the normal in a classical car), then you tried to win time (Classic Klassic Devil) and then waits for a duty against a single adversary.
In the midst of all this appears sometimes the police, which does not only make it harder.
The newness is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to get out of someone and you have to help him, always click the right button at the right time.
It's nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are enough less landscapes in the game what should be expected (in particular there are only three).
But the final result is positive, because this element does not become mourning and, in the context already mentioned, is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model remains the shoes of the previous episodes.
This means that today's no longer a great thing, but it can't be said that it's bad.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you can already search for another part.
But to a fully designed cart, this style of conduct should be enough, although we can find something better between the competition games.
Even here, it's in order.
But the problems occur after a certain time.
Unlike the right of the conduct models, do not happen the same with the colisions.
From games of this type you can't expect to recruit complicated deformations and colitions, but in fact before a shooting against any object, you can't predict how you will react your car, with which it's not in order.
It is typical that, when making a very adapted advancement or driving the car with a normal traffic, there are only light rocks, but in other situations almost identical, your car finally makes uncontrolled pirates.
Or even completely destroyed.
Thanks to the retreat system, they do not have great problems, but you can put them out of a bad humor.
The retreats are designed in such a way that when you suffer an accident or you get out of the track, the game returns you to the last rescue point on the track.
However, only five residues are available in each cart.
If you consum them all, you must restart the road from the beginning.
So it isn't more than a help if something doesn't go well, but it's not very trusting.
Sometimes, nor the retreat helps, only helps you to learn the given memory stage.
A great depreciation of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, there is a specific way to enter; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Another time you find you in some "civil" vehicles always with the same setting, although you are the first, five or five minutes ago or later.
This is going to raise mostly in situations, when you see that two cars that go to the meeting in opposite addresses, you're going forward without problems, but when you get it, you should turn or swim well.
It's the same time you arrive, because it's planned because the "stress" will always happen before your natives.
The opposites also have more advantage.
During the whole game you will arrive to places where, without taking into account the moment, you will always advance the same adverse on the same site.
Furthermore, this happens at the end of the game, in a long bridge, which results still more shocking.
Your opponent must arrive before you, at the price that it is.
When you go ahead of yours, you difficulty see the cars that come forward, so you can first pople the car.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum suspense and adrenaline doses, but execution is so apparent that you are certainly immediately deceptive.
And it's a regret, because even though the model of the travel is simple, the game is diverted and with action, so it is often not possible to follow the details of what happens or where.
And indeed, if the merit is taken the idea with 50 exclusive pistas or classification in the car so that it doesn't cut the burden, or anything else.
Inhabited idea is the change of cars during the cars.
You have to be attentioned to the gasoline surrounders on the road, because it is just there you have to change your car, although in most cases, you will sufficiently do what you have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Deportations are suitable for urban areas, American strong cars for rectangular cars and super-deporting exotics for technical driving, for example, by mountain roads with curves.
Furthermore, the main narrative ice also appears a ice of parallel challenges, i.e. there are carries in specific places that you will know for the historys.
Here you will get not only medals, but also experience points for your profile, which serves both for challenges and accounts.
When reaching the higher level, the driver opens a number of possibilities, starting through the car and ending with funds for the profile.
At the same time, a online Autolog function is connected, which compares your results with other players and provides other Community functions.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last career is done in history.
With the car you get to the metro tunnel (pase), where you can fly to dark ways (pase).
The frequencies between 150 and 200 km/h (pase) and, soon after you, the metro port comes and will be carried out in front without any more.
In the edition we will certainly have a discussion about this for several days, about it during the programing of the game, no one even thought a little or if the authors of the truth take us for a panda of bobos.
The technical part of the game is not nothing extraordinary, but at least general visual effects result in most of the pleasing cases, sometimes even sovereign.
Because it's regret that, at the worst moments, the quality of the image is reduced in a serious way.
This affects most of the accidents where many participants are involved, when the quality of image is not already valid.
The audio is good and the sound band is a matter of guests.
In order to be pleased to most of the youth group, the sound band belongs to the category "Bath one of his father and mother," but it can be suggested that nobody would buy the game only for his music.
The final sensation of Need for Speed: The Run is quite confused.
If the game avoids absolutely tight errors, we would have problems to claim that The Run is the best NFS game in the last few years.
It feels that the game is not completed.
The difference is safe, but prepare because errors will shoot you in the eyes with the strength of some flight reflectors.

Ambassador to the EU, Vicenova:
Cheques have a reputation of negatives and eurosceptics.
"The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions."
"I didn't expect a war without quarter."
"They will take five, six years before the situation is a little stability, calm and new players get up to their new roles," thus began with conviction its conference in the Czech Ambassador in the EU, Millenna Vicenova.
How it is not to take seriously its "class and openly on Europe", which said in the first part of its conference, when he was able to describe each EU organ and his relations with such preciseness and clarity, because it would be the sending of many conferences of the United Carolina Law Faculty.
Vicenova also considered the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
"The first one is the critics that, if it is insulted, a green official is able to take any role, but I'm saying he left all unconcerned, because he takes his roles to perfect."
"He is a man who knows listening to the members of the twenty-five states, communicating with them and having a clear vision of where to go the EU."
The new position of representative of the Foreign and Security Policy is explained from the question: "What is this EU? What number can I call it?", therefore, this is a important step to the unification and clarification of the political unity of countries such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us the chest of Olomouc
Vicenova has also been occupied on the next agenda and will continue and continue to continue to the European Council in the next future.
The Czech Presidency has been a success two years ago.
Cheques were undertaken by the emergency economic crisis, solved the gas crisis and organized a Summit for Eastern Association.
The government's fall at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU has at the time many commitments.
In the words of the embassy, "a good night", not only the Presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is now being treated.
On the other hand, the EU budget for seven years must be adopted, caused by the current economic situation, much more complicated.
If the budget is more simpler and effective, what sectors will be priority, what countries will receive more support and less? This will be present in the agenda of the next meeting.
The Ambassador also recalled its main sides, with which it came to Europe: "Account of Europe with clearness."
"The truth is that I don't like feast abbreviations, foreigners or gears that people don't understand."
"How can a citizen understand that in Brussels the skins are not really invented, the curves or rounds, the plates of different sizes, or that no one will ban us the shoes of Olomouc?".
It also intends to get more useful from the EU's environment and approach more Czech citizens to European institutions.
We're waiting for Europe of speeds
According to the embassy, cheques have a fame of eurosceptics, and people understand the negative aspects of the positives.
He also regretted the low participation of the cheques in the European institutions.
There are many factors, such as modesty of our candidates, their incapacity to write motivation messages, but also the low support of the cheques.
In addition to the success of the Czech presidency, it stressed the force and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Cree me that when you add to me a Poland and a Hungary and is about me a slovakia, a French to my side says to me, "What, have you already stayed, those of the Visegrad Group?", and you see no grace to him."
In the future, the EU, according to Vicenova, is expected to expect new sustainable rules on budgetary policy for Member States.
It is a very real thing of the concept of the two speeds, if not more, in Europe, more than the new "European Federation".
"We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone."
"We have the Schengen space and we have the strengthened cooperation procedure."
"It was said for the first time that they only cooperate with countries who want and those who do not, that they stay out."
"This procedures will be increasing and strengthening Europe of the two speeds," is expected Vicenova.
In this regard, he also highlighted the role of Checa and Herman van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle, according to which all the issues affecting the whole EU should be discussed between Member States, not only among the members of the Eurozone.
Brand story:
The innovative IBM started on the second century of existence
If someone looked for a term that was very precisely defined by the IBM Strategy, the most closest would be "length."
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is undertaken as current and, however, has been over 100 years since its foundation.
The basis of this long-level character put it the first head of the signature, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Mr.
He already acknowledged that many world problems have a solution if people are ready to think.
His "Think" word became its seals, around which the life of the giant future will be built (he was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began to publish in 1935).
Watson was also the basis of a carefully raised enterprises culture.
"For us, IBM implies a long-term thinking, a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and prosperated for hundreds of years because its basic principles were faithful, but without fear of changes around.
That has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to be more prosperous in our second century," said during his birthday, the current director of the company Samuel J. Palmisano.
A sophisticated system
Watson, already in the 30s, was worried about the care of his employees as Baśa employee in Chequia (the employees of IBM were the first US operators who enjoyed vacation pay, safe, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated reward system that was worth the best inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sofistication maintains IBM in the relationship with the customer.
Since first, the company was supposed to discover talents (which was one of the first world enterprises to end with any kind of discrimination, it could be elected without problems).
On the line of the anti-discrimination strategy is the current plan of IBM, which will be replaced by Palestinian the year that comes to a woman: Virginia Romatty.
She's already working for thirty years in IBM, where he has been the head of sales, marquetin and strategies.
During the past few years, IBM has participated in the called virtual meetings, rain of online ideas, which are infinity of future strategies and innovations.
It is not surprised that they overcome ideas, because in the sign, almost a half million people work.
A institution with good reputation
The position set in the business provides an internal and external image to the company.
"Dead, IBM maintained an institutional concept more than technological undertakings", states the Economist professor of the Harvard Business School and author of the IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter book.
"IBM is not a technological company, but a company trying to solve business problems for technology users," pointed out George Colony of the Forrester Research advisor.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the business and creating a business directly.
IBM - or "Green Green" - as it is known in the U.S. familyly because of its logo, it has become one of the world's largest enterprises in the last hundred years.
The most powerful technological company (develops both teams and programs, infrastructures and web accommodation services within a wide range of services from servers to nanotechnology).
The largest number of patents from all North America technological companies and five of its employees have received Nobel premium.
Among its invents are the automatic box, payment cards, financial switchs, bar codes and disks.
IBM will fabric this year $220 billion. This year has become the second technological subscription for market capitalization (the first is Apple), when he first exceeded in 1996 to Microsoft.
View to Future
Not all products and innovations are finally satisfied with the guests of customers and the time (IBM has not issued by its own operational system, OS/2, online prodigy services or IBM PCjr computers).
"If your business is based on progress, it cannot be emotionally enclared in the past," acknowledged Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM has no problem in building its bases on other platforms (and also, if they do not work, leave them).
And that's the difference of competitive, Microsoft, which is mainly maintained and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Future technology
With regard to sales, IBM is mainly dedicated to services, which are about one fifth part of programs and another fifth teams.
However, in 1990 the teams represented more than half of the share of suppliers.
From 2000, IBM has sold low income shares for a total of $15 billion, and during the same period, $58 million had invested in the purchase of technology for future.
Investments have been followed since 2008, when the world's modern financial crisis was first shown.
IBM acts according to the premises of his first head, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of 29 increased investment.
It seems that even now the IBM company has been able to understand the crisis.
The value of IBM actions since the beginning of 2008 has grown strictly up to 120 per cent, and the net benefit of the company has not been increased.
The IBM division is to change it all, except on value.
It can therefore be expected that when the next crisis comes, this giant flexibility will survive.
IBM history: from the shoes cut to space flights
The IBM company (International Business Machines) was founded in New York for hundred years and was its original Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM is already adopted in 1924 - originally it was a mark used in the Canadian and South America sugars.
The basis for IBM's birth emerged from the fusion of four enterprises reset by the decade of 1880.
It could be invented as the famous "first watch" that allows to control the entry and exit of employees.
The new company's architect was Charles Ranlett Flint's business man, who also presided to his supervisor until 1930.
Flint left the chief of a competitive company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him with the company's management.
The new leader eclipsed to the founder of IBM (Watson’s ideas remain the strong basis on which corporate culture and identity are supported).
Watson directed the company until 1952.
IBM, as indicated in its name, began with the production and sale of all kinds of devices for business, from meat cuttingers and cheese to register boxes.
During the first four years that Watson directed the company, the facturation doubled $9 million and began the great expansion of the company by the continents.
Watson was so crucial for the company that, nearly 40 years after taking the head's seat, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its address, IBM began working in the development of artificial intellectuality and developed the first programing language.
In the 1960s, IBM's staff and computers helped NASA to drive flights to space (a Mercurio, Saturno and in 1969).
While in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classical "peses" which set up the computer standard at that time reached the market with IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its production of computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, by its part, purchased the consultative part of the Price Waterhouse Coopers company and began offering a complete advisory and high value services.
The strategy that IBM has paid over the past three years is the Smarter Planet concept, i.e. "A more intelligent planet".
Its aim is to make more rational use of technology, although the areas have not yet been planned and the circumstances, for example, have been improved in the transport and administration of cities.
For the trade sector, IBM has not been very much presented by the Smart Commerce platform that allows minorists to manage the full trade cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
The first country in Central and Eastern Europe was already opened in the Czechoslovakia in 1932.
Today, the IBM śR also operates the strategic for externalization in Brno.
The Headquarters for Central and East Europe is in Prague. There is also a world's famous research team that works with the voice recognition.
Rychtáova about his unfaithful husband:
I'm not gonna want it anymore!
Darina Rychtáova (53) said it ended!
After his husband Josef Rychtá (53) had become the only protector of Iveta Bartochova (45), but also his loved man, Darina continued to have the hope that Josef would get out of his red dream and return to his home.
However, it is not going to wait and has set clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can return home, but no longer like my couple," Rychtáova explained.
When Darina Rychtáova accompanied during the summer to Bartošové in his home, he couldn't imagine how he would end her marriage.
Despite the request, Iveta had not moved thirty days after śičany and Pepe did not leave the song.
He even declared that she loved her.
With the time, Darina resigned himself, apparently accepted his husband’s relationship and even disappeared from him forever.
Rychytá doesn't matter with whom your wife is.
If one day Rychtá would break with Bartošov, his wife would not wait for it at home with open arms.
It's the biological father of my children and, if you want to live the rest of your life in our house, no one will escape it."
"But here I would live not so much as my loved and old bowl that was fair, but as a man who joined me some lazos," said Rychtáova and added that he had already dismissed his husband and insisted only on the mutual respect.
Josef doesn't matter that his wife has closed the door behind him.
"I accept my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and there's no possible change."
"My wife established this as a marriage on the role and I respect it."
"The company continues to enter into force, I do house arrangements, regarding the garden, home, I will purchase."
"Darina and I talked to us normally, the only thing is that we don't share bed," Rychtá said.
If Rychtáova finds a new love, he wouldn't oppose himself.
"We don't sleep together and she doesn't interest me, nor where he goes, nor if he's a girlfriend.
I know that it's my fault, I love Iveta and live all the responsibilities," he concludes.
The worst vibrations of women: Is it also related to you?
If you ask men that you can quote some typical victories of women, each of them will generally appoint them without thinking.
Dear women, are you recognised in the following lines, where some vineyards of women are referred to that they can harm the blood to men?
Acquisitions
Does you reprove your naranja media that has the dependence of the purchases?
Do you have to buy at least one trap in week?
Do you like to buy in the baths often?
Then in your case you can say that go from buys has become a vicious.
Some women are aware of their passion for purchase, at least a little.
But when seeing, what woman could resist the attempt to pass without any more for clothes, search for well-justed takes and then try them all in the prosecutor (ideally in all different colors)?
Although the majority of women go to purchase is a passing time, men can almost become a hell.
Remember how many times you already told her couple that it's better to wait before the door.
Consistent insatisfaction
"I'm not too warm?"
"It's supposed to get up at least five kilograms - should I start to do an exercise?"
"Do I really like you?"
Don't you hear these phrases?
What do you mean?
Then it's one of those women obsesionate for their aspect.
It is not that you should stop taking care, but many men are allergic to listen to your couple to take all the time of your physical aspect.
The strong sex is also agreed that the increased frequencies of complaints, the more mourning women become.
Order and cleanness in the first place
It's like an infinite life.
Put the windows, pass the aspirant, swim the ground, remove the powder, swim the bathroom and all that at least two times per week.
Does your couple reprove the clean ground with a sweet foot, your children who have slept a new cleaned lavabo, and a stair with glass doors that were so costing to clean him?
If you suffer this "deviation", you are certain that nothing should be exaged and that order and cleanness should not be safely occupied as primary in the family.
This unforgettable desire of cleaning could threaten your relationship and family welfare.
Do unpleasant comments
"Use calzoncilles are left with the Swiss clothes."
"You want to put you too tomorrow those calcetines used."
"The mood trap is not left on the ground!"
If you do these commentarys to your couple more times a day, I know that you can get it out of your boxes.
Of course, you don't want to say anything bad, you just want to get that everything's in order.
Maybe, if men know that, women, on their part, would not make so many comments.
Calumnias and chisms
Some women are also the calumnias, the chismes, but also the abuses and conspiration against someone.
Women focus on the relationships, so they like to talk together about things of the kind, where, with whom, how and why.
Better to each of us sometimes a small and unforgettable chism is shocked.
With the hand in the heart, this is just of almost all women.
On the other hand, there are chismoses from those who are not controlled, who love the chismost and often do it, disrespect all of them and are dangerous for those who run them, especially in a women's work team.
Yagr and Voráček helped with their assistance to win Philadelphia
The Hockey Jaromir Yagr's department participated in NHL's meeting with two assistance that brought the victory on the Philadelphia 5:3 in Carolina's chat and returns to the checa players in the guard of competition.
In both cases, Clude Giroux used the 39-year-old star game, and he gave a step more and was declared better player of the game.
Two assistances in the party and also the partner of Yagr, Jakub Voráček.
After the meeting, Yagr stated the supermarin journalists that Giroux had predicted a great night.
"And before the party I had told you that I would do trilete."
"I'd present him."
"Atimely they seem to be shocked," Yagr explained, after his actions this goal in Giroux, due to the first trail of Flyers.
A rat later also the second intervention of the team had a checo raster.
Voráček was done with the disk behind the Hurricane port and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, which put gol.
One second before the first break, a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was released, but from the beginning of the second part, the Flyers had already dominated.
Concretely for Giroux.
After working with Yagr, he put the third gol, after his shoot was shooted by the door of Wayne Simmonds.
"I like to play with him."
"I don't mean that it's the best player of the canche, but without doubt it's between the three best," pointed Yagr to his center.
"I would never have happened that at the end of my car would play with a sporter like him."
"I'm very satisfied of it."
"I want to play for him."
All these years in the NHL, my partners played for me, and that's now produces results," added Yagr.
Carolina still converted the game into a drama, with the Gol of Tum Ruutu, and then again from Dwyer, of criminals, to put it to a distance goal.
Matt Read did not allow any more complications, although they ended over in the number of two against one.
"Pronger had a good action in our field."
"After the disk, I took speed and read went to the most distant part."
"I tried to touch you to the disk and I'm happy because I got it", described Voráček the last goal of the game as he lived.
With its victory, Philadelphia was headed by the East Conference.
The Czech Defensor of Montreal, Jaroslav Špaček, did not play until the end of the party against Buffalo, in the second-third was removed by a lesion in the upper part of the body.
Canadians lost not only a player with a lot of defence experience, but also for a difference in two goals, 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec could not use one of the fires.
More than the lost points to the local trainer regreted the great amount of lesioned in the last line, and playing the game only with five defences.
"This is bad."
"We play the game only with a veteran player, the rest was new."
"In the end, but it's that it can't be done anything, we need to do with that," said Jacques Martin.
"To turn the players turned against us, we couldn't resist it."
"We had to simplify even more the game, get out of our field disk."
"And so we left shoes," said one of the defenders, P.K. Subban.
The Ondśej Pavelect port contributed with thirty interventions of the Winnipeg in the victory of 5:2 on the Tampa Bay.
Jet's goals were marked by five players who soon ended to a series of shoots that had already duration five games.
How travel prices have been developed since 1989
Up to 1989 in Checoslovakia was only five authorised state travel agencies: śedok, Sportrist, CKM, Recrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies at that time were sold in most cases only to socialist block because travels were very limited to the West.
Czech tourists were therefore vacations at the RDA Beachs (Alemanian Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union, (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Romania (the both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when the Yugoslav regime was able to travel to Yugoslavia, however, then the Yugoslav regime slowed to the west and the travels of the Czech tourists were then quite limited.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that citizens of socialist blocks (or even the Czech Republics) are not allowed to travel free and individually, not even by socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed a invitation letter if not, the individual travel was not possible.
The travel agencies offered in those times also travels to the West, but one had to put the colle with a cup of sleep and pass all night, or to "good well known" in the Agency.
That's how it wasn't all wearing.
The called "change promise" that was the condition for travels to the west, was not granted to the "politely not reliable gentle", which was thus not able to travel in absolutely.
The Checolovac currency was not a freely convertable currency and, without changes, was not possible to get the resources (the Western currency) to travel to Western.
The vast majority of cheques passed their vacation in their own country, so there was a large number of chains and summer houses, which the cheques would buy.
The way to travel in the cheques has suffered from 1989 a real revolution.
While until 1989 it was not going to pass the holidays in the RDA or Bulgaria, last year the cheques made 4,5 million vacation travels to countries worldwide.
It is in the great paradox, which we are not yet conscious today, the fact that the current favorite destination, Croatia, could not be traveled freely until 1989, because it was part of Yugoslavia then.
At the beginning of the 1990s, the exemption of visa was imposed to travel to the neighbouring countries of Western Europe, which caused a huge oil of short-term visits, above Vienna or Germany.
Checoeslovakia, for a long time, did not see hearts of the excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it at least at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris the cheques groups were sleeping in the camping parks, since our income from then did not allow us to pay a hotel or pension.
A typical characteristic of the cheques of that time was to take the food with you (conserves, enbuted, etc.) to eat.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech Korean, so our tourists finally could, after decades, purchase free western currency.
Our life level increased and with him also the average wages, which resulted in a increase in the demand of travels around 1997.
With the increased demand of travel, the Agencys regularly started to prepare travels using charter flight connections, which made incredibly lower the prices of travel prices in comparison with the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts by the number of passengers.
At the end of the last 90th century, the cheques traveled almost all the developed countries, except the United States, which made more simplified our trips.
Another interesting moment in the history of the post-revolutionary tourism was already occurred in 2000, when it was organized, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from Czech to an exotic country, and was in Thailand.
Since that year, they leave all the years of direct carter flights with checa tourists makes far away and warm countries. This winter will already fly from Checa to 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visiting some 1000,000 Czechs per year.
Another interesting moment of this time, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States eliminated the visa for the Czech Tourists, with which our country has been among the world's most developed countries.
In 2008 the cheques, for the first time in their history, have been paid over half of their holidays in the foreign (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, have been paid in travels to foreigners over 15.000 Czech Coronas per head, including the expenditure on the residence site.
Invited to the General Assembly to elect the President, which could be able to end again at a dead point.
Since nearly five months ago, the checa fútbol is without President, and it is likely that Ivan Hašek's successor as President of the Checa de Futbol Federation (FAśR) will not be known or after the convocation of the next Special Assembly that will take place this juvenile in Nymburk.
In fact, it has not yet been reached an agreement on the rules of vote to follow.
Without the same, you cannot even vote to choose among the three candidates.
The people interested in presiding the checa fútbol are Jindśich Rajchl, Miroslav Pella and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek rejected his office in June not soon calling his colleagues in order to find a strong person that seems to take care of the fatbol in the future.
However, after concluded the era of Hašek, a dispute was made between the two non-popular associations of the association to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This remained in evidence on 16 September when the new President had to be elected.
The delegations of the General Assembly were gathering in the National House (Národni dśm), located in Smichov's Prague barrier, because the discussions were blocked and not only about the election method.
There was no consensus or no consensus on whom in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only legal representatives or delegations with full powers.
From that moment and because of this only point, a partial agreement was made, also supported by the recommendation of the State and Law Institute, which is not possible for full power.
However, the debates on the electoral code are still open.
More light on the situation could no longer be found by the Executive Committee that, in its meetings, normal or extraordinary, was basically not resolved.
The opinion on the possibility of vote has already changed a few times, but the neural point remains the same.
The question is: How do we go to the third round to avoid the dead point?
"The debate turns around to whether it should be done in accordance with the statutes or find another model," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three Vice-Presidents of the FAṣṭR, which, from the direction of the association, represents the professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, the third round will win the candidate who has a higher percentage of support in the Federation to which it will submit its candidate.
The Moravia region is available to reach a commitment to the candidate with a higher percentage of votes in both federations.
However, the Bohemia part implies that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, should have the majority of at least two thirds.
"This would, however, leave him the meaning of the two previous rounds and would fully reject the concept of a bicameral system," it is as Svoboda understands the objections of the remaining party, according to which the best thing would not touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
This is a surprisely agreed with Tomaš Paclík, although the electoral regulation established by the statutes of all candidates is more appropriate to Pella.
"I would like to vote to the maximum in accordance with the statutes."
"In order to not invent any tongue about representatives as in the last General Assembly," said the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is requested for the first time as a candidate and which guides their comments mainly against Pelta.
Pelta is still optimized.
According to him, Nymburk will decide on the new President, and he believes that candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
"All payments will be disappointed with the party of our national team today in the European Championship.
"The fútbol will be a protagonist, and so it will work more likely," states Jablonice's representative, who has more experience in the management of the fútbol as well as at the professional and regional level.
Rajchl is the most reliant.
"I hope that there is a agreement, but, unfortunately, the situation is much more complicated."
"This is not the conflict between bohemians and morals, but there are intentions to adjust the rules to their own conviction."
"This may have a new block of the General Assembly as a result."
"In any way, I hope the common sense will be imposed," said Rachl.
There is no longer time for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be held in Montenegro, but who can know until the game starts if the fútbol team is complete?
The special aircraft, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, among other Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not come out this morning for technical problems in Praga, and has to be seen an alternative to transport part of the Executive Committee to the place where the classification party will be placed.
The decision-making meeting may finally be the one that will take place at the ministerial level, which, according to their accounts, will be held on Thursdays.
Joseph Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sport, would like to include the shared parts to the more powerful sports organization of the country to reach an agreement.
There are a lot in the game: state subsidies, the credibility of the fatbol, and also the next General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Sport Federation, which will try to provide a new direction to the Czech sport after the financial problems of the Sazka lottery house.
Pacific will fight for reaching the presidency, because there is no suitable candidate.
If the chief of Pilsen's futbolists, Tomš Paclik, before the Special Assembly, would know the name of a appropriate candidate that satisfies all its ideas about the new Chairman of the Fútbol Federation (FAśR) or would not be presented as a candidate to such a relevant post.
"If I had a suitable person, I would fight for her, and I would not be a candidate to the elections."
"But until today, a person could not be found such a person," said Paclik to the Checa News Agency.
This motivation for Paclik to join Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is the exact possibility of blocking Pella, the obviously winner of the elections, which opens the way to the President of the Czech Federation of Futbol.
Pacific also points out that, in the event of winning, it would remain in the office of President only until 2013 when the round of the ordinary General Assembly would be reached.
In that position you would like to see a good and manager expert that is not too related to the futbolistic events.
"I talked to some people who could take into account."
"To me was a crazy hearing some say that at this time they don't even want to be identified with the checo fotball."
"I would like to change that vision," adds.
What is more angry to Paclík at this time is the relationship of Pelta with the President of the Pilsen Roman Berbr Regional Futball Association, a man with a confronted past, known outside the world as a powerful lobster with the ability to influence the vote of delegations at the General Assembly.
For Paclik is so unacceptable to see Pella sit down in the presidency.
"In the case of winning, the current status would be maintained, and nothing in the fatbol will change."
" With the support of Berlin, a ambitious business man, the fútbol will still be less useful," said Patrick.
It also mentions that some years ago the name of Pelta was associated with a telephone hearing during the investigation of a corruption case, which Pelta came impunity.
"I don't know what's prestigious to the fûtball could bring Pelta's victory."
"And with what eyes the EUFA and the FIFA will look at", said Paclík, who also takes certain care of his previous statement that "if the Pilsen Club would come to the President."
In the event of winning the elections of Thursday, Paclick could be drawn up cooperation with Pelta in the future.
Similarly, it is the other candidate, Rajchl, who has been supported by Paclik before the General Assembly of September, which ended in a fault.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to whom he would follow."
"It's very powerful."
"I could imagine it, for example, as the leader of the representation."
"But not as a partnership manager."
"I do not put the narcs there I don't feel able to do", added Paclík, which in September highlighted a lot of attention to support the suspension of the Arbitres Commission chaired by Ludek Macel, replaced after Dagmar Damkova.
Palík admits that the association would be managed.
Renewing its private enterprises management capacity, since since the past summer is also the Director of Pilsen, who with its support held the triumph in the first division in May.
"I have strength to change some things in the field of fatball and to contribute to your safe practice."
"To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably intend to influence the decisions of the Disciplinary and Appeal Committee, produced unpleasant situations, Paclík said without hiding their antipathies to the President of Sparta Daniel Kśetínskī.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between the FAśR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the support of the pressure on political leaders in order to develop more money in the sport of lottery taxes.
"It is one of the key problems to which the new President should be devoted."
"If they increase the taxes on the games of azar, as the political party announces, it would support their arguments, but, frankly, they must tell us where to stop all this money," states.
Indeed, Paclik does not even take into account his association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself claims that the President of the FAṣṭR must be "no party".
Pelta is your association with Jablonec and Rajchl with Ducla de Praga.
"No, it's ideal."
"But I don't see the fact that my actions of the Pilsen Club were hypocritically deceived to another person to return there after a year and a half", said Patrick.
Pelta promised the FAśR new statutes that would end with the dead point of the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Futbol Association one of the candidates to the Presidency, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, in the event of being elected, would ensure that FAṣṭR would have new statutes that would endure to solve, in the future, disputes on the electoral regulation.
The representative of Jablonec is optimistic about the meeting of this juvenile in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-electoral conflict could go forward to a solution today with the possible victory of the fútbol team.
Before the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, in case they were elected, exactly on the representation and recur funds.
He decided to participate in the last minute at the General Assembly, so that this posting of two months could go well to defence and submit its ideas on the management of the fotbol in a broader context.
"The people of all levels are working on the fútbol for a long time and are waiting to meet this juvenile to the new President."
"It feels that someone has arrived at the time of managing the association," believes the man who is mainly associated with the Jablonice Club, but he worked in Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Association.
For this reason, I think he's having enough experience to manage the checa fotball.
It is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the Euforia that she reigned in the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Peacely, in the June General Assembly, the statutes that were not so perfect as everyone thought."
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president since September," warned Pelta.
Exactly the readaptation of the most important document of the Civil Association was used as a senator to win delegates.
"If I choose the President, I'll take it as a personal challenge and I'm willing to answer if this falls."
"It's a matter of principles, without which we can't exist," says Pelta.
Furthermore, in theory, try not to spend with your opposers.
It had already been warned that he was working with Henry Rajchl, who respected his legal training, was conscious that his opponent would also be his first vice-president.
He took a lot of time without attacking Thomas Paclík who, instead of Pelta, did not leave a titter with his head.
"He lives more than one year in the fatball world, and he has already achieved some success."
"Their attacks, but they were angry and many people were surprised by the election campaign."
"There is why many of them doubt their true nature," said to their opposer Pelta, who is still faithful to the statements already announced in September.
His most powerful weapons are, according to him, his knowledge of the fútbol, from the lower competitions to the tops.
This should be shocked for the fotball promotion.
"I would also try to solve all the scandales that occurred because of the Bohemians as a result of the corruption scandale last year."
"I would immediately be involved in the negotiations with the public and private sector, to ensure that there is enough money for the whole folk", said the candidate of 46 years ago.
It also promised that his appointment as President of the Futball would not include any personal amendment of the model.
"I would first know the tasks of each employee," said referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, imperatives a comprehensive nervousism.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that are vaccinated before the next General Assembly, he believes that delegations will not travel this juvenile to Nymburk.
"If the only problem will be how to vote on the third round, we will, without doubt, be able to overcome it.
"The fútbol needs credibility, which will be restored only if he's finally a leader," still two days before the most decisive day in his representative career, Pelta remains optimist.
Rajchl promises that under its leadership, the FAśR would start working with profits.
If in the fourth General Assembly the current vice-president Jindrich Rajchl was elected as a new Chairman of the Fútbol Association, many would be surely recommended.
Rajchl promises that, if it is elected, it would work hardly.
He wants to implement a systematic change and to make members of the Executive Committee responsible for each area of the fútbol individually.
It is also committed to solve the case of the Bohemians, to improve the relationship with the EUFA and the FIFA, to get more money for the fotball and to continue with the work initiated by President Ivan Hašek.
"I like the President, I would like to devote me completely to the fotball."
From international contacts with the EUFA and the FIFA to the selection, through the professional fútbol or the training of young futbolists in high performance.
"I don't mean that I would do it all alone," said Rajchl in an interview for the switch.
"I am a team player and I want to share the competences of the Executive Committee so that each member may be dedicated to a specific area."
"And I will allocate hard tasks so that the fatbol can continue with very impulse in each of these segments."
"The many people this probably will not like you, because it will start working very hard and not only criticize the work of others," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the futbolistic movement, it was said that it has been considered the possibility of not being submitted again as a candidate.
Everyone knows that work is 20 hours daily.
"But I need to know that this will be a sense and that there will be no people behind me that will prevent and prevent me every step," explained the reasons of their indecision.
"Thank people have told me that I should not give me for the winning, because then they would be given for the winnings. "
"It's to have faith to not leave so without any more," said.
As they say, it also motivates him to continue the work that has already started with Hašek.
"For these two years, a large part of the work that I don't want to lose now."
"There are processes that have been initiated and who will be effected within a couple of years and I would not like someone to see them", announced that, if they elected the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could be again as it was before Hašek era.
"I think in the order, and it's something that, in my opinion, Mirec Pelta is not able to keep.
"Dead of him is over all those people who would take care of the fatball so that it's just a privilege for some chosen."
"I can reprove a lot of things, but not the fact that I am for someone."
"I'm trying to be target."
"I want to do a fotball for everyone, because only so they will feel well and not only the chosen ones," said Rachl.
He also rejects the idea that the President would only bohemi.
"After some people try to claim the contrary, I'm in mind to do the maximum for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to think about the fact to share the second division in a checa part and in another living, whose winners would go to the first division."
"It would not be given the current situation where we have only three Moravia's teams, which represents a problem for young moral players," said Rajchl.
While at the pugnate of the presidential elections, Tomš Paclík, President of the Pilsner Club, was summoned, Rajchl did not believe in his possibilities to be elected.
"I am still sorry to have strong support from the Checa Federation, which has elected me as its vice-president and who knows that there are clear successes behind me", said Rajchl, whose successes include the shore of a few decades of millions of deceased contracts, television negotiations and the negotiations on the lottery law.
On the other hand, it recognises its part of guilty in which the Federation is not united.
And while proclaiming that Pella is "discalled to recover confidence in the Checa fútbol," it is considered to the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate that has something to offer to the fútbol.
"Nobody can refuse that he did a great job for Pilsen that year."
"In the case that it is elected, he will probably follow what Ivan Hašek started and would not change significantly the pattern of staff in the committees."
"I don't want to use that to my favor," she evaluates her rivals Rajchl.
The most beautiful pools in Europe
Salt to blue
for Julia Stanek
Piscines from an amazing, solar bathrooms in Budapest: Whose visits Europe can live its blue blue, and after visiting the city or a shop, relax your feet in bubble bathrooms.
A book shows where the best well-being is found in the water.
When Iris Meder performed a research journey during the last half years, there was something that couldn't miss in his equipment, a bathroom.
He was shocked on the water, looked at the cups art at the top, shocked to the marmol angels, waiting at the edge of the pool and shocked to the swimming pool of modernist renovated meticulally.
He liked the bathroom, took note in his book at the moment of all interesting details about the style and the history of the building.
Architective historian Meder explored more than 200 pools in this way and presented them in its recent book "Badefreuden": the pools covered in Munich, the historical bath palaces in the Black Sea, the "hormigón constructions" in Taunus.
He reacted its "releasing for the most extraordinary bathrooms of Central Europe" by 13 countries: more than Germany, Austria and Switzerland, visited places of Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This German of 46 years is a real enthusiasm of the bath culture.
I don't want to have anything to see with the sport, says Meder, the water is different.
Only the bathroom acids must be complied with blue and clothing blue, while the swimming swimming can breath the fascinating smell of the beach forests or listen to the triangles of the birds in the park.
"Another day I asked why the pools must always be so feasts," said this people in Vienna.
"I started collecting beautiful pools."
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
The chapoteum in the pool and the oil of the sauna. The well-being factor in the pool is so large as all senses, according to Meder.
And if the constructor is forced, the covered pools can be a real gift for the view: "Instead of land, there is a water surface in the baths."
"For one part it is transparent, on the other hand reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is optically doubled: the high bowls, the color blue, the trampolines.
The book with small "Badefreuden" photos offers in 190 pages very interesting data on architecture and history of art in the historical oasis of well-being, but mainly, you want to save the blue.
Meder, the pool collectionist discovers the exemplaries highlighted in its investigations in Hungary.
With the magnificent medical bathrooms such as the Szechenyi Bathroom of Budapest of 100 years, waters with nitrates are found in a unique cavity cavity in Miskolc-Tapolca, as well as a term, the pools are alcalinous waters and are located in a bottle-form (Városi Termalfordeè in Yaszbereny).
Many discovery swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city puts the eyes in the Zurich tested pool, you can look at Arlberb, swimming pool, from the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton, and: In the Turkish bathroom there is a window from which you can see the practice on the ski swimming pools.
The most extraordinary design may be expected to customers in Longgenfeld: The Eastern water catedral seems to be a ovn that has just been aterrizing in the Alpes.
From three open sources, weigh in winter, while the mountains of the East go down on the sky.
Anyone in the black wild
Meder, the collector of pools, did not invade the chloror in all the pools.
Many thermal bathrooms smell in the Arpád's baths in Bekescsaba, Hungary, the gas pest is so strong that people believe that they have arrived to a healthy bathroom.
The hole comes from the medical waters containing bicarbonate and alcali and whose ligame is cut into the skin when it enters the pool, a enjoyment of the well-being in a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in a place in his search for beautiful places for the bathroom when I wanted to visit discovery pools and solar baths in the checo bathroom of Luhatschowitz, found with a blocked terrace.
The bathroom of the architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the demonstrated windows of the red, white and amazing modernist building, he saw the badness growing between the blue.
The decade was opposed in a charming pool in the Black Sea: the Termal palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three phases of construction after themselves; not only can be found in neo-manic elements of their construction in 1844, if not even an Arab style hall of Alhambra, added in 1900.
Since its early modernization in 1995, the Palacio Termal is the favorite bathroom of the Pool Collectionist, Iris Meder, and not only because it is natural from the Black Selva.
"It's very good to fusion different architectic styles in a so fantastic unit," said Meder.
In a so-called palace in the termal pool apparently does not have a lot of importance.
Agricultural speculation
The German Bank analyzes the business of primates
For Christian Teevs
Is the German Bank renumbering its business with agricultural primates?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has managed a working group to check the consequences of the speculation for the poor world.
In January, the chief of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, the matter is clear, according to a study, to 84 percent of Germans, it does not seem acceptable that banks split with agricultural primary materials such as sweet or maize.
Two thirds of the surveys reiterate that German Bank and other credit institutions are removed from this business because intensifys the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a investigation by the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch at Middle October.
The author Harald Schumann shows that the loans on global primary materials make up prices, and the banks are loaded with the responsibility of the world's hunger problem.
The consumer defence campaign is directed in particular to Josef Ackermann, German Bank Director, although the large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, primary materials were thought to protect commercials from price shopping.
The main experts agree that players have disappointed the offers and demands and benefits from the costs of the poorest ones.
Ackermann reacted to the critics in a different way than the United States competitioners: He promised to revise the revisions and said that no business "mere to compromise the good name of the German Bank".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE information, a international working group is reviewing the revisions of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis must be finished at the end of the year, then the results will be submitted to the German Bank Directive together with the recommendation of how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the address of the bank shall inform the consequences.
Finally, the business of primates could be reduced, or even its total abandoned.
Ackermann tries to control his image.
Thilo Bode, the founder of Foodwatch, acknowledged the news, but reaffirmed its critics to the financial sector: "Food prices are particularly dramatic how disappointed banks are currently damaged to public well-being."
Ackermann is found as the largest banking capturer, especially in the obligations.
"The German Bank must cancel all the investments of its cart in which it plays money for food prices", said Bode.
"Come if Ackermann treats the topic of people who are hungry or the famous German Bank."
Ackermann's inspection is surprising to the first view, but it is clear that the chief of the consortium wants to offer a perfect picture a few months before leaving his position.
On Monday, the German Bank published that the President of the joint Directive will change something different from what was not planned in the Administrative Board.
With the abandonment of the aggregate speculation of agricultural speculation, you can perfect your image.
And you need to only import the possible losses, so your successor will take care of it.
Two thirds would cancel investment in primary materials
Foodwatch is striving to maintain high pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 international people have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Monday, Bode published the survey for which the Force Institute had asked 1 001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only 10 percent considered legitimate that the German Bank offers investments in which food prices were allocated.
Many of the bank clients showed personal consequences when finding that their bank was involved in such businesses: according to the survey, two thirds would cancelle all investments from which money goes from the agricultural speculation.
43 per cent would disagree a bank as well as his well-knowns, 49 per cent would ask, after reflecting, to cancel its account and change to another institution.
The house 21 in Vienna
The translated pavillon
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with altibajos and a happy end, the board of the Austrian universal exhibition of Brussels in 1958 obtained prizes, was in Vienna for a museum, remained empty and was destroyed.
Now it is reopened as an exhibition house.
The modern postgera architecture, the clear forms, the valuable crystal halls, and the new building materials, the typical of the thinking on the technical progress, so the Austrian pavilion of the Architec Karl Schwanzer for the universal exposure of Brussels in 1958 is an appropriate and known example.
The Pabellon of Schanzer then obtained the Great Architecture Price for its slight and floating construction of steel and vision.
The construction is considered to the present a contemporary hito of architecture.
He made the architect so well known that also built the Palm of Austria in the next universal exhibition.
With its legendary tower of four cylinders for MBW more the adjacent building planned in Munich, it was internationally known.
His pabellon, designed as a temporary construction for exposure, was led after the universal exhibition in the Swiss Garten along the Southern Vienna station, was reformed in 1962, and within the launch of a museum of the 20th century, called the "Cache 20".
The building was suitable but lacked from the appropriate spaces and technologies for a museum; without any wall to shoot art, nor a good environment.
Despite this, it was used until the contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building is empty since 2001 and declines more.
Today, Architec Adolf Crischanitz reformed the pabellon, now called it "hour 21" and will be used in the future as a contemporary art museum.
On Monday afternoon the beautiful museum, which belongs to the house, with the first exhibition, a shock of luck in a certain way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of Austria's Belarus Galerie since 2007, has reached a new start.
Husslein-Arco, doctor in art history with a considerable career, among other things, art patinator of ice in his youth, later in Sotheby, the Guggenheim Museum, and director of the modern art Museum of Salzburg, realized the reforms with the insistance of political and conservators of the monuments, provided private funds and patrocinators and enabled their use.
Except of the contemporary art, the works of the Fritz Wotruba's human foundation sculptor, should have a coffee and a library and be built a office building.
strict control, low budget
Crischanitz was the best choice to do.
It was not only because he reformed the sesion of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, and he extended it and helped him, if not because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pabellon was for him a "important and great pleasant sweet", in which he said "cause all the weekends" exhibitions.
I knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with his transfer to Vienna in its change of use with generosity and easyness.
There are major problems in the current reforms, the building was "a energy defender", said Crischanitz.
The profile of the crystal box windows was changed, a islalante cristal was installed with fiber fiber and was replaced by a special security crystal.
The thermal bridges and the steel lines were strengthened or replaced, and the amianto tissue was renewed.
Two flocks were used for the new use, a slow light panel between the house and the street offers lighting, a bridge to enter the building nearly new, but still the board of Schanzer.
Keep the original doors, the house is painted in old tons caoba and protected against oxygen.
And the movie room is exactly as it was before.
And all this is with a strict control by the monument office and a low budget.
"I often had to find material that was good, cheap and also like the monument protection office," said Crischanitz and warned a soil land on the ground.
Despite all pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and slight.
The pabellon, "who came from Brussels" has been difficult, stated a typical "case appearance in the history of the city."
A architecture is so "will be on the wrong place" and therefore I wanted to "declare the appropriate conscience".
In this case, house 21 is not in the wrong place, has occurred a shock of urban happiness. The completely new and planned "barrio of the central station", with housing and offices, is located near the Swizer Garten.
And may have been another shock of luck: the house 21 could receive a relief from another building of Crischanitz, because the French Collector from Habsburg has purchased the Berlin temporary art room and, as you hear, it's negotiating with the city about a neighboring place in the Swiss Garten.
Deutsche Bahn plans a winter crisis package that falls to millions
The company has planned a crisis plan that would prevent winter trends.
The number of staff should be doubled.
That's a million.
In the fight against the winter trains and delays, Germany Bahn has been paid over 70 million euros in this year, according to a periodic reporting.
The "Image" magazine reported, invoking an internal crisis plan of the group, investments expected to be around EUR 300 million.
For the best availability of vehicles and rail networks still with extreme time.
Among other things, internal and external employees are planned to double to 16.000 posts to remove the nest of the ways and of the edges.
The aim is to clean the nest and ice eyes for the operation and 90 percent of the skins required for functioning within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, President of German Bahn, warned that the trains were also late and delay during this winter after a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Germane Bahn suffered significant problems in the transport of travellers, as, among other things, there was no reservations for adverse meteorological conditions.
Many new regional trains have been over years waiting for an authorisation of the rail station.
Furthermore, there is a delay in the delivery of high speed trains.
German Bahn has been working for years in checking the edges of high speed trains with frequencies on the tank, after a high speed train would suffer the rotation of a axis in the central Colombia station.
The German Bank pays thousands of currencies in the United States.
After the tumulto of President Josef Ackerman, a new problem from the United States appears, the German Bank must pay a lot of thousands there.
As if the problems were not sufficient for German Bank, their past in the United States purchase to the giant sector, the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (106 million) in an agreement to put the end to the containers of five major credit collaboratives during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of hypothetical titles.
CNUA financial market regulator recruits many large banks to lead credit cooperation with false promises to purchase financial products; risks have minimised.
These titles lost their value during the financial crisis and led banks to deepness.
"We are satisfied to clarify the topic without the parties to take care of the courts," said a German bank portal in New York.
The bank does not grant any fault with the agreement.
This applies also to the Citigroup, which obliged a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, Chairman of the CNAS, held the defence of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (CNUA) is responsible for the U.S. credit collaboratives and provides support for the protection of customer investment.
CNUA is trying to reintegre the losses of millions of origin.
Currently closed agreements are their first type.
The regulator also requested accounts for other large banks and in the summer of JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of the doubts of hypothetical titles, it is the named hypothetic values supported.
These are based on living credits.
When the US real estate bowl established in 2007, it led many financial entities to loss.
In September 2008, the US Investment Bank Lehman Brothers was cut off in the low point of the financial crisis.
Although the results occurred a few years ago, it is currently a complicated wind for the United States banks.
Investors and inspections have uncontaminable processes to receive compensation or punish faults.
The Vivienda Financing Agency (FHFA in English) has produced the largest number of demands.
It reiterates the 18 major international banks that the two US Hypothetical Agencys Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been using hypothetics business in a volume of approximately $200 billion.
The German Bank also has a request from FHFA, it is $14.2 billion for businesses from 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires that the Frankfurt Institute responds to "the substance losses" without calling a precise number.
The German Bank rejected the debts as infunded and explained that he wanted to defend themselves.
Warren Buffett contributes with 10 billion to IBM
Buffett's funding guru, Buffett, has strongly invested in the IBM Information Technology Company.
Since March it has purchased actions for a value of more than $10 billion.
Even now, the large American investor Warren Buffett has always declared not investing in computers or information technologies as long-term development prognosis are negative.
But it has read the IBM commercial report and has changed its view on investment in the sector.
It had to be understood before IBM offered all services and search for computer systems for other Information Information Departments.
In the financial world, a Warren Buffett investment is considered a honor.
The primitive of Information Technology should therefore be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett has currently developed in the CNBC economy emission that has purchased IBM actions for a value of $10.7 billion since March.
The Berkshire Hathaway's investment has soon been one of the largest IBM shareholders with a 5,5% participation.
Buffett said that IBM did not know until now anything of the commitment.
He reached the direction of the regular benefits in the economic crisis.
"He made a great work", Buffett stated on the strategy.
IBM has been established for a long time as the profitable information technologie services as the operation of calculating centres.
The old computer pioneer over 100 years also offers software and advice as well as powerful teams for businesses.
Buffett avoided technology enterprises until date.
He said he only invested in enterprises whose business would understand.
On the contrary, Buffett used the occasion in a good train, a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
The Berkshire Hathaway has about 80 own branches, as well as part of a series of large consorts such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, anciently Munchener Back.
Buffett, 81 years old, was charged by the small textile business Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and, with wise investments, expanded it to become one of the most valuable enterprises in the world.
However, his lifestyle is humility.
That's why it's an idol for innumerable inversors of the world.
His fast and unfavourable sense to win money has provided him the overname of "Omaha's work".
After discovering Buffett's investment, the IBM actions in the bath was one percentage.
"Blue Gig", as IBM is known, has a valuable value of more than 220 billion dollars, and is, together with Apple and Microsoft, among the most valuable technologie companies in the world.
With Microsoft, you said Buffett, you don't want to cooperate.
Bill Gates, his founder, is an intimate friend.
The threat is specific
After the discovery of "Zwickau cell", the Turkish media doubt the German law state.
A newspaper speaks of a "very ideology" which is again re-avised.
The murders of eight small trumpets and Greek employees between 2001 and 2006 have an overwhelming right.
In Turkey and the German population of Turkey has reacted with fear and concern to this news.
For many Germans of the Turkish origin, a fantasm that had been believed long ago, since the attacks with fires in Mauln in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993 had no longer occurred episodes of violence with extremely right against Turkey.
However, it has never been questioned that there was xenofobia in Germany.
The ultra-direct network reveals a magnitude of which sizes weren't, nor very less, predictable.
"Do you want to restart the blood ideology?", titles the edition by the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The "Sabah" newspaper highlights the contrary that one of the offences authors was a informant of the Federal Constitution Defence Office and is concerned that German authorities may be involved in the extra-directory pantanal.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted sensitively, the weekend recorded the victims of racist violence with a guard to the Brandenburg Port.
Two weeks ago, the Turkish community in Berlin together with the German and Turkish politicians reflected in a solemn act of the 50th anniversary of the Turkish Alman Agreement.
Conviveness was put in scene with joyful colors, such as a story with a happy end.
The information arrived to some Turkish media as a bofetada: "The gift of German for the fifty-year anniversary," says the title of a article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", referring to the background of the murder chain.
The German "Hürrâce" emission also not insists on bringing this mental connection.
"Come working bad," says the title of the Ahmet Külahci column.
It highlights that murdered were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
In the Turkish German Internet forums, the police's behavior and their success in searches are critically discussed.
The authors claim that the German authorities have not seen a long time before suspected in the ultra-direct circle.
Some are shown as less retoric about the media drastics: "Dead here, immigrants do not remain more than self-defence and weapons."
"This will be the best self-protection."
"Germany internal peace depends strongly on the quality of clarification and adequate sanction to all the network.", writes "Selen".
This means that, if Germany's internal peace is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen will be raised in ninety years.
The image of Solingen fire ruining has been recorded in German and Turkey's memory.
No other event has been clearly shown to the Turkishs who live here that there is a concrete threat and, in the Germans, that dis confidence and distance can be marked in violence.
The attacks deal with the Turkish group feeling.
Do not repeat the errors of the past
In the Turkish press, mainly the deficiency of German policy after attacks was criticized, Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the attention of Solingen's fire, he sent a break-up telegram to the Turkish President and Klaus Kinkel, his Minister for Foreign Affairs, replaced him in the Columbia funeral. Kinkel detailed in his speech what they contributed to the Turkish taxes.
It is clear how the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of its taxes.
The current information of the Turkish media is to show the deepness of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country since then.
In addition to the efforts of a comprehensive explanation and re-approvement of the terrorism of extreme right in Germany, they do not need franc words.
The Surrich Lake Scandal Bank
The most attractive European bank is not in Italy or France, if not in Switzerland.
UBS almost entered into the financial crisis and from then from a crisis to the next.
Now it leads a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think about it.
After his spectacular departure of the Federal Bank, in July, it was known that in 2013 it would begin in a new and almost spectacular work: President of the Governing Board of the Great Swiss Bank, an unexpected and rewarding step in his car.
Axel Weber is publicly pleased, swimmingly for his beauty and the UBS for his recent purchased solidity and let friendly comments about his future partners.
"The USB has achieved a revitalization."
"I'm glad to cooperate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
In September it was clear that everything would be completely different.
A USB financial operator in London avoided all bank security systems and frauded EUR 1.7 billion.
Oswald Grübel, Director-General of USB, was a banker not only known in Switzerland, and he had to remember.
The President of the USB Administrative Board was also considered tough, and everyone asked: When did Axel Weber arrive?
Weber should consult the bank since February 2012.
And the Presidency of the Administrative Council will be held in May, not at the beginning of 2013, as the bank reported on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
It is not banker, but professor of economy and advisory, and has had a safely necessary adaptation period.
He is responsible for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved to be worth the title "the largest bank of Europe's scandale" for a long time.
For one part, the USB is great, even shortly was the world's largest administer, and on the other hand, for years, it is disleading from a scandale to the next.
Nothing, that looks like, it's so proud of the sugar bank.
It started the financial crisis.
USB was a great name until 2007.
The image of the administer of discreet and solid goods, but also mature, was combined with ambitious objectives, also wished to be a large number of investment banks.
For one part, with $1,6 billion, the USB manages more money from adherent customers than any other world bank.
And, on the other hand, it has progressed as investment bank in the link of the world's large banks.
This is impressed.
Hans Geiger, the former bank teacher and later professor in Zurich for many years, explains: "After my students, I always qualified the USB as a model of a good bank."
"After the current point of view, one questions: How could I be wrong?"
I was in a great mistake.
In 2007, it came to the light that something was very bad in the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, director-General, who was even considered a generous and very intelligent banker, was surprisingly divided.
Some months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank's investment fund was covered in losses of high risk and had to love thousands.
To load this, the USB announced a capital injection of nothing less than 13 billion francs.
For this, he found inversers, of course, that some shocked up to a little before: a Asian state and opaque fund of Singapore and a Arab state fund, so discreet, which has never been heard of his name.
This was just the first shot.
In April 2008, it began.
The bank had to declare the loss of thousands, Marcel Ospel, President of the Administrative Council, in 2006, in the second best payed Administrative Board of Switzerland.
In October 2008, the disaster continued, in view of its wrong investment, the UBS was found in the financial crisis against the crystal and had to be saved by the state.
The National Bank purchased problems with UBS for many thousands, Helvetic Confederation gave six thousands of francs to a obligationly convertible, making it a bank co-propositive.
All Switzerland was affected, it was stated that it was the dramatic thing for a small country, if it goes to such large banks.
Finally, the sum of the UBS balance in 2007 was more than five times greater than Swiss's economic results (see graphic).
"We can't get back to UBS," said Geiger, bank expert.
The first disaster joined the second.
A few months later, the UBS was captured in a fiscal conflict with America and was disposed to deliver the data of the adhesive customers, which could have been defrayed taxes with the bank's assistance.
Furthermore, it approve a number of 780 billion dollars, reimbursed by injustified benefits of these businesses with a payment compensation.
Thus, the UBS condemned more or less have helped tax fraud.
Similarly, he lost something that had been his capital for the competitive for rich customers: the discretion room.
After the scandale, the secret of the Swiss bank is no longer the same.
This followed the division of the President of the Joint Directive and the President of the Governing Council.
And the shooting of the customers' funds.
Thus, in a few months, the bank lost its credibility in its two central sectors: in the investment bank through false speculations and in the administration of goods through tax fraud.
And just when I was back to be something more quiet, just when I thought that the UBS would get it again, it happens this disappeared history of the operator, a individual operator defrayed $1,7 billion, before the bank was counting that something was bad.
And this has been developed, and this is still not well worked with the risk management of investment banks.
"In the case of Adoboli, risk controls have changed too little", says Martin Janssen, professor of economy and financing in the Bankage Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of a large German bank is also safe: "The problem of the UBS is not dominating risk controls".
The idea of precaution, with which Swiss bankers had been present for a long time, was to be the guards of the world's largest goods: no too large risks, instead, money security wants to fall on the other side of the Alpine Republic.
The security deposits of Swiss banks were the symbol of incapacity reliability, such as Lindt and Sprüngli of the authentic chocolate.
The UBS central in Zurich does not engage with the click of the Swiss solid private bank, it's just a little greater.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its headquarters on the Bahnhofstraße Street of Zurich, which goes from the main station directly to the Zurich Lake, marked by the swimming snow clouds of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostentable, households are one of the highest in Europe.
There are joyers like Tiffany's traditional Swiss business, such as Sprüngli confidence.
There are many years ago the Swiss banks: from the national bank, passing through the credit Suisse palace, to private bank elections like Juliaus Barr.
The UBS Reception room is entered through a weak round door.
Among the walls are revested from marmol, in front of the logo, there is a large letter to indicate the "security".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
The two large Swiss banks, the UBS and credit Swiss, at any time moved the idea of the big Swiss bank, or have traited it, as the President of a small private bank.
Do you prefer not read your name in the newspaper, at the end and at the end, makes, like all Swiss banks, also with the business of both large banks.
UBS has been too large, particularly in the investment bank, where the Anglosailles have gained the land.
There the suicide had nothing more than say.
"And they have been buried for a long time to the habitats of the anglesajones."
In fact, the UBS changed the UK investment bank, delivered its first great profit and then came the disaster, no European financial entity had lost so much money in the high risk jungle as the large Swiss bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was clear.
"Their Monday, the government coalition of the small country of seven million decided the greatest rescue operation in the history of his nation," writes the author Lukas Hassig in his book "Deer UBS-Crash" ("The crash of the UBS" in Spanish).
Politicals granted up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros to save the large bank of the routine bank.
How are they going?
It is talking to Swiss bankers, so you see the problem in UBS dimension.
In June 1998, two of the three large Swiss banks were fusioned in a powerful consortium.
There was a bank that, due to the fusion, was too big for the Swiss small, and continues to grow.
It was therefore able to complement the two different UBS precursor banks: a rich but sleeping bank with the centre of the ownership of goods in Zurich and a poor but stronger internationalization.
Unfortunately, internationalized investment banks came in an appropriate manner with a lot of money, with which they could make a large financial bicycle round.
There are two names related to this UBS submission: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS consortium 2001-2007, and Marcel Ospel, then President of the Administrative Board.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team," says the bank experts Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, which understands much of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive that could open up a step from learning in the bank to the top."
Finally, Ospel flew from Wuffli.
And at the end, Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "Think his models were a reality," says Geiger.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It is clear: The disaster came before the case.
UBS employees are clearly remembered from the guide meetings, where Wuffli, the chief of the consortium, always repeated the same subject: Shut down from the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
The "Leegue Tables", the classifications that then documented the success of the banks.
The UBS wanted to be on the top.
Some steps left him well.
In the division operations and the negotiation of action was higher.
However, firm advisers pointed out a weak point: In the business of international interest, "fixed income" language, there is a huge compensation for the large banks.
UBS has empty in American hypothetical products.
To fill these empty, the UBS started an adventure that almost costs its existence.
The same bank as one of its high-risk funds created in American high-risk investments.
It was converted into a powerful machine to hold American hypothetical credits and to sell them below, maintaining certain risks at its own level.
And also, as other banks have seen the low for a long time.
"In summer 2007, as the US real estate market was in calls, the UBS bought there", said Geiger, bank expert.
So big the euphory, so deeply the fall.
A manager had to go, because the attempt to order resulted more complicated than they were expected.
The UBS posts have become projective seats and are insecure until now.
Today, who is leading to a large bank, has almost impossible work.
There should be a strategy for a bank where all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, expert in banks, has an idea, finish the investment bank, focus on the administration of goods, return to Swiss roots.
The bank does not want to reach so far (all).
But the investment bank must decrease much, it is now clear.
The next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the new President of the bank, will present its future strategy to the world.
In fact, only 51-year-old Italian-sweet was considered as a transitional solution, since the bank was surprisingly separated from its previous Grübel.
However, he was imposed: the UBS business must be directed permanently, reported the Zurich Bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return to the investment bank to its state in average from the nineteen.
Delete 3.500 posts.
But this is not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What do you want to win money?
These are the security questions that Axel Weber is currently doing.
Even the moment, he only says he'll first find a living with her wife in Zurich.
The next year.

Intelligent grains are extensive in the cities
In many places, grains are considered "problemal places": they are not expulsed to these intelligent animals from the city for a long time, they claim experts.
Some like them, others want to be free from them very fast, the grain belongs to the image of the city for years, but in many municipalities the complaints of the neighbors are cumulated by the wild and the brush of the animals.
Although it hasn't appeared any means towards the "problemal packaging" until now.
The grains do not go out of the towns, they claim experts in the first symposium on grains in Leer, East Frisia.
There are experts in the whole country on possible solutions.
Search alternatives in towns
Echologists contribute to the problems of the cities to migration in the field of certain protected grains; chemical applications in the agriculture are visiblely closed to traditional vital spaces.
Caza, growing construction and fall of trees that hospitalize them are difficult to live birds.
The grains are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 players in Soest, Westfalia, among others, northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Ahim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There in 2005 was a conflicted project to kill the grain of the district in mass mass.
Critics have qualified the cast of animals through birds tramps and murder with balls as particularly brutal.
"Expulsing and helping them normally does not get anything", Warner Klöver, urbanist and Countryist of Leer declared.
Disparing with water to the nests or cut the trees often become unwanted consequences, Manfred Kaiser also states that the environmental experts in Lahr, Baden-Wurtemberg.
"The animals are disappeared, the large colonies of dividing and distributing in other places."
To help them only is imaginable as exceptions in hospitals, elderly or college residences.
"We must live with them, we don't take them anymore."
Without the surroundings, the problem is not solved in the towns, so Wolfgang Kellner, a chain of Leer.
It is possible to combine the animals of sensitive residential areas and cereals to retreat in other places.
"Informative Panels instead of chain sellers" Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and etnologist makes publicity against the purpose of treating the animals in a completely different form: "The best is that we can suffer a pico in the face with applome."
Jürgen co-funded in Schleswig-Holstein the teaching circle on the grains of Ascheberger, where letters informed about the life of the skilled birds.
While while, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also have his own opinion on the critics by the smiling of the birds: "All are forms of communication, they have much to say."
Intelligence and ability of these animals are legendary, grains do not only use the resources to access small skies, if not making tools to use them as resources.
Recently, theologs of Cambridge University tested in four degrees to where the birds’ intellectity come.
In a experiment, the birds learned rapidly that they had to leave a stone on a platform so that they could reach a polylla width.
Without a lot of training, they determined the size and the way he had to have the stone to fall on the platform.
In a second test, grains should solve a complicated problem.
The investigators put a small cube with a polylla width in a vertical cylinder.
The birds couldn't get to their bag with the pico.
But the investigators left them a strike.
With which the four animals formed a ring, with which they fished the cube in the tube strip.
Three of the four grains made it in the first trial.

Personal Mask
The intense and generous new book of Peter Englind, The beauty and the pain of the battle (The Beauty and the Sorrow): An intimate story about the First World War, "it starts with a long dramatic person of the type that can make the soul to his feet.
Here are some action advice: Start this page and convert it to your pages.
He will be able to know these people in the novel quote of Mr. Englind, and this dramatic person will work as his GPS, a fake for those moments, in which, as one of his men and women, is confused and displaced in the nest of war.
Mr. Englind is a Swiss historian and journalist.
It is also the new permanent secretariat of the Swedish Academia, which grants the Nobel Literature Prize.
What you've written here is a little currency book, which, obviously, describes as "a work of anti-Historical."
Contains some remarkable names, important or famous battles; almost no embassy, elegant journalists and discussions on tactics.
It is not so a book about what happened, explains, as "a book about how it happened." It is about "sensitives, impressions, experiences and states of humor".
"The beauty and pain of the battle " combines experiences in war times of more than 20 men and women, both sides of the war, from colleagues and botanics to scanners, doctors, ambulance and administrative conductors.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become war prisoners, or lose their members, become crazy or dead.
Your lives are part of here as vocative vessels in a church; some new ones are added to the mixture while others are removed.
The book of Mr. Englind is a division of standard history books.
It is also correct to the idea that the First World War was only the celebration of trinker war at the Western front.
"The beauty and pain of the battle" moves expertly through other war theatres: the Alpes, the Balcans, the Eastern front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The troops in this book are above the pillars; one pass the Christmas in Egypt under the piramides; the tse-tse mosquies are an intraactive problem.
This is a conmobiler book, almost from the beginning.
The war involves the lives of these people as a natural disaster, a hurrican Katrina who appeals to corditate.
When the artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you're a woman who is home with your kids, you stay or leave?
Of all the ways, who comes?
Just nobody understands what's going on, not even why you have to fight this war.
"Feace of facts," observes Mr. Englind, "he filled with conjections, suggestions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiration theories, dreams, pesadillas and rums."
"The beauty and the pain of the battle" continues to individuals like Florence Farmborugh, a English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a German young seaweapony.
His stories have been obtained in most of their memorys, letters and other materials already published previously.
The explanations of their lives can be agricultors or swimming, but they are more filled of life in the accumulation of small moments, lost details of Mr. Englind.
Many of these are about privacy and have to correct them with what there is.
It is about to tell the story of a German college, says, "Seedane, for all parts of the event."
"False of coffee, false aluminium, imitation leg, paper sales, wood bottles."
He continues to talk about the subsequent food in Germany.
Describes "the meat made from coated grain and presumed in meat grass (and covered with a false egg made of wood); smoke made of roots and sweet tissue; skins with wooden threads".
There is, observing, "837 substitutes for meat in the production of salts, 511 substitutes of the registered coffee."
Some stories are about honor and value.
A American recognises his own impulse to the salvation and shows about the war: "You feel that after all, this is what men are designed and not to sit in sillons with a cigarette and a whisky, the newspaper of the late or a best seller, and to pretend that this barnis means civilization, and that there is no barbara behind that almidoned and tachoned skin."
On the contrary, a British soldier is aware that he will probably die, and that no one will know or importate it.
"When one resigns himself to the thinking of sacrifice, one would like to think that might happen before the public," writes.
Instead, it's horriblely like "to a condemned being strangered in secret".
Other comments are about a old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has become more economic competition", writes Mr. Englind, "a war between factors."
Reflects the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the young century beast: The elocunt murderer in mass ideologically convinted with good-confection clothes that runs his flesh while sit behind a desktop."
People act in impressive ways; there are both innocent and heroic behavior.
Mr. Englind speaks of soldiers who actively tried to cover a veteran disease of prostitutees as a way to escape the service in front.
"The largest expression of this can be seen in the trade of genococic push, which soldiers buy and engage with this with the hope of ending in the hospital," writes.
"They who are really unexpected are frozen him on their eyes, which often from place to a ceguere of life."
In this translation of the Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englind ahgil, but not extravagant, it is perfectly adapted to his human task.
Decades of small scenes reflect the way the war to "exceptively uncontrolled forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hate".
People start to ask why their leaders are fighting them.
The best books about the First World War have often been indirect, such as The Great War and the modern memory of Paul Fussell, or news as No news in the front of Erich Maria Remarque, instead of integral stories.
The volume of Mr Englind is one of the little conventional pieces.
Your book has one of the most devastating finals that I can remember in a non-fiction work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's like if I had arrived from your book, launched from among your teeth that dramatic person's page, and he was shooted with a circle.
After a pass on a false step, a planned shock at minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them carrying antidisturbial castles.
It was elected on Monday night because the Zuccotti Park would be empty.
The operation was safely held for some high-range officials, and initially told others that they were joining one year.
The police inspector Raymond W. Kelly was in the center, stressed how the operation was struggling for the police department.
The recent week episodes were not repeated, such as the pulvering of pyray on the manifestants, infringing the department's rules and establishing a public sympathy Torment to the "okupas".
And so the police operation to defeat the Zuccotti Park of Protestants was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The agents had been prepared to see how occupation was developed in other cities.
A larger disaster simulator was holding place in Randalls Island, with an eye looking to Zuccotti.
The agents increased the call for disorder training - contra-terrorist measures that implyed rapidly mobilizing a large number of police officials - to focus on the Lower Manhattan Lower.
The last training meeting was on Monday night, on the side of the East River Manhattan.
The orders to enter the park arrived in the "last minute", said someone who was familiar with the commands, which refers to the mission only to "a exercise".
"To the few police I know that they were called for this, they didn't tell them that it was to enter the Zuccotti park," said the person who spoke an anonymously.
"The only people who knew they were going to enter the Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the Department."
A reason for secretism was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, some agents wanted to dispatch the park, but they dismissed when hundreds of manifestants had occurred before they heard about the plans.
The operation of March involved a number of police units, including special forces in the entire municipal district - tens of mobile agents who normally solved barriers with high criminality index.
Mr. Kelly said many people, like those traveling daily to work, had been going and coming from the park during the day, making a good time to enter.
"I was appropriate to do that when it was the lowest number of people in the park," said.
Camions of the Emergency Services Unit with Focus and High Vows were gathered on the cross of Pike Slip with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan’s bridge, before coming.
The pregnant lights and messages from the high voices appeared intimidating many manifestants.
The Community affair agents were in the park with their blue courts, many demonstrators simply collected their things and left.
No shop was touched until 1:45 a.m., said the police, giving time to protesters to collect their belongings.
Other agent teams were seen meetings in the perimeter to enter if they needed detention in the park.
The journalists in the park were forced to abandon it.
Paul J. Browne, head of the police department, said that he was for his security.
But many journalists said that they were trying to prevent the police to act in the park, and they had been treated brushly by the agents.
Mr. Browne said that the mobile TV units in Church Street, along the west border of the park, could take images.
As the police moved to the western through the marina densa of the demonstrators' personal effects, including machinery and clothes of paper and clothing, teams of the Limpieza Department followed them, collecting what was left behind.
Some demonstrators who refused to move themselves were dragging out, appearing on the Internet a few times later.
A central group of protesters took positions near the camping area, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police entered to arrest them metodically.
About 10 people in the camping epics were crowned among them through their arms.
And two people cast down to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency agents were called to cut the candes.
Not arrested in the park until at 3:30 p.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The departure operation was completed about 75 minutes later, said the police.
Mr. Browne said some 142 persons were arrested in the park.
The majority of the arrests were by "alternation of the public order and resistance to the authority", said.
The highest rank officer was Joseph J. Espósito, the head of the Department, the upper official uniformized in the Department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the department's head, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, when I was present, "I didn't have directed the operations", said Mr. Browne.
A second group of agents was waiting along the eastern Broadway's side, between Liberty and Cedar Streets, where they had to enter.
On the Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on the Pine Street, a block south.
From those positions, police was seen by expanding the perimeter even beyond the Zuccotti Park.
At a given time, a number of agents, many of them with echos, were seen by pushing people out.
There were some 28 people in the northern danger.
Some of the most rude action of the night had placed on the south of the park.
About 5:00 p.m., on the south of the Pine Street, a demonstrator sloped on the head of a police car, and others saw the air of the streets of a police car.
At a moment given, a piece of contrachapade went flying from the multitude.
Finally, a agent and a demonstrator were hospitalized.
The workshop's workshop will request the city for dispatchs
The synagogue that represents hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to demand the city on Monday, arguing that discards were unnecessary and discriminatory due to their unproportioned impact on schools that are at poor students.
The request may be the last weapons of the cluster of the municipal district 37 in its efforts to revoke disappointments.
Sixty-third and two school assistants, parents coordinators and other employees who were among the worst payers of the city lost their work on October 7 in a movement that the sindical leaders described as a political wage for their negative injury to allow, the past spring, access by the city to health care funds for work groups to closure their budgetary frame.
The municipal authorities rejected this accused catalogically.
In a hearing last month, the education adviser Dennis M. Walcott said that dispatchs were part of the budget adopted in June.
One member of the Council contracted to say that nothing in the budget specificated that the members of the school support staff would be disappointed.
The officers of the municipal district 37 said that they had submitted a written complaint by the Department of Education that it would be requested. A press conference will be held on Monday to announce the official presentation of the request at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The request will include Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education of the city as accused, and take into account eight employees as demandants, all of them black or Latin women, as well as most of the assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, port of the city's Legal Department, said that the city had not seen the request and therefore could not make comments on its specific allegations.
According to a New York Times querier of the demand, the synagogue has focused on the number of dismissed schools in the poor areas of the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying that the poor schools had lost more assistants, since they were inadequately subsidied in chronic form.
It is noted that even though there was no dispatch in Staten Island and a few schools at East Side or TribeCa, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in the 23th district in Bronsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were discovered in the 8 and 9 districts in the South Bronx.
In view of the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by the Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the demand says, "This is not a barrier of adherent parents that can recur funds to cover the budget disability."
P.D. The budget of the district 36 was 3.26 per cent of this year, and also lost money when the city changed the way to calculate the additional financing for each poor student in schools.
The synagogue also states that the secondary school directors may have been inflicted by the language in a memorandum that authorises the dispatch of parents' coordinators.
The memorandum used the word "excedente" to describe the action, although "excedente" often describes the act to transfer to a teacher of a school to a labour, whose salary are paid by the central office.
"Sixty and six parents coordinators were disappointed," the complainant's slaughter said, "and not only in excession."
Mission completed, the Congress prepared to reach a Libyan agreement
It seems that finally the Republicans and Democrats in the Capitol are willing to agree on something related to the resurrection in Libya.
All that was needed was that the rebellion had succeeded, that the veteran Dictor Muamar the Gadafi was captured and killed, and the participation of the United States arrived at its end.
On Monday, the Senate's Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution which is discussed by President John Kerry (democratized by Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (republic of Arizona) and Joseph I. Amorrman (Independent by Connecticut), by appealing to the libraries for its successful rebellion and for the troops of the United States.
"This resolution is to honor Libya's courage, starting to rebuild their country," said Kerry.
"It's a statement of bipartid support for its democratic aspirations."
The language can seem unfair, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy until now.
This summer, both parties legislators were fighting between themselves and the White House on the drafting of a series of resolutions to adopt or reject the role of the United States military in the UNOO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution authorized by the limitated use of United States military forces in Libya.
The draft law was decreased in the Chamber for a wide bipartite margin, which has never come to vote in the Senate.
However, the same day that the law project was rejected in the House, the camera also rejected a measure that would have been funded for U.S. operations in Libya.
That left the mission of the United States in a kind of legislative purchase - with the Congress it is sufficiently angry to criticize the maneuver by Obama of the mission, but not so angry as to actually strike the herbal under his feet.
Then, the indecision of the Congress was overcome by events.
Tripoli fell in the hands of the Libyan rebellion in August, and Gadafi was killed on October 20.
The OTAN Mission has been officially completed on October 31.
Now Senado could be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs "rejoices the people of Libya for its tremendous and extraordinary resistance to be free of themselves" and "joys men and women of the United States armed forces and coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary valuable and professionality."
The resolution also "declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya".
Will the new measure be fully supported by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, or would it share legislators as drafted by the June Act?
The last version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the principal Republic of the Committee.
Lugar's portal said the Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law project.
On the other side of the Capital, the House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment requesting a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all the Republicn congresses and some democrats.
The measure, issued by the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Republic of Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other item which actually reached a vote of all the meeting in the House or Senate in this Congress.
Other legislators have not succeeded until the time to reach their amendments to the Assembly, but not because of the lack of attempts.
Goodlatte is only one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, which covers a wide range of topics.
Some are doubled - the same law project is proposed both in the House and in the Senate - and others with low variations between themselves.
There are at least 15 versions of the amendment of the budget balance so far in the House, and the other, "he will control the federal expenditure".
Some of these law projects are also identical, but give their patrocinators - especially every new Republicans who seek to restore their posts - the opportunity to shoot that they were the "auteurs" of that measure.
The Budgetary Control Act, which was adopted in August, requested that both the House and the Senate voted an amendment to the budget balance.
In March 58 Senators voted for a non-combining resolution supporting the idea of that amendment.
Besides the budget, several members want to limit the number of mandates that members of the Congress may comply, while the representative José E. Serran (the democrat for New York), wants to remove the limit of two mandates for the Chairmans.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrata by Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments to ensure the right to quality and health care, among others.
An amendment prohibiting homosexual marriage is a pertinent proposal, as well as one that prohibits the burden of flags.
Some legislators also want to allow the cancellation of federal laws if they are rejected by two thirds of the states.
Such enthusiasm that have been members at the time to propose amendments, they are not moved to a faster rhythm than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 amendments, and submitted 66 in 110th.
The ritme is inacceptable in comparison with the 1990s when members regularly submitted more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they did not have much more success then than they have now.
The last amendment that was added - on 27 - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed by the Congress in 1789.
"Giffords speaks in his first television interview from the shoot.
Ten months after a gun shot him in a representative act in Tucson, the representative Gabrielle Giffords (democrat by Arizona) appeared on the national television night of the Monday, sing together from Broadway's Melodia "The sun will come tomorrow" and said he wanted to come back more than I wanted to return to the Congress.
In his appearance in ABC News "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords was fighting to form prayers and needed help to walk.
The program documented its difficult way back of the damages caused by a ball that fractured the brain and stripped the left side of his brain, and passed from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he returned to the Chamber to issue his triunfant vote in the debt board agreement.
In his first television interview since January, who killed six and smiled at 13, Giffords smiled, smiled and sing - and described its recovery as "facilial".
When Sawyer asked him how he feels, Giffords, 41 years old, answered: "Better good."
The interview with Giffords and his husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a special program of "20/20" of a duration time, which was issued the hope of the publication of the new copy book, "Gabby: A history of courage and hope".
The special programme analyzed the recovery of Giffords from the shot of 8 January.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first weeks, it is seen in your hospital bed, with the sweet head and a long skin over the front.
She can only keep one or two fingers, while her husband's soul.
A few months later, Giffords is seen in a street seat while the therapy teachers teach him how to make simple actions.
A head move.
A frustration of the lips.
And then, his first word, "What."
In a few days, Giffords proclaimed another word - "together", a change request in his breakfast menu.
Videos developed by ABC show that music has played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: it is seeing the congressist, playing together with the therapy the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" of Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who had two hours ago therapy every day, said that you don't remember the shooting day.
His husband said he was reading him to Giffords a newspaper on the murder of March 12 when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who died in the incident.
The suspected weapons, Jared Lee Loughner, are in custody in Missouri's prison and is being meditated by the force while waiting for judgment.
"Those people died," Giffords said to Sawyer.
"Durre, hard, hard."
Kelly said to Sawyer that at a moment of her wife's recovery, she said, "I'm broken."
"So, I said to him, 'Gabby, you've not been broken,' said Kelly.
"Than's been shooted only.
And you'll get out of this, and you're gonna get back and you're going back with more strength than ever."
The troops make feel more late than I respect
The event was a Wall Street gallery that recovered millions of dollars for the no-home veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sing a ball on impotence, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundreds of soldiers, marine soldiers, aircrafts, and marine children were cut into their posts around him.
Many of the labels were put out from foot and enjoyed.
"The men and women were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the recovery of spring funds.
A high-range military officer in the gala, also known as the President of the Conjunto State, the Almighty Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops in a different manner.
"They shown them as a kind of orphan kid," the official wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But he wasn't respected, really.
Markedly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship with militarys and a United States public often distantly worshiper sometimes.
The troops are promised with joy for their sacrifices.
But loving has a price, they say the members of the service.
The public is more acting as if they are punishing those uniforms.
"We are not victims absolutely," said the general brigade Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But it seems the only way that some show their support is to put us into the role of dispersed souls."
The topic is a very sensitive to the military leaders, who do not want to look unpleasant or in a disagreement with the public to whom they serve.
It is also understood that the angry against the troops returned in the past years of Vietnam war was much worse.
As a result, most discussions on the latest are conducted in silence and in private among war veterinaries.
After his two children returned to fight against Marina's Infantry, the retreated King Mark Cancian warned them that the people separated from militarys would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with anxiety because they faced insurance and traveled to exotic places.
Others would be asked whether there would be a "happy and violent veteran under the surface", said Cancian, who joined in Iraq and returned to a high-level work of the government in Washington.
During his employment search, he felt that some interviewers would have asked him if they would be able to suffer under the pressure of a demanding worker from Washington immediately after his fight tour.
"When you talk about your service, you need to face negative presses", recalls Cancian by connecting it to your children.
The military concern is, in part, from the American indifference towards wars.
The achievements in the fighting field are rarely chosen for loving a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees few direct benefits of Iraq and Afghanistan ' s wars.
"We, as a nation, have no longer appreciated military heroism in ways that were all common in the Second World War", said the general Tender David Barno, who commanded the United States troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the joy of politicians and the public focuss on the depth of a service member's suffering.
The troops are recognized by the number of rounds they have supported, the number of friends who have lost or the scope of their lesions.
The army faces a growing pressure to end with violation
This week, a historical hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the army for their patience against violation.
If not, hundreds of applicants are organized for the following.
The soldier of the first Elizabeth Lyman had 25 and 11 weeks of pregnancy in the night in which she said that he was violated by a friend.
It was October 2008, and he was headed back to his quarter in the Air Base Miramar, north of San Diego, after the dinner with a friend when he was found with a colleague who had a pack of 12 beer.
He asked him if he could join her in her room to take a coffee.
"I was a alarm signal," Lyman says.
However, the native in Texas left her concern.
I don't think, he's 19.
"It's Texas," says.
"I had heard my instincts."
At the few minutes of entering Lyman's room, the man closed to him back and took her down and violed her, applauded.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and other 27 members of the current and old military personnel are awaiting a judicial decision in a historical court that will be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the request that they have interrogated against the Defence Secretary of Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be judged.
The request claims that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce generalized violations between militarys, in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
In February by Susan Burke, a lawyer at Washington, D.C., the request was initially involved 17 applicants, but increased to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of them claimed that they were violated or sexually attacked by their partners, and that the army failed to investigate, process, or providing appropriate justice after the arrested attacks.
Burke says it's going to the largest army, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a structure upwards," says.
"Who are those who are able to eradicate the culture of reprise? The high command."
Burke also says that since February, some 400 survivors have been contacted with her, many of which could be part of future demands.
Your strategy: Instead of accumulating all the demanders in this case, putting all the eggs into the same chair, so say, it will present several cases, to be necessary, to keep the pressure.
The Defence Team for the Department of Defence, headed by the Federal Federal Neil MacBride, presented a movement to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, declare the Defence Strategy - in the essence that militarys cannot be requested by current or old soldiers because of the injuries suffered in armed forces.
By a sentence of the Supreme Court of 1950 called Dr. Feres, the Federal Government is not responsible for the damages suffered by staff in active service.
"Delegated damages are part of the military service of the applicants", said the documents.
The Department of Defence refused to comment on this article.
The things have changed since the 50s.
While women are still officially banned to fight, this distinction is only nominal: modern wars have rarely clearly the front lines.
Even in Iraq as in Afghanistan, military women's teams are playing more important roles, especially to reach local women in war areas.
The result: among these two wars, 150 soldiers have died and two thirds of them in struggles.
It's time that the army also modernizes, says Burke.
She's not alone in his fight, and three other questions are running, in addition to her.
In the Yale Law Faculty, the Veterinary Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four main military academys in order to promote a mixed environment.
Furthermore, the organisation of Vietnam Veterans of America is composed of a request against the army focusing on the diagnostics of "personal disorder" assigned to the victims of violation to give them the high of the service - a common event, according to the activistas, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women's Action Network in Service, a group of human rights.
His group submitted a request in December against the Veterano administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in order to handle the claims of benefits for persons who claimed to have been sexually aggreded in the service.
nine legislative projects were submitted separately at the Congress by a bipartidist mixture of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010 there were 3.158 sexual aggressions complained, according to the Office for the Prevention of the Sexual and Response of the Department of Defence.
However, aggressions are significantly infringed, and by the Pentagon's own estimates, which are about 13.5 per cent of the 19.000 estimated incidents that have occurred that year.
The report published in March also reviews the processing indexes: in 2010, 20 percent of the cases complained in the army were judged - half in the civil justice system.
The applicants in Burke's case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of traumas.
In the case of Lyman, he declared the presumed violation of the military police less than one hour after that happening.
That night, he said, was asked to tell him the details of his violation 11 times different to a lot of police, doctors and commanders.
She was subjected to a kit of violation, and the blood of her agressor - of a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which he was asked about having sexual relations with his girlfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people declared as a witness of personality on behalf of the presumed author, which was finally absolved.
"I remember the day you read the verdict," says Lyman.
"I thought I would go to work -- I found me crying from the room."
"I was put into the psychiatrist unit, and when I came out, I remembered that I told him to my command officer, "It wasn't his judgment. That was my judgment."
Lyman was ordered to visit an military psychiatrist, which finally diagnosis a disorder of personality, which did not accept it for the service.
In January 2010, the service was dispensed under less honorable terms, which prevents it from receiving any benefits.
With regard to whether the case submitted by Lyman and his demand partners continues, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, Professor of Law in the George Washington College.
However, notes, "In my view, they should be able to continue."
What is interrupted between them and one verse is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was published for the first time.
I have been a permanent critic of the Doctorine Feres.
The army is decades behind because he does not have the same encouragement and dissuasion that is responsible.
And adds: "The possibilities are strongly against them, but it is important to them to try it."
These things are only changed when good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing does not go on his way, Burke, lawyer of the applicants, will put the colle to his other hundreds of demandors for future cases.
"We will continue to fight army in this issue until reform is produced," says.
"or until we die, what's happening first.
The walls have eyes: how researchers are studying you in Facebook
Before turning into the new face of the extreme right side in Europe, Anders Berring Brevik was just another type that looked at its online anti-immigration views.
The Monday, Breivik, who acknowledged a murder in Norwegia in July, who left 77 dead, was imprisoned to his first public court hearing.
While Breivik could have acted alone, it was far away from being only in the cyberspace: most of the time had passed before his attack against his computer, charlating with some of the millions of nationalists who support the rights groups in social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Facility - you just have to enter Facebook.
"We say that it was not so difficult to reach them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recently published report on the European digitalism by the British DemoS Center.
The Facebook's personal information post is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic features with a scientific precision - the way the salers have been used for years.
The Bartlett team found a half million fans of the right groups throughout Europe and then announced them, but instead of binding them to a new band or diet product, advertising invited users to complete a survey that asked about their educational level, attitudes to violence and optimism on their own future.
By reaching Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers of 14 extreme right games in 11 European countries - all without leaving the office.
"It's a completely new way to do a research," Bartlett says.
Some of the results are not very surprising: the online partys of the right groups tend to be young, men and hampered by immigration.
However, in a kind of round, "they who combine their activity online with the outdoor activity are more reasonable, democratic and less violent than those who remain behind the computer screen."
The DEMOS work is only a example of how Facebook is converting into a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.
Centers of research, medical and political researchers are using the site to study all, from health problems to social trends as expressed in the "I like," messages in the walls and state updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding a average of three pieces of content per day, Facebook's "base data" is generating an increase in research, stimulating the number of academic works with the name of the site on the title to almost 800% in the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people whom you couldn't close to you with a folder on the street.
"And when you tried to find people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"I would have to go through the game, and they would never allow you access," Bartlett says.
"Facebook removes all that - you're going to them directly."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address social health problems.
A recent study conducted by Dr. Megan Moreno, the University of Wisconsin-Madison and its colleagues found that university students who talked about their cups in Facebook had a significantly higher risk of having problems with drinking than students who remained in silence about the topic.
They suggest that student partners, such as residential advisers, could control the site and interfere to help a student who has disappointed state updates with their bottles.
"You can't handle a problem if you can't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, co-autor of Moreno and director of the Centre of Health, Conduction and Development of Child at the Seattle Child Research Institute, said Washington Post.
"We found a way to identify children in risk that otherwise would not be diagnosed."
Facebook is also constantly "pinning" to his own population to get data.
The Site Data Team has developed statistics on the state of relationship and the Day of San Valentín, the expectation of election participation at half of the 2010 legislative period, and a National Felicity Index (for example, using the information that can be accessed - the Defender of Digital Freedom for a long time that the site should make available to other large numbers of data for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, guests or not - the sacrifice to play the Scrabble with a friend to thousands of miles of distance is to allow the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users are being part of a survey that they don't even know?
While researchers have well defined guidelines about how to collect their data out of line, online is a free bar for everyone.
"I don't think that many users have even thought that a researcher could be reviewing their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologue of London's Know-how Lab, about a 2006 study conducted with the public Facebook walls of students.
"In what they were concerned, it was only among them and their friends."
Lieutenant Colonel Cribbs for you, sir.
Even outside line, there is no guarantee that a research theme is completely honest.
In Facebook, it is impossible to know that part of the information of a user's profile and the messages of the wall are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside Facebook are two very different things," says Selwyn.
This is why, despite their years as technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a subject and a bolling are still the best research tools that no one can use.
"No replacement is to enter the real world and speak with the real people," says.
"Social research is supposed to be about social - and a lot of social is still outside the line."
"Fride and Inhuman: Anders Berring Breivik makes his first public appearance in the court
Anders Berring Breivik, the man who condemned to be the brain of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norwegia this summer, has been described itself as a fighter of the "resistance" during his first public appearance in the Oslo court.
"I am a military commander in the Norway resistance movement and the Templates of Norwegian Temple," said before a room filled with 500 people.
"I am opposed to the court, because he has received the mandate of the organizations that support hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts, but I don't declare guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologist, because "I did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform to express their view points".
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, which brought a written conversation with antelyns, to address the families of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for more than 12 weeks, prohibited access to communication media for four weeks, and said that the authorities should have a strict control over all visits and correspondance for eight weeks.
Around 30 survivors and families of victims attended the hearing.
Some came with the hope to look at Breivik at the eyes, others to confirm that it was recreated under the key.
They all attended the goal of progress towards the conclusion.
"I thought it seemed cold and inhuman," said a survivor of Utoya to the NRK.
"I was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and listening to the suspect."
In clothing with a dark and blue dragon, Breivik kept calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked at the journalists and survivors when he entered and out of the building.
Despite the strange notion of Breivik to be part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge decided that it is not a mental nurse, and said that there are no evidence to act with compromises.
Some may consum that the attacks of 22 July seem to be an extremist instead of a root group.
But that does not automatically eliminate pain and confusion that the whole nation still feels.
"I would like to look like a monster, but it doesn't seem", said one family of the victim.
"I would be much easier if it looks like it."
7 Lectures of the lost interview of Steve Jobs are shown in a theatre this week
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, there were some who compared it with Henry Ford - distinguing the genius of technology such as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans could find more clearer, in a recent interview to Jobs, which has been played as an advancement of a series of special projections on the largest markets this week, it is how much it understood this creative mind about the commercial and working processes of the products.
It was uncertainly a designer, dreamer and hyppy authorized, but he was also a meticolous organizer and a yonki of the flux diagrams - a man who believed that many executives were "a disease that consists of thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the TV series The Triumph of the Nerds (The Triumph of the idiots) on the homes of the personal computer, and was sent for more than one hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
At that time they had been less than 10 years since Jobs had been obliged to walk from Apple, and she had already worked intensely in his new NeXT computer company, waiting for the popular Internet adoption.
While a small part of the Cringely interview was used in Nerds, he said that the original interview was missing during his transport.
It was only after Jobs' death that was found a complete copy in VHS in the director's garage.
This file material, slightly revised, is the base of Steve Jobs: The lost interview of 68 minutes, which arrives to the Chinese Landmark this mileday and juvenile.
For someone known to hate interviews in depth, Jobs here seems awkwardly ready to exposure its technological philosophy and commercial strategies.
And that's very thinking.
In four different points along the interview, there are huge silences between questions and answers - from 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, where Jobs is clearly suspecting his thoughts, looking for accuracy.
There are also moments in which the perfectionism of Jobs comes to the surface, where it seems unreasonable because of Cringely's questions, encouraging him to go to the themes or arguments of greater importance.
Filmed before Pixar's era, iPod or iPhone, there is something strangely prophetic in The Lost Interview, when Jobs evaluates what other companies do well and bad, and offers its own vision of the future of the computer.
One thing is reading poststumm assessments of Jobs, but there is something cruel and inspiring in the Jobs we see here, the desirable dreamer at the edge of the size.
He has a vision of how he can and must be things.
Not much after explaining everything here, it's and he did it.
A rapid summary of seven remarkable sequences of the Lost Interview:
About how he learned to take a business:
"In the years of business, I always asked, "Why do you do things?" and the answers that you give are: "Oh, that's the only way to do."
Nobody knows why he does what he does, no one thinks about things very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs takes details of their efforts to simplify Apple accountability.
Inconcerned by the way the costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" that was done at the eye of good cube, and then adjusted with a "variable" - developed an automatized manufacture that ensured that they could determine the commercial costs to details.
About the smile to Pope:
Jobs referred to the "Blue Cacha" that he himself built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allows people to effectively hack the telephone company and call out a long distance.
It has been widely written about the device, but Jobs' Euforia here by describing the Blue Box as a encouraging act is contagious.
Describe how he and Wozniak tested the box through the use of a public phone, make a call, and then connecting from a AT & T network to another, while creating a ship with the most possible satellites.
"We were involveing things around the world twice a twelve times and crying through the public phone and returning a minute later to the public phone from the door of the side," said Jobs with a ride.
"We were young and what we learned was that we could build something that could control thousands of dollars in infrastructure throughout the world."
Our two, we didn't know much, but we could build a little thing that could control a great thing - was an incredible lesson, and I don't think that there would never exist Apple without her.
Jobs continues to describe a glorious brome that he and Wozniak almost abandon, calling the Vatican through the Blue Cache in half the night and requesting to talk to the Pope, while he made his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
While several members of the Catholic Jearchy were called in half the night to talk to the American diplomat, they both stolen in carcassets just before the mystery Pope was dispersed to respond to the phone.
About joying technology (and sale by phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12 years, at the box of resting to build a frequency container, Bill Hewlett searched for the telephone guide and made him a call.
Shortly after his 20-minute telephone conversation, Jobs obtained a part-time summer job in Hewlett-Packard.
"This was a remarkable influence on me, was the only company that had seen that age and formed my vision of what was a company and what they treated with their employees."
Jobs was then converted to one of the HP employees who visited the company's research laboratory in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first table computer never done".
It was so big as a sweet, had a small catholic tube screen, and I'll love him.
I would make a trip to HP as youth and lose time with that machine and write programs for it.
on improvising innovation:
In several points of the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on walk.
Soon in his cart, as he was intended to sell a base plates bridge, he asked him if he could mount the whole team.
Working with only 30 days of credit, I had to find out the mount and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, while I was in Apple, he recalls the fights against which a computer rat:
"I agreed to have dramatic arguments... they cryed that they would need five years [to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I had painted, and I was out and found a designer.
Nine days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and that was completely reliable.
Over the major enterprises losing force:
Before the Apple's renaissance, Jobs propheciously predicted how many of the industry's leaders would trope in their vision, and would lose the control of its market share.
"That you're working in IBM or Xerox, so you're doing better photographers and printers, and what?"
You have the monopolie of the market share, so the company has no success.
The sales and marketing departments increase the success, so that these are those who end up by directing companies and products are excluded from the forum for decision-making.
The genius of the products leading to this monopolie position can be caused by people who have no idea of good products vs bad products - the knowledge of the office necessary.
That's what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could have been administered from the whole computer industry.
It could have been 10 times its size, may have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They took the derogation of the victory.
About innovation as artistic expression:
"There is a large amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as it evolves the great idea, changes and grows."
It is a lot learned about the stirlings of the same.
There are sacrifices you have to do - some things you can't do that they make the electronics, the vision makes them, robots make them, the manufactures make them.
You have to keep 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - to adjust them all the time...
Finally, it is still trying to exhibit the best thing that a human team has done, and then to try to adapt these things to what you are doing.
Picasso said the good artists would copy, the big artists rob.
We never had anger about robbering great ideas.
What in part did greatly to Macintosh was that people who were working in him were musical, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, which were cataloguely the best computer sciences in the world.
If you weren't on the computer, I could have done wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas cereals with the rivals of the health care law while the court accepts the case
The day on which the Supreme Court was gathered at the door to consider the politically controverted question of accepting the challenge of President Obama's health care law, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were assessed in a scene discussed by the signing of lawyers that would give the case to the Supreme Court.
The occasion was on Thursday last, when the nine judges met in a preliminary hearing to carefully study the review requests.
One of the cases in question was a request submitted by 26 States by dismissing the overall reform of health assistance adopted by the Congress last year, a law which has been a war cry for conservators throughout the country.
The judges agreed to accept the request and, in fact, a historical allegation was expected for 5 hours and average March, and the result would probably be more likely to be the presidential career of 2012, which will be fully supported at the time when the court decision is known.
The lawyer that will compare to the court and claim that the law must be dismissed is probably Paul Clement, who served as the general fiscal of the United States during the government of George W. Bush.
The signing of lawyers of Clement, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two hundreds of enterprises that helped to develop the annual dinner of the Federal Society, a group that has been dedicated to the defence of the conservatory legal principles.
Another sign that the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the commercial associations that defied the law, the National Federation of Independent Affairs.
Another patrocinator was the gigantic Pfizer Inc. pharmaceutical, which has a huge financial interest in the result of the fight.
The dinner was held in a Washington hotel, hours after the court's preliminary hearing on the case.
Among the assistants were, among others, Mitch McConnell, the most important Republican in the Senate and a declared opponent of the health care law.
Special invitations at the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
It's nothing new: The two judges have been attending events of the Federal Society for years.
And it is not something in conflict with the ethical standards.
In fact, the judges are exempted from the Code of Conduction which rise the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they weren't, it could be said that they would fall under the Canon 4C Code, which says: " A judge may attend events to recur the funds of organizations related to law and others, although the judge cannot be a speaker, a invitant of honor, or to present in the programme of such event. "
However, the absolute proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the lawyers buffets in the case, as well as a company with a huge financial interest, was enough to warn the Ethic activists in the government.
"This impressive breach of ethics and indifference towards the code goes against the demands of several judges acting in the court by the same rules which apply to all federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause (Common Cause).
"The judges were accompanied in a recovery of gala funds with lawyers that have cases injured before the court."
Its appearance and assistance in the recovery of funds for this event suffered any demand of imparciality, and is inacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in the critics that say that they are too easy to mix the court's activities with the agenda inspired by groups such as the Federal Society.
And Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a high-standing conservator act.
Moreover, conservators argue that it is the magistrate Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as a general adviser of Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were presented in the court of first instance.
Their critics have stressed that Kagan abstend of seeing the case, saying that he was too involved in defending the law as for now being imparcial.
Kagan didn't give any indication that he's going to do it.
Boeing receives a record request of $18 billion
Emirates airline requests 50 double swimming aircraft Boeing 777, with a option to 20 more.
Boeing also sell six Boeing Dreamliner flights to Oman Air, a valued operation of more than a million dollars.
Rara times is news when a company obtains a request of 50 units of its product.
But it is a great transaction when the company is the Boeing Co manufacturer, and the sale price for the 50 planes is a record of $18 billion.
It is as large as the place where Boeing received the order: the Middle East, a gold threat in growth of future aircraft requests.
In a study of the Monday, Chicago company estimates that the airlines in the Middle East will need 2.520 airlines for $4,550 million for the next 20 years.
Boeing announced during the weekend his most biggest request for the history for commercial aircraft for $50 jets Boing 777 of double pastel.
The best request came from the Emirates airport in Dubai.
The airport also has a choice to buy more than 20 flights, which would increase the total sale price to 26 billion dollars, announced Boeing in the Dubai Air Hall 2011.
Then, the Monday, Boeing said that Oman Air had requested six Boeing 787-8s, the named Dreamliner, who presums a fuel shore and services for spectacular passengers.
The sale price for six of them is more than a million dollars.
"This has clearly a huge positive effect for Boeing," said the analist of Morningstar Neal.
"The quality of these customers, in particular, is very strong."
Many Middle East airlines are ownership of their oil producers.
Therefore, they have not only the money to pay the aircraft, but also a increase in the fuel prices - in generally harmful for airlines, because it is one of the largest costs - it is not so harmful, because the country is winning money with the increased oil price.
This is important because they have less likely to cancel or delay the flight commands when the fuel prices increase, said out.
"You have natural protection," he said.
The request for Emirates consolidates the Boeing's leadership on the width flight market and helps to maintain its Airbus SAS competitor's attempt to invade their domain with the A350 passenger flight.
Boeing's victory in the air feast is produced four months after Airbus said that it was going to delay the biggest debut of A350, which operates directly with 777-300ER.
He delayed the debtor to add more impulse after customers required an increase in the useful and low-load.
Boeing Co's actions were at $1.5 per cent to $67.94.
The sister of the President of Mexico, on the opinion derogated in the vote of Michoacán
Luisa Maria Calderon states that the drug traffickers helped their opponent of the PRI, Fausto Vallejo, in the container.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon seemed to have lost her candidate to the Governor of Michoacán during the elections of the violent state, and she stated the moon that drugs helped to slow the car for one of its opposers.
Previous results gave the front in the car for the Governor of the Western State in Fausto Vallejo, the institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of the crime organized during the whole election process and, above all night, it is alarming not only for Michoacán but for the whole country," said Luis Maria Calderon in a radio interview a day after the Sunday's vote.
"Avoyed our candidates, our election workers... they supported the urns, installed barricades... and ordered the people that would vote" for PRI.
PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until he lost the presidency in 2000.
However, it is the scene of a return, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
PRI has the hope of winning the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo seems to have overwhelmed a little in Calderon, who had led the surveys before the elections.
Calderon, a candidate of the Conservator's National Action Party of his brother, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvan Aureoles, the left candidate by the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who is currently employed by the ruler's office, remained in third place, a great derogation for the left shared and unfortunately before the presidential elections of 2012.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the preliminary results.
Vallejo, exalted from the capital of the State of Morelia, rejected drugs and urged other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has been dominated for a long time by specialized drug cards in marihuana, heroin and metanfetamines.
It is the birth state of President Calderon, and he elected Michoacán to launch an offensive military injury against traffickers in December 2006.
But violence has continued.
A PAN accommodation was killed a week before the elections was held by Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates left local candidates for fear.
Although for the PRI, for disappointable things that seem to be the elections of Michoacán, a victory will help stimulate the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential elections, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, welcomed Vallejo and said, "I think that this victory should be very encouraging in the next year."
BAsD encourages Asia to help save the euro area
The Asian Development Bank (BAsD) called for India and China to be prepared to help save the eurozone of its sovereign debt crisis in order to avoid a long-term recession that would prevent Asian economy's growth.
Rajat Nag, Director-General of Asian Development Bank in Manila, said that the two larger growth economys in the world had to do everything possible to accelerate the recovery of the economic block already been through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against BRIC [Brasil, Russia, India, China] countries that observe the difficulties of Europe in a "imperative" way and said that Asia's financial assistance together with the leadership and European resources would help avoid a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all together in this."
"So anyone who can help Europe to get out of the crisis is useful," said the Financial Times in an interview in the framework of the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"This can be protected in a certain measure, but it can't be immunate."
"So if China and India can help, it's all the means."
The European Monetary Union has been severely aware of a sovereign debt crisis in the last months.
In the last days, Italian debt costs have been shooted dangerously and the first ministers of Italy and Greece have diminished.
The current crisis of sovereign debt in Europe has increased the fears that the world economy could move to recession and have generated calls for the main emergency economy to help the euro zone to find a solution.
Mr. Nag predicted that any Asian support would be changing through the IMF, but he said that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of the EU rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund would provide a greater negotiation power for Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Inded Commercio Minister, said that "India will do everything possible" to help the euro zone as its own economy was now suffering the fall of exports and the extent of foreign capital entries.
"Nobody wants to keep the euro zone instable and turbulent," said.
"We have monumental challenges and we have to keep a high level of growth."
"It's not a choice, it's a imperative, because where we find job for decades of our young men and women."
Others argue that development economys like India are not responsible for helping rich Europeans when they face their own and deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor of Brown University in the U.S., said that it would be very difficult to sell Europe's help for the thousands of thousands of people in India, from which up to 800 million live with approximately $2 per day or at least.
"In some time, Greeks will be understood that their 50-year-olds are jumping up and going from holidays to the beaches, and that will not go well," said.
Lee Howell, director of the World Economic Forum, also asked why India's reservations should be used to maintain the numerous and well-employed workers of the Greek public sector, in jobs of unadministrated enterprises, and loss generators such as rail.
Mr Nag said that the eurozone crisis was threatened by "important effects in chain" throughout Asia.
The Asian Development Bank prognosis of 7.5 per cent of economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 is now faced with the "low-risk risks" because of Europe's threat.
He said that vulnerable emergency markets needed to make "contingent plans" to protect themselves from a crisis and significant outcome from their economy.
Series of the Pentagon on the possible defence remedies
The Defence Secretariat, Leon Panetta, called the Monday, warning that the automatic budget refunds that are contained could be able to shoot national security and cause financial reactions from the Pentategon's passes to the Afghanian fight camps to civil mountain chains.
The Pentagon is already saying the $450 million of reductions over the next decade, but now it is afraid that an additional reduction of 600 billion or more in cash may be imminent if the Congress does not reach an agreement on expenditure.
"The impact of these curves would be devastator for the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, republicated by Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, the Republic of Carolina del South.
He said that the failure of the Congress to reach a budget agreement and its consequent consequently, the called “sequent”, would take place to 23 percent of global reductions and a high higher to many new projects.
"A so large currency, applied in this way without discrimination, would make that most of our naval and construction projects cannot be implemented - it is not possible to buy three four parts of a ship or a building - and seriously damage other modernization efforts", wrote Panetta to the senators.
"We would also be able to separate many of our civilian officials involuntaryly and because the reduction would be imposed so fast, it is almost certain that we should have to license civilians in order to comply with the goal."
"This change would break the faith with those who keep our army and seriously damage the good arrangement."
The coarres with time would reach the fight troops, said Panetta.
"By though the financing for war time in the submarine Contingent Operations is not directly affected by the sequence, the efforts of the war would be negatively affected by serious disorders in the basic budgets," warned Panetta.
"A staff contract would be reduced, which would lead to delays in the contracts and the supervision of the contract supporting the war."
"A staff would be reduced, giving place for delays in the payment of suppliers in war time, and legal and political support would be interrupt."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, requesting information on the possible impact of the automatic cuts in the Department of Defence.
"The result of a secular in the Department of Defence would cause a rapid decline from the United States as the main military power of the world."
"We are strongly against this dracone action," the senators said in a communication together on Monday's evening when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is not an outcome with which you can live, and it is certainly not one we should impose ourselves."
"The sequence is a threat to the interests of the United States' national security, and it should not be allowed to happen."
If the Panetta letter and the recent warnings of the senators will increase the pressure for a budgetary commitment or intensify the calls to exhibit the Pentategon of the Accounts are to see.
Panetta has been more frankly about the possible recovery, despite a work at the top of the Pentategon with years of experience in budgets in the Congress and the White House and knowing that it had difficult decisions.
In a press conference last week, the Defense Secretariat painted a sweet panorama of what could be before - a army with a chat, but not a nucleus.
"It's a marine ship."
It's a children's book, right?
"It's an aircraft without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, a army of quarters, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers trained to carry out the mission," said Panetta in his words of opening in the Pentategon.
"It is a force that suffers low moral, deficit preparation and is not able to keep on the day with the adversary potentials."
"In fact, invites aggression..."
In addition to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta reports new details of how reductions "generate important operational risks: duration in response to crises, conflicts and disasters; we are seriously limited to our ability to be deployed and compromised over the world; and is an inacceptable risk in future fight operations."
And Panetta said that some of the largest defence projects could face the hacha, including those already tried and some only at the first stages of planning.
This list includes the F35 Joint Stike Fighter, a new planned bomb, the new-generation balistic submarine, the new litoral combat ship and the new struggle vehicle that the Army and the Marina need to replace, the Washington.
Detention of the development and additional tests of F35 could generate some 80 billion dollars over 10 years, but their parties say that it is the next vital step to improve and address the potential threats of China and other rivals.
How to detect a lie
A view to the most recent titlers shows how serious and all of us are the lie and lie in daily life.
The Republican candidate Herman Cain is occupied by interchanging accusions of sexual abuses with several women; each party accused of lie to the other.
The Administrators of the State University of Pennsylvania have been assaulted because they were supposedly hidden reports that said that a retired fotball trainer was sexually aggressive to children.
Last week, the French President, Nicolás Sarkozy, was "played" with a open microphone, claiming the President of the United States, Barack Obama, that the first Israeli minister Benjamín Netanyahu is a lie.
Mentir has destroyed carriages and convulsionate countries.
The congressist of New York and exhibitionist in the Internet, Anthony Weiner, made the struggle with his slowly dismissed dismissors by the irrefutable test.
The former Chairman John Edwards has been accused of offences in the financing of the campaign related to the coverage of an extra-military relationship.
And again, no one who lives in it will never forget the medium-sized circle by President Bill Clinton by lie during his second mandate about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends on tramps are very extensive in school and university reviews.
There were cases in which teachers gave the responses to students to be better viewed in their performance assessments.
Mentors who should teach the contrary are sent the message that lie and lie are acceptable.
How long do we find us?
In any day, studies show that they can lie you anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
That is sure, many of those lies are pious lies.
Another study showed that unknown men were three times in the first 10 minutes to meet themselves.
Detection of lies, or "the location of lies", is an essential ability that we must buy all, for both personal and professional reasons.
Instead of being a similar table game, for example, Charada, where the goal is to explain: "I have" is the detection of the library, the detection of the serious knowledge based on scientific data obtained during the last six decades in prestigious universities that have conducted research projects in deepness, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that old mitos about lie have been distracted.
The liars look at the eyes.
Not always tartamude, balbucean, if they rub or worry.
It is not possible to conclude that the liars are difficult to detect or detect.
A trained lie detector can reach the truth by learning about the structure of the declaration, the micro-facial expressions, the training of questions and time.
I pass a few years by studying the scientific discovery of the wrong in the wide and always emergentive body of knowledge, and I was clear that the detection of the wrong is a modern technique that is easy to learn and help navigate through our complex world - especially if their professional responsibilities include contracts, interviews, or negotiations management.
Good liars have the ability to read well to others, make them feel pleasant, manage their own emotions and feel intuitively how they understand others.
We know about the surveys that extraverted persons are more than introverted, that men say more "mentioned to themselves", while women say more lies "oriented towards others" -- normally to protect the feelings of someone -- that marriages are less often less often than their couples who are not married (but the lies that are often saying to be "herrests").
We also know that if you are understood as a wicked one, others will feel less guilty to lie.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, observe the ordinary conduct of the subject.
This is called "Creation of a basic line".
Help provide reference points to measure after changes.
Watch the posture of the subject, rise and vocal characteristic.
It's better to know if someone normally shoots with the foot all the time to not make injust accusions when you see the feet shooting in half of the meeting.
Next, search for false, verbal and non-verbal behaviour groups.
Consider these behavior groups as alarm signals, not as a lie test.
People who lie can free the top of the body when trying to remember their history, can put their feet to the door, switch up to an outdoor, change their posture significantly or show a "post-interview" -- that exagerate suspicion of relief and post-change since all difficult questions have been completed.
The questionnaires often see falsely that the interview has finished only to find that post-interview relief.
It also takes attention to the subject's vocabulary.
Scott Peterson put the ball to the background and used the past time while he said that his murdered wife was alive, launching a search for her at national level.
People who lie can also use a distance language: "I have no sexual relationship with that woman... Ms. Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question fully.
The most common verbal indicators are sutiles.
Someone can use a lot of "restrictive language" when he answers a difficult question: "Good... to tell truth... until I... I understand."
This makes the response a perception instead of a fact and is often a warning signal.
There is no magic form to detect lies, but develop ability to discover the lie is possible.
These skills will improve the possibilities of any one to avoid being victimized by the staff artists in their professional and personal life.
The controversial oil plan deleted after the threat of the delay of the United States in its approval
Days after the Administration of Obama would threaten by delaying the adoption of an oil oil planned from Canada to the Golf of Mexico -- inflicting the syndicates, while he disappointed ecologists -- the company that seeks to build oil is disposed to redirect the project to return it.
TransCanada said the Monday that he will move the oil planned outside the environmentally sensitive area of Sandhills in Nebraska, and trusts that the project will win the approval.
The company announced the decision at the Press Conference at the Headquarters of Nebraska.
TransCanada's director, Alex Parbax, says that the company maintains its confidence in the time that oil oil is approved, although it is true that with a different route.
This comes after the announcement last week by the State Department to delay the decision by a federal permission for the project until new potential routes are studied to prevent the Sandhills of Nebraska and the Ogallala Water, a wide subterranean water supply.
"This is a true way of progress," said the representative Lee Terry, the Republic of Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the Department of State is possible to separate any decision until 2013, after the elections of the next year, although officials refused that the policy was undertaken in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the request of the Department of State, and expressed all its support.
Oil, from 1,700 km from Canada to the Golf of Mexico.
It would take 700,000 barriles a day from the province of Alberta to the restaurants in Texas.
For that reason, it would be necessary to cross six states.
It is hate by ecologists, but loved by the working groups, which have allocated 20,000 jobs linked to oil.
However, Nebraska's opposite legislators are suspending legislation to force a displacement from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala Water, the largest source of potable water and irrigation.
The current environmental impact study of the Department of State found that the project only caused restricted environmental impacts, but the source of the energy industry said that the Department's general inspector ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is if the member of the TransCanada Lobby, Paul Elliot, who was a campaign adviser of Hillary Clinton in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the programme.
The other is if a sign that was contracted to direct the original study was an inadequate choice because he was linked to TransCanada.
The LaBelle Patches requested for promptly caused a child of fear
A family in New York states that the disappearing of the disco music, Patti LaBelle, was a smuggle in its Manhattan building, shooting his little daughter up to the point of fear.
The diatribe of "Lady Marmalade" assaulted Genevieve Monk of 18 months of age, so that he suffered "paths of personality, dream disorders" and "his fear for strangers", says his family at the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
It was 10 November last year when the tramoyist Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, professor of childhood garden, and Genevieve was preparing to go to a family journey.
While Kevin Monk took the car, Roseanna Monk was shooted to the riverside Boulevard building, with his team, leading to Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said he was close to the door and put his daughter on the ground for a moment.
"Another closed behind and said to me, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said to her, "Yes, and I went to cut it," he said.
LaBelle showed angry to the pregnant woman.
"He said in a aggressive ton, "I shouldn't have left her daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I said, "I don't have any interest in what you're saying or thinking."
He flew and started using bad words - the word C and the word J in high voice...
I had a water bottle and began to get the water of the bottle over me."
He said Genevieve was historical.
"I told him to this woman, "See what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the girl.
LaBelle was shocked about the mother -- which still subjected Genevieve -- and he had to be contained by its environment and retired to a car that I expected her, said Roseanna Monk.
The little was smiling so strong that he smiled, accumulated.
Later, the family sent a note requesting an apology from LaBelle, but I didn't get the answer.
The lawyer and representatives of LaBelle did not return the calls to comment that happened.
The request is looking for unspecified damages, but the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis, said that he had the case freely and that the family plans to give all the money that makes support for children with cancer.
"The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct," said Davis.
"This kind of conduct is completely unacceptable, especially when it leads to a child's garden teacher that brings into arms to a 18-month child."
Climate adversity slowed the economy
During the first year of the management of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa, increased unemployment and informality, decreased foreign investment and the economy was undergoing.
2011 is a year that will be remembered in Sinaloa's economic history, which is the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, self-designed by the change, which generated great expectations for progress in the economy, but given the climate adversity of the year start, it is not observed growth, in turn a deterioration in the main economic development indicators.
The low temperatures of February, in addition to cause thousands of losses for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the State economy to grow, caused a contrast to the economic activity in general of 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, which was mostly justified by the historical fall of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dinamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the ice effect report issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, 582 billion 835 hectares were damaged, from which 78.03 per cent suffered totally and the remaining 21.07 per cent of parcial damage had been the main struggles of fruit, measuring and garbance.
The fall in the economic activity has generated, until November, a constant increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geographic, the rate of unemployment during the first three quarters of the year was observed, as in January 55,053 Sinalogs were disbursed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the economically active population, for the second quarter the rate was 5.28 per cent, and between July and September continued to grow up to 6.19 per cent, with a rate of more than 74 thousands of people without deployment, with a increase of the first 18.000 people.
Liver liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for the Economist Gerardo López Cervantes, Director of the UAS Economic and Social Science Faculty, the growth of unemployment can be explicit indirectly, due to the actions taken from the public policy.
"What is seen is a growth in the unemployment that has to be viewed with several factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market for the purposes of restriction of resources by legislation adopted at the Congress to fight money lavage, and for people who get $1,000 illicitly is not easy to work, invest them and use them in something," said.
Migration detained
López Cervantes noted that there is also a democratic factor in the unemployment increase.
"The number of people from the state of work in the foreign country has been restricted in the United States, first by the difficulties to enter, and secondly because they have already had many difficulties to find work, that people are staying and are demanding work sources here in the state, which makes the unemployment out," said.
Informality
The analysis of the Sinaloensis Labour Market is encouraging to consider the high level of informality that is predominantly among the working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the people employed in the state of work without being a worker before any institution of social security.
Under the unemployment and informality, another of the workers of the state is low, the entity has the lower payment in the country, in accordance with the registers of the Institute of Social Affairs and the Secretariat of Work and Social Previation.
The average month income of Sinaloensian workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 weights, very below the national average, which was 7 billion 375 weights.
IED contract
In addition to the fall of economic activity and unemployment increase, in 2011, the higher reduction of the Direct Foreign Investment in the last 10 years is recorded, according to the Economic Secretariat of January to June of the State IED $630,697, which represents a fall of 87,74 per cent of the $5,143,312 registered during the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the Government's Economic Development Secretariat accounts for an overall investment of 17 billion 280 million weight in the year, mainly of the Territorial Sector's enterprises.
Debt
Before the economic contraction scenario, the Government of the State requested in July the adoption of a credit for 3 billion weight, which would be intended to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities, with a view to reactivating the economy, the adoption of the local congress was a amount of 2 billion weight, and until November they did not observe the benefits of debt in any State economy sector.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdés shows the lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the National Transformation Industry Chamber, expressed that during 2011 the harmonisation of wills of the various sectors, including the Government of the State.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa has been really very poor in this year, there is a need to work intensely to recover the land that we have lost in this year, in 2012 we have to resolve efforts, spoke to address the efforts of all and especially the good movement already synchronized by this new government team, we hope that the next year is much better", said.
Economic Length
Loredo López showed that events like the flows of principles of year have defeated the state economy and restricted their performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is the product of several events, including the helmets, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that has not returned enoughly to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have a acceptable flow level in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we are closed very below the expectations we had", said.
Redefine Vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Directorate Confederation of the Republic of Mexico in Sinaloa, expressed that the state is required to be enforced towards higher productive activities of dynamism.
"In general we have noted that it has been worked, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme in which the vocation and economic rule of the state are refined, because it is important that all the potential of the material and human resources that has Sinaloa is highlighted", said.
Work to do
The Chairman of Coparmex highlighted the importance of establishing a future vision that improves the efforts of the Government.
"In general, I would say that the Government has been endeavouring to give good results in different matters, in economic development, there are some progress, but it is important that a long-term programme be developed."
It pointed out that the current administration has made progress in its way to conduct public policy.
" There are elements that allow to say that the Government is more comprehensive, I can say that there is work done and I think that the Government is aware of the work to do," said.
They condemn it for 8 kg of mariguana
A neighbor of Navolate was sentenced to five years of prison and 100 days of currency for the possession of eight kilometers of marijuana.
The General Prosecutor of the Republic informed that the convicted drug committee is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime against health, in its variety of marijuana possession for trade.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by Mexican Army elements on 7 June 2010 in a supervisory operation on the Cyprus Street Valdez, before post 80, in the pool El Castillo, Navolato.

For these reasons, it was assured to the Second Court of District, and the sentence continues to be in the Executive Centre of Criminal Consequences.
Contributions to work should be paid
The works of social nature referred to in programs such as Habbitat, Public Space Rescate and 3x1 for Migrants are at risk of not being completed or seriously delay because of the lack of economic resources, Michael Angel López Miranda reported.
The Civil Social Development Director pointed out that, even though the work programmes have progressed, they are at risk when they have not met the Government of State with the contributions that correspond to it, with more than 11 million weights in the three programmes.
It was noted that the total investment in these three programmes was about 50 million weight, from which the State corresponds to 25 percent and that only the Federation and Municipality had provided resources for works, so that the possible delay of the conclusion of the programme is future.
"There are almost 12 million that touchs them and although the year is finished has not given us nor a fifth, when they had to give us a part since July," he said, "we have started works and they are very advanced, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with the contributions that were corresponding to them, so the Municipius had to request a credit to cover the 7 million but not brought the State administration at that time.
"And has passed us in the previous sex because the State had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programmes continued to walk, and this year we had to access these programmes we had to get resources to cover what was left by the State," detailed.
Despite the commitment of the State authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, it pointed out that the request was made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to ensure the management of the percentages that correspond to them as soon as possible.
"There are almost 12 million that touchs to bring them, and although the year is over, they haven't given us nor a fifth."
Valid "Analogical Apollo" in Mexico in 2015
The substitution of digital analytical signals is one of the most important changes that have suffered the world in the past few years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the United Nations (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional controversies interpressed by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputy against the Presidential Decree, which extended the called "analogical" of 2021 to 2015, while not meeting the eight votes required to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderon was not exceededed in his assignments by issueing the decree that details the actions to follow to the transition to the earthly digital television.
The constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic was dismissed because it was not reached by the qualified majority of eight votes so that the Court would vote on the constitutionality or inconstitucionality of the decree, and that remains the future.
The draft sentence by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero proposed to declare inconstitutional decree because the regulation of radio and television matters is a power reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunication Commission (Cofetel), in contrast to the principles of Jeracic subordination and law reservation.
On behalf of the project, only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and his own Sánchez Cordero.
With this argument, both the Senate and the House of Members promoted two constitutional disputes to imply the decree, and by accepting the requests, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all action available in it for the digital transition.
The full of ministers also resolved to dismiss the request made by the House of Members, without entering the draft discussion, also by the Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In its intervention, the President said not to match the arguments of the project in the sense that the federal executive cannot struct the measures to prepare public administration through general standards.
"I do not think that if it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and recalls that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunication sector correspond to the federal executive, which has by constitutional mandate, the State's rectification.
The substitution of digital analytical signals is one of the most important changes that have suffered the world in the past years, and is translated into a better use of the radio spectrum, a better quality of the signal and more channels.
Approaching the change would, however, postpone the benefits of digitalization, which involves a decision of public interest, which is not only a technical dimension, "as it covers economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues stressed, "exige the operation of the entire system, in accordance with the principle of economic correction of the State, of a group of assignments that the Constitution leads to the power of the State Executive".
He recalled that a large number of countries worldwide have already concluded digital transition, and it has done it through the Executive, although it has been counted with highly specialized technical bodies.
It could not be concluded that the Executive, when issued the decree, which is somewhat engaged in the field of competence of the Congress, is provided in the administrative area, the observation of the laws issued by the legislative.
Analyze the possibility of a "vote vote" account in Michoacán
According to the data raised by the PREP, the difference between the first and the second place of the Governor's election is only 27 percent, yet without accounting of the votes related to 879 of 6 000 74 total acts.
The possibility of the "stem vote" account is a reality in the election process of this year in Michoacán, where, in accordance with the data raised by the Preliminary Electoral Results Programme (PREP) the difference between the first and the second place of the ruler's election is only 27 percent, yet without accounting of the votes related to 879 of 6 000 74 total acts.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Michoacán Electoral Institute (IEM), Mary of the Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that only a few days ago, on 9 November, the election body adopted a series of lines to harmonize local standards with the federal election reform.
As noted, Michoacán did not authorize its Political Constitution or its Electoral Code of State or its Electoral Justice, since the Congress of the State adopted the reforms shortly before the conclusion of the legal time for which they could enter into force in the present election process and the Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel prohibited its publication within the periods laid down in the Official Period Act, with the argument that some objections had.
On the same 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the United Nations (SCJN) resolved the Constitutional controversy promoting the local legislative power and qualified as “invalid and illegal” the vote of the State mandate to the constitutional reforms, although he had no right to "sancel them or to pursue them".
Interviewed about the possibility of the vote by vote, Mary of the Llanderal Angels expressed that thanks to the approval of the relevant lines by the General Council of IEM will be possible to carry out partial and total votes by the local election body.
Thus, the partial census of votes, of one or more election packages, may be given in the case that: the results of the acts are not matched; there is no scrutiny act and compromise in the sender of the box or not open in the power of the Chairman; or, if there are clear errors or modifications of the acts.
Furthermore, the total census of the vote received in all cases of the election may be carried out when there is indication that the difference between the presumed candidate of the election to be treated and who has obtained the second place in the vote is equal or less than a percentage point; while and when the meeting is opened, the express request of the representative of the party and/or coalition requested by the second candidate.
The total census of the vote may also be carried out if, when the ordinary commitment is completed, the difference between the candidate presumably winned and the second place is equal or less than a percentual point, when and when the express request of the representative of the political party whose candidate was left in second place, where the electoral packages that have been subject to partial census will be excluded.
It should be noted that, in that situation, Morelia is elected, where, in accordance with the PREP, the difference between the first and the second place is only 0.16 per cent, although not accounting for the votes of 129 of the 923 total acts.
It's his first time out. Tell him to turn his damn radio off.

Wednesday, the new Italian government will be formed
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will be meeting tomorrow with the President of Italy to submit the new government to face a crisis that has put to that country on the border of the economic disaster.
The named Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet the Sunday with the President of Italy to submit the new government that will face a crisis that has been put to Italy on the border of the economic disaster and has risen all the euro area.
A communication from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will be gathered with the President, Jorgio Napolitano, to confirm that it could form a government.
A office is expected to be presented by technocrats in its majority, although it is not clear when the duty of the new executive will be assigned.
Monti said he would present the President the result of his discussions with political parties in his intention to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the capacity of our country to overcome this difficult stage," said the former European Commissioner to journalists.
Monti did not expressly say that it could form a government but the ton of its comments indicated that obstacles have been overcome.
The "mark is now well delineed", added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, while Italy fights a political and financial crisis that has stimulated its debt costs at unstable levels.
The new administration directed by the former European Commissioner Monti must adopt a hard scope of austerity required by European leaders to restore the shocked confidence in Italy.
Sublineing the pressure on Monteri to be delay, the instability of the markets put the performance of the Italian goods BTP 10 years older than 7 percent, the level in which Greece and Ireland were forced to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian leader Confindustria, said to the press after meeting Monti, "We said we would support this government very much."
We believe that this government is the last opportunity that Italy will be out of this emergency situation.
Monte's success opportunities were significantly stimulated by the support of the Silvio Berlusconi PDL Party, whom the crisis forced to dimit the Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are intended to have a good result", said the press Angelino Alfano, secretariat of the Central Party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is significant because, even now, many of its members had opposed the Government of the technological majority that is forming Monte.
Parliamentary Support
The new Government of Monti must have strong Parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpleasant reforms of austerity.
Any block or delay in its efforts could cause a new and devastating attack of the financial markets.
The Italian organization of foreign banks was joined to the pressure by warning that a failure of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti started Monday its consultations with political, trade groups and with youth organizations and women.
He will end his meeting tour on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed Sunday by Napolitano, which has enabled extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a short breath at the end of the last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi's dimitry, the costs of Italian debt have now returned to critical levels between the uncertainty about whether the new minister will have success.
Saving Italy with a public debt of 1.8 billion euros would be too much for the current financial defence of the euro area.
Monti said that his government should take the next elections, expected for 2013, despite the generalized predictions on the only time to implement the reforms before the elections.
Monti said he would like to include political offices, but the major parties insist that it should be formed only by technical, a indication of their repairs to a financial pressure process.
Political sources pointed out that mutual disregards and disagreements among the parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The rock of the Spanish is higher than the twins
Of the 22 smokers called Spain, ten are the 50 international games.
From Costa Rica only one of the 22 guests came to the 50 meetings.
A major contrast to Costa Rica, compared to the 22 calls by both countries for the friendship of today at 3:05 p.m. in the National Stadium of San José.
While World and Europe's camps, one of the monthly FIFA's brands, account for a wide record of interselations of class A, Tricolor has only the defender Michael Humannie as the only 50 international games.
This figure reached the past Wednesday at the Panama Party (0-2), in the Rommel Fernández.
Spain footballists playing in the Liga of the Stars and in powerful clubs of the Premier Liga of England hold a intense activity in household campions and household cops, and high-level choques in European cocks like Champions League.
Previous experience with the Spanish Furia is summarised in complex eliminations from Eurocopa and the World of Futball.
In contrast, Titican smokers have a limited international face in a area such as Concacaf, which is considered the lower level within the FIFA.
We see the maximum registration of the Spanish Selection is the Archer Íker Casinos, whose previous Saturday before England (case 0-1 in London) was equal to the record of the exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today before the Tricolor and put a new record for Spain of 127 internationalities.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona's brain flight, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi, including, were recognized the previous week by the EUFA together with the other hundreds of the Iberic team, the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the Schalke's arriete, Raúl González, with 102.
Nearly hundreds of people are Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
They follow him Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fabregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
From the Ticket side, and near Michael Humanña, they are the left side of Junior Díaz, with 48 presences and the artist Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five were over the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazola (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller appears with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The remaining is not about 20 hours.
While Aftero Moreal has only four games and Jord Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolivar only has one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson are not debugging.
The historical Golector of Spain is David Villa, with 50 dianes, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
By Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the register of more than nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Fifty-five included the country in the celebration of two decades of trayectory
"Go to Costa Rica is a dream realized."
In an exclusive interview with Viva, the Bad Jeff Ament, from Pearl Jam, said that the band is listed to offer one of its best conciers on Sunday in the National Stadium.
They have been more than 20 years waiting, but the band ensures that for them also will actually become the dream of touching in the country.
Thus the founder and founder Jeff Ament, who talked exclusively to Viva, from Brazil, the last week.
The grouping is located in the South America area of its work tour of two decades, and the Sunday 20 will make its only scale in Central America.
That day will be presented at the National Stadium, from 7:30 p.m. along with the angels The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is a extract of the conversation, whose complete translation is in the La Nation on the Internet.
For his costarricens followers, is a real dream that Pearl Jam goes to touch in Costa Rica, are you aware of what you're living in your fans?
Go to Costa Rica is a dream realized for us too.
This is only our second time in South and Central America and until now it has been great.
I've been in Costa Rica only once and a vacation; it's a so beautiful country and I think we'll be able to stay there a few days.
So it's fun to bring our music there.
I ask it because there is a species of dedication towards the band, the fans live intensely in the previous days.
What do you say to your most fertile followers?
Thank you for staying on our side over all these years.
He took us almost 21 years to Costa Rica; thanks for waiting so much and we regret that he took us so much time to reach it.
Some even refer to their conciert as the biggest show of the year.
Does this add some pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we have touched during the last 21 years have occurred during the last couple of weeks.
We touched a couple of gigantic shows in Sao Paulo and hoped that this has set us in the form for this conciert in Costa Rica.
Indeed, we're very excited to touch there.
We love that country, we love overfire and jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is among the best ones of the world.
How did they discover Costa Rica and their oils to surfect?
We have a lot of friends that are surfectors and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the holes there are amazing.
My friends were always going to overcome Costa Rica and Nicaragua, together with Mexico, are great places to surfey; so it was how we knew, through people who love the surf.
When you see the tour, they have come to deliver huge shows with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never touched there before, then we have no restriction on what we can do.
We'll try to give the best show possible with a good variety of songs; we'll try to touch a couple of songs of each album and give them to our fans a good and different repertorio.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What should this be?
I think it's partly because we have nine disks and we can play more than 120 songs and each one likes different songs, so it's hard to choose what songs to play each night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we have not touched, it keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because he remembers the reasons why we liked these songs and that we could have forgotten us.
That makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think that it is also more interesting for people.
With this turn, they celebrate 20 years of trayectory.
When you look back, is it difficult to believe everything they have done?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I think no one of us is imagined that we're in a large rock band and have done it for more than 20 years that looks like a dream.
We continue to account of our blessings and we are very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all want and love to create music.
We're lucky to go to the places of the world to whom we always want to go.
The things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean for you that it was the fundamental part of the grunge appearance?
It has always been a honour to be part of that group of big groups.
We are very friends of the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's surprising when a move appears from a group of friends and it's a little common.
Of course, a band of a city is coming, but it is much more strange when five or ten bands go to the same time of a city.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
We still touched some of them once.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden in his tour, so we are happy to be friends of all of them still and to be part of the sound of Seattle.
It's also very strange that a band as you keep together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us are together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which is, alone, much more time than many bands.
First, I think that we are all lucky to stay with life and, secondly, all of us are worried about others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to this, also have opened musical adventures that gives them free to each one to experience.
We trust each other with the music of each one and couldn't be better.
The relationship of you with the famous word has not been simple, but thanks to your success, you have been able to do what they want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier to find a balance.
We assure that it's not too round because it's easy to fall in that game of the great multitudes and people who love your music.
While one remembers that people are there for music, you remember that you have to respect the music and what I brought her, without being famous and being a rock star, something that is really interested in no one of us.
How do you remember your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we've written very good songs and at the beginning was something great.
We were a band for almost three years and we never published a disk until Andy died.
There were many frustrations because he was so long and the most important thing is that we are still very friends of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a photo thinking in the amazing person that Andy was and how I had to ride, it was always a joy to go working, ridiculous, talking about music and futbol and much more.
It was a surprising human being and we strange it.
The national band Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Are you sure you know your work, especially Eddie Vedder, and why did you choose it for opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with several proposals, and that was the band that most liked us, so we are grateful to see what Las Robertas can offer in life and must be very comforted.
Why do you always change Yellow Ledbetter's letter in life?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He's sing her and I think he's doing it with the first thing that happens to him.
Like bajist, what are their influences?
It's too many.
In the first ones that happen to me are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
They're so much that I could talk all night about the bajists I like.
How did Pearl Jam maintain relevant grunge, despite being no longer a mode?
I think we all always feel a little unconnected from the grunge word.
When I think about it, I remember the bands I mentioned before, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those who have occurred at the same time, and, if there's a relevance now, I think it's something wonderful because it's the music that worth listening and bands like Mudhoney are doing now better music than ever.
First, your music had a darkest content and now has become more positive.
What should this change be done?
It's interesting because I think there's a couple of songs in the new album that may seem more liviane, but there are also songs, such as The End or Just Breathe who qualify as dark songs, although they can sound a little bit positive.
With both, when Ed touched them, I cry when I heard them and they are deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow and there's some trauma in your life and you're losing a family or a friend, these things start to influence your art and your music and these two songs, without doubt, represent that for me.
Also, I think that it can be a happy person and still be able to make music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is re-interrupted for medical examinations
The former President Alberto Fujimori was entered on Monday in a public hospital to be evaluated by the loss of muscular force presented in the feet, informed his head-doctor.
Fujimori, of 72 years of age, who complies with a sentence of 25 years of prison for violations of human rights during its Government (1990-2000), suffers a number of pains, including a cancer in the language for which he has been operated four times and maintained under control.
The Congressist Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, said to the TV N Canal that Fujimori will be evaluated during three decades in the National Institute of Neoplastic Nurses to determine the cause of pain and the loss of strength of his lower members.
Aguinaga commented that, in his view, Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of the indulgence for humanitarian reasons, however, said that he did not want it because it was unfair.
He was operated four times to cancer to the language, has a weight loss of 18 kilograms to which other pathologies have been reached, such as severe erosiva gastronomis, the cute of the pneumonia, the renal calculations, the arterial hypertension and the circulation problems in the feet, encountered the doctor.
Fujimori is completed since September 2007 in the National Police Special Operations Division.
In April 2009, 25 years of prison was sentenced for death of 25 persons in hands of an army shipping officer who operated in the first years of his government.
Music travels to Mexico to strengthen political lazos
An official committee, entitled by President Uruguay, José Mujica, and integrated by several ministers and entrepreneurs, will start this March visit to Mexico in order to extend trade between both nations and address political issues in the region.
Muchica will be gathered next Monday with her by Mexico, Felipe Calderon, a higher point of a broader agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the collective of uruguay residents in Mexico, according to the Uruguay Presidency agenda.
The meeting between two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "perceived for the exchange of information in all the political matters between the two nations", says the President of the South America country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would try to support Uruguay in the incident with France when the French mandate Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country in a list of fiscal paradise, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy moved to exclude the international community to those countries that remain a fiscal paradise, a statement that caused the rejection of Uruguay and the call to consult his embassy in the European country.
Mexico has been chaired since November by the G20, a group integrated by the most powerful and developed countries in the world, and has a convention with the South American country, since January of this year, to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguay Government has tried to strive to establish fiscal exchange agreements in order to conclude the "green list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OCDE), which was formed by countries that have not implemented all international fiscal cooperation standards.
In the commercial, Mexico and Uruguay have been a free trade treaty (TLC) which has increased the exchange of goods between both nations since 2004.
The large source is the three sizes of "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario struggled, incansable, over 25 years by saving Prince Peach from the castle of Bowser, but he never had done it in three sizes: "Super Mario 3D Land" will fight for the love of the girl in estreoscope technology.
The title, which arrives this month to the shops of all the world, has been designed from a principle to use the features of the Nintendo 3DS portal console, which allows to play in three sizes without need to use dates.
"Mari is the character that you have to say how to operate the stereoscopia without darks," said Nintendo's specialized printer in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game of Nintendo originally thought for that support" because until now successes as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were existing title adjustments.
Nintendo's portfolio has supported that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and fluid game.
Alvarez has stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games on one: the first part is "single" to engage the less job users.
Once overcome, the most experts can give a "second back" to the levels of games, which presents the more difficulty.
Furthermore, users can choose in real time between a "agressive D" or one who is only affected by the depth of action, but will be necessary to play in three sizes so that they can overcome the different challenges and "not sustain optical illusions".
This super Mario incursion in the three sizes also provides the turn of the character to a portable console, since it was not produced since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo makes guides to the followers of the saga and repeats the formula of the success of the previous delivery, consuming that the source of the bigot will need to run mine-risk platforms in order to release Prince Peach.
While the player will find news in movements, environments, disorders and enemies, and also a Luigi "jogable".
Colum opens the extradition from Portillo to United States
The President Alberto Colom announced this March that it was transmitted to the extradition of the ex-governant Alfonso Porillo to respond in the United States for the conspiration for the lavage of $70 million.
That ends the process that Guatemala would respond to the request of the northern country that he claimed to Portillo to judge it there.
In press conference, Colom stated that his decision obeyed the independence of judicial and executive powers, taking into account that a court of sentence had already ordered extradition.
He warned that during his mandate "not put the hands" in judicial resolutions and transmitted all extraditions that he had known.
Besides Portillo, they will be extracted Sergio Ruano Maroquin, for serious murder and injuries, and Edgar Morales Street and Victor Street Paredes, both by drug drugs.
This was made by Colombia is an executive tramit after the extent of all the judicial and constitutional instances to process the employer between 2000 and 2004.
In accordance with the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Court of Constitution (CC), Porillo should be extracted once its legal situation has been solved in Guatemala and its human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was absolved by Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence when he was President, which was the process before extradition, but the Public Minister appealed and reacted the case.
Trinijove has helped 6.000 young people in risk situation
The entity was born to avoid falling in the marginality of children without training
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social support entity is important: 6.000 young people in risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation throughout this fourth century.
This is added to hundreds of jobs currently achieved for this social group.
The birthday served yesterday to balance in an act celebrated in the former Fabra i Coats factory complex that attended more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella barrier in 1986 in order to help young people with little training, without work, with problems of dogling or in a position to fall in marginality.
The yesterday in Sant Andreu focused on a large number of entities and institutions who have cooperated with the association in these 25 years.
The varied political representation, in full-electoral time, showed the unilateral nature of the work carried out by Trinijove.
With the President of Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jord Pujol, the Socialist Education Adviser, Ernest Maragall, and the extensive and current ecosocialist concepter Ricard Gomá.
They also accompanied the current conseller of Benestar Social i Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of the Social Work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
But he stated that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the present is also, but he added that the work done until now "is a good basis".
The President put Trinijove as an example to know how to fight the bad circumstances and to give hope to people with difficulties.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work that works", said.
Unfortunately a swimming end where macrofests were done
The invaders had fallen 11 of the 13 floors of the building in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the end the average of yesterday without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the neighbors of the 51th Balmes Street have arrived at the end.
Twelve people left the midday of yesterday volunteerly the immobile that were illegally occupated, and where they organized macrofests that desired the neighbourhood, judicially and without a police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the door circle was changed to prevent the situation again.
"There will be a access control from now", stated the Administrator.
The leaps, which had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are inhabited - the whole electrical installation and the part of the water, in addition to drawing the walls and leaveing residues of all kinds of alcoholic drinks.
The first three floors were the scenario of the multitudinary festivals, which duration up to two days and desperate inquilinous.
On the side of the building there is a disk, Balmes 51, which has also been seen injured.
His owners, Maria Pantinat explained Europe Press that since the building was occupied, the business has decreased 80%.
The disco owner points out that the invaders of the finca were unfairly competence, as they sold the coffees to three euros, while the disco is 10.
In addition, the propietary of the ocio local had to respond to neighbouring complaints, while, as it pointed out, molesties did not cause them to the customers of the discoteca, but the people of the busy house and, above all, assistants to the celebrations that were organized there, who had increased their frequency and intensity in the last few weeks, according to the neighbored neighbors of the area.
The responsibilities of the disco explained that the moles were so great that even arrived to an agreement with the immovible owner and that it was nine months ago that "I'm forgiving" the lounger.
The Urbana Watch also confirmed that during the last few weeks more neighbouring complaints had been received.
The president of the PP municipality group in the homening, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had requested the past week "immediately disappoint the immobile to end with the problems of convivality and citizenship that produce neighbourhoods, as well as the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only a plant of the busy building, but during the last months the oceans had been entering into all the plants of the building and almost all the floors, and that in some cases even robs were produced.
In this sense, he added that "is necessary to end with impunity and to be consentable to the incisive that has been generated in the end".
Also last night, the Mossos desaconed a building in Nou Barris.
At 15.30 p.m. the police was addressed to 35 of the Montral Street, after receiving the call of a neighbor who had observed that four people had accessed to the building.
The four were arrested at the time.
Park or mountain?
Architects correspond to the opportunity of the convocatory beyond Polymics on honorarys
The municipal competition on 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the early 80s, in full support of the already extensive Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this administration printed some Collserola's promoting packages.
The floor defined the mountain as the large park of the metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, it was composed of a comparison, in figures, with the Central Neoyorquino Park.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park returned, in the imagination of many, such as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that are not directioned in the north-sud edge but above (montaña) - Bayjo (Mar).
Collserola's qualification as natural park revolves in this idea.
The reference was not already Central Park but Yellowstone, with the jabalians on the role of Yogi hill.
This was until, September, the assembly called a mega competition composed of 16 concours for other so many access to Collserola.
A door gets to the park idea, without doubt.
Or that or someone wants to put the doors to the field.
The question is only: Collserola, park or mountain?
The competitor, both for its seatly organized, as well as for reflection on the city, is the theme of conversation between all the barcellone architects.
There is almost a recurrent topic to escape when two members of this old castle of elections are recognised in an ascensor.
And this fact is just one of the few matches between what three barcellones architects, and university teachers, which have been presented.
Michael Roldán, Daniel Mòdol and Marta Bayona: the competition is appropriate.
For Rolandan, after addressing the "related front" front, it is necessary to discuss "by the front of the mountain", while the talk of Ildefons Cerdá, the green balls, has not been carried out.
"It's out of the basis that Barcelona's most extensive park is the beach.
Among other things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," Urges the architect for whom the title of "Collserola ports" covers a "lexic tramp": there is no need to think about them "as access to a park, but the delimitation of areas where to act".
Moodol, as Roldán and Bayona experienced in the urban world, calculates the proposal for "Intelligence Network" with "also dangerous".
Peligers resulting from the "it is today designing public space" after the experience living in the 80s and that was in the Forum's "Chine's song".
The first fear is the delimitation of borders where it can be built.
"Restricted something is to fix the next step," i.e., its overpass.
"I need to think in new urban instruments, of planning, because the current [in reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)] may be able to give a real disaster."
More enthusiasmed to the question, Modol thinks that, simply simply, the right vallesana of Collserola "this can be understood as a park, Barcelona, no," for a merly topographic question.
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Collserola Patrone that “not must fall in a wheel,” although thanks the opportunity that the assembly offers its grace to intervene in this project "for the first time".
And further, I understand that the neighborhood of the mountain with the city is the safe conduct that allows the architects to enter the debate, but "due" about whether this technical profile is that should lead multidisciplinary equipment ("total a skin", point) which have had to be created: "The architectes should be only one tool".
Bayona understood that the answer to the question that has been given to this piece is complex, because on the basis of the concours there is no global vision of Collserola: "16 cross-border concours have been convoked in the sense of mountain-mare, but there is no long reading, which sees and understands the area in its entire area."
This results at least in its case, which has chosen to participate in the 16 concours.
On the other hand, a project for one of the doors can be shocked in program and defined with the architecture of the door on the side.
In its view, that is, the board should ensure that the shipping should immediately exceed the Dalt Round should preserve, in all its extension, a equipment area that would make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrazábal and will get free
After 72 days of slaughter, the law endorsed by the Red Casino authorized the forgiveness to the brother of the Monterrey's slaughter of the process that follows him by chatants
After staying 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrazábal will be freed after the legal supported by the Casino Red gave him forgiveness to the Judge Second Criminal of District, which continues to be a process of chasing against the brother of the Alcalde of Monterrey.
After the attention to the Casino Royale, the owner of the Red Casino, Sergio Gil García, made a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás presumably requested the payment of an economic share in the region to allow the clandestinian operation of the house.
After the public complaint, the State Prosecutor opened a criminal process against the panist alcalde brother and on 2 September was arrested and raised for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Ministry Agency 3 to Family Delits, it was transferred to the Arraigo House 1, located in the Ancient Capital Barrier of the State capital.
In that place, he remained in the 49 days following the statement of a second shocking order after the official of the Public Ministry to defeat the organized cohesion and crime crimes.
On October 19, Cadereyta was presumably transferred by chasing with a million and medium weight to the owners of the Red Casino; however, only a few hours remained in the median security reclusor since there were death threats in its opposition.
The authorities allowed him to follow the internal judgment in the municipal cells of San Nicolás of the Garza.
On 25 October, the secretariat of the Second Criminal Court Jorge Yánez, who said that almost two months of notices were tested sufficient evidence to determine the culpability of Jonas, such as the cover of 1.5 million weight to the representatives of the house of appeal to allow the operation of Jonah.
This Monday, the legally supported by Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gómez, acknowledged the Judge José Luis Pecina to ask for forgiveness for the brother of the region; so in the next hour, he could restore his freedom.
During the legal diligence, the officer of the Public Minister accepted to the Judge Ramiro Arias asked Garcia Gómez whether he had been reparated the damage and who of the partners of the house of a complaint was that he granted for forgiveness, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
Based on the 197/2011 issuer, the legal forgivement of Jonas Larrazábal is granted, and in the following case, no complaint can be submitted around the process that has been followed; otherwise, it shall not be required for damage or punishment.
After listening to the legally supported house, near 15:50 was ordered the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Bretton.
The secretariat of the Judge, Jorge Yánez, was transferred to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás of the Garza to report to Jonah that he has been legally forgiven and his poster will be archived.
He will also notify the order of immediate freedom issued by the judge.
Dionisio Pérez Yacome gives details of the air accident where he lost life the Gobernation secretariat, Francisco Blake, and seven more people
The Secretariat of Communications and Transports (SCT) informed that the results of the accident in which the Gobernation secretariat, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven more people, indicate that helicopter had been directly influenced on the ground in full structural integrity, without that the pilot could try a forced earthquake.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Yacome, secretariat of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before the aircraft was released, the pilot found that climate conditions were appropriate to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the asps had contact with trees to 25 meters where the unit lost the fire."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, so that it had the requirements required to transport staff.
He also said that the appearance of pieces on the ground was not reported in investigations carried out in the impact area.
"In a search is reported that there are no parts or components of the ship on the other hand, the impact was presented in structural form.
"The helicopter design was for 19 passengers, with appropriate requirements to transport passengers.
The terrain presents a seven degrees of inclination at 30 degrees.
At the time, the secretariat assured that it was a priority to account for the results possible, but research may take several months, even for a year.
By its part, Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Airports and Auxiliaries Services, assured that at the time of the impact, the Helicopter of the President-President State operated in cruise speed and that this occurred in a slow-spot field.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of the impact," said.
In the press conference, Pérez Yacome's holder, held six relevant elements in the research:
Visual flight:
In accordance with the air standardity, the flight was performed under the visual flight rules, this means that tripulation must be visibility during the flight and the ground.
Meteorological conditions:
The AICM reports placed appropriate conditions for the deployment, in accordance with the progress of the aircraft towards the border area between the DF and the Mexico State.
Selected routes:
It is likely that tripulation has been searching for a lower higher area and higher visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of the impact.
The impact coordinates and the last record of the radar aircraft match, probably before the impact had no control loss or change in the flight tractory.
Dispersion of the rest of the aircraft in a reduced zone:
The information available is allowed to suggest that the impact occurred in a right and side trayectory.
The aircraft dispersion pattern allows to suggest that helicopter has been influenced on the ground in structural integrity conditions.
No evidence of fire or explosion has been detected:
There are still evidence on the rest of the ship of some type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that they could have had multiple contacts with the field.
During field works, aircraft pieces have been found to a higher of 9000 200 feet above the average sea level, the land presents a decline that goes from the seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
Photographs show the sequence in which it was predictablely discarded along this recruitment.
The information provides elements that seem to indicate that helicopter could have had multiple effects on the ground.
After minucious search in a larger area than the agreed site, around the accident, there were no dispersive parts of the aircraft, which strengthens the pressure that the impact was presented in structural integrity conditions.
MSS advertising protocol to find obesity gene
The Social Safety guides a research to discover the gene of obesity in children and youth; is supported in IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Welfare (IMSS) announced that a research leaded to discover the gene of obesity in children and youth, called the Genetics of Child obesity and Adolescence Protocol, which will enable to contain overweight markers.
In a communication, the Chief of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemical Hospital of the National Medical Center of the 21th century, Miguel Cruz López explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritional and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by experts and postgraduate students of the National Public Health Institute (INSP) and the Centre for Advanced Research and Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Political Institute (IPN).
In the research, it is invited to participate in the population or not in the right to enter into the sports units of the IMSS in the Mexican Valley, where the tests are carried out to the minors, all Saturdays from 8:00 p.m.
He highlighted that the protocol was started in the Sports Unit Quauhtemoc (Penente State of Mexico) and that since October 8, the activity was carried out in the Nezahualkoyolt Sport Unit (Occidental Mexican State).
As a result of the goal of meeting at 500 or 600 young ones, the study will continue to be in the Deportation Unit (South of the Federal Division) and finally in the Morelos Deport Unit (on the north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and the importance of genetics in development of obesity and to identify in children and young mexican risk factors to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
By celebrating this November the World Day of the Diabetes, the aim was to meet three thousand children and youths between six and 14 years of age, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the implementation of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about the physical and previous physics of diseases, with a view to avoid risk factors that defeats such as diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He declared that Sabbaths are applied to all participants with anthropometric measurements (peso, tall, skin circle), taking arterial pressure, determination of glucose levels, triglycerides, colesterol and insulin and genetics (required to identify genes associated with child obesity).
Cruz López pointed out that this investigation obeyed the concern of health professionals by alarming weight increase in minors.
" Health surveys 1999 and 2006 indicated that in the case of children, 77 per cent in obesity, and 47 per cent of the girls, and overweight also has been observed, " the ISS specialist highlighted.
He stated that the justification for the search of trademarks is supported by the people of the country to decrease from others by their genetic history.
He informed that in the meantime, Mexico has 65 percent of American Indian heritage, 30 percent European and five percent African, and this condition reflects the genes associated with diabetes and excessive weight.
He explained that generally, the genetic of obesity is translated in the incapacity to burn the excess of energy that we consum (calories) and that it is stored in fat.
The investigator explained that the direct benefit for participants is the integral assessment of children, which allows to detect whether they represent some level of overweight or obesity.
Indeed, he said, the presence of dark color rings (acantosis) in hair and prebruit, which indicate the probability that there are metabolic changes and even prediabetes.
The information is conducted in confidential way, the doctors provide it in writing to parents, to which each of the measurements and changes in the lifestyle should be explained in order to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity, and other chronic losses: the sedentarism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, remain the majority of the day sit before the television and use transport means instead of slow distances.
It should also be the high caloric instant, i.e. the largest consumption of sugar drinks, carbohydrates (tamals, pane, pizza, hamburguesa, etc.) with high content in fat and protein and the genetic analysis in this protocol.
UNAM asfalt would avoid bags
Rafael Herrera, researcher of the UNAM Chemistry Faculty, develop asfalts modified with polymers to produce a better performance mixture, independent of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signs sent to the floor were expected, it would not be necessary to repair about 200 thousand rainways in the Metropolitan Zone of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher of the UNAM (FQ) Chemical Faculty (FQ), who ensured that if the construction and maintenance process of a asphaltic floor is appropriate, the baths could be reduced in quantity or even fully removed.
In its conference, a technological view of the bags, dicted in the framework of the International Chemical Year, said that the laboratory to its cart developed asfalts with polymers to produce a mixture with similar characteristics to the asfalt, but with a greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Mrs. Nájera suggested that this type of modified asfalts could be used in places where the climate is extremely warm, such as some northern cities of the country, to improve their performance and therefore the training of bags.
He explained that the asfalt, the most weighty part of the oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, one of the molecular weight called asfaltens, and other of low molecule weight, called maltenos, which together gives it to the floor their visional behavior.
The asfalt viscosual behavior is that at high temperatures around 180 degrees, it is conducted as a liquid, 120 degrees centigrated its viscosity is very high and 50 degrees of centigrated is almost solid, while at very low temperatures, the asfalt returned to slowness, added.
The previous means that in the streets the resistance of asfalt is not uniform, but that it is changed during the day in accordance with the environmental and temperature conditions, the specialist advertised in chemical engineering.
FQ investigator noted that the streets of the City of Mexico in its majority are covered by flexible paviment, which consists of six pieces of materials, of which the last three are involved in the asfalt.
Among the most superficial edges, the asfaltic folder is complemented by small stones swimming in asfalt and then compacted.
Each of the stones that represents the folder, pointed out, is bathed with asfalt.
By transiting vehicles and generating efforts, this allows the forces to spread well on the floor.
If it was treated with modified asfalt, it would still be better wide, he thought the chemical engineer.
On the asphaltic folder, it is a latest box called round folder, which is made from a stone material until, i.e., a sand that is also swimming in asfalt.
As this is the shoe that will be in contact with the slanders of the vehicles, you must have more mechanical strength than the asfaltic folder and provide friction on the path.
When it is part of the floor that will receive and disseminate the efforts, the round folder requires also to have the appropriate edge and should be careful of the material that it is done.
The climate, especially the humidity and temperature variations, is also a very important factor to consider, in particular water, because it has significantly affected the performance of the asphaltic folder.
When the land is humbled, the water is divided inside the folder, and it is difficult to get out, this happens to reboot all the floor of the floor and therefore, the training of bags.
In the training process of a bache, he said, the first in disgaining is the shifting movie and only later is affected by the asphaltic folder, but the damage does not happen immediately, but it is a process that should be attracted to the first signals with appropriate maintenance programmes.
The member of the National Research System also explained that vehicular burden is another important factor in the training of baths, and therefore the speed of each of the floor should always be in relation to the vehicle load and ensure that it is complied, to avoid shaping bags frequently.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to investigate and work on asfalt, for example, asfaltic emulsions, that in other countries are already included in the market and enabled to repair bags with facility and without need to use high temperatures.
What did you talk to the Chairman of the Valle to be the new colleague?
Analysis of the factors that caused Melina Ramírez Serna not reached the colony of Madam Columbia.
The Valle receives his title number 14 of Princess.
Once again, the Cauca Valley remains with the winnings of the colony of Madam Columbia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to comply with being in the podium of winners, light the plate coron and the band that believed it as a new princess of Colombia.
With the result of the last night in Cartagena, where the Atlantic Mrs. Atlantic came with the coron and cetro, the department was already 14 titles of Princesa and Melina, the legitimate of vallecacan women who had been near the coron, but who were proclaimers among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domingguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Lea Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuel Pinedo (1990), Romano Diana Isabelo (1993), Lorena Aljudale Aljudale (1993), Rosa Al-Gartalenalenale (1983), Olga Alfalena (Stephan).
Today, the great question that many are doing is what he said?
Because the result represents the derogation of a great favorite that showed in each presentation that she had everything to be the new colleague, not in vano, was elected King of the Police and Major Rostro Jolie de Vogue, titles that were obtained Kingdoms such as Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who took the colony of Mrs. Colombia.
The first factor that is considered to be key in the decision that he took the jury to appoint her First Prince, in which he did not agree with his answer to the question "What is the book that has marked you to and why? Written by Martín Murillo Gómez, from the Literarian Charter We read.
The questionnaire answered:
"Let much, I think enough in literature, I think it's a way to culturate, I definitely think that the book that marked me of childhood is "The Principal," is a very deep book.
Today I read "Create and punishment" is a universal literature book that we should all read; and today I'm reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called "The Ardor of the Blood".
An answer that was little enjoyed first by the term "culturalize" and second to not explain in specific way how each of the books quoted it.
But when finishing the ceremony, Melina expressed himself quiet and happy with the result "the universe is wise pass what needs to happen.
And for all people, please read a little, "The principle" is a great book."
Among the launched hypothesis it says that Valle slaughtered the favoriteism.
A Bogotán journalist instructed that, when being the favorite, ovasionate and the candidate that was carried out all the prior prizes (Oster's gastronomy network, vote of the public by the best artsal dress, and Reina Madre), "he discovered the goals of the other candidates, stressed the Queen, and therefore he did not shine in the scenario".
And that was noted in his first presentation in bathroom on the Hilton Beach and his two disfiles on the coronation velvet.
Despite both safe lighting, it was noted that the force and emphasis of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic showed themselves.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the RCN Canal, found that the fact that Melina was appointed to Princess "is confirmed that the candidate that more prizes wins during the competition is not as a king."
Furthermore, Valle was shown to the last very swimming press, and there was a fair.
Another chance is that Valle has not able to convince the jury about his interest in social work, which is lastly the essence of the National Beauty Concourse.
For some, two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty showed that they were looking for a woman compromised with the social needs of their parents.
"The only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, it must be watched but beyond the physical and focus on its social sensitivity, which is before the Concours is already involved in projects", explained.
It is also sponsored that Valle had been singing for his defects in the dry and fibrosis that it was noted in its sweet, but it resulted in contradictory since the jury exactly elected it as the 'Charlie' candidate with the most healthy body, good food and responsible physical work.
The king's preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina had no best body, "but her fibrosis problem in the abdomen, that the truth for me was not very well-known, slowed points in the last day."
Among the journalist Guido Hoyos, the Kromos magazine considers that the error of the vallecacacan was the surgical interventions practitioned.
"Creatives are good, but Valle doesn't have to do them.
His body was never his strong, and here they were covered."
For this prize, which first delivers the National Beauty Concourse, after the bathroom defilement occurred a cruel vaccine that was fulfilled last night, because it was said that this was the content that Raymundo gave him to Melina to don't give him the favor of the coron.
Reality or not, it is true that Melina has started a year of reign, not as sovereign, but as princess, the position that gives him the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international certificates for designation of the National Concourse.
However, she will pass to the story as one of the queens that, despite his roller step by Cartagena, he was elected the coron.
So was the work of the calendar identified the chain of Alfonso Cano
A Kali lofoscopist passed to the story like the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4, a CTI lofoscopist passed to the story as the man who confirmed the identification of the maximum leader of the Farcs: "Alfonso Cano", through the kitchen of his digital sheets.
From the seven lofoscoptors working in the CTI section, that week touched him the "acceptable" turn of Eliazar González, a man of Puerto Tejada who had 21 years of work in the judicial research area.
When he started his car, González worked in chocolate municipalities, where many times he had to enter over five days in the wild to reach the site where the chambers should be identified.
In 2000, it was transferred to the capital of the Valle, and after the relevant courses, it was specialized in lofoscopia, which is the study of the friction skin, i.e. the palms of the hands and feet.
The week of the operation against other Alfonso Cano to Eliazar warned him to take the minimum clothes for three days.
I was waiting for her.
On Wednesday night he went to the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two chairs and was suspected that one of them was the man who led to the oldest guerrilla in the world, so they asked him to take the decade card of Guillermo León Sáenz (her true name).
However, when the research team came to the site where the chain was found, he did not recognize it for its physical aspect, because it was very different from which he had seen in the media.
She was without barba, dressed as a campsite in the area, without hair and much more sweet.
But the legs don't lie.
Same with a galtonian forgot, tinta, a transplanter and a linner, Eliazar compared the daily prints of the chain with those of the card.
His eye failed: it was "Alfonso Cano".
On the same night, Puerto Tejada was the employee to confirm the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinçon, who was the largest leader of the Farcs.
Search for the hole
For a doctilescoptor of the site of Cali, the recognition made by President Juan Manuel Santos to Eliazar González, in the press route by the operation against Cano, is very significant.
Many people don't know our work.
Dactiloscopia is a precise science, without a mistake, which can become key in the crime resolution.
In addition to the identification of victims, the lofoscopists support investigations for crimes such as murder and murder, and confirm the identity of persons captured.
When they are captured, many criminals present false cedars or have no papers.
We take them the custom impression and search for them in the database.
The investigator said, in a case of shooting, he touched him to remove a piece of wall of a house, as the ladder had supported his hand to get a strong box full of joyas and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to get a doctile impression, but in that case we could get the wheel of all the hand and identify the criminal who had participated in different cuts," remarked.
The sheets can also discard or reaffirm suspicion in cases of murder.
Shortly, they found a dead man, with licor bottles around him.
The investigation was determined that a family could be suspected of the crime and, in fact, a shop in the bottle matched.
Although this does not guarantee that the murderer has been, it is located in the scene of the crime.
A CTI doctilescopist explained that in the objects "hears are out with chemical or physical reactions".
When appearing, a transplanter or a skin is used to upload them.
After that, the presses are sent to Asif, which is the base of criminal data, or the Registration.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," said the CTI expert.
He explained that it is not all that is shown in the CSI television program.
So not all that shrinks is gold, not everything that touchs turns back.
However, if it is possible to be used, if the respective kitchen is performed.
The "indigens" challenged the authorities in New York
Centenies of protesters were shocked before the Zuccotti Beach for camping.
There was a large part of the rule of disappearance and was transferred to a nearby park.
The integrators of the Ocupa Wall Street movement disappointed this morning to New York's authorities when they tried to enter again, under a judicial order, to the beach of Manhattan from where they were dissolved of march and to employ another park of the Great Manzana.
Centenies of protesters were shocked in front of the Zuccotti Beach, where they wanted to access a judicial order that allows the "innocents" to go back to the place, while another part of the movement responded to the disappearing by employing a park more northern of the city, where there were new detentions.
"Our idea is that, if the court does not allow us to go back to the place, we're going to install in any other place and we'll continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through peaceful seats and manifestations", said one of the portals of the movement "Ocupa Wall Street", Mark Bray.
Bray described that the response of the "indigenous" to the disappearing of his campsite that was personally dicted by the hall of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts where the judge Lucy Billings issued a order that prohibited the forced evacuation of the place and allowed protesters to keep camps.
Furthermore, the "indigens" carried out to the occupation of a new park situated in the confluence of the Canal Street centres and the Sixth Avenida, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, New York and New Jersey, and property of the Trinity Church parroquia.
At least one hour were able to take the place, but then the police listened and tried to hold some of the protesters, although Bray could not confirm the specific number, while he assured Efe that he saw several journalists who were also elected.
The organization ensures that several hundreds of people have been installed at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already been moved to support the integrators of the movement and has tried to mediate the police.
Thus, the Züccotti Beach - which is a private ownership – continues to be closed at the expectation of the celebration of a judicial view for this same March, in which the legality of the evacuation of this matrix should be analyzed.
Some of the displaced protesters brought and repaired these hours copy of that judicial order, and even delivered them to the agents who stood the plague, which caused "also small faces," stated Bray, who announced that some officials promoted shocks to the protesters.
The court order prohibits the authorities to disappoint the members of Ocupa Wall Street or to apply "letters that were published after the starting of the occupation or to prohibit protesters to access the park again with shops or other properties that were previously used".
The Alcalde Bloomberg indicated to the press that, due to that judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of space to the public and the manifestants, which warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to be installed again with campaigns and beds.
The register personally defended the disappearance carried out in the Zuccotti Beach, a operation in which about 200 detentions were carried out and decided because the protesters were "weakened the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered to evacuate the place because it was converting to "in a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and, in some cases, to harm others", because "also some businesses have been threatened" and neighbors feared "for their quality of life".
"The disappearance of this mature was awesome and shows that in the Bloomberg fund it is more interested in maintaining the financial interests than those of the United States workers", added the movement port that accused the chariot of "flooring respect to freedom of expression".
The responsibilities of "Ocupa Wall Street" also indicated that they think to organize "great actions" for the juvenile in collaboration with Community and trade organizations to remind the two months of protesting, which started on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virginia Maria in a special television ship
With Michael Bublé and other Canadian highlights, it will appear in the television program "It's Russell Peters Christmas" on 1 December.
The Canadian Pamela Anderson has been the assistant of Tim Allen in "Home Improvement", supporter in "Baywatch", connected by "Playboy", the wife of the rock music Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virginia Maria in a special Christmas of Canadian TV.
The CTV private television channel announced today that Anderson, together with the "crooner" (baladista) Michael Bublé and other Canadian shooters, will appear in the TV program "It's Russell Peters Christmas" next December, giving life to a very special Virginia Maria.
CTV has now distributed pictures of the television program where Anderson, also known by the broad distribution on the Internet of a pornographic video where it appears together with his husband, the battery of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears to be dressed as Virginia Maria, supporting a munch that represents Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian conomist of Indian origin, who recently acted as a presentator in the “My Violent Torpedo of Truth” tour of Charlie Sheen, appears as José.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the special CTV shipping accounts with the Canadian Canadian songer Bublé, who was cast in Buenos Aires at the end of March with the argentian model Luisana Lopilato, and that is not strange to the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called "zora" to the United States Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan Renaissance after the earthquake
The GDP grows up to 1,5% thanks to the home consumption and ends the espiral of falls that started in March
Since March last, Japan's economy was paralyzed, yet convincing the earthquake devastator that comes to a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that the Nipon country had suffered from the II World War.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo have encrypted material losses in $300,000, a shock that, despite the difficult world context, seems to have been shocked.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, the date of the Bruto Interior Product was used to pass page, finally, that the GDP increased by 1,5% compared to the previous quarter and a 6% annualized rate.
The registered in the second quarter - for Japan, the fiscal year starts in March 2012 - also suggests the largest growth rate from January to March 2010.
The recovery is, in part, explained by the reputation of the purchase of machinery to restore the areas of seismo and after tsunami.
In fact, undertakings increased their investments in 1.1 per cent, compared to 0.9 per cent in capital expenditure that was observed from January to March, the first return after six months of uninterrupted shift.
However, the real reverse of Japanese economy is not only based on the keynesiaan impulse that invites to use the crisis to strengthen or rebuild - the infrastructures are used from the shortages to grow from zero.
Japan has, above all, discovered by the development of household consumption, which is currently 60% of the Japanese GDP.
This variable increased 1%, imposed by increased expenditure in vehicles, travels and swimming activities.
The estigma of yen
Tokio has been commanded to the internal market, when the yen - nipona currency - has become one of the "refugied values" chosen by investors who flee from the debt crisis in the euro area and the turbias predicts from the United States, a privilege that weighs as a loss in the exporting companies' accounts.
With a stronger division, products are more precious in the foreign, a serious relief for a country whose economic flow line is determined by the health of the major technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, touched their weak results between July and September to the quote of yen.
While the markets continue with their assignment to the EU's peripheral countries, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not reduce the guard.
"The risks that continue, such as the deterioration of some foreign economy, the impact of the inundations of Thailand and the rapidly appreciated yen," said the secretariat of the Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa last night.
And indeed, perspectives do not result in an alert.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OCDE) prescribed that most Member States had presented in September more demanding signs of economic ralentization.
The indicator that advanced inflation points in the global economy showed that the main powers are flowing.
Since he slowed four decades up to the 100.4 points, before the 100.8 August.
The euro area, including, was situated under the average, which is at the level 100 by slowing eight decades up to 99.13 points.
Athenas returns to feed the doubts
Papadimos says that the adjustments will be adopted, but the conservators will not sign any written commitment
With the shocked peripheral risks and the re-installed incertainty in the parks, Greece continues to engage in the laberinto that leads to the exit of the major debt crisis.
The sense that the “consensus” of the new German transition government is more imposed by the requirements of Brussels than by a real conviction of political forces starts to be confirmed with facts.
While the new minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the period of hundred days agreed in his appointment may be short to apply them, the leader of the New Democracy Party, Antonis Samaras, ensured that he would not support new astericity measures in any case and reiterate its demand for new elections for the date expected, February 19.
"The main task of this Government is to apply the decisions of the Summit of October 26," said Papadi, when we opened a Parliamentary debate, which will culminate tomorrow with a vote of trust in the new executive.
A package with 24 programmes to stimulate employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against fiscal evasion will be the first initiative.
However, the message of Samaras did not despite the doubts about his post: "We have committed to help the transitional government, but we have not compromised nothing more."
The conservator leader was a more far-reaching pass to the EU and the FMI, the bodies that should disbloke the 8.000 million Athene needing urgently, and clearly left that he would not give a good view to no adjustment letter.
But the European Commission, which was still chosen by the impact of the Papandreu referendum order, has reiterate last night that his demand is strong: he will not disbloke the aid if the new Government and leaders of the Greek large parties do not sign "a written compromise without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
The Economic Affairsport, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the troika inspectors will return to Athens to discuss with the new Government "what is needed to pay the sixth tramo" of 8.000 million, although there is no final date.
The Greek wood still has ice to rat.
Doña Sofia: "It's instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen emphasizes the place of Spain's "representative" regarding this type of funding
Spain "having reached a world-wide-prepresenting place in the role of the Microfinancing."
Reine Doña Sofia recalled last two decades that the country has become the second donor for this introduction of cooperation, whose "essence" stated that it was a "instrument for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for the whole humanity, based on confidence in human being".
The Queen inaugured yesterday the V World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that "no question" is that operations are " absolutely essential" to achieve the United Nations Millennium Goals with the hour of 2015, and, in particular, "in those who have the purpose of reducing the half of the people who live with lower income of a daily dollar, with the establishment of the "poorhood".
Spain "continues working" to extend the net of beneficiaries "to all the world's benefits, and takes this task with "responsibility", stated Doña Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions originating in the Summit, which will be extended until the juvenile, "garant the creation of new capacity and best opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women," major beneficiaries of these loans.
They are "more achieved successes" and "more the challenges to which we face".
The Mikrocredit Summit is present not only as a forum of debate, but also the platform from which to emphasize "the basic objectives".
Thus, its Majesty explained that at the end of 2015, 175 million families who have accessed these financial services and that hundreds of these homes were out of poverty in which they are summoned.
The impulse in the design of micro credits in Spain and the rest of the world "he has followed the sentence started for years as a pioneer form" by Muhammad Yunus, emphasized by Doña Sofia as a "act of justice and recognition due".
And it was that he described the father of this tool as a "excellent idealist in the universal cause of fight against poverty" whose work has been known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to know its loan policy.
A year later, the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as Costa de Marfil celebrated in Costa de Marfil in 1999, Canada, and "in all I could find the continued evolution", explained his Majesty, whose link with this project was worth the qualification of the "faming head" held in Valladolid by the "poor bag".
Finally, the Queen of Doña Sofia concluded its intervention by encouraging presents to participate in the debate and to find solutions to progress in combating poverty.
"Ethics"
The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is a ethical imperative" for all democratic states.
In this sense, I expressed that it would be an error to link cooperation with developing countries in times of economic goodness, since it is a "permanent obligation".
Jimenez considered that microcrediters are "a serious and strict policy dedicated to eradicating poverty", and now "more than ever" governments of developed countries should work under solidarity criteria and not allow this to be the victim of counterparts.
For Spain, the micro credit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
The International Cooperation Secretariat, Soraya Rodríguez, welcomed "the success" to give the people "excluding to those who all close the doors"; and the Alcalde of Valladolid, France Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the presents to a city that "opens their doors of the solidary spirit".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President for universal sufragio
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union Congress (CDU), on Monday 14 November, in Leipzig, has crossed great difficulties for Angela Merkel, Canciller and President of the Christian Democratic Party.
It was initially not included in the agenda, the future of Europe, but the topic was put in autumn, in particular to satisfy warriors who believe that government policy is currently too strict with Greek people and could be a future with Italians.
The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the direction, was practically adopted by unanimity.
From the 1,001 delegations, only nine votes were registered against and ten abstentions.
The standing was several minutes winned, with his interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schauble, the Eurofil Minister of Finance.
The key idea of the Canciller, and of the motion, is a subject: the response to the crisis is not less Europe, but more Europe.
It is not only because Europe has peace but also because "9 million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the Canciller, "it has reached the time to open the way in Europe."
This could be shown in amendments to the Lisbon Treaty to enhance the control of the European Union on the budgetary policies of the euro area, although it could also be able to deal with the election of the President of the European Commission by universal subfraction to "a face to Europe".
In any case, this is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the Congress, clearly the idea of Wolfgang Schauble.
Indeed, it is unlikely that the twenty-third arrives rapidly to a agreement on this radical change: Great Britain has been enemy before him and the CDU leaders seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy also.
But the ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, the delegations rejected the proposal to consider the weight of each country of the European Central Bank based on the weight of each economy, which would obviously strengthen the weight of Germany.
The Canciller's desire to calm the souls within his party, and has increased the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, it is not that he has tried to win its convention at the coast of the "picture" countries or countries in difficulties to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe dedicates a paragraph to the importance of "the French-alemana friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Safe of past.
Remembering that, two centuries ago, a bloody battle in Leipzig occurred.
Indeed, it was one of the most humilious derogations for the army of Napoleon.
The incidence of fraud in low diseases
After subsidies, the UMP and the Government are injured against low diseases.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday, 15 November, to visit a box responsible for family subsidies and to speak on the subject, which is already recurrent since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and helping.
Furthermore, to accompany such absent, which is part of the will to strictly swear, but still remembers an eye of the presidential campaign of right, most want to focus on low diseases.
First of all, to apply budgetary costs: the Government expects to impose the workers of the private sector a fourth day of deficit before he can cut down.
Finally, unless there is a specific company agreement, a sick worker would lose four days of payment, i.e., at least 15% of its monthly income.
This is a measure that could raise a wrath oil, but it would allow $280 million, according to the Echos.
Furthermore, it would be accompanied with a more symbolic scale: paying the officials a day of labour without repayment in case of low labour (for the time, they have no deficiency, against the three days applied in the private sector).
While these issues are discussed, most of them also put on the table on the subject of fraud, which is directed towards the abuse of low workers.
"It will be significantly increased the controls and, in addition, if someone does a fraud, the amounts must be repaid", warned Xavier Bertrand, speaking on Sunday 13 November in the RTL.
Like in other cases, the effects of the advertising seem slightly disproportionate for the reality of low workers fraud.
Indeed, since 2002, a constant follow-up of this issue has been carried out and have been launched various offensive policies that have normally produced fruit.
French people are not sick than in the rest of Europe.
Let us first observe national figures.
According to the French Social Safety Institute (CNAM) in 2006 more than EUR 237 million were assigned to low workers.
According to the French research and documentation Institute in health economy, low subsidies represented in 2008 5 per cent of the health costs, up to €1,3 million.
From this sum, 46% corresponds to low maternity and work accidents, while 54% are related to low illness, which is up to 6.200 million euros.
Consequently, 2.5 per cent of health expenditure.
In 2010, the Frenchs collected a average of 14.5 working days before 17.8 in 2009, according to a study of the Alma Consulting Group.
A media that, without doubt, hid devisions: another survey, published in 2007 by the Siria of Professional Management Monster.com, showed that 75 per cent of the 40,000 French surveys claimed that they had not seen or only one day of low illness.
Another study, in this case of disease, indicates that 37 per cent of low diseases had been less than 8 days, 22 per cent between 8 and 14 days, 15 per cent between 15 days and a month, 15 per cent between one and three months and 11 per cent were longer.
If we compare them with our European neighbors, French workers are not more propens than in other areas to cover low illness.
A long study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the overall lack of work (and for health and other reasons) was 10 to 11 per cent in France, against 20 per cent and 28 per cent in Denmark, a 15 per cent in the United Kingdom or between 16 per cent and 18 per cent in the Netherlands.
The fraud in low disease is not particularly significant in comparison with the non-declared work.
Fraud has a very limited scope.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has resulted in controlling low disease over 45 days.
In 2008, from 1.5 million inspections, CNAM confirmed, in 13 per cent of the 285,000 carried out, that short-term lows were "injustified or too long", namely 37.050 cases.
In the case of the lower than 45 days, subject to systematic inspections, 11 per cent of the cases were " adequately adjusted or unjustified; a number of which, having a total of 1,2 million income, is 132,000.
Consequently, a total of 169.000 "injustified" cases were reached between several million workers who had a low illness.
Uncertainly, a insignificant number compared, for example, with the work in black.
According to the Deputy of the Office of the Dominican Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent a loss of tax revenues between 9.000 and 15,000 million euro per year, i.e., more than the total costs of low-sized subsidies and, without doubt, significantly more than fraud in this area.
Papdens: Greece must apply a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to enhance its economy.
This is what he has declared on Monday 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papadeus before the Parliament; he also added that the hundreds of days that have been granted to his Government of Union would not be sufficient to achieve that goal.
"In order to make efforts to recover the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme", stated the Governing Chief, who expressed his first public debate during the debate on the vote of confidence to Parliament on Thursday.
The implementation of the decisions taken during the Euro area Summit on 27 October will be the "principal task" of the new Government, as the country is in game" remains in the euro area, has added.
Consequently, Papademous expected that public deficiency of the country would be reduced by about 9 per cent of GDP before the end of the year, after reaching 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
The right rejects new asterity measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right group, showed its support to the measures already adopted to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party will not be compromised with additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote for new measures," said during a meeting with the deputy of his "New Democracy".
He pointed out that it was in accordance with the deficit and debt reduction objectives, as well as the fight against derogation, but against any policy that prevents economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the FMI and the EU would not disbloke the loan of 8.000 million euros necessary without a written guarantee of support of all parties to measures, Antonio Samaras said that his word would be sufficient and that it would not be signed because of the external pressure.
A expert committee states that it should be legalized by Ethanese and the assisted self-assault
Canadians live rejecting death, as indicated in the report of the Real Society of Canada
In the field of paleary care, the Committee calls for Governments, health assistance institutions and doctors to cooperate in order to ensure the best paliative care, not only in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives rejecting death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians are ready to talk to their doctor about the conditions where they want to die and take provisions for that effect.
This is one of the conclusions of an indirect report of the Real Society of Canada, which has contained in the participation of six experts in various areas, including ethics, laws and doctors.
The Committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code in order to enable the assisted self-assault and Ethanese, when the patient is presented this option and has been judged to take the decision.
To begin, experts point out a recent survey of the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries in the world.
Despite the tenth place, the study states that "the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to treat the subject of death."
With medicine or not, 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to the experts selected by the Kingdom Society of Canada.
And despite the majority of Canadians want to die at home, 68.6 per cent of them have been missing in the hospital.
In general, the highest rate in this sense is registered by Quebec, where 86 per cent of the deaths are produced in the hospital.
As regards the delicate issue of Ethanese and the assisted suicide, the authors of the report have reached some conclusions that do not match the post of the Federal Government, which has already stated that they did not want to change the Criminal Code regarding Ethanese and the Assistant Suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or not a criminal crime, there is no evidence that the fact that they have not been considered criminal crime has not caused a abuse of their application, i.e., the use of Ethanese or suicide assisted with non-competent persons or that they had not been granted their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-chairman of the report, declared last night by teleconference that, on the contrary, there were more exemptions in the countries where Ethanese or assisted suicide were not legalized.
"In Canada, Ethanese is practiced, although it is clearly illegal."
"In Canada, self-assailed, although it is clearly illegal," says Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians, favourable to Etanasia
We remember that 85 per cent of Canadians have already been expressed for Ethanese, because they believe that they would allow those whose death is near to encourage their suffering, as indicated in 2010, an Angus Reid survey.
Furthermore, 66% believes that the fact of legalization of Ethanese will not understand that the life of old or disabled persons is less valued.
With regard to people who have experienced self-assault, 41 per cent of the surveys believe that a process should not be initiated against them.
With regard to the maintenance or interruption of health assistance to a patient, the situation is not so clear, as indicated by the authors of the report.
In addition, among its recommendations, it suggests that the retirement of health care is indicated in the Criminal Code, if legally rejected, does not require a criminal offence.
The Committee of Experts also requests that health professionals be formed in the duty to respect the fact that a patient refuses the assistance to the end of their life without fear to face a complaint.
In the field of paleary care, the Committee calls for Governments, health assistance institutions and doctors to cooperate in order to ensure the best paliative care, not only in cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to Palestinian or Terminal seat, which is already used in the health institutions of Canada, the Committee requests that, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, it is considered an Ethanese and is subject to the same procedures.
Other experts show reservations
Other health law experts have already shown their reservations with regard to the conclusions of the report of the experts of the Real Society of Canada.
Peter Deschamps, a health specialist, has qualified the post of experts signing the report, among other things because Ethania’s practice is not limited to nurses in the terminal phase.
"This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is smiling to live and has more than 18 years can ask for help to suicide", says Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr. Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seem to have a priority for personal autonomy on any other value of society.
Now, adds that "in society, there are labels and limitations".
The health specialist Margaret Saturville also expressed its "forest opposition" regarding the conclusions of the report, which was qualified by "manfiesto for Ethanese".
Margaret Saturville, who also belongs to the Real Society of Canada, puts on a judicial screen the lack of abuse in certain countries where Ethana and the assisted suicide are legal, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
The king of Jordan urges President El Asad to abandon the power
Damascus claims a "complete"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Bachar El Asad's Partyes were demonstrated last night before the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Last night the diplomatic pressure on the Syrian Bachar El Asad was intensified, which, with Russia's support, resists and claims that there is a "complement" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has strengthened sanctions against Damasco, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring Syria, have been demonstrated for the abandonment of the power by President Asad.
King Abdala II of Jordan was the first Arab leader who requested President Bachar El Asad to "absent the power" in Syria, where there have already been a quarter of civilians and members of the rule forces.
"If Bachar really is worried about his country, it should, in addition to creating the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life", stated the king of Jordan, near Syria, in an interview for the BBC.
For its part, the chief of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davidoglu, regretted that the mediation efforts that leads to Turkey since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in a failure.
"They who are not in peace in the Middle East with their peoples and can't satisfy them, they will go," he stated by inviting Syria, a neighbouring country for which Turkey is taking a more harder post.
Following the decisions of the Arab link and the European Union, the United States concluded that the agreement against Asad and the action of the Syrian regime had been strengthened.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab link and other countries, such as Turkey, are taking a tone more harder than it is", states Mark Toner, a port of the Department of State.
At the same time, 16 civilians have already lost their lives and at least 19 members of the regime forces in the Dea region, in the south of Syria, reported the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH).
Another two civilians failed to "during bombs and shoots with weight shocks in Jobar" in the local city of Homs, as indicated by this NGO.
During a press route, the Syrian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid Al Mualem, considers that the country "before the end of the crisis".
He also reacted firmly to the decision of the Arab League to suspend on the damage of his functions, which is, in its view, "a dangerous step".
Syria will not be frapped," he added, safeguarding that "the compliments tramped against Syria will fail".
After the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League currently studied a "mechanism of civilians" and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
The French Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alain Juppé, also expressed its support to the sentence of observers of the United Nations to contribute to the protection of civilians against the repression of the regime, which, in its view, is enclosed in the "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the Liga in Rabat is expected to be held in the morning for the implementation of the crisis output plan adopted on 2 November, which, in particular, provides the removal of the armed forces of the cities in the hands of the opposition and release of the detented protesters.
The Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Serguei Lavrov, has judged yesterday as "incorrect" the decision of the Arab League, while China urged Syria to implement the crisis outlook, although it did not demonstrate its support for the implementation of possible sanctions against Damasco.
Italy
Monti requests time for Italian markets and sacrifices
The future leader of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has requested a little time for the markets to form their team and to implement a program that will include "professional" to recover the lost credibility for the last months of the Government of Berlusconi.
The former European Commissioner has discussed the political parties yesterday, and today he was meeting with the trade and the leader.
It should be a relatively limited office, composed of external technologies to Parliament.
"Monte has spoken of a wide programme with numerous sacrifices", stated Francesco Nucara, a deputy of one of the many small parliamentary groups who participated in meetings after meeting with the designated Council President.
For its part, the Chairman of the House of Members, Gianfranco Fini, stated that Mario Monti hopes that it requests for a vote of trust to Parliament to ensure that the new Government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with the presentation, by Mr Monti, of a limited list, without doubt of a twelve of ministers, to the Head of State, Napolitan Jorgio.
Monte has commented on the nervousism of the Burunty markets and the obligationists last night, requesting them time.
In the "democracy, there are certain periods" to form a Government and to prepare its programme, emphasized that it is "certain that markets will be patient and will understand it".
His appointment was initially obtained the benefit of the markets, but then the concern was imposed, in particular after an unprecedented fall of industrial production in the euro area in September.
The named Prime Minister should create a team mainly formed by technographers, even though he has emphasized that he would like to include "politicals".
The new Government should operate until 2013, date of the following legislation, to be considered.
According to the President of the House of Deputy, Gianfranco Fini, the new Government will obtain the vote of confidence of Parliament before Friday.
Monti has been compromised that when it takes charge, he will work with the urgentness and with the purpose of that Italy "recover its protagonism" in Europe.
A port of the European Commissioner Olli Rehn emphasized that "including a new government will not change our diagnose of Italian economy".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal to achieve a budget balance in 2013, despite the plans of austerity adopted over the past months, requested the adoption of new rigorous measures.
The "head of Chiefs" Italian Emma Marcegaglia, who will see the master, also stressed the need to stimulate the economy, "for a country that does not grow up is not able to respect the requirements of deficit".
Monti, famous for its competitive and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), is a "time change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconisme"; the "professor" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousity" and "other Italy", according to the editorialists.
The big innocent will be the long-term of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid previous elections, since Italy has to put some 200,000 euros in State obligations before April 2012.
A Russian scientific has cooperated with the Iranian nuclear programme
A Russian Scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has cooperated with Iran in developing a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapons, as the Monday stated a specialized American NGO in the atomic risk.
For the identification of the researcher, the Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and on other documents issued by the United Nations Agency.
The IAEA last week showed its "grace concern" for a "posible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to the ISIS, on the basis of the IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, had worked for three decades, since 1960, in a Soviet Military Nuclear Center in Tcheliabinsk (Oural) and had participated in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds for explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, the centre would have been abandoned to form a central company in the production of "nanodiamants" in Kiev.
The economic problems of your company would lead to contact him in 1995 with the Ambassador of Iran in Ukraine.
Then it was believed that he had cooperated with the Iran programme between 1996 and 2002 before returning to Russia.
In its last report, the IAEA said that there are "class indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the assistance of a foreign expert, which was not only well known for the technique, but also, according to the report of a Member State to the Agency, worked during the majority of its roads in that technology in the military programme of its country of origin."
Muslim crimes and crimes have increased 50%
Muslim crimes and crimes have increased around 50 per cent between 2009 and 2010, while in the same period, the remaining types of racial and religious violence have reduced or slightly increased, as indicated by the FBI statistics on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence against Muslims in 2009 to 160 in 2010 has increased from 49 per cent in the case of acts of violence against Catholics, a reduction of 4 per cent in Jewish crimes and a global increase of 14 per cent in the number of crimes and antireligious crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has grown slightly up to 6.628 cases, of which 47.3% should be at racial differences and 20% to religious differences, as indicated by the FBI.
"Third a decree in 2009, it was worried that they returned to increase this type of crimes and crimes," stressed the organization of human rights defence, "the increase of the acts of violence against Muslims is particularly significant", added the organization in a communication.
"Human Rights First has long been noted that violence against Muslims, as well as all kinds of hatred crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," adds a responsible organization, Paul Legendre.
"The United States government may and must work to end such abuses," adds, as such efforts could include an improvement of the police reports on "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in the US Federal Law was hered from the time of combating civil rights.
This legislation was adopted after Martin Luther King's death to punish acts of violence linked to race, the color of skin, religion, origin and now sexual inclination.
Twitter changes your platform and looks more like Facebook
The Twitter microblogging site modified the Monday presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activities of people to whom they follow, which causes their service a little more like Facebook.
A new "Activity" and another named "name" will allow to follow more legitimately and directly the activity of other "Twittos", i.e. those whose messages "tweets" continue on on the Internet or which follow you.
This allows you to know whether you follow messages, if you are subscribed to new accounts, if you preferably qualify any message, etc.
This new Twitter form was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before spread it to the rest of the Sunday network, as stated to the AFP's portion, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, who was known by its low-instinct function, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to return a message of another person, following Friday to recommend following another user), making the happiness of the initiatives, is thus opened to a larger public with a more comparable manner to that of the larger Facebook and Google+ public networks.
In the network, users have discussed "tweets" with different views the interest of this innovation.
"It's inutile, is invasive and it seems too much to Facebook", writes @jemb123.
"The function Activity will help me to follow better some elements of my Twitter flow," writes @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a budgetary "good rules" in the Constitution
The Government of a great social-democratic/democratic coalition that is in the power of Austria has decided to include in the Constitution a budgetary "good rule" to reduce public deficit, and therefore avoid a possible degradation of Austria's sovereign note by credit qualification agencies (true A).
It was the social-democratic Canciller, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when Austrian public debt reached 74.6%, a very higher number of 60% fixed by the Maastricht Treaty but clearly lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria was reduced at a single level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay $3 million more in interest each year", stated the Vice-Christ Democratic Vice-Christ for Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus responds to a request from the Brussels Summit to the Member States of the euro area of the last October 26, which requested the Heads of State and Government to include, before the end of 2012, the reducing of public deficit and the recovery of public accounts in the Constitution or an equivalent law.
The device adopted by the Austrian Government is close to the German model, since Germany was the first European country that adopted this type of "regule".
Before 2017, the structural public deficit should decrease each year in 0.75% of the bruto domestic product (PIB) and, from 2017, the structural public deficit of the Federal State should not exceed 0.35% of the GDP, while regional and common States should present balanced budgets.
The objective is that, until 2020/2021, public debt is reduced under the criteria of 60% of the Maastricht Treaty.
It's a children's book, right?
No threat with a new intervention of the change market
The Japanese Prime Minister, Yoshihiko Noda, warned the march that the Nipon authorities would renew the marked change if the yen continued to increase.
"We will intervente, as we did last time, if we confirm that a excessive volatility is produced" in the type of yen change, Noda explained the Senate.
On Monday, yen was up to a closer level to the maximum historical levels which had produced the intervention of Japanese authorities on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo was massively sold yens for $1,000 to reduce the value of the nipona division, which was finally reaching a new record since 1945 compared to the United States currency.
But yen has been backing paulatingly since then, stimulated by the purchases of investors that are considered it a "value refugee" in these uncertain times of global economic ralentization and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar returning to be covered at less than 77 yens and the euro has fallen down below the symbolic bar of 105 yens, reaching a number of levels close to which the last intervention has caused.
Before the financial crisis 2008-2009, the dollar was covered around 120 yens and the euro to more than 160 yens.
This explosion of the nipona division harms the exports of the archipelago, as Made products in Japan and reduces the value of income obtained in foreign by Japanese enterprises when they convert them to national currency.
"Japan is fighting to rebuild" after the seismo and tsunami of 11 March, which destroyed the Tohoku region, emphasized Noda, who fears that the rebuilding of the yen court of roots the weakness.
The third global economic power has recovered growth in the third quarter (1.5 per cent in relation to the previous quarter), for the first time in one year, thanks to the increase in export and consumption of homes affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister believes that the high level of yen did not reflect the "economic bases of Japan".
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, requested the Japan Bank (BoJ) to launch a meeting of its monetary policy two days, which takes all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the Adjoint Goal of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "the appropriate measures", understood that a more monetary flexibility should not be expected on Thursday.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the emission institute increased in five billion yens (47,000 million euros) purchases from the Tesor letters, bringing to the 55 billion yens (519,000 million euros) the amount of the funds dedicated to the purchase of various financial titles to the liquidity market.
Euro area:
the types grow, the balls flake
The risk of the debt crisis is still harming European indexes.
Despite the appointment of new government heads in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth rates in France and Germany, the type of the weakest countries continue to grow.
The stableness of the euro area has still been worried, and the European bags are slower in the negative zone on March 15, November.
In Paris, at 10 hours, the CAC 40 lost 1.4% and is at 3.064 points.
Dax lost in Frankfurt 0.4% and in London 0.1%.
"Bearing in mind the new pressures regarding the income of the loans of the most affected euro area, the Burunty markets worldwide remain part of their recent profits."
"Inversers, nervous, are perfectly conscious of the counting risk", explains Terry Pratt, institutional corrector in IG Markets, quoted by the Reuters Agency.
Tokio's Bolsa has closed 0.7 per cent by renewing the concerns of market intervenants with regard to the capacity of Europe to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, as the rest of the world, has a fixed look in Europe, and exchanges will continue to be achieved in a lower range of variations, so investors will have no evidence that the situation has been established", considers Mitsushige Akino, fund manager in Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The restoration of the concerns for the future of the euro area affects the single currency, which continues to decrease on March.
The euro remains at its lower level since a month and medium.
10 hours ago, the European division was $3570, a decline of 0.4 per cent.
According to the drivers, he has lost the value after the CDU's Champier Angela Merkel party, who was meeting the Monday at the Congress, to adopt a movement that, in particular, provides the option that a country in difficulty leaves the euro area without abandoning the European Union.
Italian and Spanish types exceeding 6% with crops
The type of credit in Italy and Spain remains a very worried level.
On Monday morning, the performance of Italian obligations to 10 years was 6.85%, while Spanish titles offered at the same time 6.2%.
These tensions relating to the types of interest in the Southern countries, although also in France, continue to produce the fears of the intervenants.
The chief of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has requested time for markets to improve the situation in Italy, which is the risk of achieving its debt weight.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for its part, stated that the implementation of the decisions adopted in the Euro area Summit on 27 October would be the "clear work" of its Government.
Spain is at the point of view of the markets while there will be legislative elections therein.
The difference in the types ("expread") between ten years of obligations in Germany and Spain has reached a new maximum history.
In the expectation of the growth rates of the euro area
From statistical view, France has registered an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, i.e. a more favourable number than 0.3% expected by domestic consumption.
However, Insee has revised to low the number of the second quarter, with a decrease of 0.1% of the bruto domestic product (PIB) instead of a stacking.
In addition, the fourth quarter is what really concerns economics.
Germany has registered a growth of 0.5% in the same period.
The first forecasts for the whole of the euro area are prescribed at 11 hours after the European Commission has warned on the risk of a new receipt.
Energy policy:
the facts must value more than the dogmas
If there is a theme that can't be treated by taking into account short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it is the energy policy.
Availability and electricity costs directly affect the acquisitive power and the competitiveness of companies.
It is appropriate that an election meeting is the time to reflect on such issues and the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it examines the whole economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The Frenchs should based their views on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are 7.000 million people in the planet, democratic evolution will have the duplication of electrical demand before 2050, unless there is a large part of the world's global population of a vital element.
At the same time, there will be a higher deficiency of fossil resources to continue to produce continuously electricity, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce emissions of winter gas to combat climate change, a theme that has disappeared from the environmental debate.
Fukushima's accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains alone in its decision to abandon nuclear energy.
This is not the case or Belgium, which puts its attention to the need to find a source that can replace it, or Switzerland, which only aims to build centrals of the last generation.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, by quoting some examples, continue to be determined with their projects.
U.S., after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, turning back to the construction of an interrupted central after the accident of Trie Mile Island.
If the German model, based on renewable energy, is presented in cases as an example, the reality will be against such a speech.
The Berlin election will propose an enhancement of the electricity price, an increased energy dependence on the increased gas needs of imported, in particular in Russia, to increase CO2 emissions for the construction of gas and carbon centres.
In some months, the damage effects will be noted.
It should be meditate on the case of Denmark.
Europe's campaign in the electronic sector, which obtains 30% of its electricity, is also one of the larger carbon and gas users because of the wind intermitting; therefore, their CO2 emissions and their electricity prices are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to our energy policy, our neighbors have a electricity facture more than 40% of French homes.
While in globalized energy costs are a key factor of competitiveness and the guarantee of the maintenance of industrial use in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would have a strong decline in electricity price, which would remain realistic to the wonderful statements on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of our acquisitive power.
This is a price that the large majority of Frenchs refuse to pay, and in fact, they do not demonstrate opposition in principle to that type of energy, as shown in the surveys.
We remember that the energy policy of our country has lost the construction of a industrial sector with 125,000 directors and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Extensively directed to export, it covers a galaxy of specialized pymes on international markets and can create non-localised jobs.
If France decided to leave nuclear energy, it would be the sacrifice of large part of these KMOs and the loss of EUR 6.000 per year in French equipment and nuclear services exports.
What electricist would load a EPR designed to operate sixty years when its manufacturer's manufacturer's smuggling is expected?
To solve nuclear energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no wonderful source of electricity production as there is no diabetic source.
The development by the Areva of Solutions with low CO2, nuclear and renewable CO2 emissions demonstrates the supplementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the maximum security level.
In France, we have a Security Authority that exercises strict and transparent control on existing centres and on the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, of recognised professionality, are also obsessed by security.
In the middle of the century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, the Trie Mile Island, has occurred in normal operational conditions; it did not cause consequences, nor for people or for the environment.
In Chernobil, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and some imperdonable human failures.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of an unprecedented scale, which caused death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as did the two previously.
Thanks to these progress and cooperation between security authorities, and French and German operators and constructors, the EPR has a powerful design to resist such phenomena.
While studying all the electric actors who want to build a central, the interruption of their construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for Areva and EDF competitors, since it would leave them free to take the leadership in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is essential and legitimate to search for the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsive to let emotions, dogmes and participants dominate such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Migration, a load or an opportunity for the economy?
Imigration policy implemented by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from several points of view: the saturation of the police, judicial and administrative services subject to the digit policy, the compatibility of this policy with the self-declared status of "the country of human rights".
More recently, it is the shock of foreign students that has shooted to the holders, with the Minister of Interior (see release of 23 May), proclaiming in past that France "no need for foreign talents, workers or bedrooms."
However, it is rarely analyzed from the economic point of view.
The question is that, on this subject, there is a sufficient consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac set the orientation by declaring in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed people should not be a problem for a country that accounts for about two million immigrants", while on the left, the ton fixed it Michel Rocard, explaining that France "not can be charged by all the mercy of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both left and right shared the fear of the invasion of the national territory by a number of Poland sources.
On both sides, immigrants are a burden for the economy and French society.
The only difference is at the level of generosity with which they act in relation to immigrants.
In its programme, François Hollande is limited to include banalities, pointing out that the code-road will allow to solve the " migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be electorally, but economically is very sweet.
As the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron pointed out in a recent work that resumes the most recent knowledge of immigration (Exceptive People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus between the experts on the positive impact of migratory flows in economic growth, salary and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
The limitation of immigration deficits growth and damages employment.
The fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace national workers, in particular the poorly qualified, pressing to reduce their wages.
However, experience shows that immigrants are actually more complementary than the replacement of national workers and are mainly professionals in sectors with lack of employment.
Unqualified immigrants work in sectors that do not affect national workers and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where training does not meet staff demand.
Positive effects on salary
Similarly, a surgery would have difficulties to work in a country that has lack of an advisists, the complementarity between national and immigrants is that the arrival of these are positively influenced on the wages and employment of nationals.
Bearing in mind the previous, John Peri calculated that an increase of 1% of migratory flows had an increase in real long-term wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And without taking into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (which exists a large proportion of naturalized nobel premiums and companies such as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net income to social systems, as they provide a average of 1 per cent of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organization, for example, calculates that a immigrant in Germany who has a 30-year-old age will carry out a net (minor expenditure) of 150,000 euros to public average budgets throughout its life.
At the beginning of his mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go looking for the growing points that were missing with the dentists.
These dentists, who dismissed immigrants, had exactly the inverse effect.
Europe has invented democracy, only the lack of thinking about a European democracy
Democracy is a precious good, but also fragile.
The European continent should be able to remember this because, although it was invented in Athene over two thousand years ago, during the 19th century has suffered the tragedy of the World War, totalitarisms, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also in Spain, to Salazar in Portugal, the Corones in Greece.
Some may have believed that, so that democracy would be finally triumphed on their enemies, it would be sufficient to exercise the vote and the way it could be the most direct way.
We know, from Napoleon the Small, which was about something thought.
The universal sufragio, although it is a condition necessary for democracy, is not sufficient for himself and can even become a "oppression instrument", as it had previously said the Republican philosoph Etienne Vacherot.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, Luces, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we live in Europe is a economic crisis, but it is at the point of become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinodia of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this regard, a double clear effect: showed the need for a powerful return of the political area, but also the concerning feeling of its impossibility, of its incompatibility.
It must be reflected on this ambivality to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now been moved and, in many cases, the Republicn soldiers have no longer progressed in the good sense.
We will not be able to win if we require national references, organized on the basis of the needs and in a decorative manner.
A white sign to the absolute European monarch or high the empty of the nationalist anger: What options for the citizen!
No, we don't want to get out of effects, but a common exercise of full-right, peaceful and continuous, from options and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (we wouldn't know where to end the list), because there is only a crisis, the crisis of Europe.
The whole of Europe is the one that enhances the market orders and qualification agencies, who suffers their impotentity and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe who suffers humiliation in the international area.
We are worried about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is all Europe who lose sovereignty slowly and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent is that the popular sovereignty will recover the timon of the European project.
Because only Europeans can together reduce the weight of their debts, free from the markets and prepare their future through investment.
The outcome of the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, except to lead us to disaster.
After struggling for a long time against this proposal of socialists and of Jacques Delors, the whole world now calls for a European economic rule.
That's what it's.
But think of it without greater political and democratic integration, and without being lived like that by the citizens, it would be a new crazy and would bring us to a new dead point.
We must take a new stage of the European construction.
To build the Republic in France, the Republic was needed "hacer" republics.
The revolution motivated by interests would not be enough.
This lesson remains applicable.
We must build a more integrated Europe from the economic perspective.
Only one can be achieved by building a more democratic Europe at the political level, a truly popular European sovereignty.
To build Europe, we do Europeans.
The cards with chip "no contact" are generalized
The world room of Chip cards begins march in Villepinte, near Paris, with a optimistic environment.
In fact, 2011 should end up to 11% in global card sales with microprocessors (bank cards, phones with SIM cards etc.), with a total of 6,000 million units, according to the calculations of the Eurosmart office.
The most powerful segment is the technologie without contact, which allows to subscribe common transport or purchase simplely by approaching the card to a reader.
This year will be sold throughout the world 460 million cards with chip without contact, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its contribution should continue to increase in 2012 (before 580 million units) and represent about 10% of the world market of chip cards (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has been long rewarded with regard to the Asian-Pacific region, is gaining a field in the field of non-contact payment sector.
About 26 million bank cards Visa are already available for this function, which is accepted in 75,000 pay terminals.
In France, its starts are more modest: 400,000 Visa cards are used without contact.
But the large surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has issued this year 2,5 million cards Pas MasterCard without contact.
However, to put the top path, the banks must put them available to their customers.
"There are two large French institutions that have been able to systematically disseminate in the future, between their customers, bank cards provided from the system without contact," announces Gérard Nébouy, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
But so is just a first stage towards the future payment media: the mobile phone.
Currently, there are few devices equipped with NFC technology (Near Field Communication), essential for operations.
"He's swearing."
"But it should finally try a true age the year that comes."
"We expect to be sold between 80 and 120 million units in the world in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the front.
The Agricultural Bank announced last night the launching of a test between December and June in Caen.
The iPhone will be equipped with around 200 customers and collaborators with a foundation that allows payment without contact.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marsella.
And the General Society also stated yesterday that it is preparing the marketing of a offer that allows its customers to pay without contact through their mobile.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front goes to increase
Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Magreb and Boko Haram Sect.
The links between the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Magreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Section of Boko Haram, which has been suspected for a long time, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Argelia Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even claimed that Argel "have the certidumbre".
"The way both organizations operate and the reports of intelligence services show that they cooperate", explained, without further details.
Paris seems to reach a similar conclusion.
The investigation of the two French sequencies in Niger last January would have been re-annumbered.
Rapted in a restaurant in Niamey for people related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocor and Vincent Delory died next day together with several of its students during a operation launched by the French special forces.
In the spots of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators found several telephone chips belonging to terrorists.
Terrorism eye
The study of the calls made indicates several interlocutors based on Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers have particularly captured the interest of researchers: one leads to a Nigerian who remained long-term in Mayduguri, a city of the north of Nigeria, from Boko Haram, and one to a man who, likely, is near Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a progress, but in doubt we should expect to have more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We know for years that the section enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it's always more active," says a Nigerian investigator Kunle Amuwo.
These last months, the "subsidys" were increasingly clear in the evolution and the discours of Boko Haram or in its operational ways, which now implies the use of missiles or explosive devices more complex and the same style as they used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting by Washington, has since then pressed Abuya to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities, in fact, take time to consider the group as a community of illuminants, a little interested.
Quick success
Based in 2002 in Mayduguri around a mix, a school and the fundamentalist Mohammed Joseph, Boko Haram (which means, "the western education is a sin"), encourages the establishment of a Islamic emit in the northern Nigerian Islamic Muslim.
In this poor region, the association lives rapidly.
It is political and requires strict respect of sharia while its warriors are launched against the struggle of the wicked central government.
These are first directed to churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram warriors were particularly active and the attacks against committees were multiplied.
Abuya’s reaction was, as normally passing, generalized.
The army attacked the city and recorded 800 dead.
Mohammed Joseph, arrested in life, received death in prison.
Since then, the sect has radicalized and left its fires from the north.
The past Navities revince a warning that caused 80 dead in Jos and then another in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram returned to attack Abuya, in particular against the protected general of the police, with a suicide attack, the first of this type.
In August, the United Nations local headquarters becomes its first international goal.
The creation of a terrorist eye in Africa, which would ship from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, concerns all security experts.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and the Somalians of Al-Chababa operating in Kenia, Boko Haram comes as a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned you against Boko Haram and said that he was willing to "depart all the information".
The world according to the candidates to the Presidency
With regard to China, Iran and the help to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry revalue in simpleness and lack of knowledge.
A America weak by the crisis, can you manage a complex world with simple ideas or even simplists?
Listed to the Republican candidates for the presidents, the electors could think that's it.
Since a few days ago, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have made more structuring and attacks in the field of foreign policy, traditionally a strong point of the Republicans.
The weights, often unfunded, are extensive about China, Iran, helping Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best candidate located on the road towards the designation by the Grend Old Party, threatened to bring Chineses to the WTO and declare "for the manipulation of their division", a key topic in an emerged America by the migration of entire fragments in Asia.
As if that implies the explosion of a commercial war, he stated.
John Huntsman, former Ambassador of Obama in China, and the only candidate that has a sophisticated vision of the external policy, is almost shocked to a attitude that "speaks" emotions.
He requested a strong but constructive dialogue with Pekin (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who is standing in the depths of the sonds, remains inaugurable.
To the Reagan style
Romney has also promised a military intervention in Iran if sanctions could not interrupt its nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran," he snacked.
"If Obama sell released, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military assistance to Israel, accusing Obama of having failed with its obligations in relation to that partner.
The Employee Herman Cain, the second best-classed candidate, shows for its part a shameful recognition of such themes.
Recently, he urged to oppose the Chinese military threat because Pequin “to develop nuclear capacity”, apparently ignoring the fact that China has already available the military atom since 1964.
The Teacher Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says that by its part, it is ready to deploy the United States army in Mexico to fight drug prisoners.
The torture rise, banned by Obama in 2009, also recommended Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
Differences are considerable with the Republican candidate in 2008, John McCain, a weight in external policy.
The opposers of the current President replied that Reagan also had simple ideas and wins the Cold War.
They remember that Obama himself was a affected and that he had to shoot the piston in the fight against terrorism.
In fact, in the absence of its ingenuous dialogue with Iran, the precipitation of the "boys" of Iraq and its territories in Libya, and it marks the weakness.
But the attacks are not simple.
The population is more positively the national security balance of Obama, which ended with Bin Laden.
Since Iraq, he dislooked the military interventions generating a hunger.
And, arguing that it does not necessarily rebuilding America to restore his leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more fair.
North Stream, new Russian Gas entrance door in Europe
North Stream gas driver, which directly communicates Western Europe with Russia through the Baltic Sea, has already been placed in service.
Gas should be provided to meet the needs of thirty million homes.
Gazprom, the Russian giant gas, wanted to celebrate the event with great pump.
Last March, over 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, participated in the Baltic oceans, between the music of the orchester and a delicate buffet, in the inauguration of the North Stream, the new gas communicated directly under the sea, Russia and Germany.
Similarly, the German Canciller Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Filon and his Homologo of the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, have turned together the flight of the ball that controls the Russian gas in the Western Europe network.
With this new gas drive each year, 27.5 million additional Russian gas meters will be reached in Western Europe through a first tube of 1.224 km that communicate the San Petersburg region with the country of Mecklemburg and Pomerania.
A second tube should be concluded at the end of 2012, which will allow to provide a total of 55,000 million cubic gas meters, i.e., enough to cover all French consumption.
Furthermore, it is already talking about the possibility of building a third tube for the same rear.
For Gazprom, the finalization at the time of this huge work presents trials of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries were strongly opposed to the project.
In fact, North Stream will allow gas to provide directly to Germany, avoiding the earthquake by third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
In fact, these two countries lose something of their power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia by enable them to close the access to Western Europe markets.
In the argued point of the debate, Varsovia did not doubt compare North Stream as a "new German and Soviet Covenant" in terms of the Alliance between Hitler and Stalin to Occupy Poland in 1939.
I mean, if the topic is politically delicate.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has obtained greater supply security.
But the price is a debilitation of Europe of energy, since the project has generated a break between Eastern and Western Europeans.
Russia has learned in just five years to triumph its vision of a direct partnership between Russia and the rich Western countries, large gas consumers and more limited reservations.
"This gasoduct is a component of our association with Russia, a new art that is one of us organicly", confirmed François Filon during the inauguration of the gas, showing how many gas contracts are as political as economics.
All this explains the broad sounds in the faces of Gazprom's guidelines, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this gas produces also a technical achievement.
The submarino tube is manufactured of cement steel to protect it against ships' angles.
A medium of 200 meters of depth is supported in the sea.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid mines fields dating from the Second World War.
"It was necessary to retire or destroy a hundred of them, for care," says Jens Muller, a porter of North Stream society.
It was also necessary to enhance the protection of fauna and flower.
The tube is a long metal scene that weights like 242 Eiffel tours and is not interrupted throughout its length: nor by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
It was planned for a control platform in Sweden's waters, but the responsibilities of the project rejected the same when the Swedishs were not very disposed to allow a Russian state society to establish a permanently in the sea before their costs.
"In the case we'll have, we'll interrupte the gas step in less than one minute," needs Jens Muller.
In the case of escape, gas shall therefore be released to the atmosphere.
But the constructors are not likely to be fleet, since they have expected junctions that, according to the predictions, they will have a flee every 100,000 years.
The state control of the gas drive is guaranteed by a submarino robot that is carried out by a ship, which carrys out external inspections, as well as by a device that circle through the gas drive.
With the form of a clean, it is introduced inside the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and is moved with the gas.
At its arrival, after three full journeys of travel to a speed of three meters per second, you provide specific data on possible metal deformations.
The gas drive has been designed to operate for 50 years without any type of reparation.
Gas movement is simply guaranteed by pressure.
At the beginning, 200 bars and, at the outdoor of 100 bars.
Five companies have joined their forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which has 51% of the participations.
The Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5%) were united, as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French GDF Suez group (9 per cent of each).
These five companies have created a common company called North Stream, which is responsible for building and exploiting gas.
It has its seat in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxes are particularly favourable.
Then, Gazprom acquired this society, during a period of twenty-twenty-year renewable, the total of the gas transport capacity.
"Gazprom will pay you for the total capacity, independently of the amount of gas that is actually transported", needs Jens Muller.
The financing of gas production has been financed by 30 per cent with the contribution of shareholders and 70 per cent through bank loans.
The total cost of the work should be reached by EUR 7.400 million for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure that they will not exceed their investment, since Gazprom is only the risk of expenditure.
The gas producer emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, in a pine sand coast.
Some valves, with 4,5 meters of height, form the gas output door.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and the specific features of the gas to the arrival before transfer to German gases.
Since the past march, the terminal receives a million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
In total capacity, there will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a brand book.
Created half-century ago by a Italian company, Moleskine wants to return to people the favor for writing.
It has an adventure air, from hours of writing at the light of a vel.
The Moleskine book is easily recognised, with its black rectangular folders, his goma, its red white color sheets, as old as for time.
However, the Moleskine books with the current aspect were born... in 1997.
The Italian Mode company, based on Milán, decided at that time to start a design note book, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, who was then the company's advisor, was loaded from the launching of the new product.
The book is inspired in an old production technique, the skin mol (top skin skin), which refers to a barned ball that was used, among other things, to cover the banks.
This type of book was very valued by writers and travellers.
"Moleskine has adapted to the current favorite an old and forgotten object, a icon of the Vanguardian artists to the XX century", accounts Maria Sebregondi, who has since then become responsible for the brand in Mode.
And it's the success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26 per cent, up to a volume of 12.7 million of units sold.
The confidential production of the first years, where only 3.000 frees were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the profile of the buyer, since the note board affects both business men and students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolites, open spirit and worship.
The small Italian company, who had 12 employees at its starts, now has about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
He distributes his bookshops, from the Fnac to the small trade in the centre of the city, and has been able to impose his identity.
"We have adapted to the time and the need to write, despite the increase of the e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature goes from hand with Moleskine's development: recently, the mark has started the "Detour" exposure where architects or artists exposure their own cousin.
In August, he also launched a chairman with leopard pieces, due to the Locarno film Festival.
Using their success and this cultural will, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: balls, agendas, balls, computer foundations... The brand covers a wide range of supports.
Successful success: in autumn 2006, Mode was acquired by the SG Capital Europe Investment Fund, in the current Sintgra Capital, and is thus written a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the percentage of disabled workers still so high?
Around 19% of disabled persons are looking for employment.
The XV week for the employment of disabled persons begins today.
Despite a resolved public policy since 2005, unemployment rates among disabled persons doubled the average rate: 19 per cent, compared to 9 per cent for the whole population.
Deceasing?
"No," said Eric Blanchet, Director-General of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of disabled persons.
"Progress achieved for 15 years are significant.
"In that time, the unemployment rate was not two times but three times higher than the average.
"But there is still much to do."
It should be noted that disabled unemployed people continue to strike many obstacles to access to employment.
They often have a advanced age: 37 per cent has more than 50 years (a average 17 per cent).
They have a low quality level: 80 per cent has not been finished by the bachelor and 2,3 million students in higher education only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term rate is very extensive among them: 53% for disabled persons, against 38% of average.
It is, there are numerous issues that are particularly difficult to return to the work world and that "constitute the fall of the problem", states Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, a association created in 1992 to help enterprises to contract disabled workers.
These are the objective obstacles.
Furthermore, there are those who are not mentioned; the mentality of people is advanced, but too slow.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Introduction Association for the City indicated that the investigated directors had "a level of knowledge on disabilities low", with a "excellent representation of people in the streets, physical or intellectual deficiencies".
The result is: private enterprises with more than 20 workers are very far from the goal of contracting 6% of disabled workers, aimed at a law of 1987.
According to the latest available figures, dating in 2008, a relationship of 2.6% is reached.
"We now reach around 3 per cent," states Peter White, Director-General of Agefiph, the body responsible for recursioning the contributions of enterprises that do not respect this law.
The test is the number of establishments "supply to this contribution", as well as the paid amounts, have decreased from 2007 to 2011, from 59.000 to 46.000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The law of 2005, which increased the contributions, has generated a great pressure for companies", explains Peter White.
"But this improvement also reflects a real consciousness, especially among the major groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59 per cent of corporations who have 20 to 49 workers have disabled employees in their model, against 82 per cent of between 100 and 199 employees.
Hazard: "A joy"
On Monday at night (20h45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the joy that they generate this friendly party.
We will not be able to say that it was noted connivelity among them, but the image is symbolic.
Sit one along the other, on the road of the State of France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really done peace.
Fifty months after the slope of his sight against Turkey, the Belgian selectioner has no more joy for him.
"I'm very pleased for Eden, for his progress and for being Belgian."
"I want to go forward," answers Lille's front.
As regards the contrast between its presentations in its team and selection, "that's a set" has been justified.
"In Lille, I am all the year, which does not apply Belgium.
"I have to stay."
Inviting to play against Romania on Wednesday night, taking into account this party against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to, finally, "brillar".
We don't forget the placer.
He continued to encourage the Bleus since he had seven years, as well as during the 1998 and 2000 winning campaigns.
"I've always been his fan," says.
Uncertainly, that will enhance the "particular" character of the meeting.
Specially because it will be faced with "Mathieu (Debooky), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ".
"We're over to fight a few days ago.
"To play against them is always a joy."
With simply, Leekens made for its part reference to the "gourn".
"Orglo" to discuss a gala party.
"Orgullo" also by verifying, as "six", that France "does become a very high-level team", nearly one year after Knysna's traumaism.
"Laurent Blanc has done a forming work", said with entusiasm.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the technology would be pleased to share aircraft with the Bleus to... Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgian are growing," he stressed.
"We're building something; players are ambitious, they're hungry.
"You can see it in the next games." Included the party against France.
Portugal shows great confidence
Portugal of Paul Bento is a great optimistic towards Bosnia (22.00 p.m.), which will be celebrated march in Lisbon.
In the age party, I missed both teams.
"When these 90 minutes are over, we'll be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paul Bento is already seeing in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt; the Selection, which is leading since September 2010, will be qualified for the Eurocopa 2012.
Effectly, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there's a game to play and a rival, Bosnia, to cut off.
Taking into account the ida party (0-0), the Wednesday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the thing is not decided.
Portugal dominated the game for more than one hour, yes, but couldn't mark the valuable goal that he had given his peace.
"It's a good result, but at the same time he conveyed a risk, because we didn't mark out of the house."
But at home, in the luminous Stadium of Lisbon Luz, the Portugals are convinced that they will pass, before a public who should be equal to entusiasmed, even if it is clear that the party " is very equal ", digits a optimistic but lussued Benefit.
"We hope that the party is very equal, but we are completely convinced that we can take the front," said the Portuguese trainer of 42 years.
"We continue to have 50% of the possibilities to participate in Europe in 2012," however, it was related to Carlos Queiroz's successor.
The fourth spring in Bosnia obliges the Portugueses to mark and win.
Bosnians could reach a quarter, although they also need to mark.
"It's a good result, but it was once a risk, because we didn't mark out of the house," regrets Bento.
"We're playing against a team that has a great technical quality and that has players with a great individual quality," added.
Like Zenica, the Portuguese will be able to exercise a maximum pressure on the bosnians from the beginning to "do not let them think."
A good idea, always to be realistic this time.
