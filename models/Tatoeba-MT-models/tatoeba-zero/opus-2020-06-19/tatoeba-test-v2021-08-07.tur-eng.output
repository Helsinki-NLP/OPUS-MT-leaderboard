I'm careful of her kitchen.
I got a French lesson in school.
I saw French at the school.
He brought him to the Kyoto Korean House.
I've seen him in the sight that he's going to win.
I looked like Tom was there.
I was sure Tom's gonna be there.
I looked like Tom wouldn't do this.
I got my place at the end of the time.
I got my shooting.
I got a book.
I came to a wrong bus.
I understand exactly what he said.
This proved that he was inflicted.
It's clear that Tom couldn't understand too much French.
The day he was born, the rain was all day.
I'm doing two hours every day.
She really depends on when it's going to be.
That's really unfortunate.
I tried again, but it's all right.
I tried a car with the brothers.

This life is a future opportunity.
It's a perfect place to start.
I'm sorry that Tom didn't come here today.
I'm sorry that Tom's dead too young.
It's a joy to help you.
It's a joy to be here.
This is a policy engineer.
These people are a place where they are.
Today's a Nisan.
This is a security matter.
This is a short way to school.
It's a little problem.

It's a hair.
That's a deceased animal.
That's a fashion.
The conversation is unprecedented when your mouth is full.
That's because he loved me.
That's why you don't want to be alone.
It was a morning.
It's been a long time since I saw you the last time.
That's a good star.

The national calls are the best to do the person.
It's better to be alone than to be together with a few of them.
It's better to be drinking before smoking.
It's a little scared of me.
It's obviously that Tom didn't know what to do.
Great case.
It's cold today.
This is darkness.
It's hard to analyze.
It's hard to get out of the car in the cold morning.
It is easier to cut down wrong with the attitudes and movements of others.
It's easy to shoot the shoes.
She looked like a pearl.
It looked like a lot of problems.
Looks like you're all right.
He seems to be aware of the truth.
Looks like she's lying.
It looks like raining.
They look like they're slow from their marriage life.
It looks like you won me.
We're at last.
We're finally here.
He warns me.

Play time.
It's hard to follow the end of the event.
It's gonna be a shame.
The sun will be after dinner tomorrow.
This will be unworthy.
Then it's gonna be warm.
It's so nice you're coming.

Today, it'll probably be raining, so it's better to be the shadow of it.
That's like sell in the terrace.
The station's 3 kilometers away.
There's a shooting warm today.
I'm on the way to talk.
It's never true to do this.
It's nice to be a role model for others.
It's good to imagine.
It's nice to see a dream.
It's just good to talk to you.
It's so nice to see you again.
This night, but we're in Boston.

He's not a good car, but he's a car.
It's not bad.
Doing the right thing isn't always so easy.
It's not so simple.
It's not bad.
It doesn't look good.
Not too much, but it's better than ever.
It's not possible to live forever.
It's not obvious to me.
I don't want to go, I'm looking at you.
He's not volunteer.
You don't have a half to convince him.

It's time to sleep, close the radio.
It's time to sleep, close the radio.
It's a party time.
It's time to go back to Tom.
It's time to start.
This is the shooting of man's snake.
This is Tom's only chance.
It's so warm.
It's too late to do this now.
It's too late to return.
It's too late to visit them.
He's too silent.
It's a bad thing to be sweet.
We couldn't get Tom here so early.

It's so cold today, isn't it like you?
It's easy to worry about you, isn't it?
She's too weak.
Very romantic!

He took four months to save her from the hospital.
He took a few hours to do this.
He took a long time to decide where we're going.

It's not easy, but it's possible.
That won't be hard.
It's not clear.
He won't come to him.
He's got a shooting shooting.
That's great, Tom!
If it's not allowed us to do this, it's gonna be written.
She would like to give a party.
It's gonna be ridiculous to do him.
That would be easy to do.
That wasn't right.
I understand that Tom's a program, but I'm really grateful if I can get him a appointment.
