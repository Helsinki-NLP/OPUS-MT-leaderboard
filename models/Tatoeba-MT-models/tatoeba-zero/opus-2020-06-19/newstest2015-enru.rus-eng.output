Scientific found ways to discover the family stars
Astrophysics from the University of California in Santa Cruz have studied an interesting interference and its impact on chemical unity in star collections.
It is expected that the opening of specialists will be able to search for families among the stars, which are the results of one class.
The results of their research were published in Nature magazine, and they can be found on the university website.
The same chemical consisting of the nearest stars is a careful movement in the gas areas that are before the education of the stars.
Even if the born star then leaves the star class, the chemical composition of it can determine the place of its birth and the region of the astronomy education.
The scientists had doubts that the evolution of the star outside the class may lead to the appearance of the differences in its chemical content from such a family in the class.
The results of astronomic models show that such differences should not appear.
In its study, specialists with supercomputers have modeled two trails of inter-star gas that together formed the cluster.
This object during a few million years is converted to a classer that begins to form a protostar.
Scientists added the rods in the original gas flows and established that by rapidly enduring careful movement, the area reached a high level of chemical unity.
As astrophysics consider, their research proves that they can search for chemical stars and to determine the possible educational regions of such objects.

Lawrence: Russia will not be " shut off " with new sanctions and will not be out of WTO
Russia will not be "placing the door" with new sanctions.
This was the head of the MIF Sergey Lawrence head today, speaking before students and MGIO-presenters.
As regards the answers of our measures in the case of the new anti-Russian sanctions, I'm not even going to discuss, fantasing, because everything must be specifically examined, he said.
And when we understand what the European and American partners will like, then we will decide how to answer it.
This will not be linked to the men's doors, some of them who were wrongly understood, - emphasized the Minister.
We, above all, will be dismissed from our interests, to protect our economy, social area, our citizens, our business, and to make conclusions from partners' actions with a view to their adequateness, treaty and reliability.
Thus, the measures taken in sanctions can be very good to judge what partners do, continued head of the FMI.
If in the whole voice says, "They will be sanctions too ill for us, but we're forced to go to Russia to make up," it's probably not very suitable."
With regard to the WTO RF exit in response to possible new sanctions, it is not.
We, on the contrary, want to be more active to release the WTO instruments, including when it comes to trade disputes, said Lawrence.
We have already engaged in this instrument to overcome, as we think, the EU's discriminatory policy on antidemocratic procedures.
According to the Minister, the Russians are accused of depangue and implemented against the RF's economic sector of antidemocratic measures.
"We are ready to work with WTO mechanisms and to abandon our position of invalidity to apply the standards of the third EU energy package retrospectively", said Lawrence.

Remember, very American idea that work rights are human rights
The Congress of China Allison and John Lewis proposed a draft legislation which was protected as civil law.
"When the Professionals, there are work places of the Middle Class", says Ellison, democracy from Minnesota, who is the co-president of the Congress of the Progressive Fraction.
This is why I am proud of representing the Act on the Expansion of the Rights of Workers together with the symbol of movement for civil rights by John Lewis.
This innovative legislation would give workers the same legal opportunities as in the discrimination of professionals, as well as in other forms of discrimination stopping the force of professionals
Amendment of the Labour Relations Act so that employees with discrimination to participate in the organization of professionals are looking for justice in civil courts and the compensation of losses and cost payments is a reasonable and necessary initiative.
However, it is not uncertainly a radical initiative - at least, by American standards.
Indeed, the best way to consider what Ellison, Louise and the counterparts of the draft legislation are to remember the very American idea.
Despite the attacks in the past few years, the Americans in Viskonsyn, Michigan and other states throughout the country had ever supported the world in order to adopt, expand and respect the labour rights.
It was time to remember millions of Americans when the country was simultaneously protected by democracy, freedom of words, freedom of print and the right to organization.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Duolu McArthur and his assistants helped the country to take the Constitution set to ensure that the armed Hideki Todz has been replaced by democracy.
The full understanding that workers and their professionals play a role in the formulation of the new Japan, they included the text, which directly recognized that " the right of workers to organize and negotiations and the collective action is guaranteed".
When the United States occupied Germany after the Second World War, General Duyd David Eisenhawr and his assistants helped the Germans to write the Constitution which guaranteed that the fascism of Adolf Hitler was replaced by a strong democracy.
While acknowledging that workers will be organized and heard in the new State, the Germans included a article that openly stated: " It is good to train associations to protect and improve the employment and economic conditions of each person and every professional or field of activities.
The agreements that limit or attempt to defeat this right will not be legally forced; the measures aimed at these purposes will be recognized contrary.
When the first Lady Eleanor Ruзвelt was Chairman of the International Human Rights Commission, which was the World Declaration on Human Rights, adopted in 1948 the Organization of United Nations as a global agreement, Ruthelt and its composers included the guarantee that " every person had the right to organize and enter a profession to protect its interests".
Generations of the United States have taken the basis of the fact that the rights of the work are human rights.
When the country has consulted other countries about how to create civil and democratic society, the Americans explained that the right to organize professionals and that this professional should be protected as an equal partner in collective negotiations with corporations and government institutions.
Now, when these rights are attacked in America, it is wise to return to the American idea that workers must have the right to organize and to hear their voice in a free and open society.
As a favorite Martin Luther King, he said 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the professional movement did not affect the force of the country but increased them.
Under the living levels of millions, professionals were miraculously created the market for industry and highlighted the entire nation at an incredible level of production.
Those who attack professions forget these simple truths, but the storys will remember them.
The story will remember how we should.
Official recognition of labour rights as human rights and the enlargement of civil rights to prevent discrimination against the organization of professions for a long time.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are born the ideas that historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy.
The judge shall temporaryly block the law that could close all abnormal clinics in Louisiana
In the United States, the Federal Court temporaryly blocked the introduction of the law of Louisiana, which said its parties that he may probably close all five abnormal clinics in the State.
According to this measure, which was signed to the execution of the Governor Louisian Bobby Dynadle in June and should enter into force on 1 September, the doctors who do abortions would have the responsibility of receiving patients in the hospital in the radio of 30 miles from their practice.
However, the judges decide that at the present time the doctors may continue to do legal abortions by continuing searching for such powers.
" The authorities will be allowed to work legally, continued to receive power", wrote the judge John de Gravels in its decision.
The hearing will be designated within a month in which the judge shall make a more constant decision under that law.
Defenders of the right to abortion have met this decision lastly against similar measures, saying that it would give the doctors more time to get sick.
"Annual decision guarantees that women of Louisiana will be protected from a covasive law which is trying to eliminate their health and rights", said Nancy Nortop, President and leader of the Centre for Reproductive Rights, which made the search for the suspension of law from three of the five clinics of the State.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision was taken to the doctors from two clinics who had not spoken to the case and also made a statement to the authority of acceptance.
Louisiana includes 11 States that have adopted such laws and recently recognized such non-constitutional measures in Alabama and Mission.
The key part of the Texas law, which would close most of the remaining clinics in this State, was blocked by the Federal Court on Friday.
The fighters of the right to abortion, together with the American Academy Collections and Ginekologists and the American Medical Association, said that the authority laws of receipt are imposed on doctors who do not need to be medicational.
The abortion opposites that such measures are aimed at protecting women, although some have also noted their positive effects in closing clinics.
Only one doctor who does abortions in Louisiana has the authority of receiving in the hospital, reported the Centre on Reproductive Rights.
If all the other doctors in the State are required to stop implementing this procedure, the doctor, fearing for his security, would stop implementing the procedure, reported the group.
The criticism of this decision, the officials of the Louisians said that they would not be punished by the doctors who were aborted until their statement was taken to the authority.
What will introduce the cube to the fertilizing products
At least half of the products in each kind of trade networks must be Russian production, and Mrs. Gossip is considered to be the "Freely Russian" fraction of Olympic.
The parliamentary has prepared a draft legislation aimed at introducing protective measures regarding manufacturers, writes the Newspaper.
The document will still be detailed to avoid the possible discomfort for buyers.
This concerns goods that are not produced in Russia, and other groups of products produced in Russia must provide at least half of their feet to the individual producers,” reported the Nile.
However, the draft legislation amended in the article “On the basis of the government management of trade in RF” provides changes in the Tax Code establishing a decrease rate of 10 per cent in the implementation of products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing 50 per cent of the cow in trade networks includes the stimulating package for Russian producers.
The devices appear in a number of times more personal goods.
However, the initiative may have both positive and negative effects, says experts.
According to the Advocate of the Nalgovic Company, a member of the independent expert centre of Sergey Litvianko, Russian economy, and for a private agricultural and food sector will have a positive nature, and will lead to growth.
In addition, farmers, farmers, small business are produced.
They'll be able to sell more, and that's what the profit will grow.
They will also receive the right to dictate the ritualists of their conditions and prices, as they will be obliged to purchase their goods.
Russian producers will be able to make up their activities and sales to higher tax payments than previously.
This increases the income of the budget, establishing new jobs, some sectors will start to expand what is faster, will contribute to GDP growth.
Russia's dependence from foreign food will be cut several times, in fact not soon," notes the expert.
Previous Russian enterprises often couldn't try to use local shops because of a high competitive part of the shipping analysis.
Now, after the embargo introduced, it was free and can be reliefed.
However, it should not be forgotten that after all the necessary agreements and sanitary checks on the Russian market food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia.
In other words, there's a "measure" now when the previous games have gone, and the new ones have not yet come.
About a month later, you can talk about the growing demand on the basis and the growth of the prices for prepared product," said Iaf.ru, the first Vice-Vice-President of the Russian General Public Organization, the Russian Financial Club of the Financial Directors, to the Casian Tamar.
Similarly, the idea of sale in each category as at least 50 per cent of Russian food products makes it possible to strengthen the sector for local producers.
In that case, they will competite each other, not with goods supported by the other State, but with goods.
In other words, the fight against the buyer is deployed between the companies working under the single law of the sector.
On the other hand, Casia notes that Russian producers are able to meet 50 per cent of the internal needs of co-economists far beyond all articles.
In this situation, trade networks should be "trained" by the Russian products to the half of the assortin.
Consequently, fears are increased that non-called goods are produced on the packaging.
Maybe there will be shocked products with switch-tracked tissue in Russia,” adds the expert.
The inevitably effect of the importation of knots feel great trade networks, especially those who benefit to cooperate with importers.
It is logically that foreign suppliers themselves suffer, since their products are decreased.
Lithuania does not exclude that the cowboy law may also reflect on consumers.
The fact is that some Russian production products may be in the quality of import analysis, while the purchase can be able to condemn prices on the second as a deficit product.
At the beginning of the 2000s, the economists' importation ideas were re-embraced again in February that year because of the unprecedented routine.
The question of refusal of import products is now more effective on the background of the western relationships.
The Law is intended to bind riders in the forming of orders to provide providers to be considered to be the individual producers.
Then we are much faster and surely going through the import replacement, and the production system for the necessary production will be created in a shorter time," says Mr. Oлег Nilo.
Specially effective coal mechanisms will be for agricultural sectors, where particularly high capacity in milk sectors, for example, where the import share was 25 per cent.
Our farmers are really able to fully close the packaging of Russian shops.
Furthermore, a powerful impulse may also receive milk production.
As it is known, the largest part of imports remains in the guest, from 30 per cent to 35 per cent.
It is, 65-70% of the Russian products are in the whole place," says Casia.
Experts believe that the introduction of cubes to unfavourable products can enable import remarks and can accelerate the process.
However, this initiative will not take its own importation, since this requires a set of measures, certainly in Lithuania.
In any case, 50 per cent of the goods sold pursuant to this initiative may still be carried out from the border, which means that the full import replace will not occur, but significant steps will be made in that direction.
Nevertheless, it is necessary to establish the cubes in the country to make it possible for those cubits to do.
The data of the cubes as a time are guaranteed and provided," constitutes an expert.
The unexpected diagnosis and the absence of access to optimistic treatment means that ice cancer in rural areas is more killing
Angelina Joly and her brother James published a video of their death mother, who died from ice cancer in 2007.
Women in the rural area of Australia have a higher risk of death from egg cancer than those living in towns.
Studiers analyzed the cards of disease over 1100 Australian women with the "Yang cancer" in 2005, found that only 35 per cent had been survived five years after the diagnosis was placed.
The student, Susan Jordan, from the Institute of Medicine Studies QIMR Berghofer, reported that the possibility of death during the survey is 20 per cent of those living in the regions and distant state than those living in the urban areas.
NEW ISSOLUTION: New medicines can reduce light cancer and egg cancer
For researchers, women had seven years of medical path.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of women at the time of the diagnosis, the type of egg cancer, the existing of current diseases and social status also affected the possibility of survival.
Women of older age and cancers had the lowest survival rates at the time of diagnosis at the later stage.
For those living in regions or far away from the State, the possibility of death during the study was 20 per cent above than those living in the urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living beyond the cities were more likely to die from the hemisphere cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that the temporary diagnosis and the absence of access to optimal treatment could be possible.
“The disease is best treated by surgery specialized in genecological hemogology, and they are mainly in large cities,” she said.
In spite of the improvement of the quality of the electedic services to reduce the impact of the distance, it suggested that the increased number of travel services, which allows specialists to treat women closer to their home, and the support programmes for persons who have been conducted far from their home can help.
Dr. Jordan said that, despite the geographical situation, the study showed that long-term life among women with skin cancer was rare, emphasized the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
A study funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, 33-year-old young mother with the Zolfo Beach, Elish Nieve said that it had a aggressive form of egg cancer.
In September, the new FAAP gates in the Kuwait area

Inflation left out of the department.
Whether Russian rare growth of prices
As a result of the recreational sanctions of RF and Western inflation in Russia, the authorities are convinced to be analysis of the BTB Capital.
Experts believe that the impacts of the sanctions will lead to inflation shock in the first quarter of 2015, writes RBK Daily.
According to the last Mine Economic Development Provision, inflation is 6.5-7.5 per cent in 2014, in the next year and less than 6.5 per cent.
However, according to the Commersant newspapers, the EFTA has to be introduced in the macro-economic prognosis until 2017.
According to the publication, the State may reduce inflation assessment for 2015, which allows it to eliminate expected increase in population income.
The prognosis suggested that food sanctions of RF operate annually until August 2015.
How could such a situation predict such a high inflation?
The present situation is a different shock, but the low inflation tren is not changed,” said the source of the Minnesota newspaper.
Economists from the BTB Capital do not share the expectations of the Government ' s financial and economic block on inflation and prevent the growth of prices in 2014 at 8%.
The main effect of product prohibitions will begin together with the possible RF taxes in the RF regions (PNP) in 2015, which are convinced by experts.
Inflation pipe for 9 per cent is required in February, after the annual price growth rates are going to fall, experts believe.
In the past week, Ross has brought the first inflation results after the RF introduced "accurate sanctions".
Iaf.ru asked experts and clarified their inflation expectations.
Arteum Daev, director of the FC A Forex Analytic Department:
The growth of prices is already observed in the main segments of goods.
Furthermore, when socially important products began to sell, the Government had to initiate the system monitoring of value stability to prevent the risks of implicit increased prices in a short-term perspective.
The suppliers and ritualists are already counted on a daily basis before the regulatory bodies, so that the authorities know exactly who, and for what reason, has the initiative of increased prices.
The key factors of the growth index of consumer prices continue to remain the colonial levels of capital, excessive refinancing of the banking sector from the Russian mega-regulator, internal convergence for the cause of refugee in foreign currency, as well as the embargo for the import of food products from countries joined to the sanctions against Russia.
If inflation pressure remains under control, the cost of the minimum production of the product would not be 12 per cent for only one quarter.
The prohibition for the import of food products was a shock of proposals on the internal market and made a completely logical increase in the standard value.
As we are not fully able to launch the import reemployment mechanism and to increase the autonomy of the Russian market through internal production, responsible sanctions will continue to bring the risk of growth in inflation composition.
If you add any more physical reasons related to the lack of confidence in national currency and the worst economic growth perspectives, inflation may be over to 8 per cent at the end of this year.
Alexandre Ravuv, Director of the Alpary Analytic Department
In the 1990s inflation sometimes reached 20 to 30 per cent in the month, it was also higher than the current level, another case that the rapid economic growth was paid.
I think inflation is 8-8.5 per cent over the year.
Platon Maguta, managing the IC "Maguta Fund" assets
The external factor related to the sanctions against Russia until it has succeeded, but if pressure is further increased, mainly the financial sector may lead to certain difficulties and increase inflation expectations of the population, which are usually traditionally shown in the purchase of a valuable currency in order to overcome their reserves.
It may be suggested that the Government, the CDC and the Ministry of Finance are trying to reduce the slowness of the rule, such as market methods, and public regulations.
But the growth of prices begins traditionally after the summer, and it may be more sensitive.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia at 7.5 per cent, probably, is because the FF is still financially equipped.
Sadductive centres are suffered from a reduction in the number of contractors
Such a decrease of an exclusive age of 35 years of age may lead to the loss of ten million feet per year when the today youth demandors have reached the basic age of sanitation, according to the HTA study reported to the Financial Times.
According to this report, people who have a housing in the average 55 per cent of the amount of which the own households are expenditured.
It mentions the increase in the number of people living in high urbanized areas without gardens, the population of twice in front of the park house and the reduction of the garden size as other factors that are threatened for the sector, the annual sale of £5 billion at estimates.
In the majority of London, where the number of households was from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, the lower price in Britain is the domestic harvest rate.
The HTA and the Kingdom Sadducing Society reported that the absence of housing and garden spaces does not mean that people could not grow.
Gay Barter, the principal Savings Adviser in RHS, said: "The rebuilding of plants in containers, for example, is popular to ardenators who can transport plants with themselves when they move. "
The HTA report determined the period between 1997 and 2005 as a " smooth " market for savings as a result of the increase in the number of contractors and economic prosperity from the end of the 1980s to the middle of the 1990s.
It also suggests that the market will be improved in this year by a better weather after unpleasant conditions in March and April last year.

The largest Chinese companies joined against Alababa
Chinese companies, among which the largest market in China, the Dalian Wanda Group and the Tencent Holdings Internet (Sociétés, Messengers and Dr.) and Baidu (the main Chinese searching company), are building a company that will competite on the online trade market with Alibaba.
However, the miracle of Chinese Internet, which was left behind its American partners - eBay and Amazon.com, will not be easy.
The Greatest Union
The company is planned to set up a joint company of $5 billion ($814 million), 70 per cent of which will belong to Wanda and 15 per cent of the Internet Companies, reported in the Walla Group.
Registration of the company is planned in Hong Kong.
The SS combines the search services of Baidu with the popular WeChat social platform (the main number of users, which are about 438 million people), Tencent and Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to the network of 40 phenomenonal hotels of the Wanda Group, at least 49 installations of trade in movement throughout China and 40 commercial centres are managed.
Last year the company invested $50 billion in the construction of film studios and the thematic park in Zindao (the reward on the east of China on the Yellow Sea).
The project is expected to accumulate more than 1 million visitors annually and bring $960 million income.
Moreover, the Walla belongs to the American China Network of AMC Entertainment Holdings, which makes the company a larger cinema operator in the world.
In 2015, Wanda plans to equipment all its own commercial centres, hotels and places for e-commerce services, which are being developed as a timely formed Alibaba competition.
According to Dun Zé, who is launching a new company, Wanda is able to increase the number of users of their e-commerce services from the current 40 million to 100 million to the next year.
The new area should be the largest online-to-offline platform, notes Dun Zé.
Online-to-to-offline (O2O) trade is in the introduction of buyers in the Internet so that they have been in general oil magazine or purchased other traditional services.
The classical example of O2O are purchase services for a group or Vigoda.ru.
O2O is the biggest "pigs" in the online market, stated the leader Wanda Van Zynland (quote for Bloomberg).
"The present area of O2O in China does not exist, and the possibilities in this situation are almost equal to all", he believes.
The Chinese internet market is larger in the world, and, according to McKinsey & Co., it will increase more than three times to 2015 compared to 2011, to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese users have grown up to 632 million, bringing Bloomberg official statistics: it is more than the population of any world, except India.
According to the prognoses, this number can grow up to 850 million people until 2015.
The richest Union
Head of Tencent Ma Hutan, China's richest man before recently, but, according to the Broomberg Index, Alibaba Jack Ma has already deposed $5.5 billion.
The state of Jack Ma is estimated by $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion are the share of the Alababa.
The leader of Baidu Robin Li is now a third place among the richest people of China, while Van Zyannin from Wanda is the fourth raying building.
"Their battle is very interesting to observe: three of the richest people are working to get more rich, " said Bloomberg, director of the Chinese Centre for Electronic Trade in Hanchoo Zio Lay.
But he believes that a new company is not able to competite with Alibaba immediately after creating: "Rim cannot be built for one day."
The fact that Alababa is not so simple to compare not only new companies but also the leading leaders of the World Trade on the World Trade, the document published on the Alababa financial indicators for the last quarter.
Alibaba often describes something more medium between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June the Chinese company paid more than both its American competitors.
A total income of Alibaba for period almost two times exceeds the same amount of competitors, which grew nearly three times per year and was $1.99 billion.
"Alibaba has still a huge capacity to generate money, in many ways through its mobile applications," commented Bloomberg's analysis report from the Hong Kong Arete Research Service.
According to the updated view of Alibaba on the United States Value Bugs Commission, the number of mobile service users in July was 188 million, which significantly exceeds the marginal rate (163 million).
At that time, 32.8 per cent of all transactions of Alababa were at the mobile devices.
Alibaba should be called the value of its actions before the IPO.
According to the average assessment of 11 Broomberg analysis, the company may be evaluated at $187 billion after sale of shares.
According to Bloomberg's sources, Alababa may be held on 16th September.
The Road-show company, before this event, starts 3 September.
It is expected that Alibaba would be recursive in the NYSE history and allow the company to spend $20 billion.
Together, the refund of the United States shipping funds belonged to the Visa payment system, which made its shares primary in 2008, $17.9 billion.
At least half of the food products in trade networks must be Russian production, as Mrs.

The Police Chief of Magaloup has been accused of corruption
The people presented the provision of the complaint by the police and officials of Calvine municipality in the office of the State Prosecutor of Mallorki on Friday.
Calvin Police Chief on Mallorca's smoke island was arrested as a result of corruption by businessmen and owners of bars in a scandally known centre of the unrecognised drink of Malawi.
The main inspector José Antonio Navarro was placed under detention by the accused of corruption against him by several employees with Punta Balen, the street where most bars and night clubs of Magalua.
According to the daily online building of Mallorca Diario, the scholars presented evidence of the requirement from the police and officials of Calvine municipality in the Office of the Prosecutor of Mallorki against Corruption on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the National Guard of Spain for corruption accused and will be invited to the judge together with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC reported that the unwanted owners of the night clubs said that Protectionism from the authorities is seriously reflected in the state of their business.
"There's no longer about paying money, it's about to survive," said one of the businessmen.
You can't threaten our sources of existence.
We're nothing to lose.
Malawi has been in the title of the international press this year after a popular video on YouTube, which has been shown by a 18-year-old British relaxer who made a minute for 24 men during shocking bars.
The island authorities have since then tried to stop the abuse in the nervous situation among the relaxing Malalauths, with a minimum number of channels known for barriers.
Furthermore, the Playhouse club, where a mine incident occurred, was closed for year, while the playhouse and the carnage bars were shocked at $55,000 ($73,000).
Tourism smokers, mostly popular among young British relaxers, were also a place of numerous accidents in the condition of alcoholism related to a sweet smuggling known as "balconing " when people swim from one balcone to another or with balcony in the guest bathroom.
The first spring day is marked by mocks and wind conditions affected by the Adelida Airport
The VESN has prepared a cold surprises on the south of South Australia, providing rain and strong winds that have affected the flights in the Adelaide Airport.
Another 5 meters of rain slowed to 9 nights, following 6.6 m, which went on Sunday night.
The last rain predicted a couple of short swimming swimming swimming swimming winds, including the snake that began soon until 8 nights and led about 4 miles per minutes.
After winter issued early spring for the past week, the temperature was recovered in the moon until the maximum of 15.8C in the city.
The shortest conditions, as predicted, were one of the reasons for the delay of the shipping of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne in Adelaide.
The summer was to be landed on the planning immediately after 7:30 a.m., but the wind slowly changed the slow speed or the direction of the wind to a short distance was required to take the height.
The wind passements reached 50 km/h on the ground at the Adelaide at that time.
The flights showed that the aircraft had to be higher during the second floor, and the aircraft was at the end of the night at about 8:40.
The delay of this race was called for a delay of several other races, including the Rail Emirates from Dubaa and Qantas from Sidnea.
Maxim 16C is predicted in Adelaide in Monday with the probability of one or two liquids.
The calculation of the RF building objects will be new
The cost-education issues, the management of the building sector and the problems of the Federal Antimonopolis Service of the Federal Anti-Monopolis networks are specially monitored.
In the UNFPA, the expert Committee on Competition Development in the Construction Area was established.
At its meeting, the head of the JKK, the construction and natural resources of the FASA Vadim Solove stated that “the annual estimation of the Building Objects is absolutely unreasonable”.
The normal basis makes prices not transparency and may lead to an unreasonable cost of construction.
They propose the value of the construction of hostship objects at the projecting stage to determine the market prices of constructive decisions instead of the current estimated standards and unique technological estimates.
These proposals are made in the road map and are now being reviewed in the mine.
" The name of the traditional measuring documentation in the construction of constructive elements should lead to a less corruption in the area - explained " GRB " by the Wodim Soviet.
Since now, every ball and cycling is discussed, and it is not always possible to check everything, so at times in documentation the unexpected constructive companies may be covered by the "this tractor".
The FASS and the FAO are agreed.
The " Recent transitional costs for the constructive elements are already: the cost calculation methods developed for the cost of constructive solutions, the scope of these indicators, reported by the head of the department of Graduate activities and architecture of the mining Elena Jacques.
The area of road construction is selected as a pilot.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
As the head of the Profi-Invest company said, Anatolio Demianco, the estimated rules have been long slowed, but the other business mechanism has not been proposed.
"What the proposed constructive calculations are, it is difficult to implement in practice, since buildings are often useful of different technologies," he believes.
It is not a secret that the buildings are developed in many ways by the honourable.
According to the Chairman of the NGO ' s expert community of the Hospital Professionals, the State is the most powerful claimant today.
The Ingenieur of the Capital Capital Center, Rosato Vladimir Malakhov, pointed out that the market is divided today to companies with access to the contract port, and to companies who own monopoly competences and who do not allow competitors.
He believes that the establishment of a transit market may only be possible if the access to contracts will be maximumly affected by any management effects.
The expert Council was proposed to form the register system so that one of the same executives would not be able to receive more than 1 billion rule or more than 1 billion of contracts.
The mine believes that this approach is necessary to assess the impact on business and the effectiveness of construction.
In this case, Elena Joke explained that it would be necessary to provide a claimant of the genital contractor to increase the state number of claimants and budget costs on its content.
In that regard, the claimant should have knowledge that will enable assess the quality of the undertaking organizations and their security.
This division is often necessary to determine who would be responsible for the security of the object in general.
In addition, this approach may affect the deficiency of high-scale shareholders with regard to ininterestation in receiving an incomplete amount of work and a small amount of contract.
The signs of the expert and consultative Centre of the Institute of Procurements, Alexander Eustashenk, believe that the claim procedure now has become a business game for the contractor ' s carefulness.
The following example is: "In compliance with the complaint, " concrete indicators" should be defined without words: "or equivalent", "that should be", "other", "more", "anon", "also", "type", "no homological type", "not below", "left", "more", "move it may be", "return", "no later", "not allowed" and "t".
Thus, the claimers often use their right to establish requirements for the content of the complaints provided by the undertaking organizations.
Another issue of 44-FZ, considering the European Union, was the need to evaluate the quality of applications by means of the "building" proposal of the party.
In considering the request by the party, only the qualification of the contractor can be assessed, but not the quality of the work that has not yet been implemented, the expert believes.
The quality of work can only be assessed in their acceptance.
The expert Council was also proposed to transfer marginal income from the top to the lower eye to disappear interim contractors.
The Chairman of the expert Council, the secretariat, the FASC-introductor of Andrei Kingy, believes that this should not be done, as the order should be answered to the order.
And there's no way that the renowned Arcadia Ryan's Atel: "When are the claimers?".
Israeli children return to school after the war in the Gaza sector
Thousands of Israeli children in the territory of Gaza again went to the school on Monday after the flight in the bombs, when missiles and mines falled on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while the Gaza Sector schools remained closed when the territory was restored after the war.
The early school occupation has resulted in the joy and concern of those suffering from the missiles of South Israel, but the consequences of war action remained slow.
In the southern city of Ashdod, the child garden, in which the missile was slaughtered, took the results of the skins and the kids before the disciples arrived.
"We're a little scared, but we're glad to see in the future," said Ronita Bart, a resident of Kibuza Saad and an English speaker in his school.
Many children in our area really need to return to a great life.
She's 11-year-old daughter, Shaney Bart, said that she was starting back to school again.
"There was a hard time, and we didn't get out of our houses," she said.
The Chairman Reuben Rivlin visited the chibs that is close to the border of Gaza to express its support.
Before the war stopped last week, thousands of residents, such as Saad, did not go to the street or leave their homes, fleeting in more safeer areas from the Gaza sector to save from a rat and mining fire.
Many people who live in Nahal Oz, close to the border of Gaza, where a four-year-old Palestinian mine was killed, are doubtful that they should return.
The Ministry of Education reported that about two feet of the family was still not returned.
Their children were sent to other schools at that time.
Prime Minister Benjim Nyanjahu visited a school in Stheroth, a town on the border of Gaza, which was a great tribute to the Palestinian fire.
He recommended the children to learn hardly and said, "We will do everything possible to give you knowledge and ensure your security."
Israel and Hamas agreed that the last Tuesday would be unexpected.
The fire termination agreement immediately ended war action, but the key issues remained, for example, of the requirement for the elimination of the Egyptian and Israeli block of Gaza and of the opening of airports and marine ports in the Gaza sector.
Israel wants Hamas to put a weapon and return the body of two Israeli soldiers who died in the war.
It is expected that the new stage of non-direct negotiations will be started later in Egypt in this month.
More than 2100 Palestinians, among which three four were peaceful citizens, died in the war, and at least 494 children were estimated by the Palestinian and the United Nations.
Israel is opposed to these figures and claims that at least half of the murdered were slaughtered; despite this, he did not provide significant evidence that confirmed the approval.
66 soldiers and six peace-related people, including one Chinese employee.
During the fighting of Hamas and other Gaza's forces, 4591 missiles and mines were launched mostly in the south of the country.
The Israeli army, at that time, held over 5000 aircraft and other attacks.
Israeli attacks were damaged and destroyed thousands of houses in the Gaza sector, and estimated that 2500,000 people had been refugees in more than 100 schools, which were converted to hosts.
Because decades of thousands still were in hosts, and the fights continued, the responsibilities of education have been taken on the beginning of the year.
"I hope that the school will be open soon that we can end our education as children of the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammed Amara, a 13-year-old boy, who is now living in one of Gaza schools.
According to the popular price criteria, the winter growth of seven years has been shown.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic residence index increased by 1.1 per cent in August, reported RP data on Monday.
This increase has resulted in joint increase in June, July and August 4,2 per cent, the main increase in winter month since 2007.
The annual growth rate was 10.9 per cent, more than the double increase of 12 months to August 2013, but the increase was not equally distributed in the country.
The Director for RP Data Tim Loless reported that Sidne and Melbourne would lead to two-year markets.
RP Data shows that the living price in Side has grown by 16.1 per cent in the last year, while Melbourne is 11,7 per cent.
The following market powers were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where the prices in average increased from five to six per cent.
At the other end of the scale, Canberra had been reduced by government costs, where the prices were totally 1.4 per cent per year.
Mr. Lawless said that, when the early spring, the increase in the number of non-profit objects on sales during a few months later, which would be the "excellent test" for the market.
" Bearing in mind the current high level of the sales speed, the general high speed of sale and current conditions with a low percentage rate, the value of the housing may still be increased in the following three months," said he.
How people Live in the Old House
In the former house of Evedokham and his son, Ivan Dmidda, on the street of the Octjabri Revolution, 57/1 (the former Kazanic Great) 18 apartments.
The house of the XVIII century has not changed from the buildings if it was not to be sweet.
Military people are here as an excursion, and the people suffer more than their privileges - the right to live in a older physician house, the wall of Alexander Sucrova.
The date of the house building is uncertain, the historians indicate two dates: 1730 and 1737.
But in any case, there is no 300-year-old building.
An old door, always opening the door, scripting a box.
The doors of the apartment are close to each other, the walls were shocked, and the shooting shoes of the shooting shooting shooting shooting places.
Everyone seems to be honest.
And local people believe, "We don't think that's it."
It is very difficult to live in the village home of the 19th century,” says Tatiana Lukiano, a resident of apartment No. 3.
The object is on the hospital, but the money is not paid for decades, but we feel musical specimens that the authorities have just forgotten.
The last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls are still sweet, but the foundation is all predicted.
Many people still walk in the toilet on the street and pray for a week in the public bathroom.
How can we be satisfied in such conditions?
The road is walking directly under the windows, even the hot area is not available.
Dad's out of a breakfast.
Now there is only what it was heard: the flow of cars is under the windows.
Look, the kid's shields are constant, the window can't open, but the smell of the smell.
But the man is attractive to all things, to the good and bad.
Our apartment is still grateful, thanks to the husband, his hands are golden.
Moreover, we have two rooms, three live with my son.
And other families have a great worst, and in the second stage there are more than half meters of height.
For the contract, Tatiana is invited to go to a neighbourhood of the apartment No. 6 Ludmill of the Holiday.
A nice hospital woman from the flight offers a coffee shop and with a sweet smile:
We have a single apartment, a 14.5 m2 for four men, and we live: we're with husband and daughter.
I'm here since the birth, and there's no other housing, - Ludmila's got the eyes of the room: anthers, two wonderful letters "g"; one of them put a skin with a notebook.
It's very close and little different from the normal interview: only the slights are beautiful, "historical".
But from the slope, there is no water-driving system.
Ludmila speaks of her apartment typically and surprisingly as an Italian whose house is on the Roman ruin.
It is a very old and recent, daily and legendary one:
Water carried out about 40 years ago during the last repair.
Then we made a little kitchen in a cotton and a toilet from the old sweet.
We live at the second stage where David and his family apartment lived.
Our apartment is not privatized, right?
In the Centre of Inmobility, the WF says that privacy has no importance.
We are only obtained from a single apartment, we can't have more claims.
Four months ago, we were promised to smile us, but the promised case wasn't gone.
I didn't have to be complained and I'm not going to.
In this apartment, a whole dinasty died: my grandmother and my grandmother, my mother and Dad, I am with my husband and my daughter with my grandma.
It's all over that time.
For example, healthy cracks run to the kitchen.
Look at the wall of the floor, they're a metro!
They say it was cut into eggs, so it keeps it so long.
The house is based on the basis, thanks to Damid!
That's why no one has been killed by a trap or a swimming snack.
Only the building dies slowly in our eyes: soon and swimming houses are slow, the fields are slowly lost, we slowed the cement, but it's not useless.
They say that there is - under our room of a pool lace and walk to the Belarus River, which have been specially made by the older people here so that they could be able to be able to safely.
They were persecuted.
Ludmila Starstyna tells them how some historic came, praying to start in the apartment.
And then he escaped to give them a dwelling in exchange of his only one to Octjabri's vision.
Ludmila's history replied:
Where are we going to four in one?
And there's some crochet hope that they're going to give a housing more space.
We wouldn't have won anything anymore.
Nevertheless, the family of the Olds has won nothing.
The largest dream of Ludmila to be cut off, and the daughter of 16-year-old grandmother gave a single room.
The two families have set a double apartment instead of the greatest routines in which two generations are now living.
Simpatic, miniature girl Ollie Carsaka from apartment No. 11 and 12 shows the second stage of home.
There are two close rooms in the general area of 23 m2, named by the apartments, and its large family.
We all have seven, two children.
See what conditions.
The shooting is disabled by cuts, such as window frames, kitchen walls, and swimming dinners in the rooms.
Water in the roof of the year is only cold.
After visiting the apartments of the old house of Uffa, you can be sure that more have been blessed by the Lawrence Apartment No. 4.
They're doing the most space rooms of the first stage.
You're right, a lot of places!
A place in 75 squares, three men are described.
We live as once in the rooms where the legenda stopped Suvoro during his stay in Ufe, - says the head of the family Alexander Dmitrievi Lawrencey.
It's high. It's space.
One bad, all around the swimming swimming, disappearing, slowing.
The neighbors probably haven't told you!
The more painful of us with the fields: the trees were cut down, the land was literally out of the foot.
I've put up the shoes, the snakes, and there's nothing else in the room, and we're going to be in the other room as we're shooting on the shoes, so much.
About the house of the Eudoquem Demid, Alexander Dmitrievich, can tell you better any excursion.
The gold industry is like a family, says it with heavyness.
Indeed, the personality was unfavourable: the household of Kaghin and Uziyans built houses, swallowed the guns and the collars, holding the Ural machines.
The results of the purchase in movement are proud, but they don't want to live under one piece of history.
I lived here for a child in the 40s, Alexander Dmitrievich says.
Then there were tree buildings for cart, horses, and carawl buildings around, and then they were covered.
In 1968, they wanted to get out of our house, but something stopped...
The story repeated in 2014: again the new housing was taken.
As the team, we collected all documents, avoided the necessary instances, and soon we found that the apartment movement was transferred to 2015 or 2016.
We don't believe it anymore.
Two years ago, Lawrencej went to the Ministry of the Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan to know about the house court.
The people haven't accepted.
They sent from one table to another, and then, as they were, they issued a paper without signing and printing: "The Ministry of Culture does not affect the disappearance of the inhabitants."
I have even felt that our house has not been planned for a long time, since he was first under Number 57, and then became 57 A and now 57/1.
It's like it's been taken in the 70s.
The Russian planet was called on the leading information and analytical management sector of the UF of Wormura Barabasha.
The home on the street of the Octobre Revolution 57/1 includes a dwelling program.
I can't respond to the action of the 70s, but I know that there was a plan for the contribution of all old houses, despite historical importance.
Successfully, this happened, and the decision of modern authorities to restore all old houses on the street of the Octobre Revolution, representing architecture value, is successful.
Residents are planned to be displaced on the new apartments.
According to Barabasha, the rebuilding of Demidh's home will be Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.
It is now the architectural benzine in Italy, and the Stara Ufa project is presented there, including other.
I hope that all the former Kazakhstan Street will be refunded until 2016, says the official.
The house will be acquired a suitable species that had been before three centuries ago.
Damid's home may be a museum open for all the desires.
Furthermore, at the government level, it was decided to take the street in weekends.
Unfortunately, in the building there is no way to get too much income in the city.
The future museum of Vladimir Barabash is promised in 2015.
Otherwise, they will remain satisfied: their new apartments will be the same area as the present.
Just from another era.
The forest fire began in front of the shooting
The smooth gold has been the cause of the forest burden in the Oakhawn region of the Pool Zone of Provoor.
Force groups and resources are strengthened at the place of the expansion.
The CGSB's Guidelines of the Premior Aviation Aviation, which are established at the fireplace, require aviation adjustment.
Vasil Medvedev, Vice-Chairman of Aviation:
Fire in a difficult available place has found a guard aircraft with an An-2 pavilion aircraft at the 3-hectare area.
Guests in the old beach.
The strong decline of the territory and the circle of more than 45 degrees, the absence of the incentives for fire detachments are significantly complicated.
We need a Mi-8 helicopter.
The supply of powers in the Mi-2 helicopters and An-2 aircraft is extremely difficult.
After the finding of the fire on the place of the shooting, four shoes were operatively discovered.
The main task of specialists is that the fire and preparation of additional powers and burden means is to be made.
In the dinner area, 3 fire detentors are added to the Howard Heaven helicopters.
As the helicopters will be prepared for helicopters in the fire area, specialists will be moved to the kitchen place, it is reported on the Prior Administration website.
Lenny Henry: My father never understanded me.
I never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of the seventh children born in the family of Jamaican immigrants in Dadley in Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19 years old, worked on the manufacture, and their relationship was limited.
Henry is the committee, the Red Platform Rudy, which is partly based on imagined conversations with his father and has grown from a series of transmissions to Radio 4.
Saoundrek is a rhyg and a rhythm, and the melody is life-care.
However, Henry had to pass through some difficult memories of childhood.
After his mother's death, Henry often thinks about the relationship with his father.
He was unacceptable.
You never saw his face, you just heard his voice, "Cree to smile.
Get away from the sister.
Come on!
I want to look at the cricket.
My old brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a child, went to the pab and talked about things such as the shape of a bird stain, the beauty of a kidnapper.
I never talked to him like that.
He was such an unreasonable man in the edge that read a large part of my life.
He had recently opened a lithium master in Dadly, and although the conditions were better than his father’s day, he could see how to be his life.
There's little more than it's, but it's the dark, thick, deep labs with fire smells and houses and a cup of gardens.
My father was in the bathroom and just sit down there, and you heard he's starting to sing about himself because he wanted to get away from a lithium master.
When I came there, I realized he did these years and years to pay us for a survey, and I began to appreciate it more.
However, Henry went out of the child of the ill-paternal love.
My father never understood, never said, "I love you."
Only when Mom became bad at the end of her life, we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don Frank, allowed him to share the love that he had not enough in the child.
Can you stop this "I love you?"
Just stop seeing me!
Dad, I'm 22!
From Don Frank.
Why wouldn't I like to friend her?
She's a good mother.
They're still good friends with Frank whom he was married 25 years old.
Don is a good man.
Why wouldn't I have friends with Don?
She's a good mother.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
He was one of the ones that killed her.
So when I was very corrected and I had the symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "We have to take radical measures.
Then I started a serious physics study, and I also had to sit on a strict diamond to get out of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's ridiculous.
No one eats a marble.
The change of the carriage tractor, Henry, may have reflected in his pleasant, short-term strike.
Since he received a critical recognition for his hotel, he was loaded into the theatre.
He followed the Commons of Faults, and then Ogasta Wilson's Zabor.
This work is different from the networks and commodities that were an integral attribute of his native professional life.
He started the carriage when he was 16 and worked on the manufacture.
Dijay noticed how he's passing on the scene, and wrote about it to the New Face.
His TV carrière began in the middle of the seventy: "A long time I was the only black counterparty/commission."
He's learning at work.
I had not only to grow at public eyes, but I had to learn to be an effective shooting machine between 1975 and 1985, being a star, working on television, and it was very hard.
Lenny in the New People in 1975
As his manager had the right to the Black and white shooter, a light-shooting program in which people "his face", Henry found what it speaks for five years.
My family didn't like it.
I'm like, I want it never to be with me, but I'm not sorry that I did it.
Although it was a strange, appropriate condemnation of the position, I worked in large areas and learned to work with a whole.
But what was "the widespread reward of a simple developing class for the British television for years and years" was also the "Grothetic Parodi of Black People".
In the presentation of the people who were divided over the culture of black pools in Britain, Henry worked in an alternative commodity project in the eighteenth century.
The first session of "Shoo Lenny Henry" was translated in 1984, and in the nineteenth he was known as the head of Geret Blacklook from the commodity series "Chef".
Advertising roles, documental films, television and roles in the film took the next ten years of his life, but after his series in 2008, "LennyHenry.tv" he thought, "What are you going to do further, Len, because it seems little to be that you're slowing time or swimming into the side."
It was further a series of documentary transfers to radio 4 called "What's good to...?"
The first thing was Shexpire.
I had a real allergic for Shexpire.
I couldn't tell you that I was fully taught about this in school, and I thought it was, in many, the predicting of white people in the middle class with colleagues and the cut down the front.
So I was very scared of him.
Everything we're taking the interview, Peter Holl, Trevor Nann, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said, "You have to try.
Don't worry about it until you don't know what you're talking about.
Listen to some of these words, and you understand why we all love Shexpire so.
Henry's 20 lines from the last hotel monologist for documental transfer, and he's shocked.
I feel that I can.
Whatever my head has been corrected.
"There is a serious matter about this, learning your text, a small study.
So the replication process was hard, and I read this drink months and months before we put it.
And she had succeeded.
It seemed that they were waiting for disasters and that didn't happen.
Soon we started "The Error Communication".
Soon I was in National Theatre, and I couldn't believe it until the end.
It was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
And Henry felt instinctly that his business was to disclose the public.
"That voice inside me said, "You're going to work 10 minutes until they're doing a computer."
Instead, the assistant declared that the presentation would be renewed as far as the problem was resolved.
I went out of the scene and something in me said, "Oh, glory of God."
It's not my duty.
I can allow someone else to see this.
"You're playing a drink, stay in a role."
Henry in "Rabors" in Daches Theatre.
It was difficult to learn the text for the "Rabors".
Panic is very useful, it strengthens muscle.
She also took good care, so it was as a sign of the above that shows, "This is what you need to do."
He said that, of course, by the voice of the GROWIS.
So I'm holding it.
I really love this.
I like to be in the reception room.
Eventually, Henry's thinking of the comics is the whole way of our communication spend his humor when he starts, he's gonna finish a couple.
I just decided not to work in Standape, because this shooting is getting a mental reward from the full room of non-conciliators, I think it's very dangerous.
If you're always trying to do this, it can lead to the shooting.
I sometimes work in Apollo's Premier Ethiome, when I want, but, mainly, I don't get so happy as before.
I'm asking if he's gonna give a stendap tour anymore.
It's glad to sit in place with a register who helps make a form of start, medium and the end of the path -- I don't think I ever want to reject it.
That's his new involvement?
I think so.
I like to be a actor.
That's a nice fun.
You're always talking about a story, and you're here a good place for this.
I love the story.
People love history.
Kenya registers public servants to identify "invisible workers"
Kenya started a biometric registration of all State servants in order to remove "invisible workers" from the Government's payment state.
The officials who are not registered in the next two weeks will not be paid anymore in the Government's statement.
The Government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive payments after leaving the State service.
The President of Uhuru Kenita promised to reduce corruption in State structures after the authority in 2013.
Auditor verification previously found that at least $1 million ($70,0000) per month was paid by "invisible workers" and other financial violations.
The Government suspects that payments continue to be paid to bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves the public service, reports the BBC Vanjama Chabushiri reporter from the city of Nairobi.
All public servants should appear within the identification centres in the next two weeks to ensure that their data will be gathered through a biometric registration procedure, reported in the Government's statement.
Any who will not do this without a respectful reason will be extracted from the payment State shall be reported in it.
" This procedure is significantly enabled to rationalize the public service, defined the actual number of Government servants, and will also be used to clean up payment state at both government levels - therefore put the end of the problem of " invisible workers " , said Ann Weigur, the secretariat of the Ministers of Planning and Structure.
Decades of Turkish police arrested against Government
The total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey for suspicion in the "contraction against the Government " reported local information agencies.
The police representatives did not immediately comment on that information.
Among the detainees were 14 high-employed officers, reported by Hurriet Daily News.
Some of them participated in the detection of corruption events aimed at verifying Government staff, including four Government ministers.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested for suspecting the establishment of organized crime groups and telephone hearing.
Turk President Reaper Tyrep Erdogan (the first Prime Minister) identified them as a part of the measures taken against him and other in the Islamic crystal of Fethullah Gulen.
Not all children returned to Ukrainian school
The schools in most parts of Ukraine have again opened their doors on Monday (1 September) after the summer channels.
This day, traditionally, is a major event for the family, and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents, the Prime Minister of the Yankee has dismissed her daughter in school.
There he said to the expected journalists that not all schools were reopened again, but that he would do everything to protect the country for future generations:
The first September ceremony was not at each school.
There is no peaceful heaven over every part of Ukraine.
We have to fight for peaceful heaven.
The whole Ukraine, the large only Ukrainian national front, must fight for the peaceful heavens.
Alexandre Pastokhov, director of the school in Slaviansk, where she went to the daughter of Yasnuk, spoke in Russia.
We hope that the world will finally be established here and that children will receive knowledge that will benefit in their further life.
The first day of the schools, traditionally, notes that children swimming up the shoes, guard aircrafts into the hands and give their teachers colours.
In the face of Ronald Fairheed BBC, she might have found such an innocent leader that she needs.
It is a shock of glory from the world of bank business, media and the internal Tori Party.
Indeed, she has his own experience of the work on leadership.
Her carriage began to the Consulting Company of Bain and Co, and then continued to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the world of media in Pearsons.
She was Financial Times over seven years, when the high position in Pearson's main company took a colleague who worked lower.
They say she's near to $1 million.
Its political rating is also forgiven.
She recommended David Cameron to Lord Brown, former head of the BP, when he tried to bring specialists from the private sector in Witхоll: she became the advisor of the Ministerial Office.
Her husband, Thor's former adviser.
Previously in May, I called the chairman's work.
BBC is not only a large and complex organization in the heart of the public, but it has an internal paradox.
The Council has two directions: within the top level of the Governing Iérarchia, the BBC itself, but it is also a voice of public concern and concern when something is wrong.
It is almost unreasonable, which requires a full radical reform.
However, what new Chairman will risk coming, growing and destroying the institutions as complex as the Chinese dinastial if he itself remains working in this process.
This is a difficult decision.
It wouldn't be so difficult, but many people will be happy to see the BBC's decreasing size - after reviewing its powers, financial and status.
While competitors circle and new technologies shrink the calls of old attractions, unforgettable license negotiations are a special danger for BBC.
For the modest amount of £145.50 in the year, the Britishs have certainly acquired the largest medium business in the world.
BBC tells a good story: It claims that the results of its work are 96 per cent of households and are totally 40 hours per day.
Moreover, it is apparent that the population of Beeb is growing: 53 per cent is supported today against 31 per cent of 10 years ago.
The BBC models have changed: I now get news headers on mobile phones and look at the launched iPlayer programs.
But it remains very popular and inexperienced.
He needs the pre-president, I hope it's found.
Perry from Texas said that a lower Twitter was written to some bilaterally
Twitter with the confirmed gouvernant of Tehas, the Republic of Perry, on Sunday night, contained a depressive picture of the environmental prosecutor from democracies, which is in the centre of criminal sanctions for abusing of authority.
The Twitter was later removed, and he was following another of Perry's accommodation, where the record was denied.
Only with my accommodation has been published on Twitter, which was written by some multilaterally.
"I don't approve this Twitter, and I took it", reports the late record.
Perry assistants did not immediately respond to the communication requesting to comment.
Although the records were downloaded with a confirmed Perry accommodation, it was unexpected who actually has been published in the flight.
Before the early Twitter, Travis Rosmery Lemberg was an uncertain prosecutor, who acknowledged the infringement in April 2013.
Perry made a prohibition to finance her state when she refused to leave the departure, which led to the election of a large prison in Ostin in this month against Perry, which is a potential candidate to the President at the elections of 2016.
"I'm not always understood the car in the state of drought, three times higher-permanent alcohol levels of blood, but when I do this, I pretend the accused of the Governor Perry for what he says about me."
I'm the drinkest democracy in Texas.
The Lemberg Wednesday has not been investigated with the participation of a large prison against Perry.
He was employed by Michael McKrum, a Special Prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed by the Republic of the Republic.
Perry did not admit himself guilty and called a political accusation.
His powerful legal team requested the judge who led this case to reject the accused act, claiming that the law used for the persecution of the Governor, which performed its duties more than all in the whole history of Texas, is declared that it is contrary to the Constitution.
Perry has stopped funding for $7.5 million from the State State Department of Public Control, which is based on Travis circle, and has been persecuting corruption in the Texas public sector when Lemberg refused to leave.
There were many official complaints from the public control group with left views.
Perry confirming availability is often updated, and sometimes becomes famous.
At the fifth stage of the Ivoire party during his presidency campaign in 2012, Perry answered to his hearing that he could get out of the game, publishing you with a photo that runs around the lake, and saying: "We are, Southern Caroline!"
Berkeley reports that the unmovable market returned to "normal state"
One of the most well-known farmers of London warned that the market of inmobility in South-East England returned to the normal level of activity.
The house in the capital was subject to a living demand and a tendency-building price, with a wide expansion of the fears that the credit post was subject to the Bank of England to establish the restrictions of hypothetic injury in June.
Tony Pidley, the constructive and chairman of an elite building company, said on Monday, "After the current financial year, the market returned to the normal level of transactions from 2013," added that this was the "stable working environment".
London’s inmobility market was shocked during the fall, as foreign buyers went into the capital.
The prices in the city increased by 18.5 per cent in the last year, according to the Earth Chamber, significantly decreased the average rate of 6.7 per cent in England and Wales in the whole.
The average market prices for private, accessible and study schemes in Berkeley increased about one five in the past year, reached 423000 £ at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the funds in recent months has been the less attractive for foreign purchasers, some of which also stopped introducing new taxes on non-motiveness and political ritoric around the potential "special tax" before the general elections in May next.
The London Inmobility Agency for Foxtons last week warned that the April Market Reform, which has been introduced more strictly, also affected the reduction of the market growth as the market purchase in mobility as well as prices in the second half of the year.
The frequency data from Bank of England on Monday showed the fall of the number of approved hypothetical shoes in June, predicting further housing markets.
The Hamptons International, another non-moving agency, has reduced its prognosis of the growth of the prices of the London in movement by 2015 to 3 per cent on the basis of that the prices of non-motiveness have already been decreased.
At the same time, the transactions were cut four compared to the previous year in London’s most road areas, such as Chelsea, Mayor and Kensington, on the information of the Wa Elis Agency.
Nevertheless, the home question was very benefitous for Berkeley, taking the amount of sales above 2,2 billion.
Mr. Pidley added: "The question of the good design and the best place remained previous and, reflecting this, the sales for the time remained."
In June, the company reported that the sale of 3742 new houses in this year until the end of April was almost thirder than in the precrisis peak of 2007.
The annual income to tax payment was 40 per cent compared to the previous year to £380 million, income up to 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
On Monday, before the yearly meeting of the company, Mr. Pijley reported that the preferential income of Berkeley for this year would meet the current market expectations.
According to the unilateral opinion of analysts, the income is expected to be paid to $450 million per year.
The amount of the shares of Berkeley was holding at £23,96 in the second half of the day at the London board.
Photographs published by Jennifer Laurens are published on the Internet
Jennifer Laurens is at the 85th ceremony for the annual premises of the American China Academy.
Photographics of the activist Jennifer Laurens, receiving the Oscar prize, were issued by the Hacker Internet, which believes that there are more 100 catalyst photos of the catalyst.
The representative of the "Great Games" confirmed that the photos of Lawrens were real and condemned the hacker for the "invasion in personal space".
He has been treated in law enforcement bodies, and they will follow anyone who publishes the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrens.
Photographs that were originally posted on the website of the 4-chan photos were obtained by the lack of the Apple iCloud online reserve system, and the victim 'catalog' includes the names of the South Women, including Rianna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winsted and Mary-Cait Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It's clear how many of these photos are, although the stars of Scott Pilligraim against all, have also been sentenced in Twitter.
"The one who looks at the photos we've done with my husband a few years ago, joining home, I hope you're proud of yourself," wrote Winstead in Twitter.
But Victoria Jastis from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victoria of Observer" checked that she wrote on the photos of the Twitter:
Let's stop it in the skin.
Buzzfeed reported on Sunday that the representative of the post-star Ariana Grande checked that the photos that she prefered to be drawn.
Exclusive exhibition from the new Roman Howard Jacob on love and letter "J" calling critics
They disappeared, better to say so, they gradually disappeared like a swimming card box left under rain.
Only a woman has told him that he was too serious, hard in society, pressed, closed, and may have been a little disappointed.
And then she slept his hand.
He saw disappointment in himself.
He was sweet like egg, yes.
The last victim of this colleague was a small Roman, from which he expected more than normally, the elimination of the single and lack of life and, perhaps, even some satisfaction.
Alinn Solomons was a tricky of beauty with shocked hair and a thrilling heart from the northern island village, more distant and sweet than Port Royben.
She came to the south of the satellite to the older one, who Kevern considered her tea, with the last result of the heritage of the house, but like a paradise, under a joyful name of the Ray Valley.
No one lived in the house for a few years.
In the bathrooms, the slippers were slowly sit down, and the slippers left their sequences on all windows that are sure that the house belongs to them; the garden of the shoes like the ginant shoes.
It was like a kitchen from a child book, a horrible and horrible garden with full secret.
In view of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose "J" Roman is included in the Bukerway Prize list in 2014.
The sharp list will be declared on the next week
Kevin and Aileen sit down, guarding the hands, in a sleeping shoe among the hot, enjoying unexpectedly warm birthday; they both spended into a slow console that had helped the country to smile music and a remarkable news when he looked at her baptized root feet, he recalled the old sing of a slight sweeter who loved him to listen to his father to his shoes in the house.
You have too big feet.
Because of their aggressiveness, the songs on the console have no longer played.
They were not prohibited - nothing was ownership - they were just not lost them anymore.
They helped to be archiving as the word "archy".
The public has done what would never be able to achieve commands and prescriptions, as well as the books of people have chosen the memories of the rich, the culinary books and the loved Romans of all musics.
Instead of this day, Kevern began playing on the imagined forthepiano and the smell of comic voice to swallow the great feet of Aline.
Alain didn't understand.
"It was a popular song of a jazz pianon, called Faths Waller," he said to her, automatedly put two fingers into the legs.
So he always did his father to stop J's letter before she gets out of his leg.
This started from the game they played when he was small.
His father played with her father as he told him.
Start a word with "J" forgetting the ring of two fingers, and that's going to stand on you.
It wasn't a very fun game then, and it wasn't very fun now.
He knew that he's waiting for this, that's all.
He was supposed to explain what's Jazz.
Alain never heard him.
Jaz did not play, although he was not openly prohibited.
The improving was out of the mode.
There's only one "example" in life.
When the melody started, people wanted to know exactly where it ends.
It's exactly the same with the stroke.
His inadvertence acted on nervous.
Jaz was a stroke expressed by music.
Although he reached a 10-year-old age, he never heard about Sammy Davis Mrousch, Kevern knew that the jazz of the father's disappointment collection.
But even if he didn't have to tell Alain that Faths Waller was black.
Notwithstanding her age, she remembered the time when the popular skins were not black.
Nevertheless, no law or pressure.
The society was obedient, and this means that each of his segments agreed with thanks to those who cast the judge, with the principle of group preference.
People in Africa and the Caribbean temperature and physical characteristics have been well approached to the field of disappearance and sports, and they were swinging and flying.
Indonesa expenditures, like the natural talents in all matters of electronics, have been taken to ensure that no family remained without the working electronic phone.
The remaining part of the Poland disappear was made by sanctuary work; the remaining of the Greek, a bigger ball.
The exiles from the Persian palace and Levant whose grandmother did not want to leave the country when TO, TO PROYSOSTLO, ECLICE WORHS ON WORKSTO has occurred, in fear that they were accused of smiling the smells, in fear, in the own way, that the smell will swallow them the following, opened the restaurants with the lab and the calians, and they were not shocked and shocked from the slaughter.
Each of the ability.
As she heard only the ballots before, Alain was difficult to understand how distressing words that just slaughtered her Kevin could actually be placed on music.
music is the expression of love.
"They are indeed not distressable," said Kevern.
Someone may be for people who have great feet.
My father never had a pain, but he sweared this song.
He said too much, but the launched garden gave him a security illusion.
No word was able to switch the sound-isolation of guigans like the clusters.
Allin's not understood.
How could your father love that?
He wanted to say that it's a sweet, but he didn't want to get two fingers back to her.
She's already considered it strange.
"He seemed awesome," he said instead.
She's shocked with her head, locked up the Cair's review.
There was nothing in the whole world, except her sweet-warm hairs.
Nothing he would like to look.
"No, if you say so," she said, staying at her opinion.
But this doesn't explain why you're going to eat her.
It seemed to be really disappointed.
I have too big feet?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
I don't know, maybe...
And you're saying you hate me because my bottles are too sweet?
Do I hate you?
Of course, I don't hate you.
It's just that stupid song.
He could say, "I love you," but it was too early for it.
"You like me just because you've got the biggest ships," he tried to say instead of it.
I've got a shock.
This was wrong.
He wanted it to be funny.
The attempt to smile was often brought him into a sweet situation, because as father, he did not have the oppressed condemnation that could smell the brutality smiling in the shock.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe, and he, Kevin, wanted.
Despite good eyes.
Alinn Solomon was shocked and stood from the shuttle, swallowed the console and fed the wine they drinked.
The wine from the bobbin, so the oppression couldn't serve him with justification.
In her concern, she seemed to have drove as palm letters in the uragan.
"And you like me just because you have a fool head," she said...
Even if you don't like it.
He was regretted her and because of the deceased of his words, and because of the fear that she appeared in her view when she gave him refusal.
Did she think he was shocking her?
She didn't talk to him about life in a cold northern archypology where she was grown, but he did not doubt that she was like a sweet.
The same large black ocean was slaughtered on both of them.
The same men, even more sensitive and attractive after the TOT, who had been killed by the men, who had been raised by the slaughter of the slaughter, who were willing to swallow the hands of any woman to reject or sign them.
Shut head?
They would show her a shock if she wouldn't be careful!
First, a dinner would become the most common expression of a fertile disaster between men and women; the opposite to the prestige ballots that had issued the console - first to eat it and then to shoot it.
Better accurate, according to Keverna ' s view, because he himself had already been matured.
Alain Solomon showed that he had to go.
He was up of the shirt as a old man.
She feeled like a skin pain, but his weight was surprised to her.
It was not the end of the light.
They've had to know each other.
She looked out, and she looked out of the upper window, and she looked out, her satellite was a man who had shooted on himself.
Adam, who leaves the garden, thought she.
She feeled a angry of compassion to her and to men, some of them, and he had taken up her hands.
A man who was away from her with a soft spot, shocked, shocked, all the ability to fight left him - why did she feel that she knew so well if she couldn't remember any case until this day when she saw that?
Another Alain Solomon looked at his feet.
For twenty years before the above-mentioned events or around Esme Nusbaum, a smart and energy 32-year researcher who had been working in the Office, the informal supervisory Service, prepared a small report on the maintenance of a low and medium-sized violence level in the country where it was expected that, if it was not completely stopped, it would be delayed, taking into account the means and forces provided for its eradication.
"My people have been done, and many are done," she wrote, "to strike the aggressiveness of people who were struggled in the thousand war and winned most of them, especially among these satellite winds and the swimming villages of the place, where, despite the ears of the churches, the breath of human goods was slowly shocked over the whole history.
Some qualitys, however, are unexpected.
Besides the shock, it seems to be less than the pains he hurts.
The population is smiling about sensitive ballots, the history of overcome obstacles, and announces its faith in the well-being of marriage and family life, but not only the old fertility remains a strong lack of both rural and rural communities, but also provides information that a new and bad threat in homes, workplaces, roads, and even rural areas.
"You have a dedication to write too much," her scientific leader said, reading the entire report.
I think you're gonna have to read less rumans.
Essme Nusbaum was cut off the head.
I have to ask you too, are you atheist?
"I think I should not answer," said Esma Nusbaum.
Are you lesbian?
Esma reiterated his right to private life and silence.
Phoenix?
Another silence.
"I'm asking", said Luther Rabinuz, "not because I am against atheism, forestity or feminism.
We don't have any warnings here.
We are the servants of society without warning.
But some kinds of hypersensitive, absolutely accepted and inspired themselves may sometimes tell results, such as what you have shown to me.
Obviously, you are warned against the church, and what you call "truck" and "truck", others would interpret as a expression of natural life and energy.
Keep on the TOM, WHAT FOR WORT, as it seems to have occurred if it happened last night, means to leave the country of its necessary life force.
Esme Nusbaum looked at the sides when Rabinez spoke.
On his head, racial as flamingo, light-did letters repeated the advice that Opnau gave the country the last fourth century or more.
Listen to your neighbor, prices of your couple, listen to the ballots, go to the muscles, talk on the phone, communicate, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
A conversation is better to silence, a word of song better than the written word, but nothing better for love.
"I really understand what you want to say," said Esme Nusbaum quietly when I convinced that her scientific leader ended saying, "and I don't want to say anything, except that we haven't been so effective as we are convinced.
I am worried that if we are not ready, we will find that we repeat the errors that have been made to TOMU, WHAT PROYSOLO, HOW WORK THE PROCEDURE.
Only this time we will turn out our wrath and infidelity to others.
Luther Rabinuz connected the fingers in the piramid.
This jealousy was to mean unnecessary patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "invoking the "error" actions that made or did our grandfathers.
You're going too far and when you're talking about they're cut off their angry and infidelity on the other ones.
There should be no need to remember that, understanding the past, we're not talking about ours and them.
There were no "nus" and no "others".
It was a time of uncleanness -- it's all we know.
"There, if being honest with himself," was intended to enter Esma, "no part of society can be well justified.
I'm not accusing anyone.
Whether it was bad or good - what was done, it was done.
Then it was.
There's nothing else to say - we're agreed here.
And as no one should blame, it should not be justified if it was appropriate or if something could be corrected.
But why's the past if not to learn?
The past is to forget it.
If I can add to this one word--
The pyramid of Luther Rabinician has disappeared.
"I'll consider your report," he said by leaving her.
On the next day, on the road to work, her motociclist was slaughtered on the throat, as described in the shock, "in a bad smile."
There's an accident.
Army Lesozo claims that the movement was not planned; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
The representatives of Lesozo checked the facts of the shifting for government relief, claiming that they had acted against the police suspected in the attempt to arme political fans.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, claiming that the army of the country had surrounded its official residence and cast up government buildings in the capital of Macera.
The Prime Minister took his family to the neighbor of South Africa, saying that he was threatened to seek his life.
The representative of the Army, Major Ntoi, declared that it wasn't actually a turn, but that the army had reacted to the threat of the "political fans", which the police tried to arme.
"What happened this morning, that the Lezzo Army Army Command has taken steps, receiving several information reports that there are some elements that are really planned to weaken some political, young political fans that were ready to build haos," he reported the United States.
The representative of the South African Government Clayson Mongel said that the army's action was a turn.
He said: "There is no one who has claimed to shut up the power, in all senses, that Lesoco armed forces acted at this time have the fundamental signs of the movement, " he said.
The representatives of Lesozo reported that the soldiers returned to the chairman on Sunday and that the capital was calm.
At the same time, the Vice-Minister Mottigo Metsing has managed the Government in the absence of Taban.
Tabana stated that it was believed that the attacks were caused by the attempt to fight corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesoco was very pressed since June when Taban has stopped parliamentary sessions as a result of disagreement in its joint Government.
He stated that his actions did not rape the Government, despite the accused of return.
The Chelsea Defender Marco Van Hinkel will take the next season in the Milan, reports Milan Channel.
The 21-year-old Dutch will come to Italy in the nearest hour for medical survey.
In the past season, he went to the field in the London club only three times.
Let's remember that previously, Millan's headed to the Liverpool attacking Fernando Torres.
Production in euro at the lowest rate of 13 months
The growth in Europe was delayed to the low rate of 13 months in August, according to the popular research.
The latest value of the business activity index (PMI) in the marketing sector was notified in August, from 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders were detained, and undertaking suffered between the EU and Russia in relation to Ukraine.
The importance was made before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) in Friday.
The lines will be expected from the bank ' s clear plan to deal with the stopping of the euro and the threat to defect in inflation that represents a total of 0.3 per cent.
There is a suggestion that the ECB Mario Dragy leader may later give additional signs that he considers a quantitative relief schedule for the euro, similar to those used by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Their growth is more clear than any growth, the fluctuous effect of growth in economic and geopolitical incertitude for producers," said Rob Dobson, the elderly market economist.
The production sector in Germany, the largest Russian trade partner in the EU, has fallen to the lowest than 11 months of note 51.4.
As a result, in the second dimension of the block economy, France, the SME has dropped up to 46.9.
France continues to cause current concern, as well as the deficiency of Italy from stability growth to stability.
Given that the impulse of growth in the main industrial engine, Germany and Spain does not add confidence,” said Mr. Dobson.
The shortage of the industry, more likely, remains in the fire of analytics expecting additional monetary or fiscal stimulation.
One positive news was from Ireland, where SMEs increased up to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, the principal economist of IHS Global Insight, said: "There is less than it can be said about the augustic study of the Euro-Productive Industry Index, which shows that the sector still grows."
He added: " The Europeans, apparently, have lived very difficult in this time, since the current increased geopolitical tension - especially related to Russia/Ukrainian - adds non-determination in many countries.
This increased tension apparently has been attacked by business - and especially by consumers’ confidence, and it is likely that some orders are delayed or even rejected, especially large orders.
He said that "every more like it," that the ECB, finally, must be carried out a certain variety of quantities, "we want to suspect that it will be limited."
The people of Mariopol will have a live cep against the rulers
In Mariopol, before the last week, it was quiet - nobody had been able to organize the National Republic of Mariopol, the city was living and working in the Asian Sea.
Now, people with fear are waiting for the arrival of the Policeans.
According to politicians, separators are passed to Mariopol to go to the Asian Sea - recently taken the city of Newoazowski, which has not yet entered into the self-employed Republic.
The marihupolitans decided that the Ukrainian army was going to protect them, but they had a little against the extremely armed representatives of the DNA-LDN and had gathered assistance to the military.
They're knifes, building blocks and strengthening.
On Saturday night, a few thousand people came to the eastern border of the city, and they stood there in a living tent, raised by the mountain of Ukraine.
They are going to do the same in the case of the invasion.
Volunteers are collecting and receiving, collecting medicines, published newspapers.
In the city, shops are slowly closed, stop the work of banks and banks.
10 Years for the survivors of Beslan: Decades from the ill-school of school, as children who have been in her, have still suffered
Ten years ago, more than 1000 people were taken in the Tchéthan fighters in Beslaw, South Russia
More than 330 people, more than half of their children, were killed during this three-day trial test, which has struck the world
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who inflicted death during the school belief.
Some ten years later, after the terrible shock of the unlane school, 334 people died, including 186 children, who were hereby surviving catastrophy last night for the new appeal in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatis, hidden and killed children and parents at the beginning of the new fourth session of 1 September 2004, seemed to have a very great deal of evil.
Tragedy has combined the east and western retreat, which was wonderfully growing into action and hope for the future in the conditions of serious tribulation.
Decades later, we returned to Beslan to the south of Russia to find some of the victims who were inflicted to death during the schoolbishop.
We have found wonderful young people who have opposed the calamity, although the remembering of the terrorism is going to live with them forever.
The greatest hope of them?
What a war that is now quoting Ukraine, in which the children died as they are, now stopped.
The girl who's trying to get back to a shooting room on the photo
It was printed on the picture of a famous Russian photo, Dmitri Bellaka, when he tried to get back to a shooting sports hall after the shock of the mine.
Aid was desperately looking for her mother, Laris, who is now 40.
They were feared that both they died, but actually they survived.
"The woman told me to run out of all the powers, but I couldn't," said Ida.
My feet were broken with blood.
I stood and put back inside to find my mother.
The Soldat took her and took her in a safe place.
After the surgery of the operation, she thought it was completely restored, but he said last night, "Thir months ago he was angry.
I'm afraid, I can need more operations.
A few bottles remained in my core.
Its purpose is to be a dancer, to help people as well as the doctors have helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but, of course, she didn't cut her", she says with a call.
"This happened with me, and I can't change this fact.
Once a year, I'm always going to this sporting room to remember all those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about this in other days.
It's too strong.
My best friend, who had to be my girlfriend, was killed there.
We played together when we were little, and we dreamed that we were going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I'm not going to work.
I'll think about the family later.
She says she's sweet with her, although the memories are smelling every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our disasters, and we are so grateful for the help that we have received from the people from Britain and out there.
When I'm seeing in the Internet photo where I'm driving in the school window, I think many people will see it first, know our tragedy, and do so that doesn't happen anymore.
The boy who runs through the grain of a pool, thinking that his mother was dead.
It was his first day in school (the Russians starting a school at seven years) and survived three days of smooth, understood by their mother Tamar.
Then he was seven, and he said, "Mother said to me that if the explosion would be, and keep it in the hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she would die.
She said, "Good."
Being fearing that she was dead, he fled and on the road saw a laughing boy, took a child behind his hand and fly through the grain of a ball.
His father, Vladimir, who took his son outside, said, "Damir told me that his mother died.
He said, "I can't save her."
In fact, Tamara was elected to freedom and was in the hospital with feet on his feet, in his own mind, thinking that her son was dead.
After their unions, she said, "I cry with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He escaped and captured me.
Amira later arrived to London (the present unbelieving news of the World), where he was rewarded as the Protector of children from the Barnardo's Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Shery.
"This fear returns to you every day, but I would like to stop remembering him," said he yesterday.
I can't say he's smelling in my memory.
I remember as soon as I put all my game weapons out.
But now I can play in computer games with a gun, and it's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to return to that sports room, but I don't think about myself.
I remember the kids I played in the room that didn't have a choice.
We never say they're killed or dead.
We're saying they're staying in the sport room.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially a playing shop where I was allowed to choose everything I want, and a journey in the car with an open top.
But now he's afraid of the places like Ukraine where wars bring to the tribulation that he and his friends survived.
This fear comes back to you every day, but I would like to stop remembering him.
"I'm so sorry all those suffering from these fears," said Damal, who had done a voluntary work last week in the women's monastery.
I want to help you so.
I would like to serve to the police and hope that I will be counted in the next year.
His mother Tamara, 48 years old, said, "37 children were killed in our quarrel, can you imagine yourself?
I remember the smell of the calm right after the shoot, but there was no children who would cry and run around, and this quiet continued for many months.
She's gonna remember her trip with Damor to London.
People in London were crying when I told us our story.
I understood how people at the other end of the earth can understand our feelings can support.
She was grateful "Sherry Blair and her fund for that reward and the opportunity to go to London in October 2004.
I would like to call Sheri and just tell her that 10 years ago, but I still remember her and her husband in London and how they helped Damy and me.
I remember, when Damor wanted to eat, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with the officers in the restaurant, Damar shot them out of his water weapon, and they run and played with him.
And the whole month after our cosmetic, he went.
I was surprised that the British people were so prepared to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I think all this world is not better than these 10 years.
Now the war is in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think many children have been killed and will be killed.
It's just the same kids as ours.
I think for many people of war, it's a news report that they're listening when they're crazy or when they're doing something else.
I just know that these people feel, horrible.
And I can't stop feeling him.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill one another, and that's so painful.
Damy grew up and became a very calm and peaceful boy, not agressive and not abominable.
He's not looking for places, for example, he's not circled on this past cosmart.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close to six colleagues, and they're going to a sporting room from time and smell there.
When he was younger, he suffered from that - I remember when he stood on the guard, turning away from us, hours.
He wasn't sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he cast out all his weapons and other military games, and I am now 17, he is above me, simpatic, intelligent and healthy.
I'm sure I've been so sure he's dead and I'm never seeing him anymore.
When I was able to justify from the explosion and up on the feet, I saw the hell around myself when the body was slept all over there.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could survive in this fool.
"I remembered that I cryed to him, "Damir, run, run!" but again I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard and escaped.
That is a life for us, in contrast with many others.
Georgium Ilin, 17 years
A boy whose shocking photo after the shoot became a determining tragedy in Beslawn
Dead: Beslan Georgy Ilin and his mother Fatima after the end of 2004 and Georgy today
On his shocked face, it was an impression of fear when he was saved from the death when the Tschechian terrorists shot him with the class.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarics in Beslawn.
His mother, Phoenima, in 54, led him to school at the first day of school before taking him the older son of Wormir to the University.
"I went for two minutes before the terrorists run into the door, so my little boy remained one for three days," she remembered.
Not one, there was the family of our parents, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgy could survive.
How close it is, it's harder to think and talk about it.
There's no day when we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes of these days for me in front of my eyes.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
Western soul: Photo of Georgia (left) was one of the most shocking pictures of the attack and was shocked in the sculpture (right)
I remember Georgie wanted to go to school on the day that he said he wanted to understand the teacher.
I just knew he was alive when I saw him at the television.
There is even a sculpture of Georgia's smiling in San Marino.
Georgy doesn't like to look at this photo, and it's hidden in our book shoes at home.
I understand, but I also think that through this photo, people from all the world feel our pain.
Georgy now says, "It's important that this never happens again.
"I doubt that we will ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragics and never know the truth.
Now they investigate the violation of Boing in Ukraine.
Do we ever know what she was called?
This world comes to something very bad.
"I can't understand how this happens, because if you ask people, nobody wants war, so how does that happen?
Ten years are nothing for such pain.
We need to pass for decades to forget her a little.
She affected my health, and I still feel her.
About three or four years of shock, I've been shocked, but now it's been better.
I returned to school in 2004, and I was very scared every day.
I thought about my friends and colleagues who were killed.
That's why I continue to go to this sports room before each September.
I want to give me a memory to my old friends.
I'm hard to get into the sports room, but I have to do it.
I don't feel a victim, this story is part of my past.
I'm not forgotten of this, but I don't feel mercy for myself.
My life continues.
I finished school this year and made a medical university at the Gouvernance.
I'm going to learn to be a cardiochurgo.
My first choice was to go to the army.
I wanted to be military, but the health hasn't allowed me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgium Farnive, 20 years
A boy who survived, despite the leg of a terrorist murderer
Incredible: Georgy Farniv was in the feet of the terrorist murderer during the defect, but he was still able to survive.
During the shutting, he was photographed in a sports hall sit down with a bomb in the foot of the terrorist murderer.
Actually, it's a wonder that he wasn't killed.
"Now it seems to be evening," says Georgy, who wanted to learn to the SSF office, but was not able to cause the damage caused by his health during the injury.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm the older now, and I say that the children are easy to handle the bad smells - I have to say that it's wrong.
"In 2006, I worked with psychologists, and I felt little better after that, but I can't forget it.
I would like to forget.
In 2005, the next year was the first and last time I entered this sports room again.
I lost my conscience.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show where I was on this known photo.
The survivors: Georgy Farniv today with an open football photo in the hospital after heating
My pain is great, and I'll put her with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or to discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
With regard to physical condition, I'm healthy.
I need to be careful with a colleague who was hurted, but now I'm fine.
But the whole health didn't let me go to the FBI Academy in San Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical conclusions, and they answered that it was impossible.
My second infringement was animals, so I went to the Water Institute.
I learned there two years.
He's learning to treat all animals from the cows to the bowl.
He said, "I know that I will never tell my children about my experience.
This is not what children need to know, and of course not what they have to survive.
His mother, Marina, was 42 years old, said, "This pain never leaves me.
She's in my soul, worse the birth is near.
I'm going to go and I'll be present at the ceremonys that will be held to notice it.
I know that Georgy will not go.
She should be stronger for him, because he was there, and I don't.
I was waiting for him home and I couldn't help.
I'm so grateful that he's returned to me, and here in Beslane's printing is on each other.
He's staying with us.
Georgy is now grown, but this is still with him.
It's hard to accept, when something is so badly injust, it happens to you.
He's a boy, he loves sports, but he can't take care of them because of the colleague.
He had several operations, he could walk, but he couldn't do a sport.
I would say he's over 50% overlooked this shooting, but it's impossible to overcome and forget it.
This weird experience remains with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the injury, and that's only to increase my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and were my ways.
My son with me, and it's the best gift that God could do to me, but my heart hurts those who were killed.
I know the family where new kids were born, but I know how older people have never been married.
It's hard to accept that life continues, even if you don't want.
I'm never gonna forget how the heart shooted me from the snake at the time I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what happens in the world is wars in different regions.
Why are these people fighting?
Why are they killing one another?
The war is very close to our country now, and I'll believe it.
We were a friendly country in the past, so how did we have to fight now?
People and children suffer, I'm sure many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If it could be able to approve and leave, so far as possible.
Alena Zcaeva, 10 years
A girl who has shocked a shock in a safe place.
Savior: Allan Chavhu is safe to the Russian fighter (left).
Now she's ten (right) and she will not really remember the wonderful crime.
The world has stopped breathing in 2004 when a small Alena was able to handle a high school in Belarus, the Russian police.
Terrorists left her, but with cruelness, they left her 30-year-old mother, Christine's sister and Brother Mahara in the sporting room.
Mahar, who was then three years old, was saved, but Alenian’s mother and sister died in a dead battle.
Her father Ruslan has been married again since they had a little daughter with his new Sweet wife, whose name was Christian in the memory of her lost daughter.
Alena, who is now ten, will not remember the sweet and grow into a smart and living girl, says the neighbor.
"He's a great happy family now, and Alena and Macar are both beautiful children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a magnificent father and wants to keep them away from all memories when the tenth anniversary is noted.
We can understand why.
Defenseer Sindzi Kagawa, returning from Martin Yuntead to the Dormud Bourse, said he was able to wait when he was able to go back to the field in the form of a German club.
He said that this transfer is a joyful event in the carriage.
Of course, I'm very glad I'm going to play again for the Borsey -- brings the image of Kagawa's words.
I feel very good.
Positive emotions and with enthusiasm when I can get out of the field again in the Bourtzian form.
Remember, Kagawa moved to the Mediterranean from Burundi in 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he was not able to shut up in the English club, conducting a total of 38 mass in the Championship of England, killing 6 pounds and delivering 8 resulting transfers.
Man is accused of traveling a girl at a swimming "pelican" shock in Fife
A 78-year-old man will be present before a court on a three-year-old girl at the "pelican" shipping in Fife.
Gordon Stuart would have killed a girl in Petevine in East New York.
Prosecutors stated that Mr. Stuart had made his Audi Q3 without adequate care and attention and killed the girl, as a result of her trauma.
Stuart, 78 years of age, was denied by his guilty in the Sheriff Court of Dani.
Sheriff Charles McNair, the Queen's lawyer, appointed the date of the court in January.
Obama, Mercel and Olland are not displaced in the Vladimir-Est
The shopping of Duty Free Airport, Vladimir-West airport, issued a table prohibiting the purchase of a number of world-wide political leaders.
Don't be disappointed by spirits, waters, and horns.
The Administration of Magazine decided that the President of the United States Barak Obama, the FIG Angela Mercelle, the President of France, France, Vitalia Clickko, Julia Timocchinco, the Prime Minister of Japan and other known goods would not be able to shoot the water, the horns and the spirits of their shops.
And it was on the door of the corresponding table.
Before, Obama was prohibited to appear at least available to him as a type of firm service, the Diathic Table of IMOs, as reported on the website of the company-building institutes.
Whether the President of the United States had a dream to ask in Russia's diathic table, but the authors of the bans are apparently strictly strict.
Is there a snare after the embargo: Medveiv gave the advisory to the Agrarians
The Prime Minister of Russia, Dmitri Medvedev, believes that, in the conditions of the Russian agriculture, new technologies should be undertaken to arrange the issue of displaced buriers in the purchasers.
The Council was given at the visit of the Southern Promoting Company Agroomplax.
The Head of Government also urged the restaurants to relocate the Russian meat, which is at the level of quality.
The annual embargo for food imports was imported in Russia from 7 August.
The main trainer of the Russian Valentin Masslake collected is welcomed by the outcomes of the tourist DecaNation.
According to the specialist, the third place is a good result, taking into account the absence of targeted training for recruitment.
Our sports have been speaking at their level - it brings all the sports.
The third place is confirming our high-level command level.
It is welcome that the advantage of French and even Americans over us is minimum.
I need to take into account that we weren't ready to do so.
The session was closed, and we did not bind our leaders to participate in the DecaNation Match.
In the past few years we became the second tower, but in this season we have updated the collection.
France, on the contrary, was a bomb team including 13 Championships of Europe.
They did not hide their intention to win this year, as they were several times publicly declared.
However, even such a composition was not able to oppose the Americans.
I therefore believe that the Russians have come to such a representative company at a good level.
But in some kinds, the results were at the order below than the British Liga.
It's finished.
Naturally, sports are not so important as well as command levels.
The main place was here.
As a result, it agreed to be the absorption when the men were so infected by the tactical shift pilots that showed the results below the average level... of women's escapes.
4 Indications How to get the best quality of photos and videos
If you want to picture or take a video under the water, you have a whole series of device options before you.
The most lowest option is the water-conducted "million", for example, Nikon Coolpix AW120, or GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are sold for $300.
I made these pictures on a family party with a few cameras, just $350.
Independing on what equipment you are using, several rules must be respected to the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a water-conduct camera, make sure that the battery and other cameras are physically closed.
Furthermore, set your camera for the type of photos or videos you're going to do.
Some photos and videocames have switch modes or object types that optimize an exposition to the posted subconditions.
And before swimming into the water, find out how your machine can get off.
Some cameras are calculated at only 5 feet, other to 50 or 60 feet.
Look at our shopping leadership and the raying of digital cameras and for traditional and water-produced models.
Take a few of them, because many of them are not obtained.
The kid's got a J.C.D. that will help you shoot the pictures, while they're not normally there.
Even if you have a JCD, it's gonna be hard to look under water, and the camera company will be an accidental process.
So do a few boxes.
Also, if your camera has a series of eating modes that takes several boxes with a few different installations of exposition, use them.
Stay on the surface.
The number of lights is significantly decreased than the deepest you nervous under the water.
If that is possible, stay on the surface when you take into the basin, the river or the ocean.
This also allows you to deliver more colors on photos; you're going deeply, less you'll see.
Clear closer to board objects.
This is a good board for swimming powder, but it is still more important under the water because of the light condition.
Specially important if you get to the eckbox: this device is often equipped with a fixed, widely wide line, which means that you'll need to draw close to the food objects if you want to fill the cart.
The Olympic Game of 2012 for the voluntary battle of Bill Mahov may go into Greek and Roman fight.
This reported the main trainer of the Dhageistan ' s collection for the voluntary fighting of Sajid Sajid.
The Specialist did not exclude the participation of the world championship in Tascant in September 2014.
Bill Mahov is currently on the collection of classic teams, which produces "R-Sports" words Sajda Sajida.
Indeed, Bill also spoke in both styles.
At the youth of the world in 2005, he became the winner of the volunteers and the third pack in the conspiration of the Greek Romans and decided to concentrate on the voluntary fight.
For a long time there was a conversation that the new stage of his carriage will lead to the Greek and Roman battle.
I'm saying more: Macov can already be on a world champion in Tascant - if he wins a shooting.
But the decisive word is always for the trainer head in the head of the Coguashville.
Andrew Lowson was a person whose personality power could spend all around, even in a guiant organization, such as the National Health Service.
Consulting anesthesisologist, he devoted his career to the release of sick people as well as to the suffering of diseases.
Among those with whom he came to him, his wife was the official of MI-6 who had to live with the destructive consequences of torture.
Lawson understood that while the doctor was involved by diagnosis and diseases, the treatments are mainly worried about something different.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one who began to suffer.
"I didn't feel like normal," he wrote in May last year.
I was hard to find the power in myself.
With the symptoms, he found that his wife, Juliat, was struggling.
"I want everything to happen quickly, not later," he noted.
When Juliat went out for week, Lowson found that he was uncomfortable and incomprehensible for the reason.
There was something wrong.
He asked the colleague to make the rings of a crude cell.
Two weeks ago, he was cast on legs in the French Alps.
The results of the tanggen came.
It was a mezo-related cancer that affects the dust or the skin of light.
For most cancers it is difficult to find exact reason.
Although some smokers are ill with light cancers, for example, not all light cancers have been smokeed.
But with a different messenger.
Just in all cases, it's a reason to contact the asbest, a sweet building material that has ever been called a miracle, but that, as we know now, is deadly dangerous.
For most of us, the disease is that we can't care for.
Asbest, at the end, is material from the past.
The most dangerous type of abast is not used in Britain since the 1960s when the recommended industrial ban has entered into force.
Even when he used, only people in specific areas worked closely with him, such as tuberculosis, constructors, carnivals and house workers, for example.
Industrial toxin from another epoch, if it is a cause for concern today.
But it's wrong.
The Great Britain is present today on the pipe of the mezotors.
There are more people from the Mesilians than any other country on the planet.
Annual mortality has about 2500 people, more than two times more people died from this disease than the result of car accidents.
Annual mortal number of mezoleters since 1980 and predicted deaths in the future in Britain
The reason we feel about his deadly consequences now is that, although the use of abuses has been opposed to many years (all types of abbast was finally prohibited by the law in 1999), the development of the Messiantors usually include decades of years.
And it is not limited to the shock of the industrial construction veterans.
Asbest was, and in many cases it's staying in the house where we live, offices where we're working, schools where we're learning, and shops where we're going to buy.
As a result, the messanger does not take attention to the class, the level of availability, professional or age.
Basits of election, from the modern London universities to private schools, have not been saving.
The House's building is decreased by the Abbasto.
Even hospitals that are designed to treat us have been reserved by this mortal cancer.
Andrew Lowson wasn't old.
He wasn't a pneumoniazer.
Indeed, he was supposed to think where he could contact Abbastom.
Then he turned out.
"It seems to have been a lot of abusors in the Gay Hospital where I spent six years in the kitchen," he wrote.
All students, nurses, doctors and loaders were using these tonnes.
How many of my supervisors have the same sickness?
It was a question to which, unfortunately, he could give a partial answer.
"The four doctors who were in the Haïa hospital and who later developed a messor for the past five years," he stated in 2010, "one remained in the lives".
How many of us have this disease?
Andre Lawson was placed a diagnose of "Message" when he was 48 years old.
When he died, 17 February, he was 55.
Living so long.
Fifty per cent of the sick mediterraneans die over eight months after the diagnosis.
She's always dead.
So now we can only repeat the question of Lawson, "Why of us are ill with this same disease?"
According to the leading expert on Mezory in Britain, Professor Julian Pito, the most likely suggests that between 1970 and 2050, when the abuse of epidemia in Britain is to be survived, about 900,000 people will die.
Most now do not represent that they will die so.

A rapid review of the reports from the court hall where the victims are often in charge of compensation shows how far they have been dispersed by the mezoyers.
In June, for example, Marks & Spencer acknowledged that Janes Ellen had a contact with the Asabestom.
She worked at the net for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, with the headquarters of clothing on two objects, one of which was the main shops in Oxford Street.
Miss Ellen was only 18 years old when she began working in M&S.
She now has two children older than 20 years.
"And as it happened," she said, "I never heard about the messenger, I had known about the abast.
I couldn't come in my head that it's gonna cut me.
Many people really know the abuse.
Indeed, abast isn't one substance, but a group of six minerals.
They received their name from the word "asbestform " which means a smooth structure that reports to them flexibility and flexibility.
From these six, three were often used in buildings.
Crystil, a widely known as a white abast, has often seen many others in buildings today.
He was used in blood pants, a powder, a terminology of tuberculosis, a swimming swimming swimming pool, even the cars of cars.
It is less dead than other forms of abast, but it is still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization of Serious Health, which may lead to death.
The more dangerous, however, is a shorter abast (amzit) and a blue abast (crochid).
The Great Britain was ever the largest importer of the world's core abast, and the experts suggest that "wealth is, although the outstanding reasons to believe that this is the main reason for the only high number of patients with the mezolet [in England]".
Marks & Spencer has affected the main company shop in Oxford Street, London Alamy
Jeans Ellen may have not been thinking of himself as a typical victim, but the work of Julian Pito makes it possible to suggest that her history is not far inherent.
He conducted a study of sick people who suggested that "the real percentage of the mazomers, when no known effects on the work or home, were likely caused by the impact of the abast from the environment".
The majority of these effects, he says, "normal use and weather impact" on our buildings.
Nobody seems to be sure he's safe.
The report of Goddard Consulting, in which the Westminster Garden considers, shows that people, even in the government centre, could have an incomprehensive impact.
In 2009 Goddard reported that parliamentary committees had been infected by abuses that could be able to move somewhere uncomfortable as the "force air flows".
Members of Parliament are often accused of their own interests, but in this case it seems true.
While the Parliament ' s Technical Services Division stated that the Westminster Hour had received the " clean sanitary witness", she now acknowledged that it was necessary to work on a $1 billion for the reconstruction of the Parliament, improved electricity and removed the abast, and that after the overall elections of 2015, the members of the Parliament may be meeting at the QE2 centre nearby, not at the green camps of Westminster.
The report Goddard noted that "the situation of abusom was not ruled in accordance with various rules".
You cannot know if this management would stand life.
All you can do now is waiting.
One of those who couldn't detect their contact with the Abbastom is Graham Abbott, the doctor of the General Practice.
Andrey Lowson, Abbott, 50 years of age, suspected that he had been affected by the abuse when he worked in hospitals.
"I worked in the hospital, which was successfully stated in the shocks related to the abasthom," he said, "But I can't prove that in my case.
That's hard to remember all the places where he worked, and dates.
That he will remember clearly, so that day at the beginning of December 2009, when it was something like a slipp.
He was 45, and he was on the midst of the afternoon.
Soon I started to evacuate.
This started very fast.
I felt horrible.
I thought I couldn't go all the way to home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain was going out of the throat, the shoes around the light.
However, as Jeans Ellen, he had no reason to suspect the messenger.
Finally, he couldn't go to work for a month.
The incompatible doctors made ringgenic pictures and set tribal categories to remove iceness from light and to analyze it.
But his state remained without diagnosis.
His health has been slowly improved, and he returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms returned, often after his sport and he was hardly breathing.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came to him in acceptance with similar symptoms, and then he placed a diagnose of "Missioner".
But even then Abbott did not connect it to his own case.
At the end, his patient was a ten-year-old and worked directly with a beast.
The relationship was clear in this case.
In September 2011, the status of Abbott was again deteriorated, and his consultant doctor showed the results of the TCT and the ringgenic pictures of the group of experts.
In December 2011, nearly two years after Abbott began feeling bad, a tank that was equipped with the camera, it was introduced in a flight between the shell of his bread cell and the lock of its easier.
I'm optimist.
I'm just going forward," he says.
I wasn't too worried about it, honestly.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried about it.
The result of the biopsy came for a week between Christmas and New Year, "I said that it was a Mezoryer."
Graham Abbott: Diagnostic Mezoryer
Abbott was immediately loaded in meetings with Macmillan's nurse, one of whom he invited to contact the judiciary.
That's why he understood the epidemia.
"The abast has been widely used, especially in large public buildings, where a lot of abuses of terminology on the tube," he says.
People who have affected the abast in these buildings are now ill with this disease.
Thus, the Mezoryer is now intriguing young people of non-typical professionals.
The most dangerous isolated pipes in hospitals were in the hospitals, so it was little likely to suffer patients.
But many workers who passed through the swimming tonnels to go from one building to another (cake Andre Lowson) or eat in dubbles tables (which often did Graham Abbott) almost really have affected toxic substances.
In the course of a few decades after the war, hospitals were a place where, theoretically, they saved life for posters, but a place represented a threat to life for doctors who treated them.
He's still getting away today.
Schools set up their hills in Bunzén at a beast subscriptions
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbest has often been used in offices, shops, libraries and marries because of its wonderful isolation and fire-based characterists.
Schools too.
Indeed, many probably had the first effect of the abast in the class.
In the whole country, at county chemical lessons, school students set up their mountains in Bunzhen’s abuse.
Web sites shown that the problem of the schools was highlighted.
As in our homes, there were normally abuses.
" This is an industrial nucleus in a large number of buildings", states Andrew Morgan, lawyer who represented Andrew Louson in the case of Gay's hospital.
In one case, the only contact that a sick woman could remember was a harbour chair in the 1970s.
So be careful, a garden chair.
Effects of diagnosis when you know that illness is inexilable, chlorome.
"But to understand this, there's enough time," says Gregor Abbott.
I returned to work and tried to continue, but I realized that I couldn't focus on what I do.
I've been in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized that I'm going to go and think about myself.
Well, I won't meet Christmas.
One of the most difficult things was transition from the doctor's situation in the patient.
As an uncertain number of patients before him, he remembered how it was slaughtered with the fact that the information should be accepted.
"It's hard to understand everything," he says.
"I asked my doctor how much time have I?"
I gave it about 12 months.
I remember how I thought, "I'm not going to meet Christmas again.
"There is everything."
The Mezoryam is particularly dangerous, as the engineer is as we support life, the breathing act is caused by cancer that kills.
The majority of the cases of the slaughter have been contacted with the Asbest.
Asbest consists of crochet volcano.
When the asbest is disrupted and the bottles are breathed, they can shoot in the shoe, the shoes of the light.
The volcano asbest disappoints the throat and can cause mutations of cells.
"The work is due to the breathing of the eagles of a beast", Professor Tom Trejar, a cardio-operation surgery who came to the Hague hospital in 2001.
This is the hospital where, as Andrew Lowson suspected, he had been affected by the abast, now, on the iron of the judges, the Mezoletry Heart Center.
Trayer knew Lawson and treated others who may have been affected by the hospital.
When the eggs of the abbist fall into the legs, Trejar says, "The breathing of them affects the peripheral place.
This is, in fact, an invasive process since the beginning.
General treatments in other forms of cancer are very less effective in the mezoter.
The effectiveness of the surgical involvement, for example, has caused a deterioration of disputes.
Some seem to have to try.
The trainer isn't agreed.
"I can't get out of the tribe," he says.
You can't walk around her feet.
However, this cancer is "not very good to do chemistry", which is "acting", but does not cure.
"There are the sicks who live long from time," says Trejar.
But finally they're all dead.
Happily, some patients live far more than they are expected.
Steven Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis was placed.
Two and half years after the diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After his illness, Abbott met Andrew Lowson, who, four years after the diagnosis, became a support office and consultations for the same sick one.
"Allo, the Central Center," he said lively when they called.
"He was very positive," said Abbott.
He's been diagnosed four years ago, and he's still very powerful.
First, Abbott proposed six cycles of chemotherapy that would take four months and extend his life for a month.
"I was in disappointment," he said.
I wanted to get up.
However, Lawson was able to make a few more positive scenarios.
When he met with several specialists, Abbott decided to continue treatment with professor Lloyk Lanj-Lazungski, Professor of Tractical Surgery in the Hague Hospital.
"We had the advantage that I had no direction, I just called them, and they took me," says Gregor.
A medium-stattic patient should be able to provide guidance and approval for funding.
Days are playing a decisive role for sick sickness to get the best of existing treatments.
However, when such treatments are ineffective, many sick people have another financial matter for concern - the future family that they are left.
And then they're on the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson connected with Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Availablely knows that abust is harmful for health since 1898," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s is that it was understood that even very small numbers could risk health.
It was then discussed about the inequalities of companies.
Andre Luson and Gay's hospital, finally, have resolved the case, but it was not a “resolution for the full value”, as Morgan did not prove the result of his mezoter in the guest.
After investigating his death, the representative of Gaia's hospital was still confirmed, however, that "beating in dual-term places of which it was spoken has been removed in the 1990s".
It was too late for Andrew Louson.
How to Delete Abbest
Indeed, to communicate with one company or workplace, usually for decades after that, there was a great problem for sick people who needed compensation.
Many of their former employees have changed or closed.
The feared archives could be lost.
Those who are protected from skins know that at their side, of course, no.
In response, there have been severe new legislative acts that facilitate the sickness of compensation, even if their former employees could not be followed.
In accordance with that law, a £350 million fund was established, funded by the insurance industry, for those who had been diagnosed after July 2012 and who could be able to contact, but who would not be judged.
In such cases, sicks will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could normally condemn for compensation - about 120 000 £.
About 300 successful scopes in this scheme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, as many people work with the mezo-master, believes that $350 million are a very good job for the insurance industry.
"This is the contract written by the insurers insurance", said he, as it is, that the amount is fourth that the insurers should be paid if they were not able to interfere with the temporary space and sick with the mezoomer would be able to follow the company and seek a normal way.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister of Labour and Pension, acknowledged that the law was "incomplete".
However, Penning and Morgan recognize that, when seven people die each day, rapid action was needed.
"Their people suffer so strong, and they need help today," said Penning during the second reading of Bill on the mezoter in December last year.
At that time, Graham Abbott was in the hands of Professor Lock Lange Laznski for 19 months.
After the initial consultations, Lanj-Lazungsky recommended a surgical intervention that, in contrast with Tom Trejare, is considered effective.
Thus, radiotherapy and chemotherapy had been followed by three therapie in which Lanj Lazungsky can be able to honor the total 40 per cent of the survivors who survived in five years.
Abbott felt that he was forced.
"This is, of course, one of the most important things," says Abbott.
You see this in the patients always.
There's some power that supports you.
When you get it, the situation may be very fast.
Graham Abbott Lee for Operation in March 2012.
By the end of August he ended the last six cycles of chemotherapy.
The following scannings have not shown the sequence of diseases.
Then I was scanning in March [2014].
There were a few [cancers] in my summer cell.
I had to do 50 times.
It's not the threat of life.
That's the end of life.
And again Abbott passed through six cycles of chemotherapy.
There's no shifts now.
However, this process was physically and emotionally heavy.
You can think of practical things - about finances when I die, for example, or what the wife needs to show, how the timer works on the board.
When you get bad news, you're unreasonable.
We need to look forward.
Like Elly’s father, 16, and Tamzin, 14, it’s not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," he says.
It's hard to understand what to say and how much to say.
When I had the first diagnosis, I told the girls that I had a disease that means I'm not living before older.
They reacted very differently.
Tamzine is very comfortable and energy.
She told all his friends, and they called us very fast.
Ellie was more deserved.
She didn't say much.
Such interviews are something that must be cut off all the ill cancer.
However, such discussions are not equal to hope for sick people, even the possibility of surviving.
This disease is with herself (as well as, finally, for Steven J. Gould).

China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders; the protesters who swear
The China Parliament decided to not allow Hong Kong's elections to move candidates to the election of 2017, despite the growing demands of democratic reform.
This step, likely, will start the long-term promised protesters in Hong Kong's Quarter case, since activists have started planning and mobilization in the following hours.
The decision of the General Assembly of the People's Representatives, in fact, allows communist leaders to take away all candidates that are not loyal to Beijing.
"This has not been wrong with our expectations, but it's all in a angry," said the lawyer Emily Lau, Chairman of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Peyn promised.
They were inflicting Hong Kong people.
And of course we have the case with the authorisation regime.
Defending China's decision, Le Fey, Vice-General, the Permanent Committee of the Alliance of People's Representatives, said that it would be too "haotic".
Since 1997, when Britain returned to the Hong Kong control of China, Beijing promised the people of the region to choose by voted by the head of the Government since 2017.
The Chinese leaders submitted the decision adopted on Sunday as a democratic step, as it provides to the honcongants the right to vote directly, but it is also obvious that Chinese leaders will continue to keep strongly in their hands through the Commission for Embarking Candidates, which is strictly controlled from Beijing.
In accordance with the new article, only candidates who " love the country and love Hong Kong" will be granted.
A decision was taken after the summer when one of the most wide and wide protesters in Hong Kong has been received for many years.
A major part of the promo-democratic campaign in Hong Kong was the Occupy Central with Love and Peace, whose organizations were threatened to overcome the Hong Kong financial area if Beijing does not guarantee this general election law.
On Sunday night, a few hours after the statement, hundreds of Occupy Central were gathered in rain before the Hungarian Government's headquarters.
The organizations claimed that their movement was at the new stage of civil accusation and that they would be shocked on the sights of protest in the next weeks.
However, they have not reported details, obviously, to avoid problems with the authorities.
In the online declaration, the organizer reported that the movement " had thought to cover the central area only as an exclusive action that could be taken only if all the possibilities of the dialogue were exhausted and no other election could be taken.
We are very regretted that today all the possibilities of the dialogue will be extraordinary and locked by the central area will be uncertainly.
The State authorities in Hong Kong have been prepared for a number of days to declare Beijing, and in the Sunday, the Government ' s headquarters have been strengthened security measures with the accession of the police and barricad.
Many in Hong Kong feel that they are slowly losing control over their own city.
The protocol of the material population increases competitiveness in the field of goods and services.
It also increases the fear that the values of Hong Kong, such as democracy and freedom of words, start to decline under increased pressure from Beijing.
Some criticize the Occupy Central movement, saying that his demonstrations are risking business, the source of the living force of Hong Kong.
"The question of which they say, he can cause a great economic damage in depending on how long the person will participate and how long it is", said the legislator of the Ip, who has criticized the movement for a long time.
We don't want to diffuse the concern that Hong Kong goes out of control.
This is a submission that is dangerous for investment.
Chinese public media also have reported reports in the past days in which the hongonists of democratic movement have been demonstrated by divergents conducted by western states.
In these years, activists organized an informal referendum on electoral law, which brought to 780.000 participants, more than one of the five electioners of Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands were one of the largest promo-democratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
The American School of Exhibition is at university life: the first ones proposed to arrive on a personal aircraft
We are pleased to react to such a question, starting the first service in Britain for the journeys of the "lux" category for the current students.
To leave a clear impression from the university, the company also proposes transport options such as a private flight, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stuart also stated that the service was thinking of security.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who are usually going to take their things through the whole country into a dangerous reloading machine.
In combination with our new VIF options, we are unfortunately waiting for the help of students to reach the university with the minimum efforts and the maximum race.
The representative of the company reported that since this service was just running, the orders were not made, but added that "the students would start ordering this service in the next few weeks".
The company also stated that, despite the need for students to pay for a year of 9000 £, she hoped to find a market for this service.
Current students are very different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in regard to expectations and hopes: more important than ever, to make great first impression, and VIF is what they need.
However, the National Union of Students has discovered this service as a reliable from reality.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the Supreme Education, said: " This project represents incredibly the life of most students.
Many students in this month starting education at the university have faced a crisis of the value of life when the available financial support in the form of credit and appropriators does not have a decent increase in basic needs, until they can actually start thinking that thousands of funds are a simple income in general.
Faminists raciality and police conduct after Ferguson
Safety adolescents were killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, previously in this month.
Those who arrive, squander, "Let up, don't shoot!" until they are waiting for the fires.
After two weeks of protest in Ferguson, Missoury, who were related to the murder of an unarmed adolescent Michael Braun, the blogger of Miriam Zola Prus noted the Internet discussion between white feminists.
According to her experience, white pheminists who left comments have made up above racial property when the genitor was talking about promoting reproductive rights and income inequalities.
However, while the pressure on the Middle West was growing and attracted to national attention, Overs saw the responses of white women, which focused on racial property by 100 per cent.
In comparison with the reaction of black women, soon after the murder of the 9 August, personal exhibitions with the titles such as "Ferguson's thoughts from the white woman" and "Feminism is not only about women's depression".
But for Pers, they showed a substantial trail.
"In the feminis, I don't think there are many people who speak about the white skin and privileges at such a high level," she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
This is very symbolically for the crisis we faced, and because (the situation in Ferguson) was so linked to racial property, they felt that it was to be indicated.
For a professor of the English language at the University of Ogayo Corita Mitchell Ferguson, the problems faced by the American blackness every day, but not being found as a "answers" in the cultural field.
"I can write something awesome in Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner, and I get 150 pieces out there," says Mitchell.
When I write something about how flower people are attacked in their own country, silence sounds.
"Why are women safely talking about relationships but not about security in the public?" she asked.
For black women, such as Mitchell, who have studied racial, gender and sexuality in the United States history, there is no divorce between racial and genital issues.
From its view, the blackness of women are in the position to clearly divide these problems; they are faced with a complex reality every day.
While white women are now joining racial origin and gender issues in the feminist Mediterranean, Engela Hattery, Professor of Women and Gender Studies at George Mayson University, says that their former girls were opposed.
"In the early 1865 and 1890, at least 10000 black men were broken, and there was almost always a force of white woman," said Hatter.
There was a white woman who confirmed the statement to defeat the bleeding.
In view of Hattery, the disappearing between white and black women occurred when white socialists, such as Susan B. Antony, studied the situation at the end of the 1800s and saw that the fight against election law would only be effective for one group: women or black.
"They decided to put all the eggs into the corner of the right to vote for women, and the right to vote for the blacks should appear later," said Hatter.
Regarding such things, we have a clear view of why flowers don't trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women have reached the right to vote in 1920, the white women have been united with the South Women's Association for prevention of lenses.
The group appeared nearly 40 years after the first request for assistance by the black woman, Mr. Mitchell said.
In view of the reactions of white pheminists to the situations in Ferguson, the police ' s behavior, racial discrimination, reflects time when white pheminists had to be " smooth " problems with black women in several generations.
"One, it would be good if activists who have such [traditional feminist] ideology would have seen the right to child up, as they were regarding the right to contract?", asked Michel.
The second rail feminists that have made carriages to combat reproductive rights and access to contraceptives now start to understand what this means.
The known white activist of the feminist movement Gloria Tony, two weeks after the murder of Michael Brown, used Fasbuck and published a slight article of the Guardian Rebecca Carroll, which needed that white Americans participate more in the protests of racism.
"I hope that women with another, but like a reason to understand the dangers of TV - and the point of view of racial problems that are significantly different in public issues - will be in the head of the change", wrote Tony.
Although the phenomenon is undertaken by more severe pheminism, which includes racial and racial affairs, and the genitor, her comments on race in America have yet been surprised to some of them.
Scientist of the American Business Institute, Christine Sommers, author "Who has stealed pheminism?", said She The People, that young men in the United States, especially colorful young people, "more vulnerable than their sisters," but the comments on the Pherguson are opposed to the criticism she had previously expressed.
Now we have hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for the boys.
However, when the White House recently initiated a small program, “Strong my brother”, to help vulnerable black and Spanish young people who were vulnerable, he continued to react by many pheminists, including Gloria Stein.
Police relations with the black community is not the only problem to move forward to the traditional pheminism.
After the U.S. border service arrested about 63.000 young people without being involved in the South-West border this year, the immigration reform was again on the surface as a problem of women.
André Mercado, co-president We Belong Together, who mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that to address this problem as an important for women, she only had to share the historys of immigration women.
"They say themselves for themselves," said Mercedes.
When the majority of the working visions are issued [immigrants], women who are coming with them are in the position vulnerable for domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories are called in women's organizations," she said.
The sweet house is sold
The house photo of Safolk’s sales was removed by non-motive agents when there was a large sweet that was shown in the guest.
The private house with one bed is on a private street in Ipswitz.
Detailed the pictures of a guest house, which was pictured by a dog with the head of the guard.
Connells Inmobility Agency reported that the sweet is a home owner of the home.
"Actually, the photo was displaced as a error and already removed", reported the representative of the company.
In the details of the home, Connells described the former congregation house as a "unity of single house with one bed".
Although the Agency has removed a photo from its website, it is still in advertising materials.
The house sale was interested in social networks where some asked whether a pork was sold together with the house.
The Russian tennisist Maria Sharavoy, in the fourth circle of the United States Open Caroline of Wonnicky, believes that she is lacking stability.
According to the deportation, she wants to complete the year and try to go to a new level, which is transferred from New York to the OSSO.
How do you evaluate your results on the Good Slamming Tours in this year?
Of course, I'm glad I could win the Rolan Harros.
With regard to the three other tourists, I have not enough stability, especially in the end of some matchs.
Now, of course, I'm disappointed.
I couldn't even go to the fourth finance.
What are your tasks before the end of the season?
After the second invasion, I have a great motivation to go to the new level.
I'm going to work, and I'm going to do everything I can to complete the year.
Asian tourist series begins a couple of weeks.
Member of the Committee on Physical Cultural, Sports and Youth Affairs, former Championship of Nicolai Valouves, suggested that the TOMs should be able to grant bonus in the sweets.
He said, generally the rules will be the same as in the Council's time, the people will make the rule of interruption, flight and other training.
Remember, 12 Russian actors will start entering from 1 September on their Territories of OMC.
I also invited schoolmates who were deleted by the WTO to give boxes when they were in the ears, noted Balouev.
For example, they can a little add to the EEA balls.
There is also proposals to provide additional weekly workers of undertakings that have passed the sports tests.
The city of Harvey in South Wales appeared a new million after winning in the lottery
Game in Harvey's lottery in this month.
Search for a new million in the south-west of Perth where a happy one will get home for almost $1,1 million with a lottery player on Saturday night.
The Harvi gas kitchen offers gold in the second time for five years, the last winning was $1 million in November 2009.
However, a lucky victor still needs to declare himself.
Steve Forvard's owner said that the winner had called a small town to the south-west of Perth.
The whole city is talking about this, and it's all very excited.
We thought that such a winner could be secret.
Eight winners from Western Australia replied the main winner in the last month, noting the end of a few weeks for the state players.
Last week, the Canning Wail player was one of the five million augusts, as a result of a large $7.5 million out of Belmont's whole weeks before it.
The winned couple has been playing for twenty years and reporting that the winner gave them the opportunity to travel to peace and buy a new house.
Millionary of Harveys has been granted the main call of winning in Western Australia to 59 in this year, with a total of $85 million.
Mine development wants to accelerate the growth of the electricity market
In this week, the Mini-Economic Development Government has introduced a comprehensive development plan for environmental clean transport in Russia and told the Ministerial Department of Oлег Plugglers on the round table, conducted in Moscow Bus salon 2014.
The plan is set up to the Government, one of the main objectives is a reduction in the gas emissions.
It is expected that the document will be adopted at the end of September, starting October, said the Delegates, the proposed measures relating to electricity and hybrids - the development of gas vehicles in Russia are already available.
The plan (the copy of the "Vedomities") was calculated for 2014-2017 gg.
The criteria for the evaluation of electric and hybrid transport should be developed and should decide how to stimulate the use and production of environmentally clean vehicles.
The report of the Government in which tax and customs support measures will be prepared by December 2014; the balance credit scheme and the flow licensing will be developed by April 2015; and the proposals for reduced the price of the machine, the stimulation of localization and the establishment of service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015, a change in legislative and legal act should be made to facilitate the conditions for the construction of a loading infrastructure (in parks, auto-care stations and other).
In addition, federal officials are intended to formulate for the regional authorities to encourage the use of environmental clean transport in the form of the provision of advantages in the movement and park, for example, and to February 2016, and proposals for expanding such transport.
Finally, the mini-economic development has already been listed in October 2014 the evaluation of the regional authorities' evaluation of criteria reflecting the effective support of the production of clean transport, the development of load infrastructure.
The Electronics Framework in Russia is only formed - in 2013, about 100 electronic mobiles are sold in the whole country.
At the beginning of 2014, the import shipment for electricity was slowed, so the sales are about 500 pieces, and the principal executive director Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrey Panks.
However, five-class growth does not make any significant electricity: in Russia, in 2013, the European Business Association has sold 2,78 million easy and easy commercial cars.
Only Mitsubishi Motors is imported until Russia.
Renault's imports are prepared to focus on corporate customers, said the director of Strategic Planning and Partnerships of Renault in Russia, Nicola Remis.
Most of the other electric transport producers have taken a living position in Russia.
The development of electricity engines is also in Russian producers, GAZ, but it is slight.
For example, in January 2014, "AutoVAS" issued 30 electronic mobiles.
The question of the deficiency due to the prices of electricity is recognised by the Director of AutoVAZ, the Sergey Aman's Ingeniation, without the switch manager in this scene.
The development of the Russian electricity market in addition to the roads of cars (electronics sold in Russia, in the middle of two roads with internal swimming engines) maintains the indevelopment of the loading infrastructure (units) involves the Aatostata Engineer Serge.
In the course of costs and low levels of automotiveness, electricity is remaining at the lower segment of the Russian market, predicting the main editor "Avator " Mikhail Poro-Roman, and the Cellucks agreed with it.
Instead, automatic producers say that some electronic models are close to the cost of the ordinary.
In the Russian market, the good prospects of electricity mobilities are mainly to make awareness of consumers that electricity is real; in particular, it will facilitate the emergence of all new load stations, emphasize the President of the BMW Group in Russia Volfhang Schlemm.
Such infrastructure projects, for example, have implemented a number of stations in Moscow.
The negotiations on the construction of advertising networks are also conducted with other regions.
According to the director of the Russian Department of Wormira Sofiin, the company believes in the electronic market and is ready to build contracts throughout the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electricity mobiles in the country and the absence of a single standard for the load of different burdens.
Moreover, "Russeti" as a network company does not have the right to sell electricity, and it is possible to do this with regard to the loading of electricity.
Panka is the most effective measure of training in Russia for the market of electronic mobiles for Customs.
The Nuclear Tax will operate until the end of 2014, the possibility of extending it, the expansion of the loan list.
The replacement of environmental taxes (the idea is discussed and related to all the cars) also supports the market, but we do not feel as customs preferences as Panks.
Small transfer tax in Russia, says Panks, in contrast, for example, from Norwegia, where tax reduction has resulted in a rare growth of electricity sales -- it is now 12% of the market.
Russia requires and stimulated measures for automobilists, such as a free park in the centre of the city (cake already done in Moscow), aware of Panks, or the possibility of movement of electronic motors for the selected pools, which is not yet in Russia.

Twitter tried to be more interesting for new users
The Twitter Mikrobs has changed the user registration process so that new participants could quickly involve actively with the platform.
This measure should decrease the number of people cutting their mixtures.
Now new Twitter users will be recorded during the registration of a large number of recommended battery servers to compose their read circle immediately.
Recommendations are made on the basis of the interests specified in registration.
In this way Twitter automatically sets a subscription box for all automatically selected customers.
Because of this, the user must be able to cut the balls in ownership so that he does not read those who are not interested in him.
If the users of the microblog servers have previously seen only the availability of recommended users, Twitter now produces a picture of one of the popular blogs to help make a person's impression.
This is a larger change in Twitter registration in the past three years.
Twitter has recently worked actively on the modernization of the server.
This is particularly related to the continuing attempts of the service to achieve the unfortunateness.

Creator Coming Out Simulator will release a game on the modern journalist
Hey, Nikki Case, known as Coming Out Simulator game, decided to launch a game on the modern journalist.

Heritage may, in turn, picture the event that affects the events.
If he takes the scene that the police will look like heroes and the protesters, the police will begin to treat him better and leave where the ordinary man cannot go.
If he will see the events otherwise, his photos can convert peace protests into a wide burn.
The game shows will need to be collected by a hero Twitter, where new signers will appear when the photos there are popular.
The game has no name.
The date of exit and platforms to which it appears is unknown.
Case, however, published a picture that shows how the event could change in depending on how the picture was made and processed.
In the interview, Kill Screen Case explained that he had thought that the concept of this game was a long time ago, but he wanted to dedicate it not to the U.S. Protests, but to events in the Gaza sector.
After he started to collect the game material, he was aware that he was missing knowledge and ability to reveal the history of the region.
However, when he saw the Mediterranean’s events in Ferguson, he decided to make a game on the motives that happened.
Nicky Case is an independent developer who launchs browser games.
The worst known project was the Coming Out Simulator, above 2014.
The game, in which Case's biography events, is dedicated to how biosexual adolescents are trying to tell their relationship with homosexual parents.

Army controls the new Government of Thailand
General Prat (right) was appointed to the Minister of Defence of Legislated Vungsuvan (left)
The military government and Prime Minister of Thailand, General Prat Chan-Ocha, declared the composition of the new Office of Ministers of the country, where more than three posts are employed by the General or General.
Army representatives received key posts: Defence Ministers, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Trade.
On Monday, Prat Chan-Ocha was officially approved by the Prime Minister as the king of Thailand officially approved the appointment of the head of the temporary military government at that post.
The 60-year-old military captured in the country in the result of the uncertain movement of May 22 was the only candidate to the Prime Minister.
He was elected by the Prime Minister at the Parliament's meeting.
The former army appointed Parliament's deputy.
According to Praeta Cha-Ocha, the only way to maintain stability was the turn.
He had predicted the continued demonstration in which the protesters requested the departure of the Prime Minister of Yinglack Chinavat.
Officially, the Chan-Ocha Plan will be a temporary prize, since the military plans to conduct general elections at the end of 2015.
However, there are fears that militarys try to strengthen their power in the country.
Military arrived on May 22
on the basis of the full paralysis of the civil authorities.
The leaders of the main political parties were temporaryly arrested.
Once after the arrival of military authorities, they arrested the country ' s leading politicians, including the Prime Minister of Yinglake Chinavat.
Some journalists and public actors were also detained.
The current political crisis falls from the roots in 2006 when the army was slaughtered from the former Prime Minister of Brother Yinglyk Chinavat Tasin.
Both are used to use the population of the rural population, especially in the northern regions of the country, which did not make it possible for elections.
However, many representatives of the Medium Class and the capital elite have entered the anti-governmental movement, which has almost paralyzed the country since November 2013.
Nobody said it's gonna be better in the medium salt, I didn't promise you, I'm looking for a new Palm Brazilian officer.
It must be formally recognised that it is true, but the mind and desires are still unprecedented.
Because they know that we say Belgium -- we're understood the media, we say media -- we're going to say "media" -- we're going to be in Belgium.
The restaurants liked to declare that the success of the work is depending on three factors: the location, the location and the location again.
There are such places that are not to be good, but even good, but some of them.
I remembered that there was a "Grodoko" coffee, then "Odessa Mom" and a restaurant Bogole and a drinker.
Now it's a drink again, but it's not a nostaligic, but a Belgian.
On the ground, only the top of the iceberg was placed: a bar and a pair of tables, the rest of the space is free even the sunlight.
It's glad here as in the child room: red, yellow and green walls, different shoes, instead of television windows where girls and women smell.
Belgium firms in Petersburg haven't been a news for a long time ago, so there is a comparison with what.
Here, eight species of different birds (260-300 rubbers per 0.5 l) and an innumerable number of bottles (17.0-1550 rubbers).
The company positioning official is gladly presenting the menu, telling that " media are large seeds" and should be noted: the service, despite individual deficiencies, is the most positive part of Palm.
We are waiting for content, but often unexpectedly.
But whoever, for example, has been given to warn that a meat rule with the ballonic shirt (280 rubbers) is in fact a carpacho, which is so slight that the primary paper is shown to the material that is unlikely total.
You can feel some smile only if you smell together.
It's worse with the salts.
Classic League (260) would be the right thing to recognise the crime against the Belgian people: a frozen iceberg that has ever been removed for a long time by the Kenya Fassol, obtained from the Beton plus a swimming pool.
You don't want to meet anybody like that.
The creation of the Belgian Salat was partly otherwise, but the impression was not different.
If there was still a closed eye on the unexpected mid - or overwhelming shoes, why the media seem like they have been able to disappear and disappear for their life several times!
Because I already know, there's plenty of normal white media here!
They're in the box for your choice. (490-560 rules for 0.5 km).
The white wine, agriculture, and marble was not clearly shocked.
There's a smooth, and there's no aromatic, if there was a wine, and it's been a wonder.
It's too good to believe the media's fresh with the home mayones.
The curious vatter in here isn't a shooting, so that in depending on the order, you can decide, first or second shooting before you, but just a nice mate.
It was stated that a local snake was prepared in a drink soup, and there was nothing about the smell.
The situation was diagnosticly contradictory, and the dismarin was depressed.
It was impressed that the chromosome in life was covered by dismarined skins, which was the father of the flesh that was such unproofly aroma.
But there was a wonderful crystal to the leg - no, just a shock in a caramelized corner.
Baphli in Palm is proposed not only shocks but also with skin, smoke or bacon and smell (220-280).
The sleeve was a sweeper, and the swimming waffles were shocked.
However, the manager was very informally interested in the general impressions that had been drawn up to the table.
I mean, we have to come again.
The cost of the dollar was higher than 37 rules on the news of the new sanctions prepared for the West towards Russia.
This is a new historical recursion.
The Dollar was calculated "tomorrow" to 10:29 msq by 26.9 cops and composed 37.02 rubbers, the euro rate was up to the 48.73 rule, shows the Moscow board data.
The bivalt corsin growed at 28 copy levels of previous closure and was 42.28 rubbers.
Before the chronic events, the dollar had reached the maximum of 19 February 2009, and then was 36.43 rubbers, and on 3 March 2014 he had already been 37.005 rubbers.
Tonight, on August 29, the White House reported that President of the United States Barak Obama and the President of Germany Angela Merckel discussed the possibility of introducing additional sanctions against Russia.
The rubber weakness is long-term and a couple of euros and a couple of dollars.
The long-term prognosis predicted this mark, says an older Alpary analysis Anna Bodrova.
Everything related to Ukraine or otherwise will be reflected on courses.
As long as that continues, investors will react.
Today, the listening on the invasion of the army has not been confirmed by any of the other parties, but the market was very emotional.
All conversations on his sustainability to such news have been overlooked yesterday.
The week, according to the prediction of a specialist, is closed around those levels to $36,90 and 37,05 rule.
The tax period has been completed, the prices for oil weak, policy, sanctions, the problem of the gas transit through Ukraine are all of the pieces.
Inflations are also discharged: at current prices from 5 to 10 per cent.
Eventually, sezonal fruits and fruits are finished, and there will be a vacuum until the network is overriding to other suppliers.
"Dallar came to the record at 37 rules, passed it and returned, no powerful exhibition, comments the head of the Broker Market Analysis Office Constantine Busheev.
They will still see whether they will enter the promised sanctions on Saturday, as the NATO will attend.
Rubl, according to his words, was slightly slow after the finance of the tax season, then the news went to Ukraine, and the CIA, on the past week, stated that until the end of the year, would be completely transferred to the swimming rate and rejected from any currency interventions.
If you look at a daily collection, it was nothing different from the previous months in that month, all of them feared the note of 37 sections, continues to be analytical.
Well, there's no power in the trafficking plan.
The prevailing time for the currency market was remembered at the end of January, as well as on the third March, when the CB has downloaded a recursive amount of currency.
In the UFS, the IC is a positive part of the rubber weakness.
The main analysis of the UFS IC Alexandre Cozlope is mainly increased in the budget of export operations and the increased competitiveness of internal producers.
The travel of imported goods and services may be negative.
The results of Russian currencies are significantly reduced by investing in the Russian economy, increased inflation pressure and, as a result, causes the incentive of money income that, on the other hand, the development of the economy of the country.
When it is said about the market of actions, the evaluation of a number of rubbers constitutes a reduction in the shares expressed in the rubbers.
For example, IMDB Index reduced 1,67 per cent during the trade, and RTS lost 3,27 per cent.
The significant difference in relatively reduced index is explained by the weakness of the rule during the day more than 1,5 per cent.
The weakness of the rubber is emotive and is explained by mass effort to purchase the currency.
As the practice shows, emotions are slowly inclined, but the cutting of the rubber is partly or fully resumed.
" Let us soon see the percentage of the dollar and the Russian currency nearly 36 rubbers per dollar," said Alex Kozlo.
Genetic violation is often wrongly diagnosed
Britain reported that she's passing many years, thinking that she's going to die, after a wrong diagnosis.
Carrin Rogers has conducted a large part of her adolescent age, thinking that she had been alive only a few years after diagnosing another disease.
Indeed, she had Sharko-Mari-Thut diseases (SMT) as a group of inherent violations that cause nervous damages outside the brain and the drought.
The CMT CMT UK reported that the wrong diagnosis was a part of the problem among people with MST, because it was so little to know about the situation.
About 23.000 people in Britain are supposed to have SMTs that can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, uncertain path and feet.
The worst may feel feeling feelings of emotion or pain, and the state is not infected and progressed, which means that symptoms are raised in time.
When Rogers was 13 years old, she thought that it suffered from the assault of Fridreak (AF) as a prognosis for which it was very bad.
Rogers thought she would be covered to a disabled crystal until she was 18 and died before she was completed 30.
The mother of two children now 51 said, "I knew I couldn't do anything else.
I've fallen every day, and I've got more time.
I couldn't be able to shoot the rope or skeetbord with the other kids, and I have to get a lot to school because I went and run.
Rogers said that when she was 13 years old, after several operations to free cylinders and shoot up, she looked at a medical card when her doctor was out of the room, and there was written that she had an AF.
"I felt guilty because I was smelling the noise where the need was to be, and so I didn't say to anyone, but I came home, found information about this situation in the library and wrote to the AF Association," she said.
When I received information in response, I was shocked and tested the worst panic that could only be possible.
I thought I'd be in the disabled box in 18 and I'm going to die before I get 25, and I'm going to lose all my ability in this past.
I passed through it alone, and I planned my own funerals.
She said that at the time she completed 17, she realized that her ability to walk was not so worried as she thought, and asked her doctor about it.
He just wakeed up, took me and said, "My dear, I don't think you have this disease, because you'd already be in a disabled crystal."
I think you have something that represents a very small threat for life.
After a number of genetic surveys, the SMT was found in it.
"When he explained what the SMT was, I thought it had a happy ticket", she said.
The SMIT-building organization announced the monthly information on SMIT to try to focus on this disease.

The taxation increased rapidly, 4.3 per cent of local taxes, 3.9 per cent, based on the research carried out by the company providing vocational services, Ernst & Young and the State Tax Centre, the Tax Policy Group.
More than half of the tax revenues in the area, 56 per cent are undertaking taxes, while 36 per cent of the Maryland tax revenue is on the company.
Virginia, with 28 per cent, produces less tax income, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.
Increased tax growth has been returned to the level of non-motiveness of companies, researchers said that in this year, 3.7 per cent of the tax income, after three years, the growth was less than 1 per cent.
While the large part of these income is in major states such as California, New York and Texas, it is estimated that the same is happening in the Washington Zone.
Maryland and Virginia funded $10 billion together with the State in movement and local level in the past year, more than $9.6 billion in 2012 than 4.2 per cent, compared to the previous year.
However, the return of non-motive costs has no similar effect on State tax growth and local levels in Maryland, where the tax infringement tax exceeds one fifth of the company's tax accounts.
Virginia and Colombia are paying about half of the State tax accounts and locally in the form of non-motive taxes.
"What happens in Maryland is that the large part of their inmobility, especially the tax base around Colombia, belongs to or to a government or an non-commercial organization that does not pay tax on immigration", said D. Lindaholm, Executive Director of the State Taxing Centre.
Maryland, therefore, had much more confidence in the taxes to pay the same services in other states.
The recent tax growth from entrepreneurs cannot fully explain the restoration of the non-motive market.
Income of entrepreneurs seem to be amended in accordance with these data.
The company in the region has declared the company ' s undertakings taxes of $2.3 billion, more than $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland has collected $1 billion of corporate tax revenues, mostly in the region.
Although trends are directed in one direction, the tax burden of entrepreneurs at the local level does not increase the same speed in all three locations.
The growth level in Colombia was at the same level as the average of the country, 4.3 per cent, while growth in Mary was significantly faster, 4.9 per cent.
Only in Virginia has been observed by tax rates below the average, equivalent to 4.1 per cent.
Virginia was the lowest corporate tax from three laws (the same corporate rate) by 6 per cent.
The company rate in Maryland is 8.25 per cent, while it is relatively high in the area of 9.975 per cent.
A recent study of the United States Toergo House showed that Virginia was lowered in the state and local undertaking taxes and, in general, a more favourable climate regarding business taxes than Maryland.
The circle was not evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia experiences competitive pressure from its neighbourhood from the south.
The Northern Caroline has recently signed the legislative act which decreased the corporate rate this year from 6,9 per cent to 6 per cent, as in Virginia, and the rate of 5 per cent in the next year.
If the State continues to achieve tax goals in the next year, the law could result in the tax rate for entrepreneurs even to 3 per cent by 2017.
As a result, small business in the Washington Zone seems to be better and thus increased by state taxes and local levels, according to recent research.
Taxes for entrepreneurs paid in the form of the individual income tax by small business owners are a transitional structure that has been established by most small companies in Colombia, Maryland and Virginia by $2.4 billion in the past year, with much greater growth speed than the cost of undertakings in general.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in business taxes in the whole country may be maintained in this year when taxes from trafficking in state governments and local levels increased by 6.2 per cent of the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington Zone can be delayed, as the decrease of federal costs is at the market of work in the region.
The Russian Snapshodo Bronx
The home Championship of the Peace at home brings two golden and seven bronze rewards in Russia.
The Russian indicator was only the main strike of the collected Japan.
Turnier in Chelabinsk was a midday, and the first day it brought a Russian silver meal.

In the serious shock of the small, he finished by the comments of the counterparty, Alan Schmitta, wins.
On Thursday, there were three bonds of premiums, but the Russians were limited to a bronze in a male tourist up to 90 km.
His owner, Kirill Questions, was guaranteed by the Russian collection of this medal: his comfortable finance co-teacher was Kirill Dennis.
However, the latter was not the one that the questionnaire couldn't go to his fathers because of the trauma.
The man's burn was buried by guests and, on the sixth day of the assembly, the Renath Said was placed in a collection copy of more than 100 km.
In the comfortable final, he gained a clean victory over the Brazilian David Mour.
This has been completed by the individual part of the world prize.
On the last day of the tourism in Chelabinsk, on Sunday, there were championships of the world in teams of conspiration.
Both Russian assemblies and men and women were one of the main claims for rewards, but as in individual conspirations, the representatives of the beautiful field had not been blessed before they had not arrived.
And here, Russian teledowers have buried the command arm.
In the decisive opposition, they entered the main opposition favorites of the Japan team in the sight of 2-3.
The Russian assembly took 2-0 after the clean winning of Han-Magmodev and the left-to-left Denise Yarceva (weight up to 73 km).
However, in the worst pregnant categories with its Japanese counterparts, Murat Havillor (81), Magomed Magomed (90) and Aslan Kambye (100).
The scenario also developed and a bronze shop in the women's tourist where the Russian collection was 2-0, entering Japan 2-3.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, was present at the Challabinsk surroundings team, which after the end of the tourism, welcomed the man ' s silver collection.
"The second place is very clear, but I want to say that you could be a champion," said Putin, whose word leads to RI.
Gaining Japanese, telephone generators, there's nothing wearing here.
But I'm sure you can have them and win.
The Russian meeting at the home championship of the world was much better than a year ago at the restraints of the same level in Rio de Janeiro.
Then, in the Russian team, there were only three meal, one arm and two bronzes.
To this end, the current tourists were slaughtered by the Olympic Champion Arsen Galstonia and Mansur Isaiave.
We're all of us, of course, great maximumists.
Yes, I want gold meals.
But let us remember that if a man in the Olympic cycle enters eight more stronger, he's a potential Olympic winner.
Moreover, in the sports way, like the shooting," reported the results of the Sport Minister RF Vitalius Mutko, whose words lead to the Championship Press.

The family Joan Rivers is hoped to be better.
Joan Riverz is unconscious of the arrival in the hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter expressed the hope of today that the 81-year-old coma actor would be reversed from the disease.
"Thank you for your continuous love and support," Melissa Rivers said today.
We hope the best.
Her mother arrived in the hospital, Maunt Sinai, on Thursday, after a extreme call about a heart stop in the High East Side, New York City, reports the sources.
The physicians intended to keep it under drugs and under strict monitoring until they are not satisfied with the state that remains “depressed”.
The response was wide, including numerous Internet supports from Donald Tramp, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripp.
Everyone will be able to king
In the sale of a debted album by the Royal Blood Group, the new hope of the British Year, which was made from the direct clubs on the stadium.
Douet Royal Blood has been a scene all year, but it's already actively named at the BBC musical prize, the slope at Arctic Monkeys, and visits the New York Congress from Jimmy Pedge.
They have a single album over a few months before the reliance received 1000,000 predictions, and the contract on the issue is located in the Mejor Lab Warner Music port.
Bearing in mind the current laughing situation on the musical market, the situation from a number of outdoors, as it is not the new Lane Del Rey or the interim vote of the representative of the New R'n'B, and the duth of britannicians played with the theme of volume and intensity, which has been last few decades ago.
In general, the rates for the first album in relation to all the above-mentioned circumstances were particularly high and have already been completely justified.
Douth did not get himself a name to which before it could be able to get out of what was completely disappointed hair metallists, and the blood of the kings, as they seem to have in their lives, also understood.
It is, of course, most of the heroes of the past level Led Zeppelin: as the great quarter, Royal Blood was intending to strive the blood of the British Year by bringing it to a new height.
Prognoses relate to the success of this company, so that it's blessed, but something can be said.
Decades of songs in thirty minutes are not so demonstration of the phenomenonic gift, the safe and powerful declaration of purposes.
Some of the individual numbers, indeed, cannot be rejected: "Out Of the Black" is characterized by what is forgotten not a mechanical line, but by a slaughtered party.
The musicians smile say that this song is simpler to smile as they can.
It should also set a powerful "Little Monster" and a closed platform of the "Better Strangers" composition with a shexpitry quote in the rubber.
However, it is true that each of these songs will be good to the celebration of the heavy year, but when they play, they are able to spend more or less typically.
And that's not perfectly bad, even instead.
The Royal Blood Power is that they do not claim to new Lenin and MacCartony labs (like rapidly in the Motorhead premiums), but he has increased a number of Roth-Doets from the Indian Clubs.
Their music, despite some differences, has been created for stadiums, in a place which is less than a few thousand people, apparently close.
The secret to participate in the heating of the bass replaced by a guitare in a relative format designed at the beginning of the White Stripes.
However, the case is not only in instruments, but also in the approach to changing.
The heroes of retreat nulls with great work were elected from the border of the post-modernist paradise, with a huge shock of shock to recognize themselves not just by episodes, but by self-establishing creative units.
Royal Blood now sounds so powerful and shocked that this opposite has successfully caused some of the secondary and solidarity of the music material.
Well, at the end of the time, who said that the year should be wise?
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just reaffirmed what the information reported on Tuesday morning: Online Magazine and Video Producer, and hundreds of other things, purchases the Twitch streaming services for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
This news was not surprised because nobody expected that Twitch would be sold, but because many were expecting that YouTube would be a buyer.
Three months ago, Twitch's videoschers at Google for a good billion looked completely ready, and it was natural.
Twitch, founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, set up a goal to be the streaming service of the general nature -- the YouTube version in real time.
Instead of that, he was rapidly converted into a platform where heymers translated his internal games; "Youtube for a real time" said Business Insider.
Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video game where all scientists give (e.g., old) handling games, such as the Tainical Theatre, are already popular at YouTube.
The case is that YouTube is often mentioned when Twitch describes, so the news that YouTube is buying Twitch has been meeting without a special interest, a classical example of a coated technological company that purchases potential competition.
This is the secret why the YouTube shop was lost, given that he was ready to pay less than Amazon.
All we have at this time is a statement by the executive director Twitch Emmett Shira: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them quickly."
Another secret, honestly, is Twitch's incredible success.
I'll be able to be able to see the sports better than to look at it. It's hard to understand how to look at the games instead of getting the game into my hands.
One case is to look through a friend's head on the 3 a.m. when she passes through the Resident of the Evil, and to the other, see how a bilateral person receives 20 shots in Call of Duty.
All the games you could look right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today have been raised to one person, so to look at their smell, without controlling the edge of self-respectively, may be a receipt of the main pain that is accepted by Do It Right.
I agree that the speeds in which Rogers Bannisters of our electronic century end all the games in the recursion time are developed.
But if it doesn't speak about the virtuosis of games or humor, it's not likely that his Twitch channel will be very interesting.
But what do you know the sceptics like me?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors a month, and this is the fourth source of small internet trace.
What's Amazon doing about this?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch gets back to Amazon Instant video as well as YouTube could just shoot Twitch.
However, Twitch has the joy of receiving any company: young men who have dreams of publishers.
As the head of Twitch Shir, Amazon and Twitch said, "doe believe in the future game," and this channel does not give scourge signs, even it is a delicate type of sport.
In 2004, over 330 people, including 186 children, died.
More 800 people were blessed.
We spent a few days in Beslene.
They have spoken to the survivors - almost all students who are now with the parents of the dead - the city of Angels - Ramon Kaspottat, head of the Matrix Beslinan Committee, who took part in the special operation of the IPS, - reports the representative of the Office of Elizabeth Antonio, who worked on a special project.
After returning to Moscow, they met with Aslambeck Ashlamahan, who was a President of the North Caucash President 10 years ago, and held negotiations with terrorists, as well as with the FIB of Russia, Vichela Bochalor. "
What I was particularly surprised at working on this topic is that Beslaw seemed to haven't been these ten years.
This subject is extremely sick for everyone who has some relationship with her, people agree to say what happened.
The impressions of the travel are very hard.
But I can't forget Beslan, and I hope we did with our task," said Antonio.
The special project is prepared for Rambler & Co Holding Info study that works in company since spring this year.
The previous special projects were dedicated to the First World War and the 15-year-old residence of Wormira Putin.
The CDD has implemented a short-term missing launch

Deputy proposed to accelerate the entry into force of the Personal Data Act
In the event of successful initiative, Russian data will not be stored on the servers by slaughter from 1 January 2015
The Gospel introduced a draft law which provides the transfer of the date of entry into force by the Russian Personal Data Act adopted from 1 September 2016 to 1 January 2015.
The initiative is located on the basis of legislative activities of the low room.
His authors were the Championships of Vadim Day, Yaroslav Nilo (LDD), Eugenes Federations, Vladimir Parisin (Russian Faculty) and Alexander Southern Countries (CPR).
Such change, as the authors of the initiative, will contribute to more operational and efficient security of the rights of RF citizens to maintain personal data and compliance with the secretary of the information and telemune networks.
The law entitled to the parliamentary is obligation to store personal data on the territory of the RF on the internet.
He also makes binding records, systemization, collection, storage, identification and extraction of personal data of RF citizens, in Russia's databases, as well as information on the location of such databases.
Furthermore, the Law provides the Law on Royal Oversight on the basis of the court ' s decision to restrict access to information processed with violations of the RF legislation in personal data.
The Law also proposes the establishment of such "white lists" of offenders websites - an automated information system "Speakers of personal data violations".
This law was adopted by the Hospital of the Year.
The authors of the draft legislation have introduced Andrey Lugov and Vadim Day of LDDR and Alexandre Yuzako from the CCP.
Day and Yuzaco are also one of the authors of the current draft legislation on the transfer of date of entry into force already adopted.
Those who have no RF centre dates must be paid for the loan
The Communication of the first sentence of the Committee on Information Policy of Leonid Levin, which was today in the Hoover of the Law, stated that it would not consider problems to transfer the date of entry into force of the Personal Data Protection Act.
He said that the companies who will not have their own personal data on the RF territory by 1 January 2015 will be able to arrange them, for example, "Rosterekhome", which often said that they are willing to provide their servers in the arnd, and already provide their servers, the Mail Group, in Western companies that are already provided by their servers."
" There are also several independent data of the centres that are ready to cooperate in this area, " he added.
"If the company decides to comply with the law and continue to work on the RF territory, I see no problem, they will receive technological opportunities for the location," said Levine.
Compliance with the draft legislation
After the publication of the draft legislation, the Russian Electronic Communications Association expressed fear that Russians would not be able to use many global Internet services.
In particular, it is the online-blowing services of aircraft and hotels.
Association believes that "the legislative project remains subjects to personal data - the Russian Federation of the Rights to provide its own data in an imperative determination that their records, systemization and etc. should only be provided in the databases set out on the territory of the Russian Federation".
The Declaration stressed that a more effective measure would be the establishment of a user information mechanism on where the record is implemented, the systemization of its personnel data.
In that case, you can choose the territory on which action will be carried out.
Similar legislation on the localization of personal data in other countries has also resulted in achieving global services and significant economic losses.

Middle RF: Russia shall take accountable measures in the event of the EU ' s new sanctions
Russia remains the right to take accountable measures to protect its legal interests in the introduction of new anti-Russian sanctions, reports MIF.
In the report of the Russian external state, the European Council ' s decisions 'affirmed the incapacity of EU Member States to overcome the intelligence of uncertain support of their chief authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the east of Ukraine, with the " absolutely uncertain approval of the presence of Russian armed forces on the territory of this country" states on the website of the State.
MID RF regrets that Europe, instead of interesting its Member States, is affected by countries interested in strengthening the conflict with Russia.
Members of Europe should call on the peaceful settlement of the conflict in the east of Ukraine, and also to ensure the fully valued "diagram between the opposers", emphasizes the state.
The website also notes that there are no objective assessments of humanitarian situation in Donabass, where the total humanitarian disaster has been developed, as well as the increase in the number of victims among the peaceful population.

Hytric ways to spontaneize university education
While the value of university training for many students exceeds $1,000 per year, Matt Schrader, who will soon go to the second course, has thought to reduce expenditure.
He developed a system of the way the brothers of the books were insured by the elderly, proposing a nominal compensation to make them sell.
"My mathematical analysis student, which is usually $180, I got a seminar for $10 and the Chick-fil-A piece," says Schredder, 19-year-old, who is a 19-year-old covenant in Georgia.
The necessary literature for the last seminar would be $430, says he.
He costs $120.
According to the Council of Collections, the average student costs more than $1200 per year for training and training, but students have a number of options for reducing these expenditure.
Students are increasingly choosing online magics and creative ideas like the Shreder system.
The book record is increasingly popular, allowing students to use a book during the seminar, and it is often low than their purchase.
The Nybo Incorporate company, which belongs to more than 250 university bookshops, reports that the number of book slows from 2011.
Research shows that some four books in University Book Books were taken in the past summer seminar, says the Vice-President Nibo Trevor Meyer.
A less than half of all books are acquired in university bookshops, according to the "National Trade Association".
That's a introduction course for the best way to make a benefit.
Acquisition in the Internet Magazine
Sometimes, if you go to Internet, the prices for a new book may be one third of what you'll see in the university bookshop.
The nineth Matematical Analysis publication of Ronald Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostettler are about $290 for pre-screening, but a new exemplare can be acquired for $239.99 on Chegg.com website, which specializes for sales.
purchase of detention
If you are not against foreign places or damages held by training is a good option.
Mathematic analysis is sold for $93.49 in a deserved view at Chegg.com.
Matt Casedia, 25 years old, has paid the fourth course from Briggham Yang University to Amazon.com 42 cents for the detained e-mail "Strategic decisions in the Mediterranean: understanding the business part of the public business".
The book was sold for $48 new.
Promotors, for example, Ingrid Brecy, Director of the Colege without Stan at the University of Massachusetts in Emherste, invites students to specify their teachers whether they cannot use previous publications.
At times, the updates are not necessary for employment.
In such cases, old publications can often be found for a very small amount of value of the last publication.
Besides Chegg and Amazon websites, Half.com, belonging to "eBay Inc", is a popular alternative for buying detented books.
Procat
In order to take up training, you should be thinking of if you're going to be well with them, not forget to return them and you don't want to leave them after the course is completed.
You can set up more than 80% of the value of the new book.
For example, one student has been able to make the "Matematic Analysis" for about $20.
Explain the rules of the store where you are taking the books, including any traps that can be drawn for the labels, the emphasis and the damages.
If you take the book on the smell, remember: If you don't return to the book, the slaughter may even exceed the value of the new angle.
Electronic Books
Electronic books instead of traditional training are another option.
Sometimes, these books are ownly shuttled by obtaining electronic license for a certain period in distributors, such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The Matematical Analysis Profile is $61 at Chegg.com site for six months.
Brecy says that students studying literature often can find the most advantageous prices, since many classic experiences can now be scanned free, while the literature of natural and engineering sciences can be very costly.
Nevertheless, consider it.
Joe Holt, a 29-year-old age who will start a school at Pepperdin Legal School, recommends to use the ISBN number to explain the prices for the book, as it ensures that you are looking for the text you need.
Before you do an Internet order, you have to check out whether the book really exists.
It was not easy to give him that lesson.
The delivery of the book he received was replied for four weeks and, at the end, he paid the full price in the university bookshop.
Putin declared the full inefficacy of the Dark Eastern Development Fund
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, presented a meeting on priority investment projects and the Territories in the Forest, reports the Interfax budgetary investment fund for further Eastern Development, which has been established two years ago.
"15 billion rubbers have remained on the deposites," emphasized the President.
During the meeting, the Head of the State requested to accelerate the approval of the list of the Territory Foreign Development Territories.
He recalled that the draft legislation necessary for the establishment of the Tor should be introduced to the Gospel of this Monday.
The Federal Meeting, noted by the President, did not adopt the list of the Territories of Progressive Development in the Forest, and their criteria.
Vladimir Putin also set up the main objectives for the development of the Forest.
Among them, improved transport access to the region, the elimination of infrastructure limits are both on the internal market and for the development of export.
Furthermore, it must be necessary for additional investment in the region, as well as to form the Territory of Income Development, which should be competitive towards the key business centres of ATR, to be competitive.
Remember, it was previously reported that the Territory of Counter-Economic Development could replace the ECE.
Why the galaxies couldn't save cash collections?
Sylvester Stallon returned less than $30 million from its $90 million budget in the United States, while "The Sinful Goal: Women to kill" only returned $12 million from its $70 million.
The Home Home with Cameron Diaz has provided only $14.6 million for the first week, while children's films, such as "Kak to bring dragon 2" are also distracted.
The article of the Telegraph Robby Collin shows that when it is talking about children's films, it may be a bad case as the most films.
Collin called the 2014's "beast" year for the whole history of children's films, and called "Kak to make a dragon 2" and "functioning" funds continued.
However, when there are films aimed at a number of more older ages, it seems that the problem is not necessary to be the most films.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average retina CinemaScore and Metacritic for each film that was above the year in the number of at least 2000 cops between May and July 20, 2013 and that year.
The results that take into account the views of cinema as well as the cinema criteria make it possible to suggest that the films of this year are like a calibra with the last year's chiefs.
Some comments suggest that the case may be in the changed attractions and the growing popularity of the Internet rivers such as Netflix.
Resident John Faarro, who works at this moment soon on the exit of the Dynasian film "The Book of Jungley," said the website Hollywood Reporter, "I think it's time to change."
We must recognize that and not try to smile for what happened before.
Rather than the current fall of the cash collections in Hollywood, Netflix access from the fluctuation play service reached $1.2 billion, almost two over the last year of $837 million.
Last year, the director Steven Spilberg discovered the study because they're too trusting in the comics Francis, and proposed the "gree" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current fall, some comments say that it was a part of the truth in his mature predictions.
As a result of the outcome of a number of potential cassettes in 2015, including “Masticians: Altrona”, “Minione” and “Suur Park”, the other representatives of the film industry have been more optimistic.
Simon Kinberg's producer recently called the fall of cash collections just "cycling", said Hollywood Reporter, "the swimming flight will be the most casual season in history, and no one will worry about it."
Product sanctions are not scared of owners of the Caucasian and Medium-Asian food, but for the restaurants of the European and Japanese Russian cook.
And in general, there is no preference to replaced imports from non-Russian products, but from Latin America, Israel and China.
"There is a little bit more than the bad mozarelle" is cut off by the Head of the Italian restaurant Barlotti Marino Valero on the quality of the skin that offers him to deliver it from the Italians.
Mozarrela and the snare of the burrat finished in the first restaurant, and they have a small time of storage.
The parmegazine's got to stop for a couple of months.
What do you do?
Go to Russian?
In 2005, I was at the Doromily Market.
Mariano Valerio shows that it is clear: the shocking memories do not leave him until now.
The meat was on the tv over 30 centimeters from the field!
There's a kiss!
Strikes!
Then I said, for our restaurant, we're never going to buy anything at Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe there's all changed.
But on the day, I was brought to the test of fish from the Dark East.
That's how she's been sweet!
I said I don't even want to talk to someone who brought it to us.
Varieo is surprised that many of the common things for Italy are for the Russian manufacturer in dicovine.
A few years ago, I was supposed to buy Russian guayadin.
In Italy, milk is in the cold camera for 10 days at temperature 1-2 degrees.
It should be depending on being mild to disable the mouse.
I've done this with the local guest.
Then they asked me, "Where did you take such a sweet meat?"
I said it's your, Russian!
Why don't you do that?
In five minutes of walk from Barlotti to the French restaurant, "Brasserie Most" is on the kitchen, where there are no products indicated: French steelers, sea food.
The Brasserie Most and the Strike Bar, Reese Trigel, are not so pessimistly set as Valerio: the people from France have already been replaced by Tunisia and the French restaurants will be buying Swiss.
On the other hand, and Reese is more emocional when it comes to Russian suppliers: " The Crown Capstal is 200 rubbers!
I ask, "Why, why is it so?"
I answered, "No, we have to pay too."
But this capstal shouldn't stand 80 rules!
We're buying a weight in the south, but they're 15-20 years old, imagine how much their panciller's weight?
The price is that it's superdelete.
The Russian delivery seems to be one of the main sources of drought for foreign shops.
Standard history: "The three months were all good, then the quality was slightly slow."
Main claims: Russian suppliers cannot be able to stable and quality.
Many restaurants of the European kitchen don't know that they will be with them when the smells are completed

Sanctional Menu
6. August, President Vladimir Putin signed a statement of the application of individual economic measures to ensure Russia ' s security, which are called in the main product sanctions.
The country is prohibited to import gums, sweats, meat and subproducts from home birds, meat cuts, fish, milk, yellows, creatures, sweats, fruits, fruits, grains, cows, and sugar shoes.
The restaurants started Chahard with suppliers: the prices of the product have been grown and the same needs to be urged from other countries.
This is the stronger than it is said on road restaurants with the monopy of France, Italy, Spain, where products were put directly from the "matterin" countries.
It had to be overwhelmed and soon.
For example, when Russian accommodation interdisciplined Australian guayadin in the beginning of 2014, and a year ago, the American and Canadian meat.
Instead, the suppliers were arranged for guayadines from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the sanctions of summer-2014 were more serious.
Indeed, 20 August, Prime Minister, Dmitri Medvedev, adopted amendments to the President's instruction, which depend on the prohibition of the children of the Atlantic Round and Forel, unlawful milk, seed cardfel, cowboys, horns and legs for visit.
The Italian Valerio hopes that sanctions can still be cut down.
However, there is a part of the restaurants in the conditions of incertitude.
According to the West-Zostat company, one of the largest HoReCa suppliers was 70 per cent of imports in the primary segment.
The restaurants have to change the menu under the production of local farmers and other countries, says Sergey Miron, a restaurant, the owner of the Restkonsalt.
If the chief is strong, it will not be a problem for him.
Only we have a few of these cases, and the development of a new menu can take two-third months.
Trigel from the Brasserie Must restaurant will be ready: 10 to 15 per cent of the bags, even half of the menu is to be processed.
In the restaurants with sweet kitchen, for example, the shoes of the marble shoes on the befstrogans, says Sergey Miron.
"The troops from Europe can be replaced by Russian, Whiterusian cereals, Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile, and are listed by the representative of the Province West-South Oxan Gilbчuk.
Little and milk products from Europe are similar in Russia and Belarus.
The Curry of the United States can be replaced from Russia and Belarus, shoes and seeds from Norwegia - roses, seeds, forelets from Belarus and Chile.
The lack of fruit and fruits of European production may be compensated by producing manufacturers, proposals from Serbia, Moldova and China.
In Mironwa's view, the budgetary restaurants will be more simpler than the primary segment: not there were gurmans that have been able to distinguish the Italian shower from Russians.
Although the Ginza Project is difficult, it is considered it.
Ginza Project has a number of tens of restaurants under different burns and with its menus.
"There'll take a lot of time for the replacement," says Miron.
In Ginza, comments were rejected, referring to the absence of owners in the country.
The authorities of the Café and Medium-Asia coffee stressed that products from the former Council Republic of Europe are more aromatic
But there are few restaurants that are not almost covered by sanctions.
They relate to the kitchen of SNGs: shipping, tooth, Armenian and Azerbaijan.
"In the French kitchen there are no price products," says Hatuna Colbaya, the owner of the shipping restaurant Saperavi and the coffee "Wi-moo!".
All the laughs for us are done in Russia, based on many smoke fleet, we're not using exotic green."
In Colombia's works, no observances have been selected from the menu.
Timor Lanka, a restaurant owner of Chichon N1 with the Zabec cuisine, has no smile: the sanctions must be changed only to the New Zealand.
If Russia runs imports from Usbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we're even winning in price, it'll be decreased to us than import from Europe, he says it.
The CNG can be deceived with extraction, jewelry, powders, shooters, fruits.
In this regard, what they bring from the Mediterranean, is much better than "plastic" from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
Over the Zabecs, everyone knows they're nice, sweet.
Nobody say about the Spanish.
After the application of the sanctions, the representative of the Ministers of Uzbekistan Olymboy Artics stated that it was planned to increase exports of fruit-products in Russia by two to 2016.
It was intended to replace European imports in Russia almost immediately after the sanctions were introduced by Belarus and Kazakhstan.
The restaurants that responded to the Deneg's request also are very calmly reacting to sanctions.
McDonald's press service said that localization exceeds 85 per cent and the network worked with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatiana of the Boodan Department of Work with the Subway Russian suppliers, some 80 per cent of the net products are purchased in Russia, although they may have timely complicated with providing fruit and growing prices to milk products produced from imports.
The Thermost sanctional products did not have more than 4 per cent.
They didn't get sanctions and the skin Wacker.
KFC, Burger King and "Crown Cartosh" weren't answered, but other market participants say that the Burger King's localization level is significantly less than McDonald's.
In the absence of the Norwegian fish, restaurants are ready to purchase the Chile rather than the Russian Dark East
On your snake
Together, the restaurants are regretting that the price increases even in local products.
"The product for Graley" prices grew up average 10-15%, for the Italian restaurant "Cerry Mio" two times," says the restaurant Romans.
Even in the Bahrain restaurants, the rabbit is 5 to 10 per cent, recognizes Colombia.
"Ocean Zooka" does not denice: "Napromer, the Belarus milk product from the beginning of August traveled to 10 to 15%."
"The Brazilian suppliers have led prices almost two times to the sweet, "declared Sergey Rack, Vice-General Director Stardogs.
Railways traveled to 35 per cent.
Let's wait for China's price, maybe they shock the brasilian heads.
In the nearest time, "Stardogs" will be planned to increase 8% prices.
Now and so unwanted to take the prices, says Rack.
In statistics, the growth in the second quarter of 2014 is only 1.8 per cent.
This is the smallest indicator after 2010.
The raw prices will continue to grow, but it is unacceptable, as soon as possible: until the majority of the restaurants have been covered by products for the next two months in hope to survive the transfer of the purchased prices.
But what's going on in two months, no one knows.
There are ten chairs decorated with green and trees in front of the marine of Moscow.
In the center of the scene, musicians play waves.
This is the festival of regional products with a joyful name "The time is."
"We've been planned to celebrate local food, and here as a sanction, we've been shocked, organized the festival," says one of the organizations.
As a scene with the Greek Power Anastas, there was a Macaron and home confess-maker class for the preparation of charmed balls on day.
All of the Russian products believe organizers.
The exhibition of the Russian nationality is in shaats.
Med from Baskiria, Olenn of Salehard, fruits of the sub-shosa "Lenin" named League, shoes from the shoes of Italian Jay Clouds.
" The restaurants can be tranquilly replaced by another fishing pool from the Dark East, " said the owner of the fishing rabbit Philip Galkine.
We have a nerve, a kit, a sweet, a sweet, a shoe, a king's horse.
Yeah, they're not so grain as the Norwegian stone, because it's a dick fish.
The Norwegian rock is the same aquaculture.
You take him in the hand, he doesn't even shoot it.
And our western shoes you don't keep in your hands.
Only non-specific claims are agreed to replace the Italian mosaic
In the shooting of his shoe, there are shoes with the "Magazine", the shoe, the mould, the mushroom, the midst of the Crema, the shoes of the Dark East.
Halkin is sure that a long time is to go to fish from the Dark East.
According to statistics, fishing in Russia in 2013 is more than 4 million tonnes, a major part of the fish is in Japan, Korea and even in the United States.
Fish imports in 2013 to about 800 000 tonnes.
His people are working since 2012, sell the fish through the Internet magazine, until sanctions were introduced, there are more than half the restaurants, such as "Prender things".
Now, 15 restaurants have been requested to Galkina.
The same sweet can be made from our fish, he's sweet.
We've been shocked, tried different receptors.
Now, we're going to sell through the internet magic for millions of rules per month.
Our fish is a few times deceived, and the delivery is a maximum of 15 kilograms.
In the confirming chair of Galkina, I'm preparing the Philadelphia port with the kitchen.
Unlike the roles of the seed, these should be more widowed, but knowing that this fish is our wives.
On the website, the "Is People" is even the roles of the balls and the sea eyes.
In the soshibars, the Norwegian horse prefers the Chile.
Galkine explains that the success of Monday to plan new receptions with the further western fish.
"Russian suppliers haven't proposed us before," says Killfish Bar Dmitriy Eussei's owner.
The same situation is also with other products: Russian producers could take the free cut, but it does not happen.
According to the founder and owner of the Lavka Lavka Boris Akimon project, it is now possible to speak about the substitution of imports from Europe and America from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large transnational corporations with powerful logistics and large amounts.
They can quickly notice the banned imports from our farmers.
That is, first of all, the major producers of other countries win from the prohibition,” says Akimo.
However, in the last month, the restaurant has received more alarming signal than product sanctions.
As a result, the Russian supervisory checks have been temporaryly suspended by three McDonald's companies in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stabropol and Ecatherinburgh.
"We have studied the fact of the claims for the identification of action necessary for the rapid opening of the restaurants for visitors," said "Dengam" in the press office of McDonald's.
Indeed, no one understands what will continue.
If everything is limited to product sanctions, it is one option that can survive, is said at the conditions of an anonymity of the company employed by the restaurant.
If McDonald's will start closing around the country, the scenario will be completely different.
Europrotocol instead of AIDS
The cash payments can be received without GIBD's help, so the CBI intends to stimulate the implementation of the EuroProtocol in Russia.
The Russian bank has developed a project of indications that, since 1 September of this year, it could be able to be paid without HIV.
It is true that only the cases when the accident was formed on the EuroProtocol without the participation of the road police.
I mean, if only two cars had been involved in the TSD, no physically affected persons who do not exceed the deadline, and both drivers have agreed to the issue of the accident.
From 2 August, the Europrotocol payment is 50 000 rubs and from 1 October in Moscow, San Petersburg, as well as in the Moscow and Leningrad area will be increased to 400 000 rubs.
It is that, often even in less damages, the situation in which the EuroProtocols can be formed by the drivers shocked in the accident calls for DTDs.
For the police of the cocktail was not able to repay without the aid of AIDS.
The parameters set out in the draft indication are intended to eliminate the obstacle to the introduction of the EuroProtocol in Russia.
According to them, the maximum cash payment for DTDs provided without GID staff should not be below than the "europrotocol" limit.
However, it may not be above the limit defined in the Coco insurance treaty.
The idea, of course, is useful and theoretically able to download both DPS staff and roads.
But it is probably not going to be insured, nor any insurance, nor any insurance.
Recently, there is a serious threat to the growth of fraud that could lead to the new rules on cash payments.
With regard to drivers, it is difficult to imagine what work should be done to overcome the Spanish Russian consertism.
In most cases, the driver will wait for an inspector to make a small accident because it is more reliable.
And it's not known that it'll be easier to win driving or convince drivers in the reliability of the Euro Protocol.
Conservation certificates make them unfortunate
Minfin wants to prohibit the reserve certificates to the prosecutor, so that the banks will allow them to make an analysis of their free contribution.
Minfin is preparing a draft legislation prohibiting the conservative certificates of the applicant.
This instrument has recently collected popularity as the rates above than the bank contributions.
The case is that the reserve certificates of the claimant do not fall in the tax insurance system, and the bank is deficit because it is not necessary to pay accounts to the Tax Insurance Agency (ACS).
The situation is that this step is planned to be taken because of small and medium-sized banks that distribute such certificates and suffer from Sberbank and Moscow Bank, which controls 98 per cent of the profile market, according to the ACS assessments.
The share of the Moscow Bank, according to the Agency, is around 3,5 per cent.
The problem explained in the ASB is that clients of a small bank that purchase such a certificate are trying to obtain money to the ASV.
Some income, with no sufficient financial graphicity and purchase conservative certificates to the applicant, may propose that their attachments are threatened.
The lack of insurance payments for these certificates may result in inconsciousness and social tension.
In practice, the Agency had been cases when the claiming certificates tried to repay the insurance reimbursement through the court” stated in the ASV.
It's, of course, a problem.
The purchaser will still have no certificate, since they have no right to repay from the State.
If this would be the case that the instrument was not threatened by the ASV, it would also prohibit a metallic account on which the citizens are taking into account in grams of one of the four metals, gold, gold, placing and ball.
Because these accounts do not also fall in the investment insurance system, but their existence will be tried to no one.
The case, probably, is that the claimant certificates are a very valuable valuable bump, which may actually play in the role of cucideneg.
Their movement is not practically controlled: any client of the bank may purchase a certificate, deliver any citizenship, and the number of guests may change.
In the law draft, it is noted that the conservation certificate must be a precisely valuable burden that should be stored in the depositary.
In order to submit a pile to banks, such certificates are authorized to issue without the right to a delay.
That is the analysis of an unexpected contribution that has long been dreaming of bankers.

Two Unions meetings
Debates at the top level in Minsk did not solve the problems for which they had been addressed but have been generated a new format: the first person of the European Union had met the first persons of the future of the European Union.
Please also be concerned (the situation around Ukraine does not suffer), EU leaders and the Tambour Union have first discussed a number of “deep problems”.
Whether this structure can work effectively, uncomprehensible; it is clear that those who have removed rings from this summit.
The questions on this account were held on 26 August, when the Belarus and after them and the other Europeans had been seen in the television of the new President Lucasenko.
The Belarus's leader has shown an example of accurate teaching, a man ' s conduct, which just smile a jackpot, and plans the appropriate age in the higher society.
How Midan Lukashenko helps
The event in Minsk is immediately three major European Commissioners (EU Ministers) who met Lucas and allowed him to speak on a final briefing on their behalf - not just the legitimation of the President with the 20-year-old stage.
This is a claim for the recognition of the full of European policies and the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
The Old Analytics of the Belarus Institute for Strategic Research Dennis Melissans is convinced: Brussels is now not able to talk to Mine as well as before.
"The fact that Catherine Ashton met the Tet-a-Tet with Lukashennko, gives the reasons to believe that the relationship with the EU will continue to be disappointed," he said "Honnick".
The iceberg has a hidden part: the preparation for the slope of the Belarus authorities has started long before the Maydan of November 2013 in Kiev.
" The results have been achieved and with the EU are successful negotiations on the facilitation of the visa regime and reamministration, the modernization dialogue, and the Consulting of the Honour, and the United States negotiations on international security have been held.
The United States have even taken some sanctions.
With regard to Ukrainian events, they themselves and responded to Belarus's guidelines only to the process.
Minsk, from one part, has been able to maintain a relationship with Ukraine - quite warm enough to lose strongly in the mutual trade, and President P Goodenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.
Another Belarus leader who had not recognized the association of Crusa to Russia and called for the prostitute of Donbass, with all the strictness, has not been shocked and with Moscow.
Minsk is not out of the Tambour Union, nor from the ADCD, and the Russian Aviation Aviation is located in the Bangkoks.
Brussels and Washington noted the balanced position of Minsk on the Ukrainian issue - and assessed it, the assurance of the Belarus experts.
When the movement of Lukashenko to political diversification is successful, it will be shown how often Minsk is to take meetings in the EU+TS format.
In the press office of the High Representative of the EU on external policy and diplomatics, Catherine Ashton had not been able to respond operationally to the question of what Brussels expected to be in a new format.
The secretariat Ashton Maya Cosianchich just stated that the subject was not a priority for the decision of war and peace.
There was a report that the next place for Ukrainian meeting with the first persons in the new format could also become Kazakhstan.
The Champion of Degy for Minsk was a statement by President Nürsulatan Nazarbaev, in which he acknowledged that it was requested by representatives of the European Union.
However, in the final briefing, Alexandre Lukashenko understood that all of the parties did not contrary the Minski to remain a central area for meetings as well as in Russia, OBSE, and at the level of the heads of States and high representatives of the European Union.
This means that the last Dictator of Europe is fully directed by the European leader who helps to solve the global problem.
Best friend of the European Farmer
The delegation of the EU, including the Euro-Euromystors on Trade and Energy, underlined the conclusion: the main submission of the Somit is not a tragic situation in Donbass, and the economy.
Indeed, the schedule of future gas supply negotiations and the overcome of the TS countries on the EU Association Agreement is more than peaceful declarations without specific date and numbers.
However, the Commission on Trade, Carl De Gucht, stated: "The representatives of the EU came to Minnesota to seek a decision on a political crisis that has economic consequences, not against the contrary."
It seems, however, that the economic crisis in Ukraine works in Belarus.
His consequences - and first-term mutual sanctions of West and Russia - give Minsk, which has been the long-term sanctional pressure for the manner.
According to the words of the Director of the Mixed Research Center, the Ex-Candidate at the President of Belarus, Yaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are actively interested in the possibilities of Belarus's agricultural production in the sector of sanctions.
The delivery schemes for which Vladimir Putin has been slaughtered by Minsk.
"The initiativers of these schemes," emphasized Romanchuk, "Ogonika", "remember" is not the Belarus businessmen, but the Russian companies.
They have long deployed goods delivery schemes, including Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and these schemes have been destroyed today.
Russian business is necessary to restore them, even through the bicycle structure.
The second surrounded by the expert is that many Ukrainian companies do not allow the production of Belarus from the Ukrainian base, also with a Russian market orientation.
The Ukrainian producers ordered to export $4 billion to Russia, and the Belarus's trade schemes can now be extremely displaced."
Romansk believes that the role of the EU's negotiations and TS for Lukashenko is perfect and in the context of economic relations with Europe.
He recalls that the loss of the EU agrarian sector from Moscow sanctions is estimated by 5 to 10 billion euros, and the European Union has currently proposed 125 million euros of compensation.
The Belarus President may propose that Brussels work together in order to minimise the consequences of the euro farmers.
This may take up the authority of Lukashenko to the EU to an unreasonable height.
Holidayness without initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarus's authorities for the Summit initiative.
But paradox is that the official Minsk was denied by its active role in the TS+EU-born format, and the Belarus leader at the meeting with the Ukrainian colleague emphasized that the new format and its entirety of the Kiev initiative.
“It was your proposal to gather, without any request to discuss, not with the boundaries, after the signing of the Treaty on Association with the EU, into the situation that was at that time in Ukraine,” he called on before the chambers to Peter Pettynco.
Moreover, observers protested this as a attempt to relieve Moscow, and it was initially against the Minska media, which increases its political weight.
In the Bielorrusian diplomatic state, the Belarus stressed that the EU and the EU's TS organization in their country is not towards the main objectives, and the final purpose of this format - the establishment of a single economic space from Lisbon to the Slovenia.
"It is absolutely in the spirit of the concepts that, in other areas, in particular in the area of security, moves and moves the leadership of our Strategic Union, the Russian Federation," said the "Ogonko" in the Belarus, the state of which recently switching words.
In Moscow there may be a payment input zones
Moscow's Government considers the option of introducing zones with payment income as a means of restrainting central roads in the same way with other large cities of the world, brings M24.ru with reference to the Moscow's shipping slaughter for Maxim Lixtov's transport.
One of the options that successfully recommended themselves is a paying entry.
That's an expert opinion, we're required to study it, to look at all the past and plus.
To tell them that there was a decision taken in this regard until early,” said Lixuth.
Zammar stressed the importance of Asian cities experiences that were similar to Moscow, for the authorities of the capital authorities.
One of the decisions taken from these countries is already the construction of a central corner car, added to Lixut.
The recent construction of the Central Corporation Card is an example that it is not necessary to pass through Moscow.
If there was a sufficient train infrastructure, it would not be necessary to have a transit traffic in Moscow,” said the Emmanuel.
Maxim Lixut also stated that the introduction of payment parks had significantly downloaded capital streets.
In his words, the national authorities are not planned to stop the achievement.
Remember, on 26 August, Mr. Russian capital Sergey Soviet participated in the trademarks of the first launching complex of the Moscow Headquarters (CCAD).
Skill Skill
The film Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez, "The Women's Slaughter-2: Women's Gould" did not completely the revolution that could be expected.
The first "Good of sins" (2005), covered by the minimum but symbolic participation of Quentin Tarantino, made revolution in relationships between films, mixes and literature nucleus.
He also skied his revolution: in the sense that he destroys the fundamental for the modern thinking of the "thesis - Antithesis - synthesis" ceppo (if you understand under the test of the universe nuclear and under the antithesis - the scope of the comics).
It should now be read, "thesis is anti-thesis haos".
"Good of sins" is also dramatic, and on the philosophic level: both times he has a narrow sense of words.
Yes, a part of the heroes is known on the first "Good", although this is, the sound of Marv (Micky Ruk), remembered, ended on the electrical store, and there is nothing, just and tried to swallow - in the role of this popular wife, from the legs and other shoes.
But the elders are literally cutting new pieces that have been cut into the city from another film, about the meaning and smiling of which the slaughter are not concerned.
Yes, his story, which was uncomfortable by the authors on the most interesting place, is in the super-profit player of Johnny (Jasef Gordon Lewit).
It's in a volunteer-frigery Eve Lord (Eva Green) and for some of her sweet Duyte (Jos Broline).
But this trip that Duyte says is not to be different from Johnny - more than the persons like other parts of the body, the individuals are insufficiently regular, not poverty or even half-power.
It's not people, we know that these are the archipels of noir: a yearly shoe that is too sure of the player who enjoys the "medium wood" sex detective, corrupted the senator.
Well, when the archaepsis runs out with the architect and the architect, it's not filmed, but read that an abstract biography.
It's just funny to bring an abstract book on the logic.
Moreover, even in this suspicious world there is something constant.
The battles of the first "Good" continue to be rounded from their neighbors of dark forces.
There's no call for detective Hartigaran, and Bruce Wilson's is always glad to see.
The main problem of the "Good of sins" 2 is different.
Frank Miller was good that as a qualifier had talentally connected comics and zeros, and as the register turned up the presentation of how to move mixes to the screen.
Comics and Nuer are two aggressively contradictional "reality".
The phenomenon of the comics was born at the end of the 1920s, and then, when the Romans of Dashila Hammet (1929), the Maltian Scool (1930) and the Skill Key (1931) built a noir channel called hard-boiled school.
Well or pulp fiction.
The comics gave the Hollywood many tens of heroes: from the Popaia Sea, the grain of the spitata grain that gives him rich power, superman, Batman and the slaughter of Dick Treysy to Calka, Thora, the Man Pauca and other "masters".
However, in any film on the motives, the painted persons did not want to choose the screen flesh, remained manufacturers in their neighboring " real" world.
In fact, they were totally slaughtered by the existence.
Nevertheless, the most exciting jealous of the world literature.
After world war, a traditional Roman, with concerns, characters, family scandaries and historical background, has lost any confidence.
What forums are the Tibo and Rugon-Maccar, even the Bolconics and Rostovs after Verden, Osvencima and Hiromi?
This Roman has been peacefully mutatised in a mile-operation, and the criminality, as defined, has increased to the level of philosophic prosecution.
Hammet at his shore learned that it's a sanitator on the front.
He was a communist.
As it was, at least close to the competition and the pillars, such as the writers of Horas McKick and Jim Thompson, registers of Jull Dassen, Joseph Louce, Edward Dmitrick.
Thus, the architecs they have brought, first, strike and quoted, and the second is softly social.
This is not the American variant of sociorealism.
The first "Good of sins" was noted just as the contrary, but organizedly connected comics with norm.
At the first time, the mix was waiting, not by its graphic nature, but not by the "the real" film.

France's socialists must " shut up and bring France to order", says the key unioner of Frausua Olland
Mr. Val urged the deeply separated left forces to "demonstrate the warm relationship" to the attacked president-socialist whose stops were not found to be approved by most French.
The Chairman respects each one, serves our loyalty, he grants our support.
"This is our debt - stay close to him," he said, calling applauses.
The Prime Minister believed that his Government would not put in question a 35-hour working week in France, despite the disadvantaged conflict proposals, to reduce the rules made by Emmanuel Mcron, the new Minister of Economy, previously in that week.
At Saturday, Mr. Olland requested his partners on the Socialist Party to remain "one" with the Government.
However, Christian Thobian, the Minister of Justice, put a roll to the ship, came to the congregation of unacceptable members of Parliament from the Socialist Party, and disclosed the Socialist Party that she allowed the French "to lose faith in the future".
Marin Le Pé, the leader of the extremely right front, expressed the opposite to permanent domestic conflicts among socialists, said that it did not consider that the new Government of Vale remained for more than a few months.
Francois Olland is a black king, but the black and prince Manuel Val, who was obliged to gather a new Government when it was not longed and flight.
"And the new will not continue on the wednesday or wine," said Ms. Le Penn.
She repeated the call of its party to a parliament, said that she was sure that the party could easily win and be ready to be managed.
The French right party had survived from the Mart municipal elections, and the extreme legal national front was the first to EU elections in May.
Resurrectional Journal du Dumanche found that 76 per cent of French believes that the socialist party risks a number of confronting fractions before the end of the President of Mr. Olland in 2017.
Packel Perryno, politician from the University of Sians Po, warned that the French would lose patience quickly if the new socialist government could not correct the economy and the re-coordinated unemployment.
"Hither has little time, but the public's opinion needs to feel quickly what is changed," he warned.
In the other case, the situation may be worse.
"The Body without drugs" remained without search.
The Swedish arbitration court left without considering the budgetary directive of the Ministry of Regional Management of Hospitality to the Fund of the Wool without Drugs.
Wednesday was intended to spend more than 7 million rubbers in the centre of Ecatherinburg.
However, the ruler has not appeared in the court two times.
Today, the arbitrary Court of Sweden left without considering the executive directive of the Ministry of State Administration of the Region (MUGISO) to the Fund "The World without Drugs" (one of the founders Mr. Ecatherinburg Eugene Royzman).
The representatives of the areas of the authorities wished to call out with the organization 7.3 million rubbers as a loan for the building.
Today it was known that the ruler had not appeared two times in the court, because it had been adopted a decision on the refusal.
The absence of representatives in the IUGISO directive had not been able to explain, and the chief of the Legal Office of Maxim Titt did not respond to telephone calls.
The representatives of the fund were not able to connect.
Remember, it was a special fund in the city centre on the Belin Street, 19 on a free road since 2011.
This decision was adopted by Alexander Mishari.
In November 2012, the Ministry of State Administration of Sweden's Administration of State and Administration Division issued the Swedish arbitration Court for the expulsion of the fund from the building.
According to the investigation, the State was required by the court to recognize the unexpected treaty of a memorandum.
In the view of the MIGISO directive, there were no significant conditions for the allocation of cultural heritage.
The Swedish Arbitration Court rejected, then appealed to the 17th Arbitration Court of Permi, who was pleased.
Then the same Court has granted a cassational complaint to this decision, which remained unpleasant, after which a decision was condemned by the Supreme Arbitration Court, but the Court adopted the party to the directive.
In 2013, a new tariff contract was concluded that the fund repayed again, reported to the head of the city of Eugene Royzman.
The Ardenian payment was appointed for a month by 300 thousand rubs.
The previous Administration has given us this building to a free-drive use, acknowledging our responsibilities to combat drugs as a sign of respect for the fund.
The current Administration decided to be different," he stated.
Mother Draghaev, Ecatherinburgh
Why Mr. Eccaterinburg proposed to go volunteerly?
On July 24, the deputy of the mountain of Eccaterinburgh, Alexandre Cossinski, proposed the master of the city, a spiker of the Royzman's mountains to go away.

This was reported in the HUM of the Swedish Zone, where the relevant statement was made by Anna Filatus's director of the Law Center, Anna Filatus.
According to her, Mr. Royzman accused her in his blog that she was involved in crimes that could have done her former couple.
Mr. Eccaterinburg is convinced that "that's a normal attempt to know the truth."

In paragraph 9 of September, when Apple is to submit its new developments, the press appears to all the new challenges of what to be expected from the presentation.
American media reference reports that the sixth generation of iPhone will be able to deal with the function of a mobile apple project and the Visa, MasterCard and American Express payment systems.
According to Bloomberg and the specialized Re/Code Internet Ressource, Apple, on 9 September, may notify the joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express, resulting in the new iPhone 6 phone, as a result of the function of a mobile cocktail.

Hong Kong ' s democracy activists strike the statement of the Chinese representative on the next day following the decision of elections
The group of faithful citizens, Peking, was close to the Chinese flag.
The Permanent Committee of the Alliance of the People ' s Representatives on Sunday identified a procedure for which two or three candidates would be allowed to participate in the elections of the leader of Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates should first receive support for most members of the movement committee, which would probably be the part of Peking's filists.
The decision is almost impossible for a democratic opposition to go into the election Bulletin and has renewed the democratic movement activists to stop the Hongkong financial centre by the Occupy Central Protests.
Political reform is the main source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese leaders fear that the calls for democracy are distributed to other cities.
According to the publication of the Beijing Document, which describes the control of China over Hong Kong, the Democratic Movement Actists held an informal referendum on elections in the special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands have gone to the business centre and have established a seat burden.
Brifing Li is organized by the Government of Hong Kong and the Chinese Office on Contacts in Hong Kong.
The Vice-President of the Permanent Committee of the General Assembly of the People's Representatives of Jang Rongshune and Vice-Chairman of the Hong Kong and Macao of the State Council of Fing Way should also be held on a series of publications during the day.
Attivist students said they would be gathered into the Headquarters of Hong Kong on the second half of the day.

Israel's authorities intend to join 400 lands from the Palestinian autonomy
Israel’s authorities announced that the intentions were to join 400 hectares of the earth on the west coast of the Jordan River belonging to the Palestinian autonomy.
As the Bibi-size reports, the decision to join the South Viflian land is related to the desire to pay for the defeat and murder of three Israeli adolescents in June that year.
Israel ' s defence territory was declared on Sunday and enforced the military to arrange the administrative administration on the western coast.
According to the representative of the Gaza Saiba Arikata sector, the world public should call Israel to respond to the “continuing residence activity in the west coast of Jordan and the East Jerusalem”.
Putin requires to start negotiations on the Stateness of Eastern Ukraine
According to the Russian news report on his comments, the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, needed in the Sunday that the Ukrainian Government stopped combats with separators in the west of the country and immediately began negotiations on the "economic" of the region.
His secretariat, Dmitri Pesko, later explained that Putin did not mean to advise that the Eastern Ukraine Territory would be part of the Russian separators, but that its status within Ukraine should be revised to provide the Russian region to protect their rights and interests.
However, inviting the Putin to the Chief Government to start negotiations with prostitutes as equally with the clear strategy that it should be given from the beginning of the bloodproliferation five months ago: help separaters to take the territory and urgency the Ukrainian Government to give the new proclaimed territory of New Russia a real independence to approach Russia and not to Western.
In the interview of the first public TV channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to return by the territories held in the eastern Donetsk and the Lugan regions, which were entered in March and April after Moscow Annexed the Ukrainian Military Hales on 18 March.
Cleml and separators have recently called New Russia's occupied Territories, or New Russia, which are sent to the revolutionary day of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that any person who believes that peace negotiations will occur in the nearest future when the Ukrainian policies start to parliamentary elections on October 26 and when the Governments attack peace-related populations in the regions with the " illusion " reported ITAR-TASS.
"We must start immediately negotiations and not only on technical matters but also on the political device of society and the state of the Government of South-East Ukraine to enhance the interests of those living there", said he.
Pisko said that the words of the Pope of State were in the context of a broader autonomy, which was discussed in the course of months with the leaders in Kiev in providing to enhance the fear in Russian speaking areas, that their cultural and language rights were dangerous.
Only the Ukrainian Government may give the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions, said Pisk.
This is not a matter of discussion between Ukraine and Russia, said Peter, "for this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
Involvement of the secretariat Kremell to amend the "near interpretation" words of Putin emphasized the decision of the Russian leadership to conduct themselves in relation to the separatistic resurrection in the east other ways than the open clothes of Croma, where most of the 2 million people are ethnic.
Moscow would have to make a lot of more serious battle to join even Donetsk and the Eastern Ukraine, as most of 6.5 million people not Russians, and surveys before the beginning of the conflict showed a wide support for remaining within Ukraine.
The autonomy, which the Russian diplomates had discussed on international forums, would give regional governments in Ukraine the authority to determine trade agreements and external policy, in fact, transmitting the Cromil a real control over the territory that would have combined the main territory of Russia with the Cross.
The Russian military fleet, as well as the commercial marine institutions and the historical marine smokers, is located in the dark half of five months ago.
In the regions between the Russian and the Crom, there are also shaches, manufactures and lithiums that produce necessary equipment for the Russian army.
The Ukrainian President Peter Pettynko proposed in its inauguration statement on 7 June that the Ukrainian legislators, after the new elections, would be amended to the Constitution which allows the separate regions to control their finances and language status.
However, his autonomy seems to be extremely different from the view of Kremell and the separators, in the arms and encouraging of Moscow.
The last call by Putin to Kyova to agree with the leaders of separater leaders as equal, followed new invasions last week after the Russian troops and dancers entered the Eastern Ukraine from the front of the peace area across the Azovo Sea.
The supported separators of Russia have been under control of the city of Newoazlovski, whose security officers said that they fear that it is the start of the strategic sea territories to the Cruma itself.
This has contributed to the extensive civil and military efforts to strengthen Mariopol, a steady port of 500000 people between the New Azotic and the Croatian Mediterranean.
On Saturday, a meeting of the leaders of the European Union in Brussels was called for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Council's Republic, which was independent of 23 years.
"We are closer to the point of unfold." Pennyenko warned.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign dancers are now in the Ukrainian territory.
The EU Summit did not take certain measures; the leaders called for a project of more sour sanctions against Russia that will be adopted in any case of the Ukrainian crisis.
The Ukrainian soldiers had to go with their position in Illowisk after two columns of Russian burnners and 1000 military in the last week in the Donetsk region, to support the experienced separators, Colonel André L'Senko, press-secret of the National Security Council and defence defence, reported reporters in Kyoto in Saturday.
The first of 63 Ukrainian soldiers, which have been held in Iloyask as a result of the Russian invasion, were exchanged on Sunday on 10 Russian airlines in Ukraine a week ago, reported Lesenko on Sunday.

The angry was the most universal and functional emotion of humans
The heartfelt expression of persons is universal for humanity, and everyone who participates in the creation of the body and group of museums is not a case, and is an additional means of expression of the brace and threats, declared by Australia and the United States.
They told them about their openings in the magazine Evolution and Human Beavior, and they can read in the Press-Relys of the University of Santa Barbara.
The angry expression of persons is a shocked and cut down brown cut into the shooting line of the smells is equal to all cultures and even blind from the birth of children who have never seen it, notes the author of Aaron Sell's research.
In the context of a large research project dedicated to the angry, the scientists explained that this emotion had occurred in the effective conduct of disputes during the conflict.
As much more physical damage can one person give to another, the more he has the possibilities to dictate its conditions, and he brings it to a co-conciliator with a angry.
Researchers have found confirms and other hypothesis: physically strong people are more intense and moved to the leadership, thinking that others are inadequate for them, and they also prefer strong ways for peaceful solutions.
Despite the importance of the angry, the scientists decided that the movement of each of the seven muscle groups of the heartfelt expression of the person should be represented by the anger's more powerful and dangerous person in the eyes of the counterparty, and that it would soon agree with its conditions to avoid conflict.
For the verification of this hypothesis, researchers have modeled a person on the computer where each of the seven elements of the angry person had existed or missed, and showed them to the information.
Though the slaughtered blooms or swallowed shocks in the individuality did not make a wrong person, a more stronger physically participant of the research had been acknowledged unilaterally.
Men's angry, as well as animals, is threatened: a pronounced demonstration of his own power to agree and to submit.
The man smells the news and smells with the same purpose as the smell that swims, or a grandfather that shows his skins.
The " angry " denied by the co-conciliator to take the situation, and the person immediately takes the form that most effectively demonstrates the contrary side of the refusal.
But the most discreet - that no one of the components of the arrogant person is arbitrary, they all express the same,” said the anthropologist John Tubi.
