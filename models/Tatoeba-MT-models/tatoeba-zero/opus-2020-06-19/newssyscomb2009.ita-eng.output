The triumph of the right populations in Austria: in total 29%
The perception of both existing parties in the great coalition and this marked strengthening of the right-related population partys has brought, in seconds, the first provisional results, to the advanced parliamentary elections of Domenica in Austria.
The Austrian Popular Party (EVP), within which the position of President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously empty, has immediately lost stronger.
On the contrary, the EU election leader for the future of Austria (BZÃ), the Khernten Jörg Haider sub-prefect, is preparing the trionphal return to the national policy.
According to the provisional results, however, the strongest-democratic party in the country remains the 29.8% of the votes, than the last elections of 2006, however, 5.5%.
It's still worse for OVP, who lost about 25.6% almost 9% of the votes.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the Austrian history of the afterguerra, and especially the literally catastrophic result of the peoples, which have caused previous elections.
On the beginning of July, when the DOVP abandoned the coalition, the people had a significant benefit in preferences before SPEC.
But the electors clearly punished them because they made the government astray.
Yes, in the first response to the results there have been speculations on the possible divisions of the President of the party, Vice-Chair Wilhelm Monter.
The observers believe that they may already happen during the extraordinary convocation of the party's direction.
This evolution may facilitate the way towards the most likely way out of the electional result, namely towards the renovation of the SPÖ and OPP coalition .
With regard to the strengthening of both the right - the liberalist parties (FPUE) have previously gained 18% and the BZUE 11% of votes - but the socio-democratics have also shown the concern of another 1999, when the populations agreed with the collective government, (which the GFUE was still unite, in 2005, separated from the BZW), which has been given reasons for sanctions by the European Union.
On this evolution obviously plays Haider, which has already declared that it is ready to cooperate with any party and bring a return to Vienna in national policy.
It has also been possible to enter the Green Party, but it has been slightly declined, and from the third to the fifth place between the Austrian political parties.
No other party has obviously exceeded the 4% threshold and has not entered in Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: The relationships with India can relax
If the problem was not able to resolve with the Czech scientists who have been accused of the illegal collection of shuttles in India, it would be likely to be the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain relief of the Czech-Indonesian reports.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after the meeting today with its Indian homolog Pranab Mukherjee.
"If you don't solve, then, if, if there would be a certain refrigeration," he found after the meeting that was held under the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee after the negotiations said that the executive power can difficultly enter into the legal facts.
However, he stated that in the case of Petr Švacha, which was assured by the accused and punished with a currency, the Central Government may negotiate with the local in Dardjeeling what happens under its court.
"It could be resolved," said the Minister.
According to Mukherjee, it would be better, for Emil Kučera sentenced for three years of prison, to rise to a superior instance.
Then you can ask the release on warrance and wait for the judgment in freedom.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner has been expressed in the same way during the negotiations.
"Recommendates the Court of First Instance, then it will be possible to obtain the grace," said the Chief of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech party can enter into the fact is to provide the "competent legal aid", supported the Indian Minister.
At the same time, he said that such support is already providing the Indian party.
"We have the most interest in maintaining the best relationships with India for many years.
The Indians also admit that," said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as he said to ˌTK, before his partner, he stressed that the Czech Republic gives a great importance to the problem of the Czech entomology.
"We really consider a deep error the reclusion and accused of these cechish scientists," said.
The Minister has avoided responding to the question if he has obtained the promise to take care of this.
"I've got so much promise," he only found.
A Czech judge in the fight for marine fundamentals
It is close to the electronic map on the wall on which Australia is drawn and the marine areas are designed.
But it is not interested in the continent but to a small point lost in the ocean blue.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with it the sea-based baseline.
The area is at the same time as the continent itself, says the Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuossso, which is part of a team of 33 workers of the OSN Division for marine issues and maritime rights.
His head, the Czech lawyer of the Division, Václav Mikulka, is following his exhibition and all of which adds.
Domestics the desire to work and the entusiasm.
The marine fundamental still hides a little known world of natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, metal minerals and other mineral materials, but also organs living unknown until now that bring the key to discover the medicine against cancer.
The largest base of the terrace
Cost States have started providing interest in the sub-sea territory.
According to the OSN Convention, they are sufficient for laws on which they have made an agreement in Montego Bay in Japan in 1982.
This is mainly the area of the continental platform which often extends to hundreds of miles from the coast of the State concerned.
This is the view of the Convention that it has an exclusive right to all the resources of the continental platform.
"In a few words for continental platforms, the part of the marine fundamentals and its undersuola that is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The so-called economic area is often extending beyond the territorial sea over 200 miles of Nautic", explains Mikulka.
The request for which the country presents before the Committee for the Determination of the Dimensions of the Continental Platform must be accompanied by a very broad technical and scientific documentation based on many cost surveys and measurements.
It is the result of a long-term preparation.
"Under of our tasks is to search for legal and technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has already treated 5 requests for Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the three last names have succeeded," adds Mikulka.
The recent success of Australia, which has significantly expanded its marine possessions, has registered a global economist.
But also the New Zealand has won us - the surface of the marine base, which has been allocated by the Commission last week, about 1,6 square miles, so more or less than six times greater than the state itself.
All and two countries have invested in the search for millions of dollars.
The benefit, which will be frustrated in the future from the marine fundamentals, as they are promising, will be inestimable.
Other states will also have their requests gradually.
They can do this for ten years since it was ratified "the Montego Bay Convention".
There, where the continental platform starts the sub-ocean area that the Convention has declared the common heritage of humanity."
There was no one who had had been an exclusive position.
The right to extraction in this area is granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
"But the marine foundation is not Klondike," says director Mikulka, "and its single parties are legally designed and their contracted regime."
Czechs in the Pacific
A part of the marine fundamental is also belonging to the Czech Republic today.
It is disabled with other states of the former Soviet Block in the framework of the Joint Interocean metal organization.
This has been purchased in 1991 according to the convention, as well as the investors of few other states, the status of the "pionier investor".
It has the right to extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the extended Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor and little larger than the former Czechoslovacchia.
The fund is frastified, it is a almost submarin replica of Tatry.
"It's possible to extract on the total surface of 75 000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich giant of polymetal agglomerates containing nichel, rame, cobalt and mananese," explains another Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A worker of the Macedonia Rober Sandev division takes a review to show it.
It looks like a small patate or with a fantasy pool, a legendary scheme, as in the legend of Golem’s wave.
German special units were presented to the release of obstacles
The Egyptian government had requested assistance to Germany for the release of shopping – the experts were then arrived.
When the situation became critical, special units were ready, but they were not intervened.
In the circumstances of the liberation of the 11-year-old European barriers, there are always more detailed information.
On the rescue operation as the Ministry of Defence and the Internal Ministry has participated in the German special units.
In addition to army specialists, GSG9 units, aviation police, the Federal Criminal Office, as well as the logistic experts of the technical institution.
As reported by the portion of the ministers on Monday night, German units have not been involved because the sequestriers, given the danger of a force intervention, have released obstacles to flee.
The Egyptian government accepted the aid offered by the Germans to join themselves as directly assistance on place.
"We haven't arrived for luck," says a call from the Ministry of Internal.
Agricultors raised a group of travelers in the south of Egypt: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian accompanies.
After the slaughter in a wilderness area in the south of Egypt, the obstacles have been deported in the border zone between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Ciad.
The identity of raders until the end remains secret as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
The released in frattempo arrived in good conditions in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that free shops are under the protection of the German ambassador.
It has not been explained about the delivery details.
There was no information in Berlin, for when they were returned to Germany.
According to the "Image" newspaper, the 5 holidays and special units should go to flight with an Army Airbus Airbus and arrive on Monday in Germany.
American representation room rejects the saving package.
The first room of the United States congress just failed the saving package of $700 billion for financial markets.
Dow Jones's falling down.
With 206 votes to 227, the representative American house rejected the government's saving package for financial markets.
Despite the calls of President George W. Bush and the first plan of both parties, there was no majority for the programme, with which the chaos of the financial markets would be argued.
In a dramatic action, supporters have tried desperately to convince the critics from the weak package of $7,700 mld.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the treaty, encouraged Members to agree, even though the plan was unpopular.
8. It is difficult to have recognition to avoid something that has not yet arrived..
While the sufragio was in place, the Dow Jones is covered by more than 6% or 600 points.
The reason for investors' concern was that the State saving package could fail.
It was renewed before the end of the vote, after the announcement of the failure, again.
Experts now are expected to have other serious turbulents on international financial markets.
In order to ensure that the programme enters into force, it is necessary to benefit both from the chambers and the senate.
Promotors register digits in increased reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German tourist operators:
According to a study, the fact of travel reservations for the next months compared to the previous year has increased obviously - for the winter stage adjusting more than 30%.
Despite weaknesses of conjunction the desire to travel from Germans standing on a survey remains slow.
In the winter season reservations, travel agencies registered more than 31 % than the same period in the past year, as he informed the German DRV Association for Tourism in Berlin.
According to the GfK Market Research Institute, there is a increased reserve rate for the months of autumn.
The DRV reported that the outcome of travel agencies for October 2007 would be at about 11%.
For these results, GfK's figures, which annually analyzes the preserving data of 1200 German travel agencies and puts a point of statistical projection for the whole market.
In addition, travel reservations would be made until August 2008.
Because of the weak quotation of the dollar, in particular the travels in the United States would be required, reported the DRV.
Here, the increase in reservations would lead to a third.
They would also be able to travel in Germany, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as internal locations in Germany.
Most of all travels, including a high quotation, explained the President of DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of the increased costs for food energy and generation, the costs in this case would be better calculable for customers than for a holiday organized individually."
Consumers could spare money through, among others, discounts for reserves made with strong advance or even offered, explained Laepple.
Even those months would have registered excellent booking digits, so as compared to the year before it would be re-except of the fact - even if, according to another study, the number of Germans who have taken a jour, comparing with the previous year is slow.
My first time at Oktoberfest
Hits of Ballermann, sweet bird from a litro and vip in Dirndln shocked.
A Debut to Wiesn
Susanne Kronzucker and I haven't actually very common.
You're bionda, television moderation and you're inducing a Dirndl made on measure.
I've got the dark hair, I'm student and my clothes are second hand.
One thing, however, is common to us: just 3 minutes at Wiesn, the photos already start against us and shoot photos until they fill the memory of photo machines – very light, and this at my first visit to Wiesn.
That's how friends are doing
Dirndl's two money seems to get his goal.
As a tourist of Wiesn and a real resident in the north of the equator of the white salt, the sense of well-being in the cost/woman up to this day is still in the limits.
And instead, once arrived to Theresienwiese, it's nothing serious.
Almost everyone brings the Dirndl or the skin pants; no one looks disgusted or pregnant - everything perfectly normal.
Just my Dirndl's shoes collects strange eyes at the stand of bananas to chocolate.
A monastery notes me that I would have shooted the snake in wrong way: "A left you are free, at the center of six virgins, to the right hand you're able to see."
Suspectly, I'm a system of the fiocco from the left to the left.
All right," says it and ride.
Others make a smaller sperm of flirt-technical subtle and indossing soft heads of feelings, on which it captures "To drunk to get clothesed!" and strike the nuded thread against a not invited one.
The boy with exhibition inclinations is called Bob, coming from England and also visits the Octtoberfest for the first time.
Find it "gorgeous", with a strascata "oooo".
This tells me, after you've been released from your bird leg from a drinker before.
I'm close to one of these hydrats, which everyone thinks it's a patch.
Bob is also one of the famous "Wildbiesler".
Others don't have the luck to free from alcohol in this way.
On the eighth night they walk in white on the board of the festival, the healthy ones who have to take care of the poor ones.
The nurses are white every time – always 4 a swimming bar covered by the tender.
This works as with the majority of the Wiesn visitors: you're going empty, you're back.
Those who swim under the phone in this alcoholic bar in the blood aren't seen.
"These are those where goarnimmer packn", one of the healthcares slows to me and shoots in the baraonda.
The victim of a police accident identified
A 63-year-old woman who died in the hospital after being invested by a vehicle while walking in Essex was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the incident on Wednesday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city.
You've been brought to the Queen's Hospital, to Romford, but she's dead.
After the incident, a 51-year-old man was arrested by the unexpected guidance accused.
It has been released on warranty.
Turkey is expanding the diplomatic horizons
As far as Turkey tried to enter the European Union, European powers were shocked to deepen in Turkey.
On the eastern part of Bosforo, perhaps 20 steps in Asia, there is one of the most beautiful religions of this imperial ambition.
The train station of Hydarpasha was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-reascimental style.
This is at least what the tourist guides tell you.
The building is horses between the end of the platforms with a tower on each of its edges, looking at the world as some German provincial municipalities.
The stone is spoiled.
The whole building was sweetly decade.
But once in the ticket office, at times, there is no doubt about the size of the company of what was the most western passenger.
The station opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a retreat to the imperial game, wanted to realize his ambitions to dominate the Middle East through this rail that runs in Damasco, Baghdad and further in what is now Saudi Arabia.
But the imperial ambitions of Germany were slaughtered during the first world war.
His rail was attacked by Lawrence d'Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
The relative isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the frozen borders of the cold war, has passed.
The British and dominant forces progressed out of Egypt and pulled the Turkeys and their German allies outside Palestinian and Syria.
And there were bad news for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, an ammunition train disappeared by destroying his developed tea.
Turkey's sources say it was a sabotage.
Since then, it was slowly in disappointment, long overcome by the story.
But today, this rail rail for Anatolia and all the east points, they serve - at least symbolically - to higher diplomatic horizons in Turkey.
The Governing Party of Justice and Development - the ACP - has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its surrounded regions, generated by the frozen borders of the cold war, has been passed.
There is a new commitment policy now.
It is noted that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian Hamas and Fatah factions, with Iraq and Iran and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To assess the parameters of this new external policy, I have been shipped on the vacuum for the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the main experts of the ACP's foreign policy, Mrs Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten hours and half later - after a subbalts course along the tracks that produced the old world chains of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the capital of Turkey - proposed as a new city for a secular state intended to return the shoes to his past ottoman.
But the ACP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an exemplary movement in Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspects in the West, more significantly in Washington.
A taxi takes me in the general area of the ACP, a ultramodern structure of stone and steel - built at hoc - in a development sub-boat, surrounded by commercial centers built and power stakeholders, where business managers are complete - both men and women - meets to make contracts of first morning.
Suat Kinikioglu could be a central-right policy from almost any other political party in Europe.
Complete, cravated, I'm sure I had a Blackberry too.
"The purpose of the external policy party now is to reintegre Turkey with its nearest neighbors.
The cold war was an anonymity," says me.
Turkey has been cut out from its insideland.
Today you must watch the east and the west at the same time.
It wasn't the case of one or another.
They should be both.
"But surely at a certain point, "I ask," Turkey will decide?"
"The Turkey," says, "not wants to go to that choice."
Then he stressed a point that almost all those with which I spoke here have reiterated: the links of not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucaso, and around the Black Sea, are benefits from Europe and the United States as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, the whole Europe can metaforly walk those rail lines to the east through Asia and the Middle East.
Back to the Hydarpasha station, after another night in white, I think of those two German gentlemen, Mr Ritter and Mr Conu, who had seen this building built 100 years ago.
How surprised it would have been to find that the Middle Eastern ambitions of Europe can now be in the hands of Turkey.
And while looking at the terminal for the tragedy that brings me back through the Bosforo, I remember that Turkey has always been called "the sick man of Europe".
Then, at least, it seemed not to be doubtful about what continent should be prepared for progress on this attractive country.
Quickly remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown wrote: as a musical director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrologio, 11 September) had in charge the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the Coro.
As a member of his music scheme for municipality, the next year founded his wonderful young, Proteus.
It was supposed to be under 21/ under the 21 years, but at the time of the Proteus sang his end in 1979, many of us were more than 20 - we simply refused to abandon the core.
The name "Proteus" (the mythology to be mutable) represented the good will of the cor and the ability to face everything that the music presented to do, both madriguels and Messianics, without accompanying or with the whole orchestra.
The musical versastigity produced by such a young crowd was often surprising, always exciting, and it was all because of the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant over the years.
How often it was told by Tod to let music speak for himself.
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
There's all there in music.
So sing it!"
His technique in the use of the battery was absolutely clear and precise, although never detatory or flore.
If it was the musical standard, it was always higher.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If you had to call a horseman director would have been Vernon Handley.
It was very well known for the two decades in which the Gilldford Philharmonic led from 1962 to 1982.
During the past 40 years and more I have concerned more than 100 of its concerts and I can honestly say that I have never been disputed with one of them - and many times inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated the orthodox directors who, in his words, simply "cavalled around the world one or two of the well-known battle horses".
He'll miss so many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett wrote:
Your necrology by William Woodruff (25 September) indicates that "in 1946 he re-educated economic history in Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher in Houblon-Norman... studying at the same time for a width in science, a letter and a PhD".
This results from the note of Woodruff's author in Beyond Nab End, but is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 was a professor of economic history at Nottingham University, completed a PhD tess on the British Gomma Industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and then published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He passed 1950-51 in the United States as a researcher in Houblon-Norman, and the summer 1952 at Illinois, Harvard and New York universities.
In 1953 Notingham was permanently left for the Illinois.
Because Woodruff chose to cover this part of his career, you don't know.
J. Vincent Resino at the University of Filistics
"Recognizing the show of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco and Life", because its photos in white and black, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They have attracted my attention to simply and the strength they transmit, although they treat the protagonists with particular respect.
A show that you're making very feelings.
Resino can catch magic moments."
Second assault for the supervended Honda
In November the Honda will start the marketing of the second generation of the model Jazz.
If the previous model was already with great housing, this new monovolume has a larger internal space.
To all, it will be added to a refined mechanism that increases the guiding comfort and allows to save fuel.
Evolution against revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz presents a very similar line to that of the previous model, changes in this monovolume are numerous.
Among the other, it is the worth to signal an innovative design, a new platform, larger and new mechanical dimensions.
However, before passing to analyze the new model, it is useful to note that this new Jazz arrives six years after the entry into the market of the first generation.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in shorter times than those used by other producers.
Although the model Jazz is less known than in other markets, it remains a unique phenomenon in the fact of sales.
It is exactly Japan's case, where Jazz was the most sales car in 2002 and also in 2008.
In Japan, almost a million Jazz's units were sold since the time of the launch.
The second market was the of the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will allow to increase sales in the segment.
So, if the Japanese company has sold a total of 83.000 units in this model in 2007, estimates will be added for 2009 around 100,000 cars, providing an increase in sale of 17% in the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honduras has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, which corresponds to 6,7% of the total sales in Honduras in Spain.
As regards the new generation, the responsibilities for the Spanish branch are expected to sell around 2,000 Jazz units in a year.
Even the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to reduce the heat of sales in Spain.
In fact, the company's responsibilities are expected to arrive at the end of the year with a total of 22.000 sold units, or 4.000 in less than in 2007, with a low of 16%.
In spite of the increase in the sales, Honduras increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8% in front of 1.6% of the last year.
Furthermore, the Japanese company is expected to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve, the Honda trusts in the arrival of another new model.
This is Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact format - 4,37 meters of length - from which the Japanese society hopes to sell about 200,000 units all year in the world.
For the markets and according to the estimates made by the Japanese producer, 50% of the sales of Insight will be held in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be shared between the Old Continent and Japan.
The Insight's commercial launch is planned for the first months of the year, immediately after the submission in society in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new Jazz is grown in all its parts.
His length reaches the 3.90 meters (5 centimeters in more), the width of 1.69 metres (2 centimeters in more) and the whole 2,50 meters, with a increase in five centimeters.
The height, however, remains invariable to 1.52 meters.
Within the dimensions, the habitable inside will also be expanded.
This benefit results from the introduction of a new platform, and on the other hand by the introduction of the fuel serbatorium in central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz model.
Furthermore, the baggage capacity – with double background - sale to 399 litres, i.e., 19 litres more the capacity of the first generation.
It should be indicated that these are the measures of the engine version 1.4, and that the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Other improvements - more than for external elements, such as poster or the possibility of mounting panoramic glass - refer to a improvement in terms of accessibility to the after-seats.
The doors that allow access to post positions are actually opened with a 80 degrees corner than 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
Furthermore, the engines in this second generation of jazz are new.
At the time of marketing, this small model will be proposed in benzine models 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
The mechanisms include the i-VTEC technology that allows to reduce consumption, produce less carbon biosside emissions, optimise the mechanism and at the same time the motor couple is higher in all its phases.
The 1 2 litre model allows to use a power of 90 cv to 6.000 tours with a maximum of 114 Nm to 4.900 rotates.
The propulsion – which in the previous Jazz reached the 78 horses – uses 5.3 litres of fuel and produces CO2 emissions of about 125 grams.
With regard to the previous propulsion, which used 83 horses in the model of first generation, now are available to 100.
The Jazz 1.4 to 100 horses reach a combination of 5,4 litres of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
The "ape car" to avoid collisions
In the context of the development of incident prevention technologies, Nissan has inspired, this time, the nature, and in particular the fires.
The Japanese society has created a robot which, for example, takes fire flights, knows avoid incidents.
It's the Bio-mimetic Car Robbot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Nissan Motor Co Technology Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Centre for Scientific and Technology of the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director-General of Public Technology and Research and Development of Brand Management, the BR23C is an expansion of the Safety School of four areas produced by Nissan.
This robot is intended to improve the ability to prevent collision in the producer house vehicles.
During the flight, each app creates a personal space in oval form that is very similar to the Nissan security school.
But the most important thing is the eyes of fire, which can see in all directions with a angle above 300 degrees, which allows the insect to fly without interruption in its personal space.
To re-establish this visual functionality, engineers have set out the point that defined a localization laser (Laser Range Finder).
This mechanism identifies the obstacles that are before the BR23C for a ray inside two meters and with a maximum width of 180 degrees, calculates the distance compared to the object and sends a signal to a microprocessor that immediately allows to prevent collision.
"In the moment when a barrier appears, the small robot imitates the movements of a ball and changes immediately direction by turning on the right or higher roads to avoid collision.
The most clear difference with any assisted system is that the evasion handling is completely instinctive.
"If not so, robot would not be able to react with enough speed to avoid obstacles", explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Lab, and engineering head of this project.
Unlike a ball, robot can't move to the top or to the low, and even in diagonal; it can be moved only in two sizes and in the direction where you can turn its roots and not using infinite directions and ways as fires do.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot may avoid collisions.
"This device has only need to prepare the information every few seconds, and acting out of these data.
It does not require intuitive information or logical memory of the previous handlers, so it can work without interruptions and only with a few dozens of memory KB.
This can be surprised, but we're not talking about memory gigabytes, and even mega."
It is the first step towards the development of new technologies for the emergency prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan hopes will be a series in cars within ten years.
The robot uses bacteria to lithium polymers, which are lighter and harder than typology with lithium ions.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of units with a GPS satellite navigation system to bring the driver to destination by avoiding obstacles present in the path.
Trima before requesting a loan
We need to recognize that the Department of the United States Department, in addition to having many capitals to intervene, is not a certain intelligence.
In front of the crisis and to avoid the Americans joining each other in unsolvent banks, they have created a pleasant and institutional game for the network users: "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the "Chrown Hotel" or the problems.
The appearance of this system and, in particular, of its receptionist, serves to induce to think not one, but two or three times before requesting a loan.
And, in particular, where to do it, that is probably the primary goal.
Of course, the information that the game provides is useful, but it is little detailed.
It's more a page for adolescents than a website for the wide public.
What happens if the game is complete?
Well, compare a dream room in the hotel.
It's always something, because buying a better house isn't even talking about...
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the subscription of an agreement with the Missubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will invest nine billion dollars in a quote equal to 21% of participation in the Society, which has arrived after a net downward of its actions in Borsa.
One week after the establishment of a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley shareholders at the individual cost of $25,25, or a sum equal to $3 billion.
The fixed price is lower than 19% of the accountable value of the titles at 31 August.
The MUFG will also invest six billion dollars in the purchase of converted accounts to a conversion price of 31.25.
Morgan Stanley indicated that the overall operation would be carried out on the basis of a average price of $29, or a percentage lower than its current course of 28%.
By 17.00 the title Morgan Stanley was 6.79% to $ 23.07.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate the transition of Morgan Stanley in bank holding company", explained John Mack, director-General of the United States Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which should allow you to distinguish his actions to take them into control of the Federal Reserve.
Their alliance with MUFG also confirms how the current financial crisis covers the largest names of Wall Street to adopt a very more careful attitude than the subject in previously.
The Monday modes also show that in the last days the agreement was amended: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced the sale of 20% of its shares to the Japanese colony for a amount of $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of MUFG, explained: "We thought that our participation share would be only composed of ordinary actions.
But in view of the current situation of global economy and market, we have chosen to minimise the risks and protect us."
Based on the average price, MUFG will obtain Morgan Stanley titles at a price lower than their accountable value of 7%.
The operation would take place with an investment of at least 20% of equity on diluted basis."
The agreement provides that the MUFG could convert half of its preferential titles in regular actions in a year when, during a period of this period, this time was exchanged by more than 50% under the fixed conversion price, or about 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital granted by MUFG would allow it to cover investment opportunities, strengthen its budget and increase its liquidity.
However, a call from the group has refused to provide specifications on the strategic projects of the two new alliances.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should therefore establish a solution coefficient animal One equal to approximately 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan has expressed the "real" budget from the end of August.
In recent weeks, the group has tried hardly, which has seen the value of its actions, while the insurance cost against the risks has immediately been slow.
The cost that he was flowing in the moon, however, remaining at a high level, around 12%.
Last week the Goldman Sachs, one other "persistent" between the large Wall Street investment banks after the Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers crown and Merrill Lynch's detection, announced that they had risked $15 billion in the Berkshire Hathaway Group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa at Quito this Monday.
Funding the Republic on a Socialism right in the XXIst century.
This is the common project of the venezuelan Hugo Chávez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Rafael Correa.
Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, this was the last to vote on the project of a new Constitution.
The mission made since the official results, 64% of the elections voted "yes" to the referendum, on a basis of votes equal to 80%.
According to these results, "no" were 28%, while 7% of the votes were zero and 0.7% white cards.
In order to adopt the draft Constitution, the half of the votes, more than one, should be obtained.
Sunday, two investigations carried out by the election seats and a estimate of an non-governmental organization had announced a shocking victory of the "Yes", situating it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had otherwise revended in the night between Sunday and Monday the victory of his Constitution project.
"The Constitution has glorifiedly trionphated," she assured, congratulating with the magicians in the guayaquil government, 280 km southwest of Quito.
As always, Chávez and Morales welcomed Rafael Correa, as he did his heavenly homolog Michelle Bachelet.
The scrutiny, which has been performed in all calm after the Electoral Observation Mission of the United States (EEA), was based on a text of 444 points to consolidate the 'new socialism' defended by the President.
This project of Constitution confers the power of the state of the economy, preserving the "development planning" of a country that is essentially living in the extraction of oil by large foreign companies and accordingly from their currency.
Concepted by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also granted greater power to the Head of State, which can be elected for two consequent mandates of four years, will have the possibility to disclosure the Assembly.
Correa has already announced the intention of exercising this amendment and reproporting its candidate for a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also states the free health and education services, which the President has started to promote in this country of 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population lives below the poority.
It also prohibits the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of a magorian base as a start point for American drug operations.
The 19 shops free in Ciad
A Egyptian command has launched the slaughter of the 11 tourists and their eight accompanying accompanimenters ten days ago.
I'm in Cairo.
The eight European tourists and their eight Egyptian accompanies held in the wilderness for ten days have been reported Monday, Health and Safety, in the capital of Egypt.
On the morning, they were released in Ciad from a Egyptian command.
Apparently, the obstacles arrived in the military base of Almaza, near the Cairo International Airport, around 15 and 30, on board of a special aircraft.
On the board of a helicotter, they were immediately transferred, without giving any interview to the print, to the hospital of Maadi, a residential Periferia of Cairo, to be subjected to analysis.
"good health" and no rescue was paid "the sequestriers", stated the Egyptian minister of Tourism, Zoheir Garanna.
On September 19, during a safari in 4x4 at the foot of the Oanat Mountain, which was confined with Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of obstacles was packed by a hidden condition on the other side of 35 unknown sequestrators.
The group was formatted by 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and a Romanian – and 8 Egyptians: two guides, four users, a border guard and the director of Aegyptus, the Safari Organizing Agency.
A Egyptian security responsibilities stated that 30 members of the special forces, on board of two elicoters, had launched the shock during the night, just before the sun.
"There have been shooted, half of the sequestrians have been killed, while the others were fled," said the responsible who asked to keep the anonymed.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "Lampo" unit have been sent to Sudan, where they would support German and Italian commands.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Italian Franco Frattini highlighted the importance of the role of Italian secret agents and special forces.
We need to admit that if we obtained this result has been thanks to the professionality and effectiveness of the men of our secret services, the special forces", said, without further details.
He also ignored the payment of a ransom.
On the first day, the Israeli army of patuglia had stated that he had intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on the board of which the sequestrians were found and killed them, including the chadian leader of the raders, and to have taken them two.
According to the army, the sequestrators would be linked to a Darfur's rebellion organization, the movement for the Liberation of the Sudan (SLA_U), a statement immediately dismissed by this latter.
Lettere- The most silence of culture
First page, a debate on the financing of the culture, on which the current election campaign is focused.
So better.
But one part of our cultural life remains in shadow.
Who will come to declare the bad sums granted to the small museums, the archives, the architectic scans, or the national historical places that are hungry?
What policy will have to do to remind the federal government that is overwhelming monuments and heritage buildings?
What in Quebec, as in Canada, do we have no real laws and laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government was three million and half euros for the only rebuilding of the Chinon castle in the Loira Valley?
The Constitution is to say that the protection of heritage is part of the national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, by any political authorities and by any government department, and all this of the common agreement.
In Québec, at the Historical Society Federation of Quebec, at least 40 000 volunteers who, grouping in 211 society for the safeguard of the historical, genealogical heritage, the archives and the heritage goods, maintain, with four money, private archives and archive sites.
They are they who often defend our heritage, which protest with the energy of desperation when real estate businesses and decisional bodies attack our forgotten remains and cities.
When will the right space be reserved for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize a part of the Fortis Bank
The Benelux states help the Belgian and Dutch Fortis Bank through a partial nationalization, which is difficult for Europe for the crisis of the US credit market: the three countries will provide 11,2 billion euros to the financial institutions - insurance also in Hungary.
The Governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands at the end of the week have agreed at the maximum level, also involved the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
In the euro area, the first major crisis is in the context of the difficulties in which the international financial market has been discussed for more than one year is that of the Fortis bank, and the decisions taken in this regard can be a previous.
In the light of the Sunday Decision all night and three States will delay almost half (49%) of the bank share in the country.
The bank will certainly sell almost part of its interests, including before all assets, especially insurance, from the Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week the Fortis' actions had started with a vertical crown, signs of crisis of the institution were then presented in the second half of the week.
The analists, however, agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too large to allow them to fall.
The shares of the bank are almost 12% lost, the lower point of 14 years.
From January the value of the shares is reduced to more than two thirds.
In view of the current share prices, the total capital value of the group is around 14 billion euros, but the bank leaders say that this value is not real.
The company's headquarters imposes the crown of Fortis actions to the incertitudes of the European foreign market due to the acceptance of the US plan from 700 billion dollars.
On Monday, the title was slowly out.
Friday Philip Derrckx was appointed a new delegated bank administrator.
The Financial Institute has also seeked private purchasers, but yet no one has been presented with a valuable offer.
The Belgian government had already assured that investors should not be afraid of losing money.
Among the bank clients did not distribute the panic, the branches have not been assaulted.
In Hungary, the Fortis has autonomy branches and has also acquired leasing deals.
The volp in the polar
In the United States, insurers on life and health, based on the data of human medical purchase, often refuse to establish an insurance contract.
Privacy experts are afraid that the data market becomes uncontrolled.
"In any case, there is a private program that the use of medicinal data for prescription depends on the approval of the person concerned.
This program must be independent, otherwise it's how to fix the pollage to the volpe" - writes Washington Post quoting Richard Dick author of the program to follow the medicine requirements.
Insurance companies subordinate the insurance rate and the expenditure in the case of errors to the condition of the customers' health and if they are too high, the risks do not imply insurance.
It was time that the customer had to submit to a medical visit, and the contract was only implemented after the examination.
10 years ago Dick has invented a much more economic procedure: based on the customer's identity code, you can easily have information from the medicines on which medicine has been purchased in the last year and half, and this program requires which diseases suffering and what health conditions is found.
For example, if you regularly purchase large quantity of colesterol reductions, it means that the level of grass in blood is in intangiblely high and is classified in the higher risk category.
There are various versions of the program, some also determine the risk multiplicator, the assurancer therefore remains not much, even though small difficulties are presented.
Among the contrary, some medicines are useful for more purposes, for example, some compositions are necessary against emergency or heat vamps, but are also effective against depression.
This latter, from the insurance point - commercially, as a risk increase factor, the first two no.
For the request and preparation of data, companies were formed by part and these, before obtaining the necessary information from the medicines, request the patient's approval.
Now the authorities are able to do so even if they have not affected many nerves.
Some recently mentioned are also preparing the result of laboratory reviews and connecting them to medical consumption data to provide a more specific image of the health state of patients.
There is always more data access and parallelly the use control will be more difficult.
There is a law on privacy, but its validity extends only to health services and insurance.
From the Congress there is a legislative proposal which gives control power to companies specialized in data service.
Richard Dick admits that it is not enough: this is why it has developed a program that linked the data in other data with the approval expressed by the person concerned.
Another question is that the person concerned cannot denied the approval because otherwise the insurers do not imply the contract.
So, at the end, the gallines are afforded to the clemance of the volp.
Global Marshall Menu
European Union and India double the trade
Since the European Union and India are partners who are in particular mutual trade, also the agenda of the nine meeting on the top has been dominated by this topic, in addition to all the other global problems.
Today, there will be a French-Indonesian top which will first be addressed to the Atomic Energy Cooperation.
The European Union recognizes the fact that India is being a large democratic power that should be given more in international affairs, but Member States have not yet been able to decide whether to support or not the new Delhi as a permanent member in the United Nations Security Council.
So it did not insist on this issue in the nineth organized summit in Marsella yesterday.
The French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as President of the Union, José Manuel Barroso President of the Commission and Javier Solana high representative for the Foreigns, received the first Indian Minister Manmohan Singh, with which the agreement to double in 5 years, which is to increase up to 100 billion euros, the trade.
Whereas the exchange of goods was out of 25 to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not too ambitious.
The 26 bilateral civil flight agreements have been united from the legal view, so the air traffic can also take the way in the future.
India would like to sign free trade agreement with the Union until the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed the agreement.
The objective is to balance because while the EU is the first commercial partner of India, New Delhi is only the nine place between the EU partners.
The top has devoted attention to global facts.
At the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and the terrorism, this last condemned both parties in all its forms and urged the convocation of a United Nations conference.
They emphasized the conclusion of the Doha Round commercial, although both parties had a role in the failure of this.
The EU has confirmed to continue in the energy and climate programme, which would like to reduce at least 20% by 2020.
In addition, India is agreed with this, as well as with the fact that it would have to establish a comprehensive agreement on the programmed climate conference for the next year and reduce 50% of the steel gas production by 2050.
They also want to raise the increase in the prices of food products and have supported the convocation of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The first Indian minister today will go to the French capital where a bilateral meeting is ready to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is expected that the French reactors receive a commodity of the value of EUR 20 billion to build Indian nuclear reactors.
According to the information from our printing Agency, the agreement would take 15 years.
Francoforte over three hundred Italian editors
There are Italian editors at the International Fire of the Francoforte Book.

We found Steve Fossett's aircraft the billions lost a year ago
The airline of Steve Fossett was found, the milliardary lost on September 3, 2007 while flying on the Nevada wilderness.
The routines were returned to a highlight of 3000 meters of height, in the Sierra Nevada of Mamoth Lakes area, to the border between California and Nevada.
But there were no humans inside the velvel.
The Sheriff of Madera Council, John Anderson, fled the doubts that remained: "The airline has been located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmed that this is exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day when he was gone," said in a print conference.
The shrine has therefore indicated that there were no human returns in the aircraft, nor in the surrounding area.
The milliardary, 63wen, was given for death in February.
The American Transport Office (Ntsb) has known that some hours after the public's advisory, a survey team was sent, which then identified the device: it is just Bellanca 8kcab, dispersed from 3 September 2007, when Fossett tried from Gerington to Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Last night, always in California, not far away from the Nevada border, some personal effects of Fossett had been returned from a couple near their residence in Mamoth Lakes.
This is two documents named Fossett, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of the Illinois, money in container and a felpa.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after his lost.
The milliardary was conquired a place in the history thanks to a long series of primates.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete the world's round on a aerostatic ball: two weeks of flight in solitary.
Three years later, he did the world's turn in an aircraft and without shock.
Among his many records, even the flight of 15,445 meters high, above the Ande, but with a copilote.
Glk, the advertising you don't wait
A Suv outside the schemes with an original and well defined by decisive line, wide surface and net angles.
This is, in synthesis, the last born between the "compacts" of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a sale of new innovation in this sector.
It will also be unexpected and unconventional the communication that will comply with the Suv Glk launch, available at the Mercedes-Benz showroom on 17 October.
Thus, the advertising battle that will comply with the debt of the new shipment will start an unfavourable communication mode, also through a 3D advenisetic campaign, which is used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A project of maxi-afmissions, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the centralist through the Milan shopping, Corso How, up to November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will start with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special eye distributed in Corso How can you see the new Suv in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, watching the image will have the impression that the car is out of the manifestation.
Next, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 new Glk will be illuminated in different times in all its details, then back into one image.
Nevertheless, Mercedes with this advertising is trying to introduce something again in the stereotyped field of car communication.
Will this form be done to study the interest of the future purchasers?
Here are the Italian hooligans
From Triveneto, they're risking the Dapo.
But who are those 150-200 boys and girls whose entire Italy is now angry? They are part of the "Other Italian" group that follows the Blue National for years, and who, for the truth, had never created excessive problems.
Never if he was shocked with adverse torments.
The extraction of the group is right.
Promotors come from the Trivenet.
From Verona, Patva, Trieste and Udine.
To these in Sofia, there have been groups (no ones, actually) from the campaign and the Puglia.
There are three color bandiers where they composed the cities of the militarys: Sabbath night have been cut off to be identified.
They are inspired to the English tifoseria.
In Bulgaria, they found a real nazis, the Levski.
The Figc had prepared 144 Italian tickets for the game: all nominatives, therefore easily controlable.
And the Viminle had controlled them all: among the parties for Sophia there was no one with a current Dapo, no one who had been injected by visiting a stage.
At four blue tifos, which had previously been crimes from stadium, the ticket was rejected and prevented the transfer.
Viminale now expects to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police then take steps: in this case, it is possible to give the Dapo at least five years to those who have been arrested or who has been identified in disorders.
An international dupo that prevents not only Italian stages but also throughout Europe.
Our hooligans, instead, will not put foot in a stage.
Successfully.
But there is now the fear-emulation: that's what little more than 100, if they add others.
"We have to speed this fire immediately and not legitimate those in this way," supports the Viminale.
Thus, "this are well opened, especially in view of the Nation's game of mercury in Lecce".
In Puglia, there is a small nucleus of the Ultra Italian supporters.
Tomorrow the Observatory will meet the Casms, which can also be counted on a section of the Aasis, namely of the secret services, which is just about the problems of the stadium.
"The Duce-Duce colors and the brace sweet during the snake of Mameli? In Bulgaria isn't done...".
This is the thought (expressed in a really little way) of Domenico Mazzilli, a few weeks director of the Viminal Observatory (he took the place that was first from Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Before Mazzilli was the Trieste where there was a nuclear of supporters from the Ultra Italian group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it has not been injured to the Dutch but certainly the behaviour of those 150-200 thrs.
"I don't do sociologue - add No1 of the Observatory - the crimes must be assigned in the country where the fact is happening.
Until now, this group remained in line, we'll see what happened and we'll be worth for the future.
But we also talk about fishes at Mameli: even those are not wrong, but if you allow me, I'm not educational...".
