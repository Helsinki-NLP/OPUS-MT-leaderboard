In the end of the exchange, Prague's boundaries in the negative
After the slaughter of Monday morning, Prague's bourse rectified his losses.
Transactions with the ΒEZ actions achieved almost half of the normal daily exchanges.
Mardi, since the beginning of the trade, the beach of Prague renewed with its slow down, when she lost almost six percent.
This time, the slow is due to the fall in the Wall Street.
The response of the market to the result of the vote of the United States representatives, which refuses to adopt the American financial sector stabilising plan, is such a view to us.
Success of actions in Asia
Asian bourses lived a dramatic fall, even though the indexes have succeeded during the day to remove a part of losses.
The Hong Kong Bus index lost 4 per cent during the exchanges, but later, he lost a part of losses and reduced about 2,5 per cent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises' Index after the movement of Chinese Hong Kong's bourne shares lost 3,8 per cent, markets were closed in Shanghai.
Sydney's bourse actions lost more than five per cent, but finally losses were able to reduce 4.3 per cent.
According to its index, Taiwan Bourse lost 3,6 per cent.
"The hesitation on the Safety Action in the United States will influence the financial markets of the whole world," observes Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Office.
Although Hong Kong was part of China, he set up its monetary policy itself, that is, independence from the Chinese Central Bank.
The interest rates are at Hong Kong the same level as in the United States.
According to the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, the US legislators should quickly re-ended the negotiations and adopt the proposal for support of the financial system.
Otherwise, there would be a risk that other countries suffer the impacts.
The blood bathing of the United States actions
Monday, the United States Representatives Chamber rejected the draft support of the financial system, which had to be allocated up to $700 billion ($12 billion).
The legislators thus denied the call to support the project of President George Bush.
According to Bush, the project should solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help to stabilise the entire economy.
American actions live, Monday, a blood bath and the main indexes of actions are the largest loss of these last 20 years.
The Dow Jones index lost nearly seven percent, condemned a fall of such an envergure for the last time in 1987.
The index was already lost during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free.
Cede Congress: the United States government can inject $700 billion in banks
The United States Congress and the Government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of the financial aid agreement to the United States financial system.
It will be submitted to the vote at the beginning of the next week.
American legislators made a decisive turnover in the talks on the adoption of a Safety Plan in the form of a financial aid of $700 billion ($12 billion), granted to the US Financial System.
Success is not so certain.
Indeed, before publishing the final version of the law and submitting it to the vote, the Congressmans must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The financial support plan will be reviewed on Monday at the Chamber of Representatives.
He said to the Reuters Barney Frank Agency, President of the Bank and Financial Regulatory Committee of the Chamber.
According to sources, the early Wednesday plan should be subjected to the vote to the Senate.
According to economists, the advertising that the savings plan will be adopted should be the first major psychological factor to restore financial markets.
However, given the complexity of mechanisms through which market aid can be effective, it will follow a "dislusion".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made a great progress.
We have resolved our divergent views on the form that should have the market stabilisation package," trusts the Bloomberg Democratic Agent Nancy Pelosi.
According to it, the final vote could be carried out since Sunday.
In the Sunday night, representatives of the legislators met the American Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give a final form to the government.
This should be saved, at financial companies, of inventive real estate assets leading to financial undertakings in considerable losses and threatening the stability of the system in its entirety.
"We are on the point that we agree on a plan that will work and must also be effective on the market.
We still need to continue this market reconstruction plan, but I think we are there", says Paulson.
A sign for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has considerable impacts on the markets of action.
According to the Democratic Senator, Harry Reid did not escape the legislators so that the Congress reaches a final agreement since Sunday.
They like to calm the investors before the start of Asian financial markets, which are located in the first temporary area, where the decision of the Congress could affect Monday Trade.
However, for this moment, it is not possible to clarify with certainty when the two United States Congress Chambers will be voted, nor if negotiations may not be blocked by such a problem at last.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted during the coming days.
However, the Law will still be informed of changes.
The total amount for the system shall be divided into two parties.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wanted, must be available as soon as possible.
But if the Congress has the impression that the programme does not fill its function, he has the possibility to block the allocation of the remaining amount, in two steps: first 100 billion additional dollars, then, to end, $350 billion.
Mr. Bush welcomes progress in negotiations
Although the Chairman could put the decision into force, the Congress has the opportunity to put it in minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which consists of obtaining finances for the purchase of bad real estate, including the value of the fall, was maintained by hundreds of thousands of Americans.
All the work is done.
The Chamber of Representatives should be able to proceed on Sunday at the vote of the Law, and the Senate Monday," stated Senator Judd Gregg.
The American President George Bush itself welcomes the progress in negotiations.
Tony Fratto said that Mr. Bush was satisfied with the progress made in Saturday and appreciated "the bipartite effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Limitation of sweet parachutes
The Chairman of the banking committee of Senator Christopher Dodd said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of the contributions against losses, the decrease agreement, the delay of the time axis.
The new law also provides for limited the donated parachutes for corporate directors who participate in the programme and establishes a committee that will ensure the monitoring of the funds.
This should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on the issue and made significant progress to a agreement that will be going and will be effective for the market and for all the Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also provides assistance for real estate owners, which have problems to pay.
The Government should negotiate new contracts in the case of hypothetics that it will save, while reducing the month of debitors and enable them to keep their houses.
Marek: A psychological assistance
According to the economic leader of Patria Finance David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its achievement will be very difficult.
"It is due to the fact that the mechanism and the price of the purchase of assets to problems are ignored.
This will be determined to spend on the share of losses between the financial sector and the government", Marek said this week to the iHNed.cz server.
If the plan will be adopted now, or in the beginning of the next week, it is not so important as it is, according to Marek.
"There is much more important than the Congressmans agree, since this week, that they support this plan and that they will convey it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, predicting the adoption of the plan, is most important at this time," said Marek.
An extreme struggle: MP3 readers against mobiles.
You will advise how to choose
While almost all mobiles can read MP3 files, no MP3 reader can be phoned.
It seems to be clear that it's better to buy just a phone.
It prevents that there are sufficient reasons for an independent reader.
The choice depends fully on the mode of use and requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house a cheap grammophone from high range to put the new album of Maxim Turbulenc.
On the one hand, such musical products do not go on wine disk, and, from quality view, there is no objective reason, so that this happens.
But if there are in your edges of the entailed line disks with rock art, jazz or blues, you're dreaming at least likely of such a grammophone.
It's also music during movements, namely the composed music, to say it simplifiedly - music in MP3.
There are also categories based on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to cost eight thousand corones for a reader, as a fan of the Pink Floyd would have been hard to support listeners buyed for twenty-four corners on the market.
These are two extreme, among which there are enough places for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The life of batteries is also decisive
Some high-game music readers are capable of much more than a simple music read, but it's here unknown functions, of course, most of the mobiles.
No current device is just the phone.
Besides the first functions, telephone calls and SMS's mail, it is able to read music and films, to register these lasts, it has a variable quality photo device and, for example, can, even to serve navigation.
And if we take into account the Smartphones and the Communicators, you'll have a little computer in your pocket.
Since no fridge can grip from the flesh and no TV will take photos, we are almost looking at a miracle.
However, the universal character of the mobile is not unconvine.
More the number of functions you use is larger, more the interval between two reloads will be reduced.
And music reading is one of the most important energy gains.
It is rare that mobiles that can read music for 10 to 12 hours, in most cases, this number is quite lower.
In this regard, music readers (especially the most rudimentary) are clearly more performing.
In the case of good market mobiles, consider that they will not play music only for a few hours.
If, in addition, you can call time in time, buy, to be over, a second reload for the work - this is valid even for cherry devices.
The problem will not be posed for MP3 readers, which are capable, after reloading, of a continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including less performing.
Another problem occurs during the recording of music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, a limited part of the devices has an universal USB connection, so that nobody can't be connected directly to the computer without a special software.
Of course, you can register music directly on the memory map, but few card readers can take it without reducing, given the small sizes of the memory cards used in mobile cards.
With regard to readers, you have no need, except (iPod), of no software.
It is enough to fill, through USB connection, the music device from the computer.
Most mobiles and readers will create a media library classified according to the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, style, or then according to the user's judgment.
Some devices show only an index with a tree structure in the way Windows Explorator, others are capable of two (irver, Samsung, Sony, Cown, intelligent phones with operational system).
Players are easier to handle, mobiles have more knowledge
In the choice of a concrete device, you are particularly interested in the lifetime of the accumulator, the memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the facilitation of the command.
If music is mostly for you, and if in the day you will hear that for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, it's enough for you any mobile reading the MP3s.
Practically, all the mobiles are available today.
You are not even obliged to take too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or reader is able to read.
Everyone arrives to read MP3 and the large majority of the music that will reach until you just have this format.
It is part of the most widespread formats, and in addition to it, the large majority of the devices is also read of the WMA format music.
The AAC (format used by the strong Apple and its iPods) is less common than it is.
High gamma mobiles also allow online music buying.
It is enough to visit the web pages of the operator (or the other provider) from the portable phone and buy the song or album in question.
This service should be a convinced reason to provide a musical mobile.
The offering of operators is unfortunately misunderstanding and, in most cases, it is limited to rapid tube radio.
The prices aren't lower.
However, it is generally considered that this way to buy music (which is by GSM, the Internet, or by the free Internet) will dominate the musical industry in the future.
Most people always carry their mobile on themselves.
Each time you want to listen to something, you just have to get out of your pocket mobile, while you forgot your MP3 player home.
But it is also important if you have always on you listeners or a free handle with connection.
If not, you can use the integrated pregnants, which have almost all mobiles, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of musical mobiles is their price.
The less cost costs normally less than 3000.
For a price of three thousand crowns, you may have a very acceptable walker.
However, in most cases, you will be limited by the absence of output for ordinary listeners.
The price of the best phones and the best tools, which have also been income for ordinary listeners, is not exceeding 15 000.
The readers, on the contrary, have the advantage of having a easy command.
Indeed, any one is coming to ensure the command of the most rudimentary readers - which does not match strongly to the less chers (cf. our choice).
A minimum functions; and the similarity of the command with that of a cassette post, which is used in the past, or a grammophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a mobile internet branched by hasard, monitoring a huge data transmission facture.
What device to choose
Even the least cheerful mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) have a load for exchangeable memory cards (M2 type, microSD and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a map, you will not exceed two thousand corners.
But take care of it.
Base models are in principle only cards with a maximum of 2 GB capacity.
Only the cherish ones get out of it with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile and want to buy a good MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, a Emgeton, or a iriver.
On the basis of the capacity (max. 2 GB), you must not cost more than 1 100 corners.
If you are part of the more demanding auditors, choose specialized walkman mobiles (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are available with independent command keys for MP3, and this is also the exit of the command is approaching to that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles in the walkman series have the same user menu as MP3 readers separately sold, is the one who went far in this area.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (for 16 GB) and a life period of the accumulator (normally 15 hours, up to 35 hours) is assured by a MP3 reader produced by one of the higher marks mentioned.
A Virtual Operator will win Czech this year itself.
Maybe
The mobile market in Czech is relatively advanced, our operators proposing practically the same services as their Western partners.
In spite of this, it misses something -- a virtual operator, which would force classic operators to cut the prices.
He mayn't miss for a long time.
We have already spoken on Mobil.cz the fact that the Czech operators are most cherish in Europe.
The Czech Office of Telecommunications (Cheque Telecommunications), which stated that the price of a SMS was higher at us than in the rest of the Union, confirmed it otherwise.
Thus, following the last steps of the European Commission in the field of the rolling costs regulating, a paradoxal situation is risked to occur - the SMS sent from the foreign will be for some customers of the Czechic mobile operators less nice than the country.
How is it possible that the prices in Czech as high as compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks a competition that would really want to enter into the fight.
This may appear to be paradoxal, since we have even three mobile networks and a penetration that exceeds over 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to claim that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this way, Pavel Dvośák, President of the Czech Bureau's Telecommunications Council (TU), who stated several times that there was no place for another operator in Czech Republic, makes chorus with the operators.
It is probably true that a classic operator with its own network has seemed to have much more chance (and now it would only find difficult frequencies).
However, there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It is just the entry of virtual operators on the mobile market that had a significant decrease of prices, which should then react classical operators.
However, even the entry of the holidays such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, the voice like those today understood in Britain.
But it was apparent that he remained from the place for such operators and that they could have a real success.
We are not obliged to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you about the launching of the Virtual Mobilking operator in Poland.
In six months, the operator has succeeded to win more than 100 000 customers and to become the fifth country operator.
Add that behind the Mobilking, there is the Penta Financial Group, which has among others the U:phone in Czech.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on a much more concrete target group.
In order to be effective, they actually need much less customers than a classic operator.
They are in fact exempted from the construction, exploitation and maintenance costs of the mobile network, relatively high.
This is as well as in the world, virtual operators are profiled as low-cost operators - they propose calls and good market SMS, which is often contrary to a limited service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers SMS at least two times less pretty than his competitors in Great Britain.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, misleading on an inhabited target group can also be a good part of advertising.
Indeed, this operator is a specific way for men.
"Real men choose Mobilking - a operator that pleases them and whom they can trust," said David Seibert, the ECO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept might be able to walk with us too.
Miroslav śepickī, the Vodafon's portal, doubtless: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, which is based on most virtual operators.
More than it is relatively saturated from the view of services offering."
In Czech no chance, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost sure that if there is a virtual operator in Czech, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this project to be successful, but negotiations are not very promoting in Czech.
Mobilking's launch will be placed in other countries of our area," said in a telephone rental for Mobil.cz Jana Studničkova, the port of the Penta Financial Group.
Indirectly it confirmed that the operators in Czech were not in any case favourable to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything they can so that a potential competitive could not appear.
The GTS Newsra Group, who would so wish to launch a new step to become a real telephoneika competitor in the field of business customers, does not hide its intention to start a virtual mobile operator for a long time.
"We are much to be able to propose our customers not only fixed telecommunication services but also mobile.
And soon it's the best.
We have already undertaken negotiations on this possibility several times with all the Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have made progress in the negotiations," said the talking port of the Pavel Kadl Group.
So the future may be promised.
According to non-official information, we may be able to welcome the first virtual operator from the end of the year.
But for now, his creation is composed of total silence.
"In this moment, we do not consider that there is place on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is in comparison with other very specific markets.
At the moment, there was no subject to a complex and serious project in this field not contacted us," stated Vlastimil Sšeу from the Press Division of Telephoneika O2 in its statement for Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
The T-Mobile Martina Kemrova's Chamber states in a rare agreement with the Declaration of O2: "We have not registered for the moment of viable and bilaterally profitable project, which could serve as a basis."
And it adds: " It is practically excluded that a virtual operator appears in the T-Mobile network from here on the end of the year.
To operate in a so-called time laps, we should have a concrete agreement since now."
Vodafone instead directs his attention on the completion of applications to obtain its own 3G license.
Miroslav śepickī said in this regard: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, especially in the field of shared costs and infrastructure.
That's what we believe is the most important contributions from the customer view.
The main strategy of Vodafone in this area is the discovery of a partner to establish a common network for a fast mobile web."
Responsable authorities: in phase with operators
The starting of mobile operators is easily comprehensive, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to a decline of prices and therefore at a low rate of their benefits.
What, therefore, is it good to facilitate the event of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, the operators know that it is like shoes in fire. Chicane composing the creation of the U:phone also witnesses.
The most apparent pressure on the U:fon was that of the T-Mobile company.
Shows the information available to the public from the web pages of tv.
But today, the U:fund is ready to serve as a argument to not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrova noted this issue: "The competition on the mobile market has been recently expanded by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
In view of the character of the mobile market in RT, it is obvious that the entry of an additional player is presenting it, and especially its services, to high requirements."
But given the attitude of the mobile operators here, the incertitude of the Czech regulatory agencies seems unreasonable.
However, it is not only the attitude of the UCTU, which, in contrast with Great Britain and other developed countries, has unfortunately not been the power of entering the economic competition in Czech.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
However, this last adopted its typical position, faced with this problem.
"The entry of a virtual operator on the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the betreffende virtual operator on the location of the necessary infrastructure.
No agreement of this type has been concluded at the time, since the offer of potential interests had not provided sufficient interest for classic operators," explained in response to our question by Christián Chalupa from the Division of Foreign Relations of the UOHS.
A statement made so would not be surprised by representatives of the operators.
But from an office, which must represent consumer interests and, among others, take care, so that no one benefits from its market position, such a statement is more than exchanging.
Moreover, Christián Chalupa adds: "To the foreign, where virtual operators are normally present, they can be observed that their income on the market has contributed to a decrease in the prices of mobile telephone services."
However, pressure in the sense of a honest market operation and a decrease of prices does not seem to be part of the interests of the UOHS.
What is effectively shocking, is the almost touching agreement of the three mobile operators, which declares their reactions.
The question, if it is really a accident, is natural.
Similarly, a price of strictly identical essence to all service stations is overly due to the scourge and hard combating of competition.
"The office has therefore not mentioned signs of an anti-competitive behavior in this regard, he has not reasoned to act in any way or in another.
No operators have dominant position, therefore nor has an increased responsibility of their market behavior.
The necessary tools for the opening of the mobile market for virtual operators probably miss even the telecommunication regulator," stated in Chaloupa’s statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many points of discussion.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the UCU, according to which telecommunications are, from the view of economic competition, one market.
No Czech operators have a dominant position on such a market.
However, some law experts propose another vision of things: to ensure that a virtual operator can be created, it is necessary to obtain each time the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator has enough logically the monopole on its network.
This is how it is necessary to play a dominant role in a certain segment of his activities.
However, even without granting this argument, it should be at least worried about the UOHS that three mobile operators are visiblely in a similar manner.
However, the complaints of many interested persons (including the GTS Novera company already mentioned) show that they face, in negotiations with all operators, similar negotiations.
Returns the responsibility of the UCTU is a quite common tour in communications, through which the UOHS lay the hands of the case.
We have already met this type of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, there was no success to renew the Telecommunications Act, adopted recently, to extend the powers of the TSI in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many specialists had promised to improve the situation.
This is why UOHS representatives have to know well, but their interests seem to be another part.
When no one looks, it can walk
This says, the function of a kind of virtual pseudo operators, several in the Czech mobile networks, remains unexpected.
These are companies who publish their own mobile telephone services price list, but these are only public.
In most cases, it is a question of solid occupation of multi-level marketing.
Specific mobile services are proposed, for example, by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many other.
The price lists of these firms are generally only elected.
The magic tour consists of the fact that the company made before the operator is a classic business customer, which controls a large number of SIM cards.
As an important customer, it obtains special price offers (and other).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czechic mobile operators prohibit such a return.
"If it would happen to what you say, it could be a crime of the contractual conditions we would examine and which could result in an end of cooperation with the society concerned," answered our question on this issue, Martina Kemrova.
However, it is little likely that such activities do not be achieved until mobile operators are responsible.
Obviously, in the case of the three enterprises mentioned, it may be thousands of customers.
However, a number of operators do not oppose such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these firms make their benefits unnecessary and, at the same time, by opposition to real virtual operators, they do not threaten them in no way with their own official marketing.
Miroslav śepickī indicates the possibilities: "The law allows such spheres, however, services of these companies are only used by a percentage of disadvantaged customers.
In addition, these are bound to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they can't be fully available in the form of normal clients of mobile operators."
But that's precisely that should appear strange to the UCU.
Furthermore, there is another question to the UOHS.
If mobile operators close the eyes on such procedure, why do they block the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that UNOHS has relatively large powers to declare such activities, and if it does not want to satisfy the explanations of operators, which claims to have no idea that this would happen, their contracting conditions would be prohibited.
When we are no longer the most precious country
As we have already mentioned several times, the income of virtual operators on the mobile market has produced a significant decline in the service price.
However, almost in almost all countries where virtual operators appeared, classic operators were soon efforts to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by these lasts were practically the same - a small market, or too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, it is precisely at this level that, in developing countries, regulators, who defended not the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
While formal measures as well as informal pressure, they ended by obtaining the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators address this issue in the form of a warm land poom which is slowly released by transmitting it to a target nearby.
Following the experiences we have, we can't be disappointed of the impression that confusion in their skills is in these cases more than profitable.
But don't smell the lack after the coggle.
If collision information is true, and a virtual operator will soon appear to us, the Czech Mobile Market may be moved.
If one of the operators accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the UOHS would only be difficult to remain inconsistent with the rejection (discrimination) of other interests.
And we may stop calling more money than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymne has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national symn.
Sunday, at the Czech Nationality Day, Prime Minister Mirec Topolánek presents only the new records of the National Kde domomæj (Who is my patriarch?).
The symne was reregistered again by the national theatre under the direction of Jiśí Bślohlavek.
We have four versions - with a single male or female song, a interpretation with cold and instrumental version.
The song is assured by Kateśina Knśinkova and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the hymne arrangements.
You can listen to the four new versions on iHNeed.cz server.
Bślohlavek considers the Czech National song as one of the most beautiful hymnes.
As he had previously granted to the Rozhlas (the Czech public radio), he chose for the interpretation of the only versions of the songers with youth and representative voices that are marked and appreciated.
"And after the beginning, I tried to take care of the two songers, as well as the smell, have a good word, so that the words are well understanded, that they are sing simultaneously," he said.
The Czech national symn will celebrate the next year its 175th anniversary.
The Kde domovj song reserved for the first time in 1834 on the plates of Stavovské divadlo (the theâtre of the states) in Fidlovačka (Kermesse des saveiters), the original cheque of Josef Kajetán Tyl, composed of the music of František Škroup.
It became popular, and people were spontaneously appropriate.
After the creation of the Czechoslavakia in 1918, the first couple naturally became an integral part of the national symn.
It remains one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How to sound the "new" hymne
Common transports (MHD) will introduce, on Monday, the pocket into their bike system
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be registered in the history of Praśský Dopravní podnik (Pragosia Transport Agency) as the date to which the first passengers will take into the metro, trams and bus, which, instead of having a paper ticket, will have an electronic cut in their pocket.
At this time, this last is available for some hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard pool card.
The passengers may buy a 30-day or 90-day breakfast (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and then registered on their card in the information points and offices of Dopravni podnik (the Transport Agency), located in the Metro Muzeum, Mśstek, Nádragí Holešovice, Andśl, Roztyly, Letśany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
From last time, there is also the possibility to buy internet cuts on the Dopravni podnik websites: www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred people benefited from the service during the morning.
Those who will start to use the online store can definitely forget the skills in the metro stations, where they had to still ask for inpatibility in long chains to obtain paper tickets.
Indeed, they will purchase their cup via Internet and register it on their Opencard card in one of the thirty Mşestská knihovna (munitional libraries).
"In these contact points, passengers have a guide with a formed staff, which will help the interests with the purchase by the internet, and will also register the copy they have purchased on their card," said Martin Opatrný.
Besides libraries, you will also be able to register electronic cuts on the Opencard in automatic distributors installed in the clothing of several metro stations.
What does these distributors compare?
They are red, remembering the machines to compose tickets and passengers may have already noticed them in the Roztyly Metro stations, Budōjovická, I.P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vllavská.
" Today, the city in five, but from here the end of the year, it should have fourty," adds Opatrný.
An automate will control the cut in place of the driver
Automates that will work from tomorrow are easy to use.
It is enough to introduce the Opencard puce card and the previously purchased copy will register himself on the card.
Electronic cuts are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in the outside of the city.
In the peri-urban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which are essentially used by the people of the Central Body to access capital.
"In the trains integrated in Prağská Integrovaná doprava (integrated transports of Prague), the controllers are equipped with card readers, using which they establish the temporary and temporary validity of the cups;" explained the control of the Philip Drapal tickets of the Ropid organization, which produces the time of transport in the Pragoal Common.
Periurban buses are equipped with integrated card players in the chair box.
When the packaging is therefore necessary, it is not only necessary to show the swimming card, but must also place the Opencard on the side of the box.
This is also the validity of the stored cuts.
"In case the passenger would need to check the validity of the stored cuts, there is nothing more simple than requesting such information to the driver", complemented Drapal.
The passengers that do not take peri-urban bus and will not remember the date when their validity is expired, the automatic distributors can return to the initially used distributors to store the card cuts.
Here, on the screen of the device, the information on the validity of their document will be shown.
Sudans requested a referendum to the United States
The Sudan Germans asked in 1945 to be integrated in the United States.
This describes a letter posted in the collections of Jihočeská vśdecká knihovna (The Scientific Library of the Southern Bohem).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we would like to live at least under the U.S. patronat.
In 1945, some Sudan Allmand groups claimed to the President of the United States with such a desire.
This is among other letters preserved in a private archive, which is currently placed in the collections of Jihočeská vśdecka knihovna.
Germans from Krumlov pray to the President of the United States in the letter that it does not allow "Schumavská śupa" (the region of forests south of the Bohem) - as annexed by Hitler in accordance with the Munich Agreement - should be returned to Checoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation and want to be really sure that the words proclaim that the American troops come in the German territory are not oppressors and enemy, but freezers," is written in the letter signed "Persones, whose type of shumava is in heart".
Since the rationalization to Czechoslovakia is intended to be promised - by knowing the Czech national character - only brutality, incomprehensive attitude, incomprehension, oppression and service, the authors of the letter request the American President to take the protection of Zhumava forever.
"We can't believe that you would grant this territory to a foreign State to us, which oppresses and destroys minorities and has nothing contributed to the victory of the Alliances without taking into account the opinion of the fourth million people," is written in the letter.
The reason for which the authors can't sign the letter is the fear of the desire of vengeance of "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States deputed the view of the Germans of Šumava, it would only be to organize a referendum in the region to establish whether its people would like to be part of the United States, or to live under the U.S. Patrone.
Although the text contained in the letter may, taking into account the current knowledge of the history of the next war, appear some naïf, according to some survivors, well illustrate the expectations of the Sudan Germans of the time.
While the Czech Germans should at least interfere that the issue of their expulsion of the Republic would be, very few of them had given such a possibility.
Some expected that the United States and the Great Britain would get a certain type of autonomy for Sudans.
Others thought they would just stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in Budōjovice, confirms it.
During the war, it was, as Almand of śeské Budśjovice, joined in the sea in the Balts countries.
At the end of the war, he was captured by the Englishs and placed in the Holstein capture camp, tens of Czech Almands came to consult him so that he could learn them from Czech.
"They believed that once they returned home, the Czech would benefit them," said Chalupa.
None of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before war did not estimate, according to him, that after the Beneš Decrees he would be expulsed from the Republic.
You don't think, you pay!
An emotive campaign will attack drivers
Action on road security is the most costful in the Czech history.
A way to characterize the emotive media campaign that is to launch, mercredi, the Ministry of Transport.
The office of the Minister Alleš śebíček believes that it will discourage the drivers of a dangerous conduct on the flight.
This campaign, which costs 150 million, will appear at television, radio, cinema, Internet, but also on shops.
It should discourage the drivers of fast and alcohol at flight.
But also remembering them to take the ceinture before starting.
She wants especially to touch the conscience of young conductors, moths, peetons, without forgoing professional drivers.
What's going on in the spots?
Over all personal stories that will attack emotions.
The slogan "sanglant" of the whole campaign also shows:
You don't think, you pay!
The word "You don't think" is recorded in Majuscules on the recording plate.
Then, in a blood flag, there's the phrase "You'll pay."
What must symbolize that a moment of intention can be paid for life.
The spots will "han" the spectators until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Sexons countries, which can generally be seen images with drastic images of the victims of accidents.
He believes that this will lead to a decrease of the accident rate and the number of deaths on the Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Sugar and struggle strategy against drivers
"What goes with drivers is the system of sugar and sweet.
For them, the sugar is represented, for example, by winning time when they grill a red fire.
The crazy is the threat of an adjustment or an accident.
The risks should be reminded of drivers," said Martin Kośán, the hospital's transport psychologist Na Homolce.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising, the psychologue is estimated.
The risk of drivers reports are, according to him, less effectively.
"When a static panel is installed against a danger, it will probably be fast to fusion with the environment, and the drivers will not see it anymore," says Kośán.
Olmert would make peace exchange in almost all the occupied territories
Ehud Olmert, the President of the Provisional Government of Israel, is encouraging the refund of practically all the occupied territories in 1967, including West Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan's heights, in exchange of peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published on Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We have to go to an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to make almost all the territories (occupied), or all", says Olmert daily.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we should be able to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of the Israeli Territory), because without this, peace will not be done", he added.
It acknowledges that the possible refund would understand Jerusalem-East.
"Those who wants security in Jerusalem, and especially don't want to be tractors and bulldozers to strike his feet, as it happened to one of my best friends, should turn away to the parties of Jerusalem," noted Olmert by making allusion to the two attacks in the city, in July, in which several people were killed and tens of blessed persons.
According to the first minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Monte del Temple, the sacred and historical places" located within the city of Vieille.
The one who wants to maintain the sovereignty of Israel over the whole city will be bound to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not be walking," he smiling through the next.
Golan's height retrait
Olmert also pronounced for the retirement of Israel from the Golan, which is, according to him, an essential condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require some efforts from Damas.
"I propose not to conclude peace with Syria only on the basis of a Golan retirement," he reports.
"The Syrians are very well aware of what they're going to leave to get the Golan.
They will have to reject their current relationships with Iran; they will have to abandon their relationship with Hezbollah (movely chiite); they will be to reject the constant support that they are granted to the Hamas terrorism (move), Al-Kaiida (Terroral network), as well as from the Djihad (heilig war) in Iraq," explained the first minister.
Questions that happen after the accident: are stewards in the car illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long road is prohibited
In the context of the tragic accident of the Autocar company of the University Agency near Patue, Italy, the question is whether stewards and passengers may move inside the car.
"If we wanted to respect the law strictly and formally, the activity of a steward is contrary to the road traffic law," said the speaking port of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The incident in question, during which a 22-year-old host was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the road of the car.
The young girl was at this time unfortunately sit next to the heating, on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had two other seats.
But the car may have an accident, may be slowly free, even when steward serves the coffee or distributes newspapers.
What's important, is if the car is under its technical box equipped or not.
If this equipment is not authorized, passengers must stay sit.
The long-term cars student Agency do not contain places; what was confirmed in Update.cz by the director of the company Radim Jančura.
"This is a question we have treated with the Ministry and, at the beginning, prohibits all passengers movement.
Then they canceled it and we have found that passengers can go to the toilets during the trace provided that they have their own seat," he declared his position.
The law ignores the steward
" There is no unique legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legal prescription is concerned with this role.
On the other hand, no legal prescription is prohibited by the transporter to propose services.
The road transport law only knows the term of vehicle receiver; it does not define its rights and duties," adds with more ambiguity the Hanzelka port.
Josef Pokorný, director of the movement of road vehicles, estimates, on the other hand, that the law is dealing sufficiently with the problem.
"All depends on the fact that the car has the permission of proposing places in its approval.
Everything stays there, he said.
Cars are divided in urbans, where there are limited places and maximum speed, interurbans with higher permitted places and higher speed and long-term cars, with the highest authorized maximum speed and seats equipped with security seats.
Like in the flight, one expert said
Jaroslav Hośín, expert at BESIP (road safety) in transport, does not see the movement of stewards to board as a major problem.
"In regular circulation there is no danger; the situation may be compared to the service of the aircraft.
Instead, it is not sure when a turbulence will occur, and the air hostship can covered the head."
"or, if the car would slowly free, physical laws would clearly be valid.
Like in a city bus or in a tram.
The transporter must handle the safety of stewards through internal requirements," he also believes that, from the point of view of the law, the problem is not resolved.
Jančura is ready to remove these services
Student Agency is the only car carrier to offer steward services.
He's up to two hundred.
Even after this accident, the director does not consider their work as a risk worker.
"But as long as I'll have the impression that it's a risk work, I'll remove it.
Passerers may receive their coffee and their newspapers at the packaging.
This would also decrease the costs," he said.
The security concern is the reason why it does not give stewards in its vehicles the director of Asiana Alexeï Litvine, which ensures, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines.
"We have no hosts, we opposed it since the beginning.
Soon or later this will end by a dead accident," he said, a year ago, in Tøden.cz.
A great tragedy has arrived
A young host of the Plześ region, who worked for society for two years, died at the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably removed the emergency stop band without using clignotan and blocked the road to the car.
The driver of this last to try to avoid it through a brush maneuver, but he burned it by his right side.
Jančura refuses that the two seats reserved at the rest of the stewards were sold.
"In the case of long lines, it is not possible to reserve these places, they are blocked."
The company has a complaint against the truck driver.
For the detriment of the young girl's family, the Agency will not wait for the judgement of the court, but in terms of financial compensation, it also takes account of the accusable.
Amendment of the law?
Not viewed
An amendment of the law, which has been developed for more than one year by a group of thirty experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide specifications regarding the movement of stewards on the board of the car.
"Ow, she has not reached any conclusion on this point.
Actually, it is not too interested in bus, but instead of the point system, the maximum speed on the car and the use of the portable on the flight," said the experts Hoquín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of stewards as a matter that was fundamentally imposed to the security of passengers", concludes the Port Hanzelka, expressing that autocar safety control is under the authority of the police and the work security office.
The hopes of the Düsseldorfois are on Francfort.
The great words were not missing in the letter addressed by the WestLB Director Committee to house employees.
By an unity of the Financial Institute of Düsseldorf with the Deka-Bank de Francfort, "the Central Financial Market Institute of Spain's Financial Group" could, according to the Sunday Post.
WestLB would bring a "competence block" doubled of sustainable productivity in such a case.
Indeed, such a relationship could be a decisive flow of shipping to other concentrations in the country bank sector.
It looks like this when a direct committee wants to demonstrate its action capacity in difficult times.
Because WestLB, blessed, has always been a strong pressure.
It is not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Authority for Financial Services, which has recently clearly understood the Government of the North-Westfale Land that the time was counted in the search for a future solution.
However, it is questioned for a few years - also on the side of Francfort - of a relationship between the Deka Bank, who knew Spain's customers from their investment funds, and WestLB.
The head of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas reported in the presentation of the end-August digits that he did not see any meaning in the fusion of the Mainzer Landstrasse house with a country bank, which is Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Governing Board of Deka, which is supported by the countries' banks and by the groups of smuggling chambers, was responsible for conducting meetings with WestLB for common commercial activities.
It could then be the debit of the financial market, or parts of that.
However, the talkers are just starting to say in the financial place.
It is not the first time that Deta-Bank, who, with its 3000 employees, accounts for one of the most important employees on the Francfort financial place, in their play, is about the consolidation of the Case Case Sector.
In 2003, Deta-Bank was believed that it could fusion with the Rhenanie Palatinat Land Bank and Halbaba.
There's nothing to smell of this twenty-shirt.
In spite of the plans, they were publicly reported that the Government of the Hesse Land was opposed to any participation in the Hellaba.
Then the other two houses did not join.
The Land Bank of Rhenanie Palatinat was raised at the Bade-Wuttenberg Bank at Stuttgart.
But there are still new treaties on the regrouping of the Deka-Bank with countries' banks.
Lastly, the President of Hellaba's Hellaba's Directorate Committee, Omther Merl, however, was pronounced against any commercial fusion strategy with his bank.
Independently from this, feeling seems to be emphasized that the regrouping of the various institutions of the public sector is particularly urgent.
Now that the electoral to the country of Baviera has passed, a BayernLB Union with the Bade-Wuttenberg Bank could first be created.
For Helaba, it's not particularly a good news.
If the pressure obliged to new fusions should increase, the possible partners slowly escape him.
In the South, she would now be a Junior partner, although she had been better resisting the crisis than the Munich and Stuttgart banks.
The grouping of Hesse-Thuringe boxes, which has 85 percent of the capital of Helaba, took a shut up the beginning of the year on all Union with WestLB.
The NorthLB would remain.
However, such geo-strategic reflections reflect only one of the faces.
Another aspect poses the question of how the various commercial models of each of these banks can be assigned.
In June, Merl stated that the decision-making issue, namely what commercial model the future capacity of the countries' banks should be assured, was not yet resolved by the German group of cash boxes.
At the end, a WestLb department could have occurred, dispatch that is not obviously desired here.
This is also what it is asked in the letter of the Executive Committee: in any case, a 'global resolution' would be mentioned for the establishment.
How all of this will be put into the same cart with the unity of some entities with Deta-Bank remains to see.
The second weekend of the bird party is also known as the weekend of Italians.
For Elena, it's the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena joins him as a little friend, and so nothing is like, he says.
Besides a ton of five litres of the Kaiser Mark, they have a well-building barb that shows about 200 visitors of the bird party whose deep sounds can produce.
Elena's shoot first, then shoot it.
From Bologne, they came to Verone.
From there, from the road car near the new Puorta car, four bus take the start at 23:45, "Monaco destination, Birra's festival, arrived at 6:30.
Three buses are preserved for Italians, in one of the buses that travel to Brazil only.
In a parking round, South Americans sing out of time and already next to their dragon, they have already celebrated last night.
And also burning, Marco Watch explains, it's not for Italians.
The bus belong to Marco, which takes a long double swimming bathroom of fauce and lunetts to large armed montures.
For five years, they're going to the bird's feast, three injured than this year.
They go overnight, stay on the party, and return at 22:30.
And the night would mean unnecessary costs, Marco explains.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pool with a Kaiser blue, raised in accordance with the Bavarois cleaning law, the disease insurance and a responsible group in Germany - Marco made a language course in Francfort.
And the bus are already rolling in the night on the "Brennero" Autostrada direction.
There's no bird, not yet.
Quickly, everything becomes quiet in the bus, travellers sleep.
That's better, they will still need their forces.
Pauses will be made in Bressanone, and Holzkirchen, while many other buses with Italian registration plates do again a little break before Munich, on the 8.
When a little morning, the Marco group ended at six-third hours as planned on the parking near the Terèse place, about 50 other bus from all Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the other are gathering together, Marco holds a last talk, explains the attack plan.
First of all: covering the small yellow cake.
Dessus is written to the left 'Fest of the bird', a boshical, and on the Internet address of the Marco travel agency 'conoscersiviando.it'.
Secondly, "When the doors of the blue chapter open, they are short," Marco cried in the small morning.
'Come!' Run and reserve the places in the tent.
'No front, no matter we're blocked, and not all the yellow boxes on the same banks, it's necessary to divide them in the room.'
The chop, cry Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget it!
'Tomount security agents that we do well!
Since you leave your places, they're part of!"
Thirdly: ‘Third night, being returning here at ten hours and half of pigs!’ Complete?
And that's it, it's going to the bird party.
On the path, one new of the white cakes on the trees to find the way, the panels, and even the electoral display of a large bavaroic popular party.
We want to be ready for return.
It's the second weekend of the bird party, known as the "week-end of Italians".
There are no precise numbers; 50 000 are talking about the Alpes and slowing into the blue kitchen, 10 per cent of the visitors would come from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police is strengthened by seven South Tirol police officers, by Italian voluntary saviors supporting the Bavarois Red Cross that carry out a statistics on countries where Italians take the first place before the British (60 interventions) and the Austrians (circa 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
Those who are particularly appreciated by Italians are the teater of the Hofbröu brassery.
Insomnie Nubes for Hypo Real Estate shareholders
The German banking system is relatively stabil, it stressed the Federal Minister of Finance just a few weeks ago.
What a chance the politician used the word “relatively” and that the German banking sector would not be paid by crisis movements.
That has actually occurred this weekend.
The financing of the Bavarois Hypo Real Estate (HRE), side of DAX, obtains a German bank consortium to protect market turbulences.
A person in the confidence of the situation said to Reuters Monday that the aid credits are allocated to an amount of EUR 35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate should now pay interests on the fraction to which it had so right.
The money provided both private banks and public law banks.
In the back-plan, it's the Depfa company who supports losses.
The state finance was, according to a newspaper article, a very short term for long-term projects for which he had paid money, which is not possible since the infidelity towards the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s liquidity reserve was reduced by 95 per cent to 2.537 million euros, and the own capital rate was also slightly slightly slightly 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
The current benefits and net benefits from financial transactions were, in comparison with the same period the previous year, to zero point, the benefits resulting from the allocation of determined credits and mobile values, as well as the removal of provisions in credit operations had increased by more than 70% to 5 million euros.
This is only due to the important benefits resulting from the reimbursement of accountability costs from the restructuring of the old Depfa group, as well as the reimbursement of interests in accordance with the book of the tax procedures and commercial purchase for Conzern companies that the deficit of profits has been adjusted by about 16 per cent.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former state financial had first been unexpectedly shown on industrial credits, which were then subsidiated at the Aareal Bank.
Since classic state financing was not sufficiently rewardable, Depfa was then intensified in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects between private investors and State (Privat-Public-Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
In terms of the value of the group, Hypo Real Estate should process awareness that should have on the calculation of wines and losses of the group an essential material effect that remains even enough.
The fact is that the dividends were shot.
By 2007, they were throwing to two thirds.
Hypo Real Estate is a very important investor of state and infrastructure since the Depfa's purchase.
It is more solid than other interbank market reintegration institutions because it has no customer deposit.
With the failure of the Lehman Brothers Investment Bank two weeks ago, the assignment of credits between banks has been remarkablely tariving, the banks have accumulated their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate requires annually for a part - approximately 50 billion euros - all of the Depfa's credits of a short-term rebuilding means.
According to a Communicator of Hypo Real Estate, the need for funding of the group is covered with the average-term credit and the protected undertakings of the flow of international markets widely outside the current walking state.
Other sources say that reintegration would be assured by the funds until the end of 2009.
The Chairman of the Directorate Committee of HRE Georg Funke explained, instead that the Hypo Real Estate Group had no longer to take up the financial markets in a mid-term term.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Surveillance of Financial Services (Bafin) are part of the principle that the capacity of the Hypo Real Group on the market is now assured.
The shareholders and creditors of the bank are only expected.
However, in view of the dynamic and impossibility of the crisis, there is no certainty.
Moreover, it is not impensable that the financing is not possible in its entire expansion.
But the opposite can't be disappeared.
After the fact that the bank is, according to the last reported, even to the doors of insolvency on Sunday nights at the end of the night, this savings will not be able to resolve the spirits no longer.
The course of the action was 75 per cent to 3,30 euros.
Instead, the obligation courses are particularly well-being.
While the debts to the first head moved, the second plan loans are broken.
The most touched are especially the investment funds of the old company Württemberg Hypo and those who have a life period over 2009.
The obligations of the Hypo Real Estate bank seemed to be an alternative spectrum placement, and now their value should be considered dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net hardship of the bank crisis and the crisis of the institutions that had taken the crisis in the establishment by the Depfa Bank.
While the emission institutions are still prepared to support the system, the governments and the less touched commercial banks may be expected to resolve timely arrays.
Or there will happen what no one is expecting at this time - that financial crisis could be overcome in the next 15 months.
But faced with the renewed brushes of a partial nationalization, the probability that security approached is now a simple hope.
This should preserve a few nights of immorality before all the long-term creditors on the decision to know whether they should separate their commitments.
Short-term investors can always use what they have taken a trace to make a loss report for the next years on the income income of the automated bourse winning capital.
Sylvana and boite secrets in Bento
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years old, has to be presented for the first day at the Tachibana High School, the girls start to ride: Germany is so "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana had already known this word thanks to Mangas - in its new exchange log, she speaks of Japan.
"The first course day in Japan.
What was I excited.
Stop the way to go to school was scared of me.
I live in Tokyo in direction of Kawasaki and take the train 40 minutes to Tachibana Highschool.
I've got to find the whole way alone. Happyly I didn't lose.
The beginning of courses seems not to be fixed in a strict way as well as in our home in Basse-Saxe.
The students appear each other after eight hours, until 9 hours less than twenty, a table tour begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the course was starting, it was to me to present.
I'm not like to talk to people, especially before a 40-year-old class.
As I had not yet the uniform of the school, I put a old shoe of my mother's accommodation, as well as a chemist, blue shoes and black shoes.
So, I was present before the pupil and tried to speak correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - I call me Sylvana, I came from Germany and my birthday is in one week.
At that moment, I was very pleased to have started learning the language just two years ago.
The 31 girls of the class all made low, shocked and signed, and I constantly heard the word "Kawaii".
I've already known him thanks to my food.
It belongs to the essential vocabulary to the survival of Japanese births and means "mad, chou".
Then I slowly left my place.
The daughter next to me made me a great irone smile, she found that it was a honor that the corresponding swimming sit next to her.
The rest of the time was quiet, but when the gang sounded, I was shooted in the rules.
Everyone talked better, smiled, and made me a lot of questions - in that case, it was enough to understand the English Japanese.
During the break, they all left their Bento.
My welcome mother also made me this kind of Lunchbox - it's really other than the poor in Germans.
I had rise to the aromatic herbs, small sausages, a concombre sald and alges, fruits and a kind of meat around Tofu.
Most of the time, I don't know what I eat exactly here in Japan.
The things have a strange appearance and a completely new ghost.
What's sure is that it's really good.
Well, if you don't know, brrrr!
Bentos are not only dinners in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a Bento that she prepared himself, and then is particularly carefully prepared - in the hope of making a little better knowledge of the boy during the break.
I read this in my eat.
I'm interesting to know if I can observe it here too.
"Why's Japan in particular?" asked me my friends when I told them I wanted to pass a year to school in Tokyo.
Then I always answered:
"For this makes me fascinate, what."
Finally, read food, that's what I prefer for for years.
And to better understand the foods and cultures found there at a time, I also began learning Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there a day.
Because I also have a weak for traditions, us and habitats.
And here, we're giving them a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the most recent technology and trends - on the other hand, it is severe, discerned and traditional.
And as everything is so well organized, I never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I have ever seen."
Rats also have feelings
A rat or a cafard fleet before the danger, is that what does it mean that he also feels afraid?
The neurophysician Joseph LeDoux is convinced: many animals also have feelings.
But how can we verify that he tests the same thing when he acts in the same way as us?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions are published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles of the answers to the question "What do you think you're true without any evidence?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other conscious states without me or anyone else has not yet been able to prove it until now, as we cannot prove that other human beings have a conscience.
But in that case, at least it can be expected that all human brains present the same configuration.
Since we turn to other species and treat the matters of feeling or in general conscience, we're going to be in difficult practices because Hardware does not match.
When a rat is before a danger, he does the same as many other animals: he makes death, flying or attack.
Human beings are in the same way, so some scientists are deducing a comparable subjective life.
But I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the brain structure make the transposition of our subjective life to that of the difficult animals.
One of the aspects is that the circles that are almost always associated with human conscience include the prefrontal Late Court (from its participation in the short-term memory and the direction and execution functions).
This wide region is much more developed in human beings than in other primates and seems to be completely absent in other beings.
So at least for these aspects of our consciousness that depend on the frontal Court, among whom we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to suggest that human being is even different from other primates.
Another significant particularity could be residing in the language of humans: a large part of its existence is linked to the language, which often means that its conscience depends on.
In that case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness should not depend on the language, it would certainly affect it, so that animal conscience, whatever it is produced, would probably vary of the majority of our conscience states.
This is why it is so difficult to determine what can be like a conscience in other animals.
If this, internal and subjective, does not leave or measure or, due to this particular Hardware, analyze on our own experience, then its observation poses great problems.
Most of my developments refer to the content of the conscious life, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be readily available scientificly.
We could consider animal conscience processes without taking into account their contents, and this is exactly what happened during short-term memory studies, especially with the example of visualization.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, we focus on the nervous correlations of conscience than on cause mechanisms: both may be identical or not.
This approach also highlights the weight of the prefrontal Court in the achievement of visualization.
But what's the result of the emotions?
I conclude that a emotional system, such as fear, is active in a sense of its own activity.
So what we're called "terror" is the mental state in which we find when the activity of the discharge system located in the brain (or its follows, like the body's reactions) occurs from the living memory.
Thus observed, emotions are closely related to the cortex regions that characterize primates and particularly humans.
Degrees of sense, associated with our voluntary nature, are degenerate, because we can, with the help of words and grammatics, distinguish and categorize states to imposing them to others other than us.
On the contrary, Antonio Damasio, for example, thinks that the feelings from primitive activities are born in the regions of the body sensation of the Courtx and the cerebral tronk, as well as Jaak Pankseep, which is more focused on the cerebral tronk.
Since this network has not been much changed during human evolution, it could actually participate in cross-border feelings in all kinds.
From a fully theoretical point of view, I can't oppose it, but I believe it is indemonyable.
Pankseep argus that what is fearful in humans and rats is likely as feeling as in both cases: How can it be checked whether rats and men feel the same thing when they act likewise?
A cafard flew before the danger, but if he feels afraid?
In my eyes, similar behaviors do not suffice to prove identical vercuss.
Certainly, the nervous comparison helps: the rats and men have similar brain trons, cafards against the brain do not even have a brain.
But is the cerebral tronc at the origin of feelings?
And even if we could prove this to the human: how can we show it at rats?
I think the rats and other mammals, perhaps even the cafards (who do you know?) have feelings.
But I wouldn't know how to show it.
And because their feelings are truly different from us (as human conscience is on special circles and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior than the emotional feelings of rats.
In all cases, progress is made on the nervous plan as the same thing is taken in rats and humans.
As I don't explore language and conscience in rats, nor feelings, I don't know whether they exist.
We could judge this as a short term, but I prefer to progress instead of stirling me constantly against a wall.
I'm actually a pragmatic emotive.
Platini, President of the EUFA: a period of gratitude for Poland and Ukraine
The First Advocate Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that the preparations would be immediately placed under the direct responsibility of the President and Prime Minister.
"The Government considers the EUFA decision in Bordeaux as a evidence of trust in Ukraine and its ability to organize, in collaboration with Poland, the Championships of Europe", announced Watjunik.
"But this isn't an amnistic for our country.
The work is just starting, and there is still a lot to do in the two countries."
In the calendar of construction or destruction of cities, streets, hotels and airports, the two guests run after the terms.
The number of cities for Europe's Championship may eventually be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't lose time anymore.
We have to work at the maximum speed," said the President of the Ukrainian Link Grigori Surkis.
"EUFA has constantly shown us at the eye."
A further radical measure was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the PZPN football link was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after many scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, independent administrator.
The Committee was meeting on the request of the Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
"A real danger would be that PZPN is not able to act in rules", Drzewiecki of the Polish Press Agency.
"We have assured the EUFA President that the preparations of the 2012 European Championship would not suffer it."
several members of the First Division's link have already been sentenced in the previous season for the handling of obligatory relief; finally, the League's beginning has even been dealt in the last minute.
Dennis Quaid inflicted against attack
She wanted to promote a new movie, talked about his private life in an interview - and now she was enthusiasmed with her ex-hollywoodian Meg Ryan.
He runs - and counter-attacks.
A late war of the Rose for the former Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid couple: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors go to a disgraceful battle - in view and south of the world.
Last week, Meg Ryan was expressed in an interview for the American newspaper InStyle on the causes of the marriage failure: "Dennis has been my long-time unfair, and it was very painful."
She had taken knowledge of the expansion of falseness only after the divorce.
The reason why this striptease of the thought resides in the press relationships of Ryan for his new film "The Women" - it is told about the history of a adultery.
The reaction of Dennis Quaid on his infidel husband qualification was clearly: that would be "monstruous", said at "New York Daily News", 54 years old, which "Meg renews the story of our relationship and the manoeuvre".
It would be more "recretable", that "the punishment and the burnings that constitute a divorce for each child are renewed in public" for their children of 16-year-old Jack.
While Ryan lived alone since the divorce, Quaid rejoiced and will soon become the jumeal father.
Thus his answer was: "In any case, my life continues.
I'm glad to have a wonderful family that's better."
The prices of flight tickets and hotels fall
During the first half of 2008, the flights and nights of hotel were less cherished than the previous year.
In Germany, according to the current study, the flights would even be reduced to 50 per cent.
The flights and nights of hotels would be overlooked - this is the result of a study of the American Express financial services provider.
The company analyzed its reserves from the first half of 2008 and, after a price increase in the first quarter, a net decline in benefits in the second quarter.
After the hotel prices increased for years, hotel nights have already been reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices increased in 41 of the 48 European cities, which were still examined by 6,9 per cent in a mean comparison to 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities examined.
From April to June the prices were already 3.6 per cent lower than the previous year.
The trend was mainly cleaned in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay from 30 to 37 per cent less than one year ago.
The causes of this would be for American Express in the low course of the dollar that led to a "booth of US tourists low."
Financial places such as Francfort or London would be more touched by the recule of hotel prices as industrial sites such as Hanovre, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices increased by 26.3 per cent, the record in Europe.
Thus, in flight prices, tendency was increased in the first quarter:
As a result of the increase in the price of the Kerrosen, economic passengers have averaged 7.1 per cent of more than 2007, long-coor flights, very fuel consumers, even increased to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, the prices of tickets in economic class increased average of 12.5 per cent in comparison with the previous quarter, in case and in the first classe, however, price changes were largely less pronounced.
In Germany, prices have been more important than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices increased 11,9 per cent, in the second quarter, lost 23.6 per cent.
The German internal flights have even been divided by two according to this study.
The reasons for this decline of prices would, on the one hand, be a slight economic growth, explaining firmly.
The request would be the field in many segments of the aircraft market.
On the other hand, there would be an accentuated pressure on the competition by the Open Chile Treaty that liberalizes the air traffic between the United States and Europe.
Sign of the tendency is the removal of airlines from non-rewardable traffic companies, as well as the high number of aircraft companies that had put the balance during the first half of 2008 - 24 companies were nothing but in Europe.
HSV said Gladbach 1:0
With a simple purpose and methods, the SV Hamburg becomes first of the classification.
In Borucea, Luhukay has not always succeeded in finding a nine officials.
from Christffer Klein. Size. Catastrous aeroplane for international player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player will return only later in the game and his sweet tired failed against the goal.
His message was precisely formulated, and he was out of his lips in conviction.
He just knew he was right.
"We need this second goal," Sifla Hermann Rieger is in the quarter of the Humbourg alone's clothes.
There was no big thing in the clothes, the half-time was finished, and most of them were cut into their place.
Rieger has been the HSV Physiothérapeute for about three decades, playing a great reputation as well as old protagonists.
That is why his request was received in strategic places.
The assistant Cornelius Jol acquired and took the pocket to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg Martin Jol's chief entrepreneur.
The orders seem to have been similar: and that's with this second goal!
The lack of practice was missing.
"It wasn't very nice to see today," Marcel Jansen later said.
Bastian Reinhard would "souhacy would also be detained".
This 1:0 (1:0 at the mid-time), the Humbourg team must do it at a shock of the head successful by Mladen Petric (11th minute); and the fact that the very low players of Gladbach couldn't hurt the low players of Hamburg.
"He was a salt victory," said Marin Jol.
Hamburg's SV will celebrate this Monday on 121 years.
By Saturday after midday, the supporters settled themselves, the blue sky above the aren and the provisional classification tables on the gentle screen that identified their club as the first of the class.
It'll be a birthday without a real party.
"We know we're taking riculum," Marcell Jansen said.
It is doubtful that the intermediary result of the table reflects more the unprevisible character of the first Link than the domination of its HSV.
The team with his late arrivers - the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the Petric goal guard as Jansen discovered by the FC Bayern - is certainly sweet, but she still not brilliant.
"We need more charm and more tribbles", said Jol.

Small matter affects the flight of spatial sounds
For years, a mysterious phenomenon leaves researchers in the perplexity: the dark material influences the speed of space sounds while it is called gravitational support manuals.
Experts are afraid that the general theory of proportionality is not completely correct.
For almost 18 years, the "Ulysses" space audio wants in space.
From the shortly heavy fuel behaviors, Criogen death threatens.
For years, a mystery phenomenon is caused to disappear among researchers - the anonymity of gravitational support.
The gravitational support is a manoeuvre of spatial sounds, by which they obtain an additional shell in the gravitational field of a heavenly body, for example the Earth.
So, sounds can economize a lot of fuel.
The American-European research sond Cassini-Huygens used this physical styre, as well as the Ulysses Solar Sond.
This is the outstanding of researchers for many years: volatile objects are not always 100 percent of the way they are expected according to the convenient pregnancy laws.
Moreover, irregularities appear at the level of speed.
Sounds become unexpectedly faster or slower.
Until now, physicians couldn't explain this effect.
They baptized him the anonymity of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that the theory of the general relativeness of Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction force of the matter of space curve, could not be completely correct.
The American Physician Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study of Princeton always believed hard as the fer that Einstein did not fail and tries to explain the anonymity of gravitational support by what is called the black material that astronomes have identified in the universe.
"The black material could be responsible for this anonymical, material that is also close to the Earth," he wrote.
Space researchers know the existence of black material only for about 10 years.
It seems to be a attraction force with the effect is observable on other heavenly bodies.
On the contrary, it is completely invisible, i.e. it is not sending or reflecting any electrical radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the scientists' calculations, the black material would also represent a good fifth of the whole mass of the universe.
Tourists engaged in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hand of their ravisers, the Kidnapp tourists in Egypt should be released as well as the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Italy confirmed it.
The Sudan ravisers requested a ransom of several million euros.
During the prior shooting of the release, six pregnants would have been killed.
In the south of Egypt, five Germans were taken.
The ransom negotiations would be already undertaken.
The Germans are without stop in the kidnappers collimator.
WELT ONLINE depends on the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in Sahara are visiblely free.
This is what the Egyptian state television, the Arab TV chain Al-Arabija and the Italian media have been communicated.
The Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the Italian television chain of Sky TG 24: "We were freed by our civilians and others.
We are in control of their health status," reported Frattini.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanians, and their eight Egyptian councils are well and are in safety, announced the Egyptian national television.
The 19 excursion participants in the desert should already be on the road to the Caire.
The circumstances around a fleet before the shooting remained fleet: so the kidnappers would have been near to put an end to the slaughter, according to an Egyptian security agent, before the Sudan army killed six kidnappers without crying war.
" The problem was resolved.
They agreed with a ransom," the agent would declare.
There was no longer to collect the otages," when it was soon, "This surprise" has been produced.
And the Sudan soldiers slaughtered that Sunday six of the ravisers in the border zone between the Sudan, the Chaad and Egypt, and adopted two of them.
The winners requested a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money had to be delivered by the German woman of one of the opposites.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" stated that, according to the German mediator, the liberation of the ships was late because the kidnappers feared their security.
According to the article, the ravisers wanted to release women's skin after the payment of the ransom.
The men should be reserved until the ravisers had found a safe path to run.
The German Ambassador in Caire refused to comment on this report.
Abus of a beau-pater who kills suicide."
A court was reported that a woman was killed for years of abuse by his beauty father.
Michael Trerise, 57-year-old STTITIANs, in the Cornoailles, was prisoned for six years after acknowledging eight chiefs of indecent facts.
The large court of Truro reported that he was regularly linked to his beautiful boyfriend, Stephanie Randle, during his childhood, from 5 to 7 years old.
Trerise wrote in a condemnation letter: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court was informed that Melle Randle, aged 34, was suicided home in Mutley, Plymouth, April 1, 2007.
A child when she lived in Coventry, Trerise joined her and banded her before forced her sexual acts, while her mother worked at the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in the Cornouailles.
His beautiful boyfriend went to Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Mele Randle, a voluntary national Trust assistant, was discovered by abuse that had been inflicted two times a week.
The general lawyer, Ramsey Quaife, said to the court that friends told Mele Randle, who was a good surfective and cyclist, seemed to be "emotionally dead" since 2006 and "he lost all hope for life."
In April 2007, his real father, Terrance Randle, found her death in his apartment in Plymouth.
We think she's suicided with a plastic sack.
Mr. Randle faced the beauty father of her daughter who had otherwise posted a condemnation letter that ended so, "I am attacked and the bandist regularly."
"I didn't abuse her sexually.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "You are really strange as a fetichist, your victim should certainly be terrified, especially at the age of 7 years.
"This displaced saga ended by the victim's suicide.
And what more surprised, it is the fact that if she had not done this geste, his story would certainly never end in the court."
He added: "I particularly emphasize his father and his mother the effects of your crime in Sthephanie for years.
"If those, she would certainly be a young happy, promised woman and success today."
Condemnation for the loss of official data.
The Ministerial Office of Cabinet, who forgot top secret documents, in June, will be sentenced by the Office Secret Act, with its BBC.
The man of the Ministry of Defense was moved when he forgot two high-class documents on a Waterloo train.
The documents were carried out in BBC's hands before they were delivered to the police.
This is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any insight of criminal intent.
The BBC corresponding Frank Gardner said that this episode had many Whitehall people.
"They would have thought that this case would be left between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Office of the Office," he stated.
The employee who cannot be appointed is accused of violation of the Act Section 8.1, that is, of the clauses relating to the salvation of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the Ministerial Officer was placed under the whole of the Metropolitan police, given the very sensitive nature of his work linked to the Association of Secret Services
Documents that he had lost contained in appreciation about Al-Qaeda and the security forces resources in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision, Monday morning, and then was carried out from his home to a secret place.
Enterprises of the building face the B&B facture.
The British companys of the building could have to pay more than 80 million £ to cover the saving of the Bradford & Bingley bank.
The Government provided 14 billion pounds to protect the deposits of 2.6 million Bradford & Bingleys.
The interests of this loan will be paid by all companies who collect the money of the spendants, including 59 building companies.
The Director-General of Building Society Association (BSA), Adrian Coles stated that it's "reasonable" to know that companies and their members should pay the cassed cups...
The loan of £14 billion will be paid when the Bradford & Bingleys hypotheques will be disbursed.
But the interests that will increase at the same time will be debt every year to 700 financial companies that collect deposits .
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed the BBC that the 59 building companies are included in this list.
It is unreasonable to see that institutions who have had a careful behavior must now pay some of the factures of the institutions that were very less careful.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is announced that each company must pay a proportional amount to its deposits, and that intermediary companies must pay about 18 per cent of the cost.
The Treasury believes that the interests of the loan will be increased in 2009, at £450 million.
This means that enterprises will have to find 81 million £ to regulate the interests of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Common Trade Committee of the Constructions, stated to the BBC that this decision seemed unjust.
It is "irritante" to see that institutions who have been carefully conducted in the reprise of the real estate market must now pay for the institutions very less careful.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, date of the first year.
"We have to consider all aspects of this matter during the next weeks, to assess the options to take so that the building companies and their members pay this lost facture," said Mr Cole.
The interests for 2009 cover seven months from the end of September to the end of March.
In 2010, the interests of the whole year should be paid, which could also double.
Since the building companies are non-operative organizations, their members are finished by paying the facture or by higher charges, or by lower interest rates for expense accounts.
The milk increases up to five penny a litre
Jersey's people have to pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy announced that she would increase the large price of her milk, of five pennies a litre from Monday.
This is the second increase of the prices that results in a increase in two pennies in February, and following a research carried out by a consulting company.
Detail salers should decide if they go to their tour, increase the price to consumers.
Before the increase in February, Jersey's milk price was last time varied in 2002.
A former Bangladesh Bangladesh saw refusing of warning
A court in Bangladesh rejected a warranty application for the former Sheikh Hasina, which could so be arrested when he returned to the country.
His lawyers said that the court refused to condemn him for his consideration of 50 million taxes when it was PM.
This is one of the many accuseds addressed to him.
Khaleda Zia, the rival of Sheikh Hasina, has been relaxed before this month.
Sheikh Hasina should return to Bangladesh for a few weeks, but his party, League Awani, requested that the provisional military government of the country first give him its full freedom.
The correspondants stressed that the terms of his release are contradictory because if it is authorized to leave the country for medical reasons, they did not see why it could not remain free to return to Bangladesh.
His lawyers have announced that she will now call the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's request, saying that she did not need a warranty because she was allowed to go to the foreigner for medical reasons," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will call against the order of the Supreme Court."
His lawyers argued that she needed this warrant to return to the country to prepare elections in December
Sheikh Hasina should return after October 17, declared an elderly leader of the Awami Party.
It was detained last year after the military interim government had taken the power, but was released in June to care for foreign.
Sheikh Hasina as Zhaleda Zia, no accusions they do.
Problems for the Afghan campaign.
In Afghanistan, almost 200,000 children missed the recent Polio Immunization campaign, because of the violence related to the Taliban, stated the United Nations.
The United Nations has carried out last week, a vaccination campaign in the six provinces.
But she claims not to be able to contact the children of Helmand and Kandahar's dangerous areas, located in the south.
One door of the United Nations said that this has been done despite the promises of the Talibans to not attack or obstruct the thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB lost the ITV judiciary
BSkyB lost its proceedings after the competitive competitive committee, which would allow it to reduce its participation in its rival ITV transmittor.
The Court of Competition ordered BSkyB to reduce its ITV parts from 17.9 per cent to less than 7.5 per cent.
The Commission stated that MSkyB's participation in the past had prevented competition and allowed it to influence ITV injustice.
BSkyB purchased its parts in 2006 after an agreement to actually prevent NTL, now called Virgin Media, buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Office reported that the purchase by BSkyB, parts of ITV, was doubted about the effective independence of ITV, and therefore encouraged the Commission of Competition to investigate
Virgin's patron, Richard Branson, a group of consumers and the Ofcom regulator were all opposed to this purchase.
BSkyB argued that it would not be reasonable to reduce its ITV parts and, on the contrary, was too excited – especially since BSkyB was deniing its vote rights.
New investigation in the case of lawyers in the United States.
The U.S. Advocate named a special accuser to check the issue of the license of nine American advocators in 2006.
Everything was born from the account of the case of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, which criticized the actions of certain minister officers.
The report was critical to the officers of the White House, legislators and the former General Prosecutor Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers who support their license to political causes.
The Special Prosecutor, Nora Makaehy, will now investigate whether the officers interrogated during the investigation have lied to the investigators and thus obstructed justice.
"Christian accusations, not founded, have not been completely confirmed or resolved", said the General Inspector, Glenn Fine, in his report.
The appointment of a special accuser to force witnesses to be put, was one of its most important recommendations.
The controverse begins by the radiation in December 2006 of nine American advisers made by the United States Justice Department.
At the time, the Department stated that lawyers were licensed for medium-sized benefits.
But then it was remarkable that the licensed lawyers were not more criticized than their other colleagues, which encourages some observers to give such licensation a political connotation.
Some of the lawyers were accused of being close to the Republicns of the Congress, while others had refused to investigate fraudulent votes against the Democratics.
American prosecutors investigate and continue the court offices for the government.
It is sure that they can be licensed at any time, but they may not be for political reasons.
The chief of the Department of Justice, Prosecutor General Alberto Gonzales, has finally been accused of being involved in this issue of licensing, and at the end he dismissed.
A number of ministerial officers of the Department of Justice have also given their demission.
The report of the General Inspector was very critical towards the role of Mr Gonzales in this case, declaring that he would consider the "first responsibility" of these licenses, and ended by "abdiving" his role of leader," noting that he was not involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including the old collaborator of Bush, Karl Rove, have not been critical to cooperate during the investigation.
The epoch of Meat Loaf must be honored.
The Rock star Meat Loaf, must be honored at Q Awards for his epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The songer, who will receive a oscar during the ceremony in London next week, declared being "honor" to obtain this recognition.
The song of nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the shooting album of Meat Loaf of 1977.
The breakfast of price delivery is presented by Coldplay, with this year, a limited selection of four categories.
Paul Rees, director of Q magazine, stated: "They have songs that transcend things like time and kind, and Bat Out Of Hell, certainly, are part of it.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a great voice like Meat Loaf.
It starts with a instrumental section that takes almost two minutes.
The song was in trade in the United Kingdom, as one in 1979, classified at the fifth place.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell remained nine years in English classifications, and was sold to more than 40 million examples throughout the world.
Meat Loaf- or Marvin Lee Aday, of his real name, had suffered health problems in recent years, even a operation to handle his heart battle became irregular, after being shocked on the scene in 2003.
In 2007, a strong laringite forced it to cancel concerts.

A Dark Street in the village, Suvent forgot, and Sound Soon soon in the winter.
New York has hundreds of adventures, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, other only functional.
. And even some veteran taxi as well as local long-term residents do not have to give indications towards Extra Place, because they have never heard it.
The street is located in the East Village and crosss the north of First Street, and is not confronted with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet long for 120 feet, it looks like a powdered ring instead of an active artery.
. No panels indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
However, this street has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the constructor of the recent luxury buildings on the First Street.
He would like to repay extra Place, and create a more fluid passage to shops and shops, which should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers, including long-term neighbors, have been declared charmed by this shortage simply because there is one of the latest and older streets of houses.
But the Department of Preservation and Development Immobilier in the city that manages the street has no interest in maintaining it.
This month, at a meeting of neighbouring owner committees, representatives of the Avalon Bay and the Avalon Bay have developed a proposal authorised by the manufacturer to buy the street.
But the Committee prefers that the street remains in the hands of the city, and requested a new proposal to submit the next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of the Committee No. 3.
"There are only few spaces belonging to the city, and we would like the city to preserve Extra Place," she declared.
"If they could propose to retain it in state and manage it, what Avalon could, but we want to keep it public."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that she wanted to repair the small street and install it with seats, some would be used by a coffee where the constructioner will consume space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was public at the meeting of this month.
Michele de Milly, the door of Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to operate the street, it doesn't want to be the owner.
"The main interest of Avalon Bay is to relocate this abandoned ship, and to make it public" she stated, emphasized that this was the city to suggest him the sale."
Seth Donlin, a word door of the Immobilier Reservation, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street, and further stressed that the Agency's mission was to develop the property rather than to manage it.
Compared to his colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a slight historic skille.
Some believe that Extra Place takes this name since 1802, when the heritage of the great firm of the many children of Philip Minthorne was divided, letting this small leg of land, which remains since abandoned.
The afternoon of the CBGB, a rock rock monument closed in 2006, reopened in Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the photo of Ramones' album covering Ramones" Rocket to Russia"
"This place was wonderful," said Danny Fields, manager of Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
She was filled with helmets, hailons, barriers, posters, sheets and cords."
Some residents, including bloggers who had already spoken about evolution to East Village, were opposed to sell Extra Place, saying that this humble small property should remain public.
Others have declared Extra Place as a real rare - a virtually identical fragment to the city that should be put into peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who conducts a blog named Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (the book of Contents: A Review Amendment Nostalgic on A Villa in the Extinction Procedure), reports the history of the Ville and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a straight-de-saac small, dark day as a night, and delimited by the doors of a frozen helmet and persians, full of newspapers in the last week, which rose along the goaters."
A few exceptions near, the street has always the same wheel.
A short rat actingly behind the rule, near a door that was shooting at the CBGB, and now becomes the seat of a chic clothing store.
Graphites on the walls, a bleeding bottle of 22 eyes, is on the count of newspapers that just come to be cast.
Some passengers declared that it was rarely thinking about Extra Place, and suggested that it was valued.
Mr. Field, on his count, said that some estimated the attraction of the street in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "developed in dark, humid and degrading places."
The bilateral debate: Immersion in English
In this part of the Educational Supervisory Programme, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discussed the position of candidates on bilateral education.
Lance T. Izumi, an elderly student member in California, and the former director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-auteur of the book "Don't even Bon that you don't think it. Why the average classs have to be able to choose their schools."
Attracting the favors of Spanish voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's proposals on education are an interesting example.
Mr. Obama's campaign stressed that "the African and Latin students have less chance to disappoint themselves than white students".
In order to combat these differences, Mr. Obama's educational program, in particular, supports both other subjects, " bilateral cross-border education" for those who learn English.
However, the question for Obama is to know whether his desire to achieve a bilingual education that defends the education in other languages other than English, will also be interested in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a primary school of the Eastern Los Angeles account.
Students of this school are largely Spanish, and low income.
More than a third of the students, consisting of many new arrives, studied English.
Between the CM1 students, 100 per cent has been reviewing the 2008 Math State, an expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students have conducted the review of English-de-language languages-d arts
This unbelievable success was achieved by another ingredient than the progressed by Mr. Obama.
Sexth Street on analysis, practice, continuous capacity assessment, and an exemplary attitude.
In addition, this school, Mr. Obama, could copy, report of Linda Mikels, the Sixth Street, established the instruction of the English language " full support".
The total emerging in English focuses on the almost constant use of English in the instruction.
Small Mikels, instead of bilingual education, stated me: "We had a great success with a student who came to arrive from Mexico, 12 months later, if you go without its class, you would have had no chance to identify it."
"It's walking, she's watching, she's marketed for us."
Mr. Obama should not take example of the Sixth Street Prep and explain it in other schools composed of Spanish students learning English.
The excellent results of this school speak of themselves, but education policies within its party (the National Education Associations have long supported bilateral education) and its huge support for bilateral education, the prognosis of Mr. Obama's response.
Although immigrants are favorable to learn English, Mr. Obama recently considered this issue as an insignifiant, when it announces that we all have to stop switching on the library of English laws.
"On the other hand, he said, "You must ensure that your child speaks Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, it should then take into consideration the educational models that operate, instead of dealing with them or considering them unlikely.
Petrole Netto Success to New Economy World worries
Oil prices slowly slowly lost, because people fear that the relief plan for financial marches is not able to rebuild the economy.

The Second Times Festival for Improvement of the Team Record.
After passing at these eight last seasons, more time than anyone in uniform of the Jets Shaun Elis, the defender thought he had seen everything.
He looked at the second time when the Jets transformed a 0 to 0 to a explosion.
"I have never seen anything like this," said Elis.
The second time began after the Jets and the Cardinal Arizona played in dark clouds.
Then the quarter back Brett Favre succeeded to make a pass in Laveranues Coles with a touchdown of 12 meters, signs the precursor of one after midday when their relationship made a bond in front.
Favre found Coles for more two touchdowns, the first when a back corner was dropped and the second, 10 seconds of the mid-time.
"I'm not out of my area" Favre declared about all his passes in Coles.
"It's a medieval player."
"We communicate very well, despite what people think."
While Favre and Coles played at the catch, the defense shocked the backquarter of the cardinals, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, round back, intercepted a lost shooting and led 32 meters up to touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens let him escape the ball because of Warner.
Last change, the loss of the Bowens ballon, may be the most charming event
Cardinals took control of this ownership during the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ballon, Jay Feely made a goal of 20 meters from 34 to 0.
That was the best thing that the Jets could march in a time.
"The Coach of Jets, Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this fool, said "the second time or third?"
When the two Jets were told to go through 21 inconsistent points in the third time -- Mangini said, "I can tell you that I appreciated the second time than the third.
." Many points have been marked in a few times."
Bangselasie reposed, exceeding its global record.
Haile Bergerlasia, Ethiopia, has again proved to be grateful of his title of the best courier of the background of the century, after having struck his own world's record at the marathon of Berlin Sunday, which became the first to run 26.2 thousand in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory in 2 :03 :59 of an accommodating course on the floor, Bursella struggled with 27 seconds his record of 2 :04 :26, discussed last year in Berlin.
By 35 years of age, Burselassie reported the 26th record of the world of his supercarriage during which he returned the world's Championship or the global record for any distance, 1600 meters from the marathon.
Last month, Burserlassie had lacked the Olympic Marathon of Beijing, fearing, may be exacerbated in today's eyes - that air pollution does not increase its asthm problems.
On the contrary, he promises to run to Berlin.
In the almost perfect-time conditions, 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the arrival-Burselasso wind Sunday, now an impressive average of a thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds
The piste courses such as Bergerlasia and Paul Tergat, both Kenians, converted into fund courses, contributed to the reduction of the marathon record over two minutes in these last decades, since 1998, when the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa wingna in Berlin at 2:06:05 .
After the Wednesday Wednesday, Burrselassie declared the reporters, had suffered cramps in the mollet two weeks ago, and had missed training for a week.
It is obviously clear that the rest has allowed him to stay brilliant, but not stealed.
"I am so happy," he said to the reporters.
"It was perfect.
I've been sent there last week, and today, I had doubts; but at the end, everything went for the best."
In particular in Kenya, the rival is African of Ethiopia, having too orchestrated his courses, avoiding the world stars of marathon, in fact accounting on the libraries as if they were in a piste competition, and considering more global records than the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not reduce the dimension of the Burselasian capacity as a fund courser.
Sunday, for four Kenyans, was recorded a time of 1:02 :04 at my way.
Two Kenyan electors, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to develop Burselasia after the file heads disappeared.
At a few more than three thousands of arrives, Burserbasy made his final reset to get away from Kwambai, which ends on 2 :05 :36, improved its best personal record of five minutes.
Kamathis arrived the third in 2:07:48.
In the women's course, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now German citizens, ended a marvelous year, obtaining the seventh time of 2:19:19.
The English Paula Radcliffe has the global record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, aged 36, surprised everyone who returned to London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She couldn't participate in the Beijing games because of a bad hypothetic, but promises to win in Berlin, improved its third marathon, its personal record of almost five minutes.
It runs for a pleasant strategy, letting the Ethiopian and Kenyan courser group take a nice advantage, then exceeding about 18 miles after.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia arrived in the second century at 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenya, ended third in 2:25:01.
In a Ville to part, the Orgueil and the trials of the Black Wine
Hidden in the development of his large park, a few thousands of the island, the brilliant and the genital Orlando, there is a quiet town where they are born pride and complications of the African experience.
"Eatonville, the first fully black city to integrate, the childhood of Zora Neale Hurston, this description she made in 1935, is no longer easy to do today." The city is at five lakes, three short crowds, 300 skins, 300 good births, full of swimming, two schools and no prison."
It has now become a city of pelerage
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Festival Zora, who stays every year in Eatonville, to make a birth in Hurston, the most famous writer of Harlem Renaissance.
And in several ways, the city that she described has become tourist thanks to its integration in the Tourist Guide of Florida edited by The Depression - was Federal Writers' Project - remains a place on the other hand.
She is also independent, dignity and private that she wasn't already in the 1930s, when Hurston said that the black rural population of Florida was often reiterate to share his real thoughts with the white man, which "we know so little, don't know what he lost".
Even if this is the year of the election of a black President, Senator Barack Obama, who also called a open dialogue on the subject of the race, many here remains aware of the view of the foreign.
"We are very prudent about how to tell the story," said Hortense Jones, 59 years old, resident forever and the oldest Parisian city.
"It must be in accordance with the reality.
Eatonville has been long defined as a paradox of triomphe and fight.
It represents both a historical model of black power and a community of almost 2400 people where poverty is two times the national average.
It is a central, but also a example of Southern black rural culture, several times dealt, which remembers the birth of American slavery.
What would explain why the residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented her native city in the whole world through sincere books, full of dialects, such as "Mils and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the guide of Florida transformed this city, just at the exit of Route 17, a road that crossed the centre of Florida, often forgotten, which was in the chapter of the black history and human dragon.
Against such a great cast in life as in literature, Hurston conducted readers in the ownership shop of the first master of Eatonville, Mr. Joe Clarke, who then was divided into several private parties.
"Pasted the way on the left," she wrote, "You'll find the modern public marron and white school, with its gardens and those well-conserved games, whose Howard Miller has always been careful, even though he can read and write.
She also mentioned the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn sold drinks of any kind as well as everything that can serve passenger people.
So, unlike a hundred words, Hurston associates Eatonville to a government car but also to analysis, reliance, and sex.
Of course, Fodor wasn't so.
It wasn't actually a portrait that everyone appreciated.
Zora well described the reality "Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, said one of Johnson's young girls who Hurston immortalized, quoting colorless songs, interpretated by men who loving their beauty."
She added: "A certain people have not appreciated."
We always remember Hurston as a living and extreme person, which would often return after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77 years old, recalled that Hurston was in a town without warning, on the board of a large Chevrolet, a cigarette in the mouth and carried pantalons here, where even today we are proud of traditional habits.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin told, while many were motivated by her.
"The people were always happy to see Zora," he said.
But he also adds, tasting in his chair of the post-year patium that gives on the Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that " she never remained too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and his books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten it.
Although she became a star of literature, a contemporaine of Langston Hughes and the only black woman of the Barnard College of the 20s, she was entered in a tomb in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she saw.
In Eatonville, no big memory, no plate for the great public.
I don't think they included the contribution or heritage that she offered to the world " said Valérie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a Hurston's biography published in 2003.
A crucial moment has occurred in the 1980s.
Public officials of the County wished to take an authorisation to five roads in the city to replace the Boulevard Kennedy, the main road to two ways of the community.
Olando's development has already put Interstate 4 to the Western Angle of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was just a difficult period of his history.
Forced integration, among both other things, has finished the relatively identical isolation of the community.
In the 50s, disputes on the mixing of races conducted hate at the gates of the community.
"To this time, a band of young white people came to launch persons or objects against people sit on the coast," said Mr. Franklin.
"A woman is even deceased. "
They started a passhake of their car."
In a letter from 1955 addressed to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the request of the Supreme Court for strong integration, defined its decision in Brown v. Board of Education, instead of glory of my race."
Residents now declare that elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some aspects, has diluted the cohesion of Eatonville and declined young people's confidence.
"The black kids were used to be embraced - I remembered it well, our master was wearing the morning, and the evening also said Mr.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, and director of the Savior Community of Eatonville, a group not benefited.
This has longed, added, until the time when teachers and students weren't coming from the same place.
"You don't smell your white professor because it's white - I mean there's a cultural starting line," said Mele Nathiri.
Citizen rights also allowed to create space for other Zora Neale Hurston- black writers, actors and artists who went beyond the damage, such as it, armed with a joyful trust and conduct lines such as: " How can they be free of my company's joy?"
That's over me."
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker returned to the Hurston's anonymous Tomb and began fighting to re-revoke his reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography on Hurston performed by Robert E. Hemenway, a real best saler, reintroduced as well as the American Canons.
The autoroute project just arrived at the moment when the most famous girl of Eatonville had found her attract.
And this time, the old neighbors of Hurston considered it a salvation.
The community began to organize a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences that would generate this audience.
Hundreds of fans came to the unuguration of the festival two years later, and many come back in January to remember it.
After many years, the container renewed the proposal for the road.
"The fascination of the five-way car routes, extremely fast, a true citizen pride," said Melle. Nathiri.
Mele Boyd summarized all the declared that "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the autoroute project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been in the church since 1993, began to come in a large number, and the residents began to review the past.
Eatonville is classified in historical city since 1998.
A mono theme library (evidently renamed Hurston) will open in 2006 on a wonderful Kennedy Boulevard, repaved.
Today, Eatonville remains annomy for Florida: to six thousands of Olando, she may at any time be considered as a post-term street back at a stylish rain day, small as she was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(only 90 per cent of blacks)
Foreigners who have come to discover the story of Eatonville, his reason for being, are still treated with carefulness.
The permission for most interviews must be requested, and some things - such as the walls of the old church of Eatonville, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Mele Jones, a courageous teacher and who has a weak for life red, are always afraid that their island community is not understanding well.
However, in view of the expansion of the Hurston festival, a number of local proud levels are experiencing.
The young people tend to consider Eatonville as Hurston would consider its entire race: beautiful, difficult and all, no better or worse, but also proud, creative, boseous, fool and mixed than the other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It's good for sincere citizen affection that it is heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's neve of 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who expects to return to Eatonville after the colleague to work for local government or police forces, which need additional forces.
And even for the youngests, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon of 11 years of Winter Park, they seem to have learned correctly the Eatonville description.
"The majority of the people that walk in this area will think, "hh, this city has nothing compared with other people," Alondra Kenon said after the last Sunday messenger.
But if you stop and take the time to contempt the story, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, everyone talks fairly finance.
Nevertheless, nothing changed.
If tourists in Manhattan had been away from the kiosque and the genital TV screens in Times Square, they would not realize that they are in the cyclone's eyes.
They could never think that in the offices to see and beat over their tea, bankers and cover fund managers that monopolis New York, pass the worst "work day" in the office since 1929.
Bookers continue to swim on the throats, with their carriages and swimming plates for morning meetings.
The Latins are always among the residential buildings, such as mulls, a hundred luxury chemises covered to a game available on their floors.
The office employees continue to make the chain to buy their sandwich morning to ambulance goods, and it is always impossible to find a taxi between 16:00 and 19:00 in week.
I did not feel the crisis, despite the completely pessimised records until the midday after I decided to go to open a new sparg account.
I was glad I was planned to work at the end of the afternoon, because I was discovering my local JP Morgan Chase branch, a twenty-five of people who made the chae.
Not in front of the shopping shops, nor to remove the species or pay a payment, but in front of the client's service guide, where ordinary customers commanded their guests, tourists requested the shopping, and new customers opened accounts.
The majority of those before me, I would learn later from Starr, my "permissioned personal banker", make all the cheese for the same reason I was.
Not in the same way, because they have already removed their economies from smaller banks, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and state Island.
They removed their money from trifts (e.g. a building company), credit associations and the type of local sparage boxes and their subsidiarys who work only in a state, which say to treat customers as their family.
In recent years, 15 of these banks failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank at the capital of $327, was rewarded to the failite syndicate, and the New Yorkians returned to the home for the weekend this weekend, another bank, Wachovia, was spending for a value of $440 million.
The office and the carriage employees who are before me, disappointed from another potential debacle, transferred their money to a bank that seems to be reliable, or the one that makes the most savings to Wall Street.
New Yorkians have become very families in the financing world in the last few weeks.
"I remembered a lady to my Chinese local supermarket, talking to Lehman Brothers' phone, the bank that made fail, and her Major Director Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity as she could have to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the uniform concierge of my building, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or delivery of my fruit and vegetables.
She told me, after my visit to the bank. "I put all my economy in the market of monetary funds.
"I changed, I don't want to get risked."
Muslim Tombes profaned while Austria shocks to the right.
Heinz-Cristian Strache, who abandoned the right side of the Austrian Freedom Party and, Philip Dewinter of the Belgian right Vlaams Belang, takes part in a manifestation to submit the organization of "which cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, on Thursday, 17 January 2008.
They have road panels that illustrate red mosques.
The police condemns the extremely right to have pronounced an Austrian Islamic Cimetry, the weekend of the victory of extreme Rights to the general elections of the country.
More than 90 tombs were seriously damaged in the Toronto of Traun, near Linz, between the Wednesday and this morning night, and it is according to the police, an organised action.
The crimers struck on several tombs, Jewish symbols such as the Star of David; the detectives believe that this would be done to deceive the feeling of hate of extremists against the Islamic immigrants.
This accident may be in any way linked to elections.
A word door of the Islamic local community declared being "deeply shocked" in the advertising of this propanion, which is just during the religious month of Ramadan that touchs its end.
Austria seriously thinks of finding her courage, following its assortment to the right at the parliamentary elections last.
The two extreme right-related parties, which were almost 30 per cent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, conducted an anti-immigration campaign. Some of their slogans were even considered, according to the critics, as xenophobs.
Heinz-Cristian Strache, Chief of Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the votes, conducted his campaign against the port of folked and burkas, and even expressed its opposition towards the alaha food.
During his final course in Vienna, he spoke of "a European brotherhood" to avoid the size of Islam.
The two parties are trying to prevent the construction of museums and minerals, proclaiming that they would be a political symbol of Austria and Europe's Islamicization.
The reviews and analysis carried out just after the elections have defined the extreme right as the strongest political block of the country, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who did the difference, because they are concerned about their future in the European Union.

Kent's police said that it would not discuss specific cases or potential movements to Glitter in the container.
A door of the Kent police said, "Kent's police will do everything necessary to protect our children as foreigners.
"On us, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the United Kingdom because we have devices that are capable of managing any potential risks in a much more effective manner.
"Protection of Kent's people is the most loving intent to the Kent police, and we will monitor closely the behavior of those who are accused of sexual abuse in the region to minimise the potential risks for the public."
. Glitter was returned to the United Kingdom last month after 27 months purified in a Vietnamian prison for abusing two girls of 10 and 11 years of age.

A source of the Interior Ministry stated that Jacques Smith, the Minister of Interior, was safe and happy to know that Glitter was prohibited for movements in France and Spain.
"I photo the master outside the scene to capture elements of his character" Sonther Bauer - Photograph
No thysses, no eternal clothes.
The essence of the large masters of the flamenco, released from all tensions to obtain the aspect of men or women's detained aspect.
On the one side, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Unreasonable, except in the intimity, in those unknown moments of the great public, where it is discovered intime gests and shooted views of artists who do not worry to get on the scene.
Dumand Duther Bauer is mixed in "Flamenco - People" the theatreality of some scenes with songers, dancers and guitarists with this less known side of artists.
In this project, the photo reflects the special iconography of the flamenco under different angles.
Included in the Moon's programmation of the Phramant Photography, the exhibition "reflexes the international importance of the flamenco, the largest of each day," explains the Creator, who explains that "Flamenco - people" "to be any one, but after having seen the photos, the observer is not typical images of artists on the scene.
These people's photod "in the street" are artists capable of transmitting on the scene of passion, tristeness, joy ... by captivating the public.
To capture instances of personality of these artists, you don't need to do photos on the scene.
They have a personality and a own character.
What I was interested was to create an intime atmosphere that allows me to capture with the photo of the moments of personality of flamenco stars."
With the "Chant Popular des Mines" Festival, Bauer started a long trip in 1997 to photograph the songers, guitarists or dancers with a plate photo.
These are portraits that, through the choice of the photo and material, remember the classic photography.
The implementation of various stylist means breaks with the classic side of the image, giving him a touch of modernity, reflects the perception of the flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day."
It is not the dance or the song in itself, but the personality and character of the artist who captures the public with his art.
The research of the essential and magic was the constant work that has been presented at the El Fotomata gallery in these days.
The flamenco views such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about seventy-dix artists.
The project was transformed into anthropology of the flamenco, which will soon be published in a gallery collection book.
The passion for Bauer's portraits led it to repeat the idea two years ago with the "SportART Project" "Sports of old sports."
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - People", the photographer admits that he likes to photograph the portrait of people, to know and to get into their life for a moment more or less long.
I think the portrait is the most hardest in the photography.
You find yourself faced by people, personalities that you sometimes don't know or who leaves you just a few minutes to make them a photo.
Despite these circumstances, as a photo, I always try my ideas to become real ".
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco named "Flamenco - people" is exposed to the Galerie El Fotomata, located in the 20th of the Mata Street (parallel king to the Peupleraie d'Hercule) which will be open until 16 October next.
Vargas Llosa condemns that the Roman he wrote is "whispering"
Romans are in places that no one knows and treats unknown subjects, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is well determined to advance the new project on which he works, a Roman who has for the main personality Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo twenty years and who has passed through Amazonia.
The favorite to the Nobel Literature Prize condemned last night at the Hay Segovia Festival, that the Roman who is currently engaged in it is "thatever shows that he should not write it."
"If I was reasonable, I would not do it, but I will do it and I hope to finish it ", he concluded in his intervention to the festival of exchange of ideas and thoughts that for four days saw developing a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The city and the dogs" was the most expected personality of the third edition of this festival and filled its contract.
Vargas Llosa, who returned the Ha Festival price to most of the votes of participants, made a room similar to the theatre Juan Bravo.
The presenter of the Festival, Felix Romeo, faced a fascinated public who had not seen the past time during which the Peruvine, with a prodigious memory and a great dose of humor, has turned up the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "the soif of reading" and "the life of new experiences"; how he wrote of a "the very methodical manner" through a intense documentation work, correcting and rewriting a part of the text to face his "man of inspiration"; comment Faulkner, Victor and Alex Dundrea have influenced his vote and his inspiration.
The Spanish American Romanist acknowledged that "no means" is to measure and know whether the books change life. "But I refuse to believe that literature is a pure experience, an ephemical experience," stated Vargas Llosa, who said that it is "a effects" and "return the people less likely," as the writers were asked, "Don't let go to the collivality" and to take their vocation.

The incident occurred when various officials of the Alava Traffic University had conducted a controlling of vehicles on N-1 at the border of the Armon Common.
They learned to stop a bragonette to check it when the driver was injured to the orders, slowly accelerated, and the control began.
The police began to continue until the vehicle stopped two kilometers far beyond the low coast, where the two occupants went down to run in a bown area.
Bask police finally arrested one of the two occupants and took the hachish 2.178 kilograms they carried and found after inspecting the quarter, a Iveco Daily.
The afternoon of the vehicle was charged by hachish ballots, and then they tried to transfer to a police post for extensive inspection and to weight drugs.
Furthermore, the officials found that the recording plate was "falsed" because it was not coherent to the written written on the grid card of the frogonnette, so that they also imposed the detention of a false crime of documentation.
Her ursaintza continues to investigate to stop the other suspect, which has succeeded to escape and to determine the origin of the narcotic invasion.
The detention, A.A. J., of 28 years of age, was guarded in order to achieve the different ways and will be judged within the following hours.
The actor Heather Locklear arrested for having conducted the effect of a medicine
Actor Heather Locklear, famous Amanda of the Telephone series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) to have led to the effect of a medicine.
One Witness saw him doing strange hands by trying to get out of his garage in Montecito, as a talking door from the police patrol in California reported to the People’s magazine.
The Witness explained that at 16:30, Locklear "stopped down on the accelerator, making a lot of smile, trying to get out of the garage car, and walking back several times, she rolled on his sunlight."
Shortly later, the witness, who first did not recognize the actor, saw that Locklear was arrested in the middle of the road and out of his vehicle.
This person, at this time, called the emergency services because "this was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actor sit inside his vehicle, which was partly blocked the road.
"He had a disastrous look," so the agents led him to the specialized center in drugs and alcohol to carry out a test.
According to a police door, the actor has shown cooperativeness and the alcohol abuse has been disappeared since the beginning, although "in the observation of the police officers at first, we think that Locklear was under the influence of a medicine."
Locklear was arrested to have been conducted under the effect of a substance which has not been specified and was incarcered at 19.00 hours and left a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was out of Arizona's clinic where she was inside to care for nervous depression.
Callingers requested the Union's Left Federation to take its responsibility in the case of Silva
The General Coordinator and Deputy Left of the Union, Gaspar Llamazares, today stated that this is the regional federation to take a decision on the case of the former juvenile adviser and sports of the municipality of Seville, France Manuel Silva, who has dismissed the last week after being accused of the treatments for the members of his family.
"In these cases, I am very federalist, and this will be the urgency organization that should take its responsibility," said Llamazares, as regards the behavior of the political party that he must adopt within the municipal Council of Seville.
However, the Union's Left Left requested that the investigations show "transparency" for irregularities that Silva could have made: "The left Union has always defended this kind of business to have a maximum degree of transparency."
He also stressed that the political party had “the very strict ethical codes for all officials”.
"Peace of Mayo", the parish of Garci
In inspiring Benito Pérez Galdoos's reports, José Luis Garci re-established the famous Spanish fight against the French in "Sangre de Mayo", which is the most ambitious film of his film with nearly 15 million euros of budget.
The cinema tried to "scann the many personalities and illustrate the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous Romancist, did he explain today during the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevar would head the long list of actors.
The film of more than two hours and half of Mayo will come out in the cinema rooms next Friday, which will then become a TV series for Telemadrid over four hours.
The great admirant of the literature of Galdoos, José Luis Garci assured that he had done with this "a child's dream" through Esperanza Aguirre, who has taken it three years ago, to turn a memorial film for the two hundred years of Madrileen's 2 May, what he always accepted when the record was holding on national historic facts.
The 15 million euros provided by the Community of Madrid are for Garci a "single opportunities" to reproduce with the decorations and clothing appropriate the environment of "A Spain who is inflicted by the leader for the fight, because the fight for independence has led the people to rebellion under the Kingdom of Ferdinand VII," he reported.
But the cinema regrets not having received funding as for the films "Capitry Alatriste" or "Goya's Fans" - more than the double of that obtained for "Sangre de Mayo" - because he couldn't turn some scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcarrcel, with whom he has cooperated for almost all his carriage.
The filmist of "Rever has started" influenced his usual way to work, on the launch of the actors, with whom he used to repeat before starting the tour and whom he does not casting, because this seems to be "humily" and considers that "the role of the cineaste is to go to the theatre and the cinema to keep it informed".
Many actors in "Sangre de Mayo" repeated before the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillan Cuervo.
Four times a candidate in Oscar (the winning one), Garci believes that the three candidate films representing Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy, Sangre de Mayo, "Seven French billard tables" and finally the winner, "The Ave's tournes" are not representatives of the Spanish young Spanish cinema, "who would like to be better known," he stated.
With this film Garci doesn't wait for a price.
"After you think you're working for posterity, then you realize that you're working only for prosperity, and now you're happy to make a film more.", Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayon is located in the skin of the sevilla dance Tortola Valencia
A sevillan dancing will make a sevillan dance too.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, daughter of a catalan father (Florenço Tórtola Ferer) and a vibrant mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), born in the district of Triana, who lived in London with his family in three years.
It was a free and specialist dancer dancer.
She was a passionary life, a pioneer of women’s release, such as Isaac Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was buddhist, vegetarian and pleasant for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked the dance history in Europe of the two-governed warfare was fascinated Isabelle Bayon.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and this last proposed to interpretate the sevillan dancer Tortola Valencia, and that's been incredible."
According to the dance, "We do not try to tell him his life but to translate his way to think.
The titles of his dance made me think of the flamenco.
Thus, "the papillon dance" made me think of a Cuban popular dance and "the serpent dance" in some tanks.
His dance was sensitive, and they told me that my way to dance was identical to the jungle ", she claims.
The scene was made by two remarkable contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing again Isabela in one of his spectacles, as he had done "Open the door"; and that of Professor Matilde Coral, who was exceptionally wanting to cooperate with the one who was his student.
"Matilde transforms Tortola into a mature personality.
I am happy because she accepted playing a role in my work and that's honoring me. "
The scene was also made thanks to the musical composition and guitators of Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, Pulga and Moi de Morón, and the persecution of El Pájaro, as well as the violence of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of a actor, Juanfra Juárez, "when plays the role of the eternal companion of this kind of artists that were considered to be divine."
This work also tells, in a certain way, the life of this woman who has been shown in such far away places, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, but also in all Europe, as she was normally in London.
"I wanted to remember because I think that these women who have a great influence in their time and now no one knows and don't value their work," says Bayon.
The spectacle will start at 20:30 at Vega Lope Theatre
The publication of a recently married poet newspaper concludes the Triennat
The presentation of the first edition of a recently married Poet Journal in the Church of Saint Stephen's in New York, where John Ramón Jimenez married Zenobia in March 1916, was inscribed in the framework of the activities provided by the Ministry of the Cultural of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized in order to remember the fifth anniversary of the consent of the Nobel Literature Prize and their decades.
Thus, the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramon" arrived at its end with the revision of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum, and with the entitled exhibition "Joan Ramon Jimenez: This little light" which was inaugurated in May last month and which, after visiting in the various Indonesian provinces, goes to New York at the International Congress.
Similarly, the Ministry of the Cultural of Andandalousie acquired eight hundred exemplary of the "Journal of a recently married poet" edited by Peter Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the work of one of the most known andalous poets.
America less requested without Paul Newman
"After God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was part of it."
This phrase is of the actor Sally Field, who worked with him in "Assence of Malice", and illustrates well the hope of American cinema, and from all the Americas, face the shocking idea that Newman is no longer from this world.
He had to get a Oscar
He wasn't turning back since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
It was a hard cut for everyone.
"It was what a resent exceeds any expression, and now I lost a great friend," said Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to their existence."
Nobody was afraid to become ridicule or exagering.
One of the fathers of the cinema and patriarch is dead during a special dark period, where terrorists and bourgeois markets are afraid, the estimation of the Americans is very low and seeklessly dignity motives.
When the times are so hard and without reason for living, there is not the humans remain like admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He was incarnated for everyone a ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of lost and winned causes, such as the foundation for the anti-drought struggle created in the honour of his old age, following a overdose and the creation of his own bio-food mark.
This was a victory for a country who had sentenced to imposed themselves against a self-suicided food culture.
This expansive admiration vague balled Hollywood without taking attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, English Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another English, the oscarist Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman marked the sum of his carrière.
The bad boy came from Australia, Russell Crowe, counted Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He put the high bar to us", observed George Clooney, who is probably the only day that is trying to see the screen like Paul Newman: being very honest and with a serious and far-reaching private life.
It is not always easy or possible in the median jungle today.
But there is someone who trys, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married 50 years in Joanne Woodward, who was faithful even if the opportunities did not miss him to be.
"But why should I eat a hamburger out of my house, if I have a bippeck in my cold?" he used to swear.
On heaven, he is honourable to meet his girls with his fans on earth, something that is not so ordinary in America.
"For all the great roles he has interpreted, he has never been so proud as the husband's declared, the loving father, the grandfather's careful and philanthrop," he says.
Madrid in the 2016 Olympic Games Organization
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid could organize Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, could be achieved in 2016.
But I'm asking if we're ready.
If we take the example of the last course: we are not!
They call him the perfect course, but I think it was the worst course I never participated.
If they had taken into account all the errors occurred during the course, these would be the object of an eliminatory note.
But let us consider it in detail and from the beginning.
Errors start with the retreat of the dossards, which makes you unable to go forward.
This is not bad, but if they make you move this would be better than they give you everything (including the electronic puzzle for courses).
And well not
They did you go there only to take the dose (first error, move only for this) and (with a long wait file!), there was only the size 'S' for the maillot (second error, because I need a XL size)
In what world are we living?
Is it because of the crisis they decided to buy that small size maillots with less tissue and less sweet tissue?
Well, this is nothing about what happened the course day.
In addition to the fact that you need to go soon to remove the electronic puzzle, the waiting file is 15 minutes and, moreover, it is necessary to leave its pipe to two to the entry.
The waiting has been over 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible since 11.000 people are expected for these courses.
Since there was a long waiting file, the competitions started and we didn't have left our sack to two in the entry, although once done, the retreat was worse.
Furthermore, the rain accompanied the expectation of more than 40 minutes during which rebellions and shoes of the barac have occurred.
I believe that about 500 people will have the pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me, they will not even be in the classification with the exact time, because of the pocket they gave me who, I think, didn't mark the start correctly.
Of course, if they asked me to quote an example of perfect course, this would not be the idea.
So I think we can always dream to become the guest city for the J.O. 2016.
Microsoft searches for a receptionist (virtual)
A new system of recognition of image and interaction, a type of Artic Intelligence has little intelligence but is able to fulfill some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a ship to move in the business camp) in response to what was requested during a conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of forms and vises, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are, which are - including remembering what posts they are - and listening and listening to the key words of their conversations.
But also group them according to grouping groups
In the presentation video, the receiptist detects a third person, but she understands that it is not belonging to the group who is talking to her and that it is not part of the company.
She asked her if she's here to visit someone and she tells her that she will answer in a few seconds.
All this without blue screen.
It's impressive.
But of course this represents the future.
Now the company has other things that focus on, for example, on the next version of its operational system, Windows.
This week was spoken more than a Microsoft strategic change.
Windows 7 will be lighter and it will no longer have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers were sold with the indispensable instead of unnecessary applications, they would be five times faster.
This represents a discovery because Microsoft, after version, has not stopped adding functions and "extra" to Windows.
Strategy change is welcome.
Microsoft is right, his operational system lost importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who joined the theory that Google Chrome is the first start from Google to make Windows competition.
Many people just stressed that an Internet browser is not an operational system.
The operational system will always be necessary because it is the essential basis for understanding the computer and software.
It takes the same function as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your beauty mother.
That's true.
It will never disappear but it must be seen the "more" of the operational system not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Balmer confirmed this idea.
People have less attention to the operational system but more to the Internet browser.
Only the computer is moved to turn Firefox, Explorer or Chrome, and people every day take more time to navigate on the Internet than to walk windows.
Who serves half of the applications provided with the system?
Who can at least.
And Windows 7 should contain less applications, much less than Vista.
Small, months composed, less complex.
For the moment, Microsoft is more interested in starting its own online services so that they eventually become an alternative in Google.
They are desperately needed of this, in fact, and I show you an example.
The photo presented in this article was taken at the beginning of this month in one of the rest rooms reserved for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the drink distributor, one shows their request to use their own search tool - "That search. Our future."
In 2006, a study concluded that 66 per cent of Microsoft employees used Google to search for Internet information.
Last week a delay occurred in the new Windows Mobile version 7.
It will not be out at the beginning of 2009, but to the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will surely try to start at the same time Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, seems to be more like a computer.
But Android's launch is late and iPhone is already on the market, that will cost them.
The Fabuleux Marcel
Paul Picasso was the insect on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio, in the blood Diamant of Edward Zwick, as Al Pacino in the Parrain of Francis Ford Coppola and is part of the holding of the muscle gays' association.
And if we put down all his appearances, we could also cite this moustachu coast that highlighted weight in a ambulant surrounding.
It's not just a simple maillot of men's body in cotton, smell and without sweet.
The English calls "tank" but the Fabulous Marcel of Brussels is different from all others.
First, by his flamboyant name - even though he is known under the name of Marcel ' - who has to see with the sport because he takes the name, according to the legend, of the Marcel Cerdan boxer, a lovers of the song Edith Piaf.
Marcel is differentiated by others by its excellent coton, by its unilateral cut, by its distinctive logo and by the small Belgian (a precisely recognisable) that the most known body maillots are in the coast.
But attention, since the Belgian brand does not only produce top tanks.
But it also produces sweat-shirt, retreat boxers, boxers in cachet, cotton pants, babys, mini-shorts...
Apartments designed for the comfort of sub-vite.
Even if it's harmful to bring them only as sub-vites.
They're too charm.
"I want to become a young mother, the candidate doesn't worry."
His great likeness with his sister did not prevent him to develop his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Curuz sisters currently take very seriously their new activity in mode.
According to Monica, they're not only beautiful and famous girls who provide their name.
She was present to the promotion that the Mango mark made in Paris at its new social seat, but also to present the most important prices of the mode than the Spanish house sponsoris.
Monica is warm and horrible.
Tell us what you're doing to Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have even created for Mango for the new winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards and at the dinner of the Opera in the honor of Valentino.
A very intense day, but at the same time, exciting, we are waiting.
What is based on your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The cinema of the 50s and 60s sweet us, and we inspire it much for our collections.
I like to swim in the city and observe the women to see how they are shooted, how they combine their clothes, I often do it.
Dancing, actor and designer, you're a very polyvalent woman, aren't you?
I think that I am, but finally everything comes together, and these activities have a lot of common things.
Since I was all the small clothes I enjoyed; I wanted to go home my grandmother to watch in the shore of my twin and to see his clothes.
It was great, almost better than go to the attractions park.
Then, when I became dance, I always tried to take care of my way to hide me.
The dancers love to spend for courses and tests, to look at it and feel good.
And in the role of the actor, when you smell your clothes is at this time you really put you into the skin of personality.
On the other hand, it's all connected.
You haven't been 30 years ago, have it been hard for you?
Not all.
I feel better than ever, my 30-year-old years are joyful.
I think that the woman is older, has more experience and saved life with less problems.
Biological clock doesn't make me afraid.
I've done everything I wanted to do from all small and this gave me a lot of internal happiness.
So, do you think you're going to become a mother?
Of course, I want to become a mother because my body asked me and, moreover, I want to become a young mother; I don't want to lose this.
As regards the candidate, I don't worry about it.
What I'll do is to give much happiness to my son and to remove him with a lot of love.
Let's go to the cinema, you're waiting for the different films you turned out last year.
That's true. I've got them out.
I am a woman out of the theatre, I'm very inquired and worried, I would like to have everything now, but of course it's not possible.
I hate the films 'The last hour' and 'Search for the Tumba of Christ'.
To see what you'll think...
A few days ago you started on the passenger with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't do that!
I'm not cut on the pastle to make the mannequin.
Always, Naomi Campbell called me, I know it since a bad time, to invite me to participate in London in a well-being deficit for his association to support women and clothes that we showed - I showed two clothes of our created collection for Mango - were sold in shops to collect money for the Naomi NGO.
The people that Naomi is a person in the heart tend.
They say so much about her, I know her, many things are not true.
Moreover, this so good side of Naomi is fascinating me.
She asked me to shoot me for so nice reason, but if she asked me to get out of it, I would even do it.
The importance is to make life better to women in the third world.
Flight-alcohol recipients must install the alcohol system
The Minister of Interior wants that the driver who has more than three administrative sanctions for alcohol has to install in its vehicle a system that prevents the driving vehicle starting, or if it does not suffice.
The initiative was already announced in June last month and is now appearing in the report of the Minister of State where this initiative is considered as a pilot project that will take one year.
Its purpose is reintegration of the driver by proposing routine re-education courses.
The Minister of Road Safety, but also the Directorate-General of Road Safety and the Institute of Technology for Car Safety, will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of the automobilists arrested to have conducted more than once again, the car reiterates.
Alcolock would avoid this because it is a vehicle-scale system which measures the alcohol rate in the helium and prevents starting the vehicle if the driver does not suffer before; or if the driver's alcohol rate is higher than the authorised.
The cost of the driver is more than 1.000 euros and is at the charge of the driver.
In this regard, a study carried out in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced up to 65 per cent of crimes during the first installation year.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save 115 people every year.
This measure only requires administrative sanctions for two reasons: to face these behaviors before they turn into criminal offences.
And facilitate its implementation, since the legal reform can be made by ordinary ways, but the reform made by criminal ways requires a reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in no trade form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have an experimental title.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputy will vote a initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party that proposes to install this system in school bus as it was done in France.
In Mexico without peep-toes
At 17.40 p.m., the Spanish aircraft flight in which the Princess of Asturies traveled to the President of the Benito Juárez of Mexico.
The sun was on the floor of sleeping, but his radios were still forced to put the hand in a visa guiding to see the king couple down from the flight.
Instead of the scale, the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours ago, I had asked on the street, the taxi driver, if he knew that the Spanish princes visited the city to complete their official travel.
- Oh, well, we can't go to the airport to take customers at this time... are you here or then...?
- No, no, sir, I'm Spanish, but I lived here two years thinking.
- Oh, very well...
But Mexico’s press knows who are the Princes of the Asturies and knows the importance of the travel.
They are several to wait in the Hangar airport near the red mass and at a military rank of 27 marine soldiers.
The Prince is smiling and smiling of sea blue, the princess, when she, with the hairs in the wind, was very shocked and does not take its usual 'pep-to'; perhaps they had said to him that a prayer was threatened.
They take a short stop at photos before they pass into the room where the official court is waiting for them.
At the door of the hotel where they hire, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a journalist of the Mexican television is waiting for them.
The most prestigious price of mode
There is certainly no more suitable place in the world to present a mode price that Paris and certainly there is no extraordinary and good living designer than Valentino.
Mango has come to present the second edition of the Boton-Mango Fashion Awards to strengthen the international image of the new talents of the mode.
The winner will be rewarded by a price of EUR 300,000.
Since then Sandrina Fasoli, Belgium winner of the first edition, looked at his models in the vitrine of Mango at 54 boulevard Housesmann in Paris, and she was almost emotional.
Indeed, it is the second largest winter of the brand in Europe that has come to be inaugured with 1.335 meters of surface.
The first boat is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the Valentino Style, President of the Concourse Jury, have found us in a luxury dinner at the officer Garnier of Paris.
With the nearest table of the extraordinary family Chagals, the presidential table prepared by Mango, looked more spectacular.
By driving on the heart and doing a bad rich heart, because of the recent death of his brother, Nati took up a clothes of Mango and some of the sweets of ELAH, which cut the sweet, and arms above, arms down with her son Luis - a beautiful man of almost two meters of high – she accompanied Valentino to his dinner prepared in his honor.
Andik, Mango's owner, a man's galant, as well as the Rotchil Baron, finished the evening without vessel because they had prepared them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who was presented in the store with a pantalone and a chemise – of his own collection - and who was metamorfosed to dinner with a long sexy and dark roof, was excited when during the night visit of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the room of repetitions of the ballets and remembering the older time, she took one of the bars and made the gesture of a larger.
Ines Sastre was not left for the visit of the palace's dependences, but she showed us before on her portable phones of his son's photos.
On the next morning, we were glad to see Olivier Martinez – another beautiful man who moves in moto – and John Travolta, who came to the Paris intercontinental hotel, with his draps, his servants, and asked for the prealable, that there are no dogs in his room.
Stars under the star of Paris.
Oh, there, it's life.
1001, the number of anti-stress
There are only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and the frustration of daily life.
And to cross all things, they're all repertoried in a book that will bring relax to the libraries on September 30.
The wave-more attracts us almost when he sounds every morning at 7 a.m., but it is worse when we think about the activity rythm we imply the current life.
The office is a synonym of tension and the computer of pains on the doses.
The stress represents the evil of the 21th century.
But there is no two methods for combating daily fatigue and the problems related to the work world.
But 1001, no more no one or less.
In addition to yoga positions, classic massage or 'spa' treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers on pages of a book a 'menu' of methods adapted to the guest and at each time.
The anti-stress work is referred to as '1001 ways to defeat and will arrive in the libraries directly from the editor Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to get tranquility in places such as work or through personal relationships, this is a man's faith.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or income 100% of natural income that help you defeat.
If adrenaline is not short in your veins to restore the balance of your body and if stress has become a problem, it is time to sit in the canape, deconnect his mind and focus on reading.
Speaking and sleeping
Some kids speak for night.
I don't relate to those who wake up well by telling us something happened before, but to the children speaking during their sleep.
The first time this happens, it can surprise you, but in fact, it is not important.
It's a blessed alteration of the sleep that is called sleep.
It is pretty frequent, especially in children and adolescents.
It's sure there's more than one who speaks for the night.
This phenomenon may appear very spoundly (only in life, for example, associated with a strong fever episode), or more periodicly (all days, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child is no longer remembered.
There is no unique cause that determines its appearance
They are often associated with other sleep alterations such as sleeves, night terraces, night eurcesies (sweet pipe) or sombulism, but it is not always the case.
As we have said before, they can also be associated with very strong fever, stress situations or overwhelming situations.
In any way, it's a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it produces is also very variable.
It may be talking with a small quiet voice, with isolated words, murmurs or instead with crys, crys, long talks ...
In the case of somniloquia becomes very frequent, it would be judicious to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check whether there is a problem that causes much anxiety and to obtain an explanation to this problem.
We said that it is a blessed alteration, that is why there is no treatment, except if it is associated with another sleep alteration that can be treated (e.g., if it is linked to a sleep or to stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to smell the child before sleeping.
Search for peaceful games and avoid television programs or series that are more or less violent.
With very nervous children and who have the pain to defeat, relaxing techniques can be used to help them relaxing internally.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As the dreams appear to try to stay calm.
Remember that they are unforgettable for the child and that next morning he will not remember what happened.
Useful Councils
Don't wake him.
It's unnecessary because he's unconscious and you'd wake him up.
Even if he's talking, he's there and he's staying there.
Remember that if it is very awesome several times, it is advised to consult a doctor or to check what causes such anxiety in the child.
If you understand what it says (what is not usual), do not have the attempt to ask him to get information.
You won't get anything, because when you sleep, he's not aware that you can organize his thought.
Moreover, you will hear what he says, but you won't know what it's in dream, taking attention to how you will interpretate the information and the conclusions you're taking it.
Don't ever tell the child you can ask him for the night to know his secrets.
Don't even smile.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
Finally, don't worry, it's nothing very bad, it's a episode that takes only a few minutes.
Illeeuser... final
Hellaeusern finally found the way of the victory on his terrain after a long period of discount.
Without making a great match, the Yellows and Blacks created the largest opportunity and successfully transformed one for the winning of the match.
The rhythm was not very supported during the meeting where the attackers were ill to express.
After a first trial of the visitor Kaffmann, who was struggling on a loose tipper, Illhaeusern was going to take slightly the ascendant and tour Funterfick from far, then with Hirn above, Romein of the foot or Debold came to shoot the defence of hamemary.
On the face, it was blocked on the ground and just left Riahi's remoting at the point of the attack.
The beginning of the second mid-time would be decisive with the first two occasions signed Riahi and Temporale for Makamary, and soon after the opening of the scene for the Illusionians by Marais, well positioned to recovered a ball retreated on a first attempt of Debold (53e).
But Ilyousiens will not save his long happiness and will be obliged to get the clothes a twenty-five minutes later and thus leave his coachers in numerical inferry.
But thenemarie will not be able to benefit and will not pose great problems to a Illusian Onze who just returned a little to "compact" his defence, struck in all the last seconds of game where, after a big cafouling, the ball passed very close to the cross.
Sarkozy meeting fishermen in anger
Before you go to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a distance through Britain.
In the demonstration of fishermen who have strongly endured the access of several bretton and standard ports, the President of the Republic decided to make themselves on Tuesday morning at the port of Guilvinec in Finland to meet their representatives.
They promised to welcome it "in a constructive spirit" and hope that it will "come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that took place at the same time as a general assembly of the "Crise Committee" established by the Breton Fishermen to obtain measures faced by gas prices, which reached a record of more than 1,14 EUR per medium litre.
According to David Martinon's speaking door, "the President will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their enterprises find competitiveness and to ensure the conditions of marine employment and repayment".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to be firm by fishermen.
On Wednesday morning, they carried out scargots in Morbian and Calvados, attending shoes nearly 10 km.
Quiberon's funeral port was also blocked, but the connections to Belle Island were not stopped.
A filter barge was run on the presby island of Quiberon.
The mariners have already shown their determination in brushing since the ears, powders and palettes before the fuel deposits of the Brest ports, and Lorient, while manifestations were turned into Concarneau or Saint-Briuc.
The movement was promoted to other ports of the Atlantic and Manche Façade, such as the Olonne Sables, in Vendée, where the chaluiers remained at quai, or Havre, where a twenty-five boats blocked the movements of trade ships.
The fishermen of La Turball and Crossic, in Loire-Atlantic Loire, stopped the block of the important Donges total refrigerator.
Those of Boulogne-Su-Mer decided to wait for the Meeting meeting to decide on possible action.
In Guilvinec, the "Crise Committee" must actually decide on marchs to give the movement and its participation to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some braton fishermen do not want to be represented by responsible members of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support their movement.
"The Grève will continue" because "the fishermen will not leave anything" and "do not want to move to Paris", says Liliane Cariou, President of Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay gas taxes, currently pay about 50 centimeters per litre, but believe that a ship’s rentability steel is only reached with a gas less than EUR 0.30.

AIG would consider slighting more than 15% of its assets
The American Insurer International Group, which the United States Monetary Authorities have reported, considers to give more than 15 per cent of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion that have been made up, according to the Dominical Financial Times edition.

By 228 votes against and 205, representatives refused the secretariat to the Treasury Henry Paulson the means he asked.
About two Republicns on three have rejected its plan.
"It's a bad signal sent to the market, which sees the Congress unable to adopt a plan", said Lindsey Piegza, FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market was counted on this plan," she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days is "trop late".
"If the project is effectively Moribond (...) then the relaxation will be passed rapidly to the Fed (American Central Bank, ndlr) and to other central banks to manage the crisis, which would remain more credit conditions", warned Brian Bethune, Economist Chief of Global Insight.
And more emphasising the emergency feeling, "every day that passs the fall of a financial institution" in the United States stressed Ms. Piegza.

Obama, winner at the first television point
In the first debat of Thursday between the two candidates at the White House, one other succeeded to know who, from John McCain or Barack Obama, brought it.
Without surprise, the QG of Republic and Democratic campaigns proclaimed their own victory in this television, which had been followed by a third of the United States families.
The political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although honourable, has not been sufficiently "brilling" to allow him to cut his down in the reviews for five weeks of the presidentials.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion survey was published in Saturday, granted an advance in five points in Obama (49 per cent against 44 per cent in McCain), considers that this is the democracy who took off the game's ring.
Indecisive electors, who are those accounting, Obama was winning for 39 per cent of the sons, while 25 per cent of them granted the victory in McCain, according to a CBS survey.
Obama should be able to confirm his progress on Thursday with the expected performance of his colleague, Joseph Biden, during the first and unique public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake of the sub-sumer.
She has good instincts, but Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The seventh-year McCain had stopped putting its insufficient experience in the field of foreign policy, while stressing the "nivelness" of his opposite on these issues, which were in the heart of this first face.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand... Have he accused several times.
"I don't believe that Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary to be President," he also assured.
A marteled attack angle since yesterday in the Republican television advertisements.
Obama stressed him that he represented the future.
Without demonstrating, he has shown himself conscious and accurate.
He made his ability to take the good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain has not yet understood, while Obama, if," retorned, this weekend, a democratic spot reproaching the Republicn to have not taken all the measure of the impact of the crisis on the "American Street".
"When the twenty-twenty-five minutes of discussion, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you, he declared Obama, yesterday, before 200,000 people gathered for a election meeting in North Caroline under a swimming rain.
It has not even declared the words "medion" or "train"." The financial deroute clearly benefits Obama, which is considered by the Americans as the most to save the economy on the front of the precipice.
"The next week could be a decisive tournant," estimated the influenced senator Charles Schumer, democratic.
The Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, an elder of the Clinton administration, compared the "economic instincts" of Obama to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidate, the current debate is "the end of eight years of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reaffirming that even the taxes of 95 per cent of the Americans would be reduced, despite Wall Street's summers, the Senator also stated that the achievement of a potential energy independence of the country by promoting renewable energy was the first priority, with the establishment of a sanitary insurance system.
McCain wanted to build a park of 45 nuclear centrals from 2030.
On the other hand, the two candidates were subjected to the financial relief plan of $700 billion ($470 billion) adopted last night by the Congress and extremely impunity.
A Minsk, "Have you noticed that there was a choice, you?"
Youth and opposites expressed on the main place of the Belarus capital to reject the results of legislatives.
Some hundreds of Belarus meetings were held on Monday after the closure of the vote offices on the central place of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislatives.
While no result was yet announced, many young people had come to demonstrate the power of President Alexandre Lokkachenko: "the dictator, dismission."
Some say they didn't even have voted, "To what good, because they will do what they want from my voice," said a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that made good figures to foreign observers in order to re-interview the language with the European Union is ready to make a democratic turning.
The sanctions, including the prohibition of visa for 40 Belarus leaders and the gele of certain possessions, could be taken if these elections were considered by the observers.
They have not been according to the opposition.
"We were held away from the electoral committees and our observers were not able to participate in the depopulation", deplored Iouri Potemkine, the parliament of the Union of the Democratic Forces, a hestergy grouping of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmic change, stressed by Alexandre Milinkievitch, the former candidate of the opposition to the President of 2006, and the head of the Deep Movement, because the importance is that the voice is accounting for, and in us, is the executive power.
If Members of the opposition enter the Parliament, they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their income to Parliament may mean television space, meetings in the regions and law proposals."
The opposition should therefore be entered into the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union must be engaged.
Because if our economy, which is slightly detained in Russia, is in crisis, and we do not reform, we can become a Russian Protectory.
Or we want to be independent."
The opposition is afraid that the United Nations for Security and Cooperation in Europe that has followed the election process does not recognize the validity of the election.
It stressed that the participation figures are too high, and that the generalization of the vote by advance (26 per cent of the elections in Minsk) opened the vote to all manipulations.
"Do you notice that there was a election, you? asked the Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the vote offices.
And there will be at least five Members of the Parliament's opposition, those who agree the best to the power."
The silence of the night comes on October's place.
In the television, President Loukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Committee welcomed their success.
The Interview - The Blood Safely Returned
Hema-Québec celebrated last 10th anniversary of his foundation, and his President, Dr. Francine Decary, had reason to rejoice, because Hema-Québec was one of the most secure and effective blood providers of the world.
And in particular, he recognised the public's trust that was seriously shocked by the blood scandale contaminated in the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know, national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Cross Transfusion Service have been contaminated by the virus of acquired immunodeficiency (VIH) and Hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
The Government of Canada established a public survey in February 1994, chaired by the Judge Horace Crever, which aimed to make light on the circumstances leading to such a tragedy, and to make recommendations so that such disaster would not be reproduced.
While the judge Krever was late to put his report, some provinces then set up a committee aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the General Committee completed this mandate.
Following the Genelinau and Krever reports, two suppliers were established in Canada: Hema-Québec to serve the Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to provide all other provinces and the two territories.
" In 1998, when Hema-Québec started its activities, 38 per cent of the people still trusted in the blood system in Quebec, Dr. Decary was reminded.
The situation was unfortunate.
In efforts to improve the safety of blood and work on the field during the years that have followed, we have resolved the public', she said to be proud that in the beginning of 2008, about 94 per cent of the Quebecose population had now confidence in Hema-Québec.
But Dr. Decary is heading that "the trust is something of extremely fragile."
Since its creation, on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec applied the precaution principle.
At this time, there were many cases of human form of fool vessel disease in Europe, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which has been told to have been strong since its foundation in 1998.
"And we didn't know if this disease could be transmised by blood.
It was then supported by one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Genelinau reports that, when it is not known and that a serious disease can be deleted, the disease of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain inevitablely conducting death, is set out of exclusion measures.
Thus, in April 1999, the blood of persons who lived over a month in the United Kingdom was rejected since 1980.
But, a few years ago, it has been shown out of any doubt that this disease is transmised by blood.
This episode showed us so that the principle of cautiousness that was applied had a sense."
In 1999, a lot more sensitive HIV detection technique appeared in the market: the nuclear acid tests (TAN) which allows to detect directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus itself and not the anticorps against the virus, where tests were used until worth.
TANs have allowed to recover the mutta period, which extends between the time that the person has been infected and the one where the first virus can be detected in the blood by our technicians, explains the specialist.
This period was reduced at a period lower than one week.
Thus, the risk of some donors are infected without knowing and not to detect them.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through blood transfusion.
Today, a person of 12 million shortly is the risk of receiving HIV contaminated.
"In other words, it means that 12 million blood products should be distributed before someone is infected by HIV.
As Hema-Québec distributes each year between 4000,000 and 500 000 blood products, this will take more than 24 years before HIV transmission was taken by a blood product.
I believe that today there can be a feeling of receiving or providing blood transfusion to recover health," states Hema-Québec's head.
" Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know what's going to be pathogenic in the system.
Not later than the last year occurred on the island of the Reunion, the Chikungunya virus, which is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
The Dr. Decary must continue to be monitored before emphasising that Hema-Québec must also provide sufficient supply.
"The needs are increased because the population is older.
Anticanceral treatments are more aggressive, patients often need reloading in red globules or plaquettes.
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the network of blood donors who are not grouping in meanly only 3% of the Quebecois admissible to the gift of blood."
Any person in health, aged 18 and more responding to the admissibility criteria may even give blood every 56 days, or six times per year.
In the meantime, 14 per cent of the people proposing their blood are not accepted because they are reached from AIDS or Malaria, for example, and if they lived in a country where the poorism is disadvantaged, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"Before these 3 per cent, we are coming to maintain an inventory that responds to the hospital needs.
The punishment is very rare.
But members of this donor network must be renewed as they are old and can't give their blood anymore.
But it is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but especially to stop them and to encourage them to become regular donors.
Today's life is so excited, it is rarely found the time to pass an hour to give his blood", says Francine Decary.
With a annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec provides not only blood products but also human tissue, including ossed tissue, heart valves, ocular globes and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burned.
These tissues are analyzed, transformed and congeled before being put in Hema-Québec, which also managed the only public bank of cordon blood in Quebec.
The ombilical cordon that was considered as a biomedic dechet reserves a rich blood in soft cells that could serve to treat serious diseases, such as leucemia.
"On a few weeks ago, our Millennium Blood Search Search, and it is expected to preserve more than thousand per year.
The Dr Decary, which describes this curdon blood leapage program as very popular, should start to be proposed for grains at the beginning of the next year.
"Mothers are disappointed to have access to it", because Hema-Québec has no way to propose this complex and cost-building program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - Impact in half-final
The Montreal Impact was qualified for the half-final round of the USL's first eliminatory series, through a victory of 3-1-4-3 to the total of the objectives, at the second and decisive match of the final series at the Saputo Stade.
The terrain environment Antonio Ribeiro marked the decisive goal at the 90th minute of game.
After a first half without goal of one side as well as the other, the field environment David Testo and Rocco Plancentino marked the other files of Montrealaise training.
Roger Levesque was the only one to join Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Remember that during the first match of the return series, on Thursday, the Impact had a defect of 2-1 at Starfire Complex, Tukwila, in Seattle's bathroom.
The Impact will measure the Vancouver Whitecaps in half-final.
The Thunder composed a 3-1 deficit in the return game for importer 4-3, but the Whitecaps have also accessed to half-final round 5-4 to the total of the targets.
Impact should face the Whitecaps Tuesday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In bref - But victory of Kovalev
The three number one of Canadians is ready to enter the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn has named the attack in a winning of 3-2 of the Canadian Barriers to the Panthers of the Florida, last night, at the Central Bell.
Costitsyn, the first star of the meeting, marked a goal, Plekanec loved two aids, and Kovalev collected a password in this wine, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preparatory matches.
Kovalev gave the victory in marking the only purpose of the fusil.
"I'm not still ready, welcomed Russia.
I need another game to feel like it."
"He tried too much to do in the first period, noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the end of the match.
He's got a beautiful sweet."
Season on the North
The Prime Minister does not exclude elections before the end of the year
As soon as the General Council of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest came to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Boldu ( left), tried to elect himself at the occasion of today's partial election.
"Repower the limits of our last large Northern border": this is the long-term environment that Jean Charest has presented with visual strength, while staying in the large lines, in the end of the General Council of the Quebec Liberal Party, Levis, last night.
Then, during his speech, Moulin was designed with images.
They turned on a ball, on three large screens, of spectacular clays of hydroelectric bars, mineral exploitation, from Quebec saw by "Google Maps", cards, etc.
Great means as in election period.
In press point, the Prime Minister also refused to exclude that the elections of this autom, even if he noted that his time was very tasked.
The "North Plan" is the fourth bread of a "vision" which the Prime Minister intends to have for Quebec, the of a 'new economic space', which includes a manual agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Bearing in mind mentioned in the recent discussions of the first minister, the opening of the Northern Territories in the 49th parallele had never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the first minister was forced to explain why the North was "a joy to the large potential", but did not give the end, investment amounts, nor specific priority in future projects.
Another few advents of what could be developed more: hydroelectricity, forest, but especially the mini-sector, covered by the growth of emerging countries and the rebuilding of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platin, or, gold, fer, titan, and even diamant", according to Mr. Charest's unuming.
This "territory two times big as France", "he's home to us, it's in Quebec.
Not only is our home, but it's in us," he emphasized, as to show that he requested a national founder.
The Quebec has built a lot in his relationship with the North, he stressed: the street to gold in Abitibi, the Quebecoise engineering, the Baie James Bay.
"It's to us, it's our future," he added, after having made a theatrical break to emphasize the building card behind him.
The North, 70% of the Québeco territory, includes a part of the Labrador which the Quebec has always returned, has specified the first minister at the press point.
"This is a traditional position that all governments reiterate.
There is a border line on which there is no long time of order and, when the opportunity is presented, I reiterate this position on behalf of the Government," said it.
On the other hand, "with climate changes, our Northern vision should be remedy", he stated by talking about the past of the Northwest, which will open the whole year because of the source of glass.
In this new geopolitical context, the first minister believes that the territory is a duty.
And the inhabitants of the territory, the United Nations Prime and the Inuits?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec Government would be very careful to them and that the project would benefit them, in particular for youth.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Peter Corbeil and Michel Léturneau (ancient deputy of Ungava), have already conducted consultations with a thirty-first community.
An inter-terminist committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has taken place to work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a great meeting, "not necessarily a Summit", but a moment in which "common vision will be given".
Northern development would also be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "concerned, ordered and respectful for the environment", he promised.
Jean Charest describes this "vision" as continued with the of the first liberal ministers who previously made it.
"If the liberals before us, we thought otherwise to transform the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was also one of the recursive themes of the weekend, which took place on Thursday by a large cocktail to emphasize the 50th anniversary of John Leage's arrival to the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposed to rebaptize the Central Beauharnois in Barrage Adelard-Godbout.
"De Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, in Leage that made the peaceful revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Bourssa, who made the Baie James, our party forced the future," said Jean Charest.
In press point, he called another reference, conservator of that, the "Roads to the North" program of John Diefenbaker, the first minister of 1957 to 1963.
Mr. Charest stressed that its service was planned for 2012 by addressing the Eastman1a-Ruper hydro-electric band project.
"It remains among us, but I think it's there", he trusted his warriors, suspicious applauses at their home.
Indeed, the first minister, who said in April that there was no election in 2008, and certainly not in 2009, did not miss the possibility of delaying the autom, as the law allows it.
He stressed that his timeline is, however, filled with a mission of the Federation Board in China and a sum of Quebec-New York.
The General Council of the weekend has provided to the Liberal Head a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" which were passed as a letter to the post: PLQ, in particular, claims the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also wished to appoint the Québec members of the Council of Radiodiffusion and Canadian Telecommunications and have a veto right to make decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, the large lines of the North Plan were welcomed with scepticism.
Pauline Marois, Chief of Criminality, emphasized the North-du-Québec Development Policy that the Landry Government was launched in 2001.
According to it, the Liberal Government, coming to the power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If he did it, "we would be more advanced today," Mrs. Marois commented on the sides of his candidate in Jean-Talon (scrrutin today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ said to support the adoption of a North Plan by the Government.
"But what we wish is that it's not just a spectacle," commented the leader Sebastien Proulx, in replacement of Mario Dumont, who returns from holidays today.
Letters - A Destroyed country
This was Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (O Iran) in the Harper Office, which allowed the last summer to say Louise Arbour that she was a "honour" for Canada.
To do so the opposite on this woman who has conducted an instant fight for justice and who gives us all our admiration so long as to the extent of the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper himself.
We are at the front of a government who is the only one, among all Western countries involved, to have not repatriated his citizen in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take account of the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager at the time of the facts that his reproached.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, renews his word and lets an unhumany child-solated child grow.
The only one who has sent it to a parodi of justice to assess the guilty of the accused.
Remember, for memories, that UNICEF, International Amnisty and the Canada Barreau Association, in particular, calls for the repatriation of Omar Khadr to benefit from a fair process in Canada.
This is the same government who closes the eyes of torture: it is unlikely that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, uncertainly ever after such years of exploitation.
It is not yet understood, but we are present at this moment at an incredibly enormous extermination of our rights, freedom and democracy, the word that Harper stops to brand and sounds so credible in his mouth.
This is the time where no morality is anymore: it can be reduced, tortured, arbitraryly imprisoned by a Canadian citizen according to the right desire of a government leader to this minority (which will be after October 14...).
Many electors believe that they will find the salvation in a party who preachs the Vertue, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has rejected what our country's reputation and dignity.
The horrible, Mr. Toews, is here in this resignation and not any other.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's oral talks
In its edition of 17 September, Le Devoir published a letter by Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President of the Canadian Mineral Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logical, it claims that the largest aurical company in the world has attempted to continue to diffuse six million against three authors and a small edition house without it to start a "transparent public debate".
If the judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of persecution, but the law.
Without surprise, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr Garver.
Because, for Barrick Gold, would it be the best way to conduct a public debate to the ruin whose oses support a contrary position?
Unlike the result of the proceedings, the authors and editors of the Black Canada book will have to cost considerable uses to prepare their defence and fight, very inequalious weapons, against a army of lawyers supported by the pockets almost without the mine.
The tactic, in these inequalities fights, is also often to destroy defenders in order to impose a regulation to the friend who will strike the opposition more to shoot anyone again on the question.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is before the public view that she had had to present its vision of facts.
In contrast to what is done in many countries where Barrick Gold works, the debates in Canada are normally through the exchange of ideas and not on matrakes.
It was therefore enough to open its books, documents and to establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent research teams that would be able to make light on this issue.
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust in the public opinion and rejects the demands and letters of support to Black Canada's authors.
Maybe Mr. Garver could explain how he can both ask for a "public" debate by mispressing the opinions of the same public?
In the world of the Vice-President, it seems that this word just designates the fatly paid lawyers and not all the Canadians; this is an extreme view of the concept.
In democracy, even delegators have the right to say.
What you don't understand - or does not want to understand - Barrick Gold, is that the public who supports the authors and editors of Black Canada does it first because he rejects the brutal way of mining.
This public is ready to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not in the context of what several people see as a continue-baillon (for the "public debate", Barrick Gold has also been put to the end of the introduction of Black Canada's authors in order to stop the use of this term...).
Besides the real talk of Mr. Garver, the continued Barrick Gold is a direct attack against the freedom of university research and the search of truth, essential to all democratic society.
It is never in block the right to quote of credible sources and the debate on facts and interpretations, which represent even the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss the subjects of the world's rich enterprises in a country such as Canada, under the lack of repeated continuations, who can do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could do it according to the scientific standards used by the Black Canada authors.
She has a right to reply.
The university environment, in which we belong, has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and to solve conflicts.
The continued decreased by Barrick Gold clearly shows that, in contrast with what it claims, it has no wish to have a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to establish devices to limit such a kind of abuse progress.
Wall Street Saving Operation - Democrats and Republicans hear
Bush Administration and Congress' File Chiefs, both republic and democrats, finally arrived at an agreement on the largest economic saving plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the United States $700 billion plan to strike the financial crisis that Wall Street has been slaughtered for months must still be completed by the two Congress rooms.
It includes a better control by the elections of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of the public money undertaken, new provisions to contain the number of houses entitled to payment standards, as well as a right to view payments paid to securities leaders.
The United States Secretariat in Tresor, Henry Paulson, President of the Chamber of Representatives, and the Republican representative at the negotiations table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after the midday, at the end of a two-day negotiation marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an effective agreement on markets", said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
"That was done in order to open the real economy and the normal Americans of the current crisis in Wall Street," explained the Democracy.
"It's the fundamental point: if we do not do this, the traumaism, the chaos and the distress on the daily life of the Americans will be extensive," said the Republicn Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had turned to the sprint over the last hours by fear of the effect that would cause a new failure on the humor of investors.
The limited time we agreed was the opening of the markets this morning.
Against the negotiations, the two candidates at the American presidential election had shown themselves instead favorable to the intention, but it was unless they expressed their misconsciousness that it was obliged to reach this extremeness.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama has assigned some provisions to the agreement, including the aim of allowing owners to maintain their home and the salary of leaders of the State's leaders.
"When the contributors are requested to take extraordinary measures because of the inresponsiveness of some, there is no pleasing.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the waves of the American television.
Questioned on a other chain to know if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republicn adversary John McCain said, "I would like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The big lines I've read [monster] that this is something we all have to divide and with which we're going to be able to advance.
The option to do nothing is just not acceptable," he said.
The plan of 700 billion is aimed at saving with the money of the contributions to the suspicious, risk-active and inconvenible credits of the American financial institutions.
After 14 months of a crisis deployed by the elimination of a real estate, which first led to the extinction of hypothetical risk credits (subpressed) before extending to other more broader forms of credit titles (PCA) and decrease on liquidity helmets and the deficiency of banks and financial institutions.
It's a group of Republican elections that had made the first start project last week.
It is believed to be out of this impasse since democratics accepted that some "toxic" assets of difficulty companies are only assured by the government, rather than purchase.
To arronize the Angles for everyone in the Congress, it has also been added that if the government had to take loss for five years with this programme, it could create new taxes to help it restore it.
The new plan prescribes the payment of a first trace of 250 billion to which 100 billion more will be added if the President is required by the judge.
The payment of 350 other billion should be completed by another vote of the Congress.
In exchange of his help, Washington will receive participations in the securities enterprises that will be divided into the profits and that it will be able to return when the tournment is passed.
The Federal Government will have the possibility to delay the income procedures concerning housing attached to the income provided by this plan, as well as to establish limits to payment and department compensations paid to the leaders of the affected enterprises.
The architects of the plan would like to see the vote of the Chamber of Representatives since now, and to the Senate Mercedes.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet sure that their plan will be green.
They have continued to vote on this project, both in the Republicn and democratic camp, last night.
"It is clearly Washington doesn't hear you," said the Republic of Scott Garrett, a member of the Chamber's Finance Committee, to the address of his electors.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yeah, there are solutions.
But not that is to benefit contributions."
An animator of a small group at the Congress on behalf of the "the Skeptics Cooks", the Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presents things otherwise, but comes to the same conclusion.
" Four hundreds of major economic teachers, including three Nobel Prize, have written us to say: We are asked to not press the Congress and to carefully examine the way to take", he said last night.
At the same time, in Europe, there was a new evidence of the world's nature of crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three countries of Benenlux announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11,2 billion euros (16,3 billion US).
The intervention of the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French Bank BNP Paribas replied to purchase its competitor in full demand since it lost EUR 2 billion (2.9 billion) in the crisis of real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is part of twenty larger European banks and ten more assuranceers.
"It isn't the lost money, said last night the Dutch Minister of Finance, Wouter Bos.
In exchange, a vote right is recovered in the bank and infringement.
It's just something that the splendors and households now appreciate that the time is uncertain."
At that time, on the other side of Manche, the British Government seemed to nationalize another financial crisis.
According to the English press, the Government would return all the loans in the Bradford Bank and Bringley bank, including over 41 billion (75.5 billion US) real estate loans.
Spain's Santander bank has learned last night that she would buy succursales and customer accounts from the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an engaged icon
His beauty in the blue eyes was long his card out, no one will say his weakness.
Was he released from the Narcissic View, the American actor in the charming smile?
Yeah and no.
His power, his sensitivity and a talent that was covered from source will have also been away from the power register that babys the real sacred monsters.
But what a great back-up course!
Paul Newman, who disappeared Monday at 83 years of age, remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of fast years.
Not much monumental than Brando, whom he was, and whom he was a kind of rival on the screen, was more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also the apostle of the freedom and extraction of the dramatic conventions.
Mother blood often makes magnificent children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, with a German Jewish father and a Hungary mother of origin.
These European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without ego, the last quality mark.
Because the whole country was designed by a man himself, the fighter of the Pacific war, who was blessed at the battle, who studied the dramatic art at Yale at the beginning of the 50s, then frequently the New York Actor's Studio before triophering the theatre, television, soon in the cinema.
The same man who warned for citizens' rights was also the car pilot that was classified in Mans at 24 hours in 1979, doubled by a symbol, whose member of a model couple was formed since 1958 with the actor Joanne Woodward.
They also divide the dark areas of this secret, discrete, engaged, allergic to the edges of the show-business, which will not actually be lost.
A honest man, in the nobleest sense of the term.
Paul Newman's disappearance tried to cinephiles this weekend, while his great roles were shocked on the black screen of memorys.
More than a half centuries of a seventh American art in perpetual mutation deserves through him.
Remember the shooting cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejected his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on a bruned tube of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More closer to us (1990) is called his sensible Mr. Bridge, found in his old age by a marriage that did not fill all his promises.
So many of the other Paul Newman have passed to the story.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, criminal, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me (Marked by Hate), Robert Wise, is a role to James Dean, once again after his death, which really launchs Newman in 1956.
This sympathical malfrat in the brillantity The Sting (L'Arnaque), the best film Oscar in 1973.
Amar and winner player in the magnificent The Hustler of Robert Ross (1961), he will retrace the personality of the return to The Color of Monney de Martin Scorsese, who values his unique Oscar on nine nominations in 1987.
This face through the age was him.
Besides him.
The times are walking through his way.
Young people are particularly familiar with him through George Roy Hill (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, a holchey team on ice little orthodoxe.
His fans found it in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Brothers Coen.
With the last role of the Irish mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes in 2003, the ball was cut.
Unlike several legends of the cinema that slowed the car, Newman will remain a long time in sell, while condemning Hollywood, his oral, its fast and its concessions.
The French cinema Bertrand Tavernier would consider it, not without humor, "as a living challenge to "supplicating" judgeing his too supported benefits.
The professional has not always been tending to the beautiful Paul Newman to whose roles slowed all the cups in the bec.
However, it was less often playing youths than marginal: nevrosed, alcoholic, salad or disappointed, which reflected his perfect traces and revolts.
As a realizer, Newman reveals the fairly known faces of his real pudic sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (as the Roman of Canadian Margaret Laurence), with her wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, brought a woman’s portrait of melancolie.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose gave him his film Harry and Son in 1984, the work of pudeur and tristeness.
Among the rain of hommages in Newman, her grand friend and former arms companion Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) was very attractive, saying: "She's presence made my life and this best country."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrant traces of the disappeared actor.
Besides his lingery career, there is also a great warrior for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a counterparty of Hollywood retreats.
We would have seen a lot of his throne throne on vinaigrettes, sweets, bicycles and other foods, judgeing the process of smelling, whatever it won at the start.
However, the benefits of these sales were paid to its Foundation for the difficulty childhood.
Newman, instead of sit on his myth, will be joined until the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these words: "All and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful of his good star.
That was a privilege to be there."
And a privilege for us to have followed the course of a American artist so lucidal and so generous.
Citizens' models, in summary and in their own.
What could you well manufacture Zuppo & amp; Compagnie in their fabrics?
Nearly, on 8 October, hearings will start with regard to the current criminal procedure, against Yanos Zuppo and his companions.
Political and his companions are accused of shocking, as a criminal organization, in a permanent and regular manner, having particularly important damages. Other guests of accused have been held against them, such as false and false use.
According to the parking, the money from subsidies was expenditure for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false facture.
The money of the State and municipalities, about 65 million HUF totally, was one part in the boxes of the Fiatal Baloldal movement, and on the other hand, in the pocket of certain people.
Their method, also publiced by the investigation authorities, was to touch the money of the grants obtained by issue of cost factures, which did not provide any real performance and thus, associations never respected their commitments.
According to the accused act, a large part of the factures were false.
For these lasts, they searched for facture books on the Józsefvaros market while they made the cachets in Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that were going to figure on the factures, it was decided, among others, during the tournings in the Northern Balaton Lake Province, conducted by Istvan Lados, on the request of Yanos Zuppo.
According to the depositment of the latter, it was necessary to restore pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he requested a facture, on the model of which they would realize the other factors they would, inter alia, introduce at the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Capital Municipality to access subsidies.
The majority of the factures was created by Istvan Lados and his partner András śri, who, according to our information, was particularly concerned to editing the files necessary for the obtaining of subsidies.
During a "recreation circle", one of Lados' choices was a bistro.
According to the two factures issued by the Suppos in 2003, this place has assured the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However, in the view of the manager ' s proposals, it would have been impossible that such as persons take care of this place at the same time.
Similarly, during 2002, the facture established on behalf of the Jobb Jövæért Foundation, which will then bring the name of Egypt a Harmadik Evezredert, brownit of forms and funds.
A pension situated in Badacsonytomina was in reality only three rooms, and a maximum ten people could pass on the night. However, the facture mentioned hundred thirty customers.
Factors to the dischargemental image are also fallen in except, when they mentioned the Pigal Kft company, also belonging to the Horeca sector. In their accountability, nor Jobb Jövært, nor the Hopaá's data appeared, according to the parking data.
Gyśzá Farkas, the company manager, declared the hvg.hu site that when the park called it and showed the factures, he knew then that it was false documents.
"The name of our society and our tax number were placed in a bad place on the cache."
He added: "Besides the form, the fact that, according to the facture, hundreds of people had lived there, not anymore, because this establishment does not contain only 11 rooms, who have no so much place.
Moreover, the factur also mentions food, and our restaurant is closed for a long time."
Heavy facture emissions have not yet been listed on Budapest’s travel agencies, which are part of their choice, but organizing only travels to the foreign. Thus, natively, they indicated stays in Hungary on factories to resolve in species, which are also contrary to the accounting practices of the Agency.
Overall, as was appeared at the investigation, they also added TVA on these documents, while travel activities, including destination outside the European Union, are factual without TVA.
Similarly, the TVA rate of the four factors established on behalf of the Hotel Revfulosop at Jobb Jövært was invalid, since the performance of the company does not support a 25% TVA as indicated, but a TVA of 15%. Moreover, hotel employees do not allow printed factures, while false performances were made on the hand.
The survey of the park shows that the "employers" also made errors by mentioning the transport of goods by road, that the factory company could not perform, since its profile was the investment advice.
Furthermore, it is also for forms such as inadequate facture types and false cachets, that the factures issued at the order of Egyuttt a Harmadik Evezredert Alapítvany, XXI. Századi Kukulturalis Egyesület and Bytos Pont have been false.
As well as in the case of the company Ravenna Bt. or the sportive stage of Kunfeherto, which both are not the authors of the factures issued in their name.
Faussarys did not have attention to the fact that HIB Kft., established in Nírereregyháza, was in liquidation at the time when (2001) the Fiatal Városért Egyesület group had to take a feed home. According to our information, this is why the company’s liquidator has never issued this facture.
Delegated facts
Another category of facture issuers is the composed of those who were very conscious that it was asked to issue fixed factures.
The Esely Budapestért Alapítvay foundation, on request of the Fiatal Baloldal Group - Ifjú Szocialisták, has established a facture for the Együtt Foundation to Harmadik Evezredert for a sum of four million HUF.
According to the accused act, the manager of the Collab Kft company was engaged to issue false facture by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
Similarly, Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation and in 2003, issued factures to the Jobb Jövśért Alapítvány Foundation, Atlasz Egyesület Association and Vörèsfenyō Egyesület association, for a amount of approximately five million HUF, but after which no benefit has been effectively provided.
There was no financial movement, not yet, since the issued factures have been cancelled afterwards, but it did not prevent the organizations of mentioning it in their accountability.
The following category of factury companies is that of the companies directly related to the accused.
Thus, the Administrative Director of the Delta Trio Kft company, employing the trade of carburant and car vehicles, whose social seat was in Budapest, but where it was not found, was Iván Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued a number of factors on the sale of computer equipment, for about 18 million HUF.
According to the investigation, these equipment would have been purchased by the Cash Investment Kft company of Kiskunhalas, which was in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of this society was a Romanian man who had also made Ivan Kubatov documentation with the company between 2002 and 2005.
According to what we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation he issued factures to the order of the Atlasz, Hopaá and Egyptian companies at Harmadik Evezredert Alapítvayny, and that he has opposed their opposite value.
It is precisely the request by Iván Kubatov that Roman shops have created the Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft companies and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, no of these companies did not work, as the accused explained by the fact that they were not receiving work.
He has always served these companies, because at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, who was accused of and editor of corporation acts, he established factures to their names, to the order of associations relating to Zuppo, such as Atlasz and Y-Generacio associations.
Kubatov granted a total of 15 factories, elected by Cash Investment companies, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade for a value of 14.2 million HUF.
The parquet thought that 10% of the expenditure indicated on the factures, as well as TVA were going in the pocket of Kubatov.
The man even used Szi-Beri Bt. company to establish fixed factures that have been used in the framework of the Biztos Pont' subsidiary application.
In January 2006, the Y-Generation Association and Sövetség to Modern Magyarerszágert introduced a request for subvention to the Socialist Party's Public Use, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They obtained this grant for a double amount of 500,000 HUF, but these amounts have not been used for the objectives set out in the request.
To avoid that it is not possible, five fixed factures received from the Works Team Kft company were presented to the TMA.
Furthermore, these factors were found during the investigation carried out in the office of the Kemecsei, the Ministry of Education.
When hearing, a part of the accused will report the facture manufacturing method, as it had already done before the park previously.
What could really be interesting would be that the principal accused, Yanos Zuschlag itself, decides to take the wave over the whole story.
By now, his grandfathers are not very detailed, and even though he has promised several times to tell the least details, he has not yet done it.
The question is whether it's in his interest, or then, of course, socialists would conclude an agreement that, in exchange of a large part of the 50 million HUF, Zusi would take the head alone.
Today, this last is probably closed, since the requests for his supervised residence on the basis of a pleasing of his detention conditions are continuously cut into the ear of a slaughter.
While those who have caused a lot more important damage, and the authors of unreparable economic crimes are free or at least waiting for their own household, he has no possibility.
Psychology of overcame: Why are more money expenditure?
When purchasers sell, buyers tend to cost more and exceed goods.
Neurological and economic researchers at the University of New York have succeeded to update the neurological and economic bases of this known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the Scientific magazine, human beings do not want to be distanced at this type of competition, such as a sale on eBay, and therefore they prefer even paying a too high price.
These research tried to develop a neurological scheme of this type of " game" by means of sales to experimental sellers.
One of the voluntary groups played at the loto, while the other group took part in the sale to ludical shops, while using a functional magnetic resonance process (IRMf) researchers analyzed the active cerebral areas of experimental subjects.
In the two games, participants could win the money, but during the sale of shops whose essential element is the overwhelming of a third, the whole of which was called Striptum was in intensive movement during the loss of the part.
This part of the brain, along with several other functions, plays a role in the "auto-stimulation" mechanism of the nervous system.
This is why, according to researchers, the rate of prices is explained with the fleet before the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theories, the economic members of this research group continued financial monitoring analysis.
During those groups, three groups were overwhelming against a partner in different circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the real value of the product concerned, and thus they carried out.
Another group, they promised that if they were expenditure from the part, they would receive 15 additional dollars in reward.
While the third group received the $15 before the purchasers, the members of the group also lost the money when they lost them.
The difference between these two groups is, in fact, that the accent was put at one on the victory, while and at the other, on failure.
Thus the neurologs hypothesis, the members of the player's team "the failure" were available to higher places than those carried out by the control group and the "for the victory".
"The results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
Indeed, each of them explained the phenomenones identified in sales to buyers only through the joy of winning and paradise before the risk.
Only the neurological image methods have helped to remove the contradiction between the two theories now on a third explanation." - Andrew Schotter, professor of the University of New York Economic Sciences.
Hepatitis: When should we consult a doctor?
In the world, about a half billion people suffer chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, chronic illness is mentioned among the first causes of death.
It is estimated to hundreds of thousands of hepatitis diseases in Hungary, but only seven thousands follow a treatment. This is because sicks often don't know that they are the virus ports.
The hepatitis name is a generic name given to infections touching the heavy and caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Fee inflammation and jaunsia are characteristic, but pathogenic agents and generated diseases differ between each other.
Hepatitis virus, according to pathogenic genes, is mainly offered under two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tube (e.g., food or water contained), hepatitis B, C, D and other organic viruses (sperme, vaginal, salve secreation).
For travellers, it is in any way recommended to vaccine against virus A and B. There is no vaccine against C.
The symptoms of Hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after the consumption of contaminated food, generally accompanied by a bad state of general, weakness, steomac and nausea.
Then it is developed on the skin and the white of the eye, a visible jaunce, the skin becomes more clear and the urin takes a thicker color. The curation can take two to three weeks.
Over the world, each year, a million people die in the most serious form of this pathology, such as cancer or phenomenon evented by hepatitis B.
The main cause is that, according to estimations, only one sick sick disease receives medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if it is not treated, it may lead to surgery or heavy cancer.
Most ills do not know about virus because pathogen genes are destructed by the heavy cells. In many cases the first symptoms appear only after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular detection tests.
Contamination is much higher than the average population of three groups: persons who have suffered blood transfusion before 1991, drug consumers and tatuated.
Currently, 200 million diseases have been counted with chronic C hepatitis in the world.
Since disease can be detected by a laboratory routine review, it is advised to consult his doctor who has been treated after the observation of unknown origin symptoms.
The disease can be generous, if it is timely detected. Virus can be eliminated from the body, so the risk of contagion is disappeared and cancer development is prevented.
30 September is the world day of hepatitis, organized for the first time in 2004 by the representatives of the four world's diseases.
Its goal is to address the attention of chronic heat surgery, caused by virus, the causes of development and the importance of precoce diagnosis of disease.
Who believe in God feels less pain?
According to the results of recent research, religious faith would work as a kind of analysis, which had already contributed to make the death of the Catholic martyrs more sustained.
The British Daily Telegraph published a article that the researchers of Oxford University have experienced interesting experience in analyzing the level of faith in God could influence tolerance on the pain of human being.
In the context of this experience for at least strange, 12 Catholic believers and so many acts were subjected to electronics, while each of them observed a painting representing the Vierge Marie.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude a large part of suffering.
Through a human brain palpation technique, Catholics have also been able to activate the part of their brain responsible for the control of pain.
This analysis is the first of a series of experiences, including academics, scientists, philosophers and theologists from different university sectors.
More precisely, the experience is carried out in the following way: an instrument that issues sculptures and disseminating electrics is set on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experience to look supported by two paintings, one as the Vierge Marie pending by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady of Leonard of Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers on the origin of this experience hoped that the view of the Vierge Mary was a kind of faith among the believers, while the choice of the painting of Da Vinci, not very different than the first, was on its calm effect.
Experimental subjects occurred a half hour in an IRM scanner, and during that period 20 electronics in four parts have occurred, regarding the painting of religious theme, or the most general theme.
The Catholics said that at the view of the Vierge Mary, they felt as "in security", as someone who was "reached" and "called, and peace envase them".
In view of the painting of religious thematics, they took account of 12% of pain than when they saw Leonard's work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself has taken part in the experience, thinks that the same effects can be achieved with any other strong image, in the athletes, with a condition of finding the appropriate photo.
"We should find a face face with which they react very positively, such as a mother or father," said the psychologist.
Tom Wright, the English edition, welcomed the results of these research.
"The practice of faith should change and, in many cases, effectively change our personality," added Wright.
After these excellent results, there is no longer the question of knowing what would be the effect on the control of the pain of the subjects if the believers are shown a Madone painted by Leonard or a painting of the same calibre?
Does the view of a Vierge Mary of best quality cause better results?
You're what you're talking about you.
On the occasion of his tenth anniversary, Google claims that we can find it in the back of the pocket of people as the heavens above their head. He knows where they pass their holidays, what specialists they consult and what are their interest centres.
However, it is not enough, According to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influenced people of society.
While in respect of sceptics establishing a parallel with Orwell's horrible vision, those do not just see the essential website 2.0.
Eric Schmidt said, there is little time in the Financial Times that the main environment of Google is to gather more information about its users. This is necessary for Google's founders to respect their initial goal, which played as follows: "Rejoice in a system all the information of the world!".
According to Google's leader, after ten years of a global channel work, they are only the beginning of their goals to treat all information.
To the question: what would it be in five years? Schmidt answered that he would like Google to answer questions like "What can I do tomorrow?" or "What is the work that would be the best?". However, the software will not answer this kind of question, simply first view, that the day where they will learn about users.
It is not perfectly clear for all interfaces that the words used during Internet research, the IP address of the computer that launchs the search and pages later consulted by interested persons are specifically repertoried.
By means of the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own research history and consult what they have been looking for, on which they have clicked. Thanks to this, long-term, recommendations, program based on the same logic, will be able to give much more personalized answers, and will provide us products and services on the basis of our previous statements and our registered preferences.
What's happening if someone serves my data against me, if he looks at what my work? They ask users, who are worried about seeing Google's monopole information.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can cause fear, and it is not the retreat, the fear of punishment, the desire of freedom or eventually the revolt against the power that can cause against international authorities a reaction.
However, it is confirmed that the search terms are not only registered but, in cases justified, they are transmitted to a third, and in such a legal case, nothing protects international personnel rights.
The most remarkable example of recent times is probably the action coordinated against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google has transmitted to the Government of Brazil the information he had collected on the public page called Orcus, which allows a identification.
The concerns of the rights of the person could be subjected to a suspicion in May, when Google, above arms with the EFF electronic law body, proved its right to the court before the FBI. According to the judge, Google may not always be obliged by any point of the Constitution to disclose information on the secret request of the FBI.
(In the same time, the federal government has successfully reached some 50,000 website addresses and 1,000 research terms that it had reported in relation to strengthening the child's child protection law, voted several years ago, but at the end of the last two months, he has not been able to provide lists of private users' research, nor the full list of the websites and the closed words of the last two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore sufficiently contradictory: it is shocked by those who fear the transmission of their personal data because they believe that their intime sphere and their private area suffer when they start using Google services. Therefore, they attack them in the spirit of revolt that is manifested against the fierce multinational society of their conservatory image.
During this time, the American Geek culture and its "sauvageons" together with the passionates, activists and enthusiastic users of the computer that appears in many countries see in Google the next generation of large enterprises, the "fashioned corporation" by opposition to the rival, Microsoft, catalogued as an invader of the world because of Windows, and even if all of them are fighting for the same goal.
This may be explained by the fact that Google, on the contrary to Microsoft, does not ask his users of identification code, do not demand money for its applications. The documentary code and the program package, continuously refreshing, has a much more accessible effect, younger and cooler, faced with the practice of the official software generator.
The reasons may also be that geeks are very precisely seeing the problematic relationship between the rights of the person and the Internet, and that the website 2.0, the most proclaimed word is just behind him.
Indeed, Web 2.0 does not refer to anything else than cooperation, but the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and that we need communication channels set to our disposal, and while the size of those changed one by one, the essential remains the same: it is exposed.
A young man can generally hold a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and it can even connect them to other performances, such as Twinter, or last.fm, to list its musical habits. Then he can link them to a continuing system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also hold blogs, where they are automatically their most recent photo galleries that they store on Flickr or Picasa.
While we can know many examples, such as that of the little friend that easily includes the view of the photos of the morning, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom his unfaithful friend has passed the evening, or the company who led one of his employees, nothing just for the sincere opinions that he wrote on his blog about the Top Management, it may be on one thing: the private life term is completely to reconside today.
Whoever lives in online life is constituted of what he himself shows, and this is how the principle can be defined behind the behaviour of the youths today.
This wants to hide something, or at least, to try to discover Google's monopole, can (for example, starting with Screen, using the Google search system, but at the same time, not to leave any tracks intentionally).
The number of persons who, delegately, do not store on public pages so that it is not possible to find them, is not less. Online Google services, passing through text treatment to image treatment, can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not raised to large server parks and who are not assembled by our best profile, which existed until this day.
The public opinion expects, without really hiding it, the moment when Google will declare his real nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is more than IBM (140 billion), Intel (124 billion) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars). AdWords/AdSense advertising areas threaten the number of advertising agencies, while the benefits introduced to a more significant speed of migration are present not only in Microsoft, but also in many other computer programmes creators.
The critical observers, however, find contradictions with concerns: for example, the top of the company has rejected, in its entirety, the protests of employees, after duplicating the price of the company mother, and after the company have judged too urged the multi-day reconstruction, which seems to be deceived by the fact that in 2006, Google has acquired before the Chinese government and after the terms of their agreement, the company detected all the results that are good, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime.
According to one of the internal rules of society, new services are not announced only when they can be used. This is about, in the next months and next years, they will move the world towards new points. While some think that the project of scan and archive of books and magazines of Google takes so important dimensions that the society will be slowly faced by the United States Supreme Court, other trimble before its health system, because in that case, it can be built a complete medical benefit from our outcomes of previous analysis, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google sets a genetic database can give a good material first to the next generation of scientists. The Roman of the famous Cory Doctorow, written with half-tons orwellians, describes the future in which a man could be approached in an unexpected way than through Google's data.
Two minors helped to lose the traces of Ozd's double murder
"The police convok two minors to interrogate them in the case of the double murder of Ozd. According to suspicious suspicion, they helped destroy the traces of the crime." - said the door of the Commissioner Borsod's department.
Young people have recognised the facts that they have been rejected, and for now they are accused of compliance.
The two minors, who, according to MTI information (Hungary Telegraph Agency), are young girls, are free.
The murder compliance may involve a detention that can go up to 5 years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ozd, a young man of 23-year-old age, was placed in provisional detention, Sunday.
The chiefs of the accused accused of him are murder, committed with premeditation and interest.
During the investigation, he revealed that the 23-year-old man had a large amount of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to resolve his debt, and that's why he will take his creditor, last Wednesday, in a site of Ozd where he killed him, as well as the girl of that man, who was nine years old.
According to MIT information, the young man premedied his crime, and the weapon with which he would make his crimes hidden on the places of crime is the evidence.
The police reviews the weapons and circumstances of its use with the assistance of specialists.
Varsovia's bourse makes a proposal for the purchase of Prague's bourse
The barrier of the values of Varsovia proposed two hundreds of euros, about five billion Czech Koreans, for the purchase of 100% of the Prag's value bounce package.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Valuation of Varsovia, confirmed this proposal, unless the Polandians had done soon that previously the Czechs excluded Varsovia's barrier from the circle of the new potential owners of Prague's bourse.
The cause of this exclusion is that Varsovia's bourse is in the hands of the State.
99 per cent of the actions are in the hands of the Poland State, which wants to separate more than 60 per cent of its actions in a few months of activity.
According to the Czech economic newspaper E15, the Poland's proposal represents the highest offer that has been done until now for the purchase of Prague's bourgeo.
According to the Czech press, the winter of Vienna, the Transatlantic Nasdaq, the Stock Exchange of New York, London and German Burse offered up to this day.
Petr Koblic, director of Prague's bourse, has declared last week that the Varsovia's barrier would be the least good, and has not excluded the fact that this could cause the disappearance of Prague's bourse in the future.
The value of the Prague bourse is estimated from 5 to 10 billion Czech corones by market specialists.
Based on an agreement between shareholders, some 90 per cent of the papers would be sold.
The most important owner of Prague's bourse is the Patricia Financing Bank, with approximately 25 percent of participations, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna bank and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 per cent.
The financial crisis of the European press view
In their comments on the mardi dedicated to the international financial crisis, aggressively updated, the newspapers of the European press already speak a "second September".
"The global financial disaster, it must be the US President" - accused of the daily Rome, the Republic. "The President has not even been able to block with his own party under a law proposal, which was expelled to slowly, to bring back to a desesperate situation..."
On the place of a new Pearl Harbour, as the Milliardary Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to talk about a second September.
A part of the madrile press see also the embassy leg in Washington.
According to the daily vision of El Mundo, these are the lacks of the political direction of there which brought the global economy to the end of the eradication.
The risk of extinction of the American financial system is growing every day, and afterwards the world will pay the strong price.
The Bush Plan was far away to be perfect, however, after the vote of the Congress, a real threat, which Washington does not propose a political tool to treat the crisis.
World economy is in the white, just at the time when the capitalism history has been one of the largest transformations.
We can't ignore the more long-term threat - highlights Geneva's Day-Anzeiger.
Some states can still have a savings duty to their holding financial bodies, and thanks to the money of their contributions, they can save them from the faillite.
Of course, if even more banks are switching such as domains, then nor financial means, nor new improvings will be sufficient.
In the long term, we need to make the states of the European Union few cases of their national egoism and focus on the control over separate financial markets.
Only Monday, the fault financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros - remembranced the coming daily, The Standard, which adds that the fears that European contributions also have to put their hand to the pocket, very deep, in a similar way to the United States in order to remedy the crisis, becomes more realistic.
To this end, the EU has not really been busy with the crisis, which, as a tsunami, is partly through the old continent.
The "conservers" should not immediately mark hundred billion euros, in contrast, if they would be rational if it would be worth touching the money of contributions, with the aim of preventing more decades.
Intelligent car defeats bourdon flight
What method would be better to develop technologies to avoid an obstacle, if this is not the implantation of an already existing obstacle detector in nature?
For example, the one of the sheep.
In the surprising project at the CETEC, which was held in Japan, the bourdonnants gave the strategic idea of starting to the engineers of Nissan to inspire them on how they should develop the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built a mini robot, a bio-robotized auto-robotized system, type BR23C, which was equipped with qualitys of balls, the final goal is to encourage the establishment of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
In his flights, each swimming pool represents its own space, oval form, which actually looks like our secure protection cock - explained, at the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the research and development and technological public relations.
The sight of the shoes plays a primary role, as it is able to see in all directions, in a angle of 300 degrees.
In order to imitate the functions of the faced eye, engineers discussed the idea of the laser telemeter.
This identifies the barriers in an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 meters before the BR23C, he evaluates the distances and sends a signal to the board microprocessor, which transforms it into an evitable manner.
The perception of the obstacle is in a second fraction. Then, the mini-auto robot, imitating the bridge movements, immediately changes the direction of its routes by turning out of a enough angle to avoid collision.
In contrast to all existing systems, this evacuation work is completely instinctive.
"If it wasn't so, the mini auto robot could not react enoughly to avoid obstacles" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Labor and robotized car project.
It must react instinctively and instantly, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and internal cows of the protective cover, a cup where the collision is considered inevitable for now.
All this process must reflect what the skin is done to avoid the other skins.
The process must be launched in a eye cline.
On the opposite of balls, the difference may not go up, down or in diagonal, it may be only two dimensions, and only in the direction where the roots can turn.
In this way, in place of infinite combinations that have the sheets to avoid the other shells, in our case, only the rotative movement, the acceleration and the switch as the hands in the disposal of the mini-auto robot
BR23C uses polymer lithium batteries that are lighter and with energy concentration is greater, which makes their long life life longer than in Lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the instinctive instinctive reaction that is primarily, not the treatment of data, and still less the ability to store.
This mechanism should be treated only a few signs in the second, and react to those.
It is not necessary to store them and react with the intuitive logical based on the data of the previous handbooks, so it does not use only a few twenty-octs of continued memory.
You don't need to remember a giga-byte ability, nor mega-byte.
This is the first step towards the design of a technological service for immediate evaporation. According to Nissan estimates, this system will enter its cars in series in the next ten years.
Another application could be its integration in the GPS navigation system, so that it can lead the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on his way.
Even a name to the baby was given out of price
The written version of the Economic Safety Plan of $700 billion is ready to save doubtful credits from the banks and to use several times.
At first, half of this amount will be expendied.
Reuters announces that during new debates, which are extended until midday, Saturday, the local time of the coast, the leaders of the Congress have been agreed on existing disputes since the days and days, around a total of $700 billion.
"We have done a serious step forward," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the United States Chamber of Representatives, said that it remains only to put paper agreements.
The commitment, born from the plan, is supported by the two candidates to the Presidency, Barack Obama and John McCain.
The United States Secretariat in the Treasury, Henry Paulson, said by commenting on the results of the commitment that the programme will work and will be effective, but other measures must still be implemented.
The written version of the plan was made public prior to Asian markets, Tuesday night at 20 a.m. local hours from Washington (which is Monday at 2 a.m., after local Europe Centrale) but has not caused a spectacular range in bourses.
Thursday, the Representative's room will be the first to vote on the law proposed by the Act on Emergency Economic Stabilisation Act in 2008, and then it will be among the Senate's hands.
On Saturday night, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, and then the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
"We are satisfied with progress this night, and we are strongly grateful for the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, the White House's port.
In addition, the divergent programme of the initial proposal made by the Bush administration, which indicated that the $700 billion should be paid only for the purchase of duly credits.
Dorenavant, the maximum half of the amount of 700 billion can be expendied. The first 250 billion will be delivered immediately after the adoption of the law by the Congress, probably Monday. This first sum will serve the secretariat to the Treasury to purchase doubtful credits of banks, while the use of the $100 billion will be left to the decision of the President.
The programme will be monitored by an independent body where the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The cost of the second half of 700 billion depends on a new decree of the Congress.
In terms of the Law, the Treasury Secretariat may establish a combinated strategy: it may, at the same time, purchase doubtful credits, titles of suspicious hypothestics and other types of "toxic".
The officials of the Department said that the purchase may have been carried out in the framework of a sell, but also directly.
The Rule provides the possibility to enterprises concerned, to take part in an insurance programme, where the secretariat to the Treasury guarantees the concerns tools, for which the undertakings will pay an equivalent prize to the expected damage.
Henry Paulson said that the law provides the necessary tools to provide 700 billion dollars for the urgent needs of the financial system, that it is the wide recovery of suspicious credits, their insurance, or to avoid the risk of seeing the system engaged in the eradication of one or another important financial institution.
"We will take the necessary provisions to be prepared for the implementation of the law as long as it is signed" - he added.
However, leaders of the banks who are in bad posts and waiting for the State's assistance may expect that their departure compensations, called just parachuted other Atlantic, will be funded by the Government.
The payment platform is indicated only in precise cases. Furthermore, restrictions depend on the way the Deputy Secretariat proposes its aid to the company.
The principle of the platform means that if the secretariat of the Treasury is acquired in the framework of a sell, they will pay more tax on the donor parachute, less than the President of discrediting bank parts of the retrait.
Directly after the purchase of suspicious credits, the government will be aggressively intervention to ensure that the amount paid to leaders is not exceeded.
In order to be complete, the image must even add that existing custom parachutes are not changed. The platform is only the new contracts, this is to motivate the participation in the plan.
It is the first time in the United States history that legal platforms will be in force on the appointments of general directors - commented by the President of the Commission on the financial performance of the Chamber of Members, the Democratic Barney Frank.
Furthermore, the State is entitled to purchase parts in banks which are part of the plan, so that the risk of contributions is reduced, as they may even be winned in the case as long as the economy and with the saved banks will return to their patents.
The draft legislation indicates that in the coming five years, the Chairman must introduce a proposal to set up on the way losses will be returned to contributions from the financial sector.
Of course, both sides were those who expressed their doubts in this regard.
This is not why American citizens have sent us, but this does not protect the dollars of contributions - said the Republicn Deputy in California, Darrell Issa.
His democratic colleague of Ohio, Mary Kaptur believes that they are the same who press the action to take, as those responsible for Wall Street's exploding.

Barack Obama and McCain support both the bank saving plan
On Monday, Barack Obama, as John McCain, the candidates at the President of the two major United States party, have assured their support to the Government's $700 billion, but there are politicians who require the demission of the United Secretariat in the Treasury.
After marathon negotiations that duration of days and days, representatives at the Congress and the Administration finally announced, on Sunday, that they have concluded principle agreements on the bank saving plan.
This financing plan, aimed at the decline of the Wall Street crisis and the paralysised credit market, was the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain are even more suitable than the other to lead the country outside the economic crisis.
According to the most recent reviews, with the advanced economic issues, Obama has succeeded again to advance. McCain's advance, obtained by the appointment of Sarah Palin as a colleague just after the Republic of Convention, founded.

The newspaper of the German language territory
The right camp is intact, it's only in the heart of the party that elections have become more conscious - so the De Spiegel, the low point of the CSU in the Bavaro country.
Haider is ready to dominate Austria to prevent the coalition of red and black.
The scene (spiegel.de)
In the Internet edition of the German Left Information Journal, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the dramatic defect of the CSU in its article entitled "The Revolution in Bavière devolves his fathers".
According to this recognised polytolog, the CSU's erosion began well before the triste two Beckstein-Huber takes his functions.
Christian socialists have transformed Baviera for decades, and now they are the same modern citizens who turn to them.
This change of time is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and in fact also the Angela Merker.
For the CSU, the failure has not been completely a surprise, but on Sunday, a process that was likely there was just ten years ago: the insufficient hegemony of the national party has been completed.
10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU was swallowed with 47.7 per cent, and this was the first time since the fifty-years, with a rate below the 50 per cent level.
This has been repeated three years ago during the 2005 federal elections, i.e. at the time of this sworn Stoiber.
The cause may be made to modernize the "devoring of their parents" in the region as part of the CSU.
This makes sociologues 40 years announcing that but they were strongly wrong about rythm. However, secularization, the results of the education and the establishment of the northern and the Eastern Germans in the Bavière region, in full development, could not remain in effect on the fidelity of CSU electors.
Modernization will be paid with the increased opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right camp is intact, it is only inside the party that electioners have become more conscious, critical and more enthusiasm.
It is also surprised that during the past few weeks, it is just the groups of classic citizens who have displaced from the CSU, such as independents, artisans, bag holders and higher students.
In these groups, CSU support was lower than 40 per cent.
Press (depresse.com)
In its article, entitled "Who? With who?, the President of the Party stands on the reserve to the issues of coalition", the conservative Austrian daily concerns the situation of the confusionary internal policy which has been installed after the Austrian elections.
Austrian socialists of SPEC want to discuss with EVP conservators.
SPEC prohibits the SPEC to spend on its internal affairs.
The popularist party BZÃ is open for negotiations. Greens do not still want to agree on coalition.
The elections have now turned around the coalition; at the debates organized on public television, parties leaders have to let their cards.
Werner Faymann, President of SPÖ, confirmed that he wanted to discuss with the AVP.
The SPUE wants to show that cooperation of the two parties is effectively possible - that is what already exists in some regions and in the social partnership.
The question he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current President of the AVP, as a vice-channel, remains open from Faymann.
As he said, the Schüssel-Molterer orientation was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of question.
Molterer reacted carefully to the red proposals.
As he has already said, cooperation will certainly be infructuous if Faymann tries to take place in the internal matters of the AVP.
In its part, the choice of the opposition or entry into the coalition is currently an effectively open issue; these points must be absolutely discussed within the EBP.
Jörg Haider, Chairman of the BZÖ, reaffirmed to all proposals.
"To avoid the coalition of red and black, we are ready to take government responsibilities", said Haider.
Yaroka stated: The strict circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit for the Equality of Opportunities, which is France, was a representative of the current Presidency of the European Union.
In his message before the plenary assembly, as one of the main doors of the expert consultation, Livia Yaroka, European Deputy Fidesz Popular European Party, has touched the attention of the segregations in education, because it is a violation of the law that affects the most Roman children, and indeed one of the main ships to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and on the other hand, by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equality.
Among those invited to take part in the consultation, European social partners, as well as the most enormous representatives of the European legal protection and civil organizations, in the field of equality of opportunities.
According to the Press Office of Mr Fidesz Popular Party, Yaroka predicted that the Romans are lost from the labour market, first after their low qualification.
"An overwhelming majority of young Romans does not have secondary diplomas, and as a result of a elementary education of bad quality, only a poor part is the possibility of obtaining a superior education diploma."
Furthermore, Yaroka stressed the fact that education as the fundamental law of human being plays a key role when other fundamental rights are to be valid.
The early educational investment in Roman children means strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the Eurodeputy, it is necessary to make awareness of these reports in a largest circle possible, also between the Romans and the Non-Roms.
In fact, early a Roman child starts the school, he increases the opportunity to become a productive member of the labour market; by taxes paid from its income and consumption, it participates in the State budget.
"On nationality of the European Union, Romans must be assured of their right to quality education and be protected by low quality and secondary education." - said Livia Yaroka.
According to the deputy, cooperation of the European Union towards a goal and action is necessary for immediate acceleration of the school desegregation process, and therefore, respect for existing and preparing anti-discrimination directives is a primary importance.
"The strict circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken. Democracy to Roman children must be given, so that they may participate as citizens of full right to the future of Europe" - requested Yaroka.
On behalf of the "European Year of Equality of Challenges" assured for all, the goal of the Summit for Equality in Europe organized every year since the Summit in Berlin, is to ensure a single platform to support the measures taken for the equality of opportunities and for combating discrimination at European level and at the level of Member States.
CSU: thanks for a transitional period
It is in October that the decision on the type of two decades Huber-Beckstein will be taken
Despite this electoral failure, heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the Bavaroese CSU sums has been broken.
The President of the Party, Erwin Hube and the head of the regional government, Benether Beckstein, can still keep their place.
The type of tandem, who has lost a catastrophic voice of 17 percent, will be at the agenda of the celebration of the exceptional party, held on the last weekend of October.
The members of this very criticized couple, in any case, felt that they were not particularly in their headquarters.
Thanks to this, they were employed to eliminate the furious members of the fraction and base, which one day after the "tsunami bavarois" requested personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
It's been five years ago - it's still true, under the direction of Edmund Stoiber, at the top of his career - the Christian social unity returned 60.7%, while today, a year after the shock against Stoiber, there is only 43.4% of their strength.
For 46 years, the CSU was the "one sovereign" of the Bavière who gave 18% of the German GDP.
But the conservators are always strong in this South region, with a key importance for the Hungary economy, and they will be bound to coalition in the future.
As one of the first signs of an internal reaming of the party, the Vice-President and the Federal Minister of Agricultural, Horst Seehofer, presented as the possible successor of Huber, also received a place in this modest recognition group, which started discussions with the Free Officers, as well as with the Free Electors, along with the right values, about a possible coalition of the Munich Government.
A strange leg of destiny was that through the list of Free Electors, Gabriele Pauli, whose measurement against Struiber had served a pocket possibility from the two Huber-Beckstein, to then treat the very ambitious municipal political woman without household.
Now, CSU's leaders put all their energy to stabilize, in one way or another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who has cut the fixes into the collisions until now, will also receive an active role. The former head of the regional government and former President of the CSU, appointed on September 28 as the most loved day of his political carriage.
Monday, Huber launched a few outstanding comments to the CDU. According to him, they would have made much more support from the part of the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as an advertising for the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Following the Federal Tag elections that will be held in September 2009, Merkel will be only lucky if they go back on a way or another, with a common force, the CSU, who played an important role in the 2005 national success.
According to Merkel, it is difficult to decepte its deception caused by the fasco, the loss of the CSU will not affect the big coalition of Berlin.
However, it is relative because it will not be easier to manage the blessed CSU, and the crisis of social-democratic democratics is always hard.
Since 1946, the SPD has reached its worst results with 18.6 per cent in Baviera.
Lukasenko - six lines : 110 - 0
No deputy of the opposition has accessed the Belarus Parliament after Sunday elections.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by a country addressed by Alexandre Lukashenko, which ensures prosperity and stability, while, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained by illnesses made during the deployment of votes.
OSCE, who sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
While the legislative area of 110 people in this country has been very well opposed for 10 million people for many decades before the electorals, the opposition joining its forces under the name of the Democratic Forces of the United Nations (ODSZ) would severely hope that Lukashenko, renewing its mandate of President for the fourth time of doubtful elections, on the tracks of the change of the Constitution in 2006, would " allow" this time to be the presence of some Members of the Parliament.
Thus, the ODSZ rejected its cocktail planned for origin.
The fact that Belarus, more economicly depending on Russia, would like to improve its reports with the EU, where, due to the qualified Bielorrusian political order of antidemocratic, Lukashenko and several high-level politicians not receiving an entry visa, was one of the expectations of the opposition. Belarus has taken a credit due to the decrease of Russian natural gas imports, and has also contributed to the transition of the Beltransgaz society, owner of the gas drives through the country.
The fact that the OSCE, during the evaluation of the campaign, focused on positive changes instead of losses, such as the prohibition of submission for a third of the candidates to opposition, refers to a prerequisite cutting.
However, the Communicator of the OSCE already responded to the campaign, while the essential candidates to opposition could not appear in the media, and in particular the fact that opposition could not be presented when voted.
Despite all this, the opposition is also a positive improvement in the political regime: political detentors have found freedom, and Minsk is ready to small conflicts with Moscow, always rejecting the Southern Ocean and the separate Georgia. Or, Russia with whom Belarus forms a paper confidence, considers the two independent Territories for a month.
"We have done two steps forward, and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue was loved between Belarus and the EU," said Alexandre Milinkevitch in our newspaper.
According to the candidate to the opposition of the presidential elections of 2006, it is desirable that this remains so, although "the power has feared in this Parliament who has no weight, even to enter one opponent".
The opposition does not require protests in view of results, rather than trying to make a message about the need for economic reforms among elections.
"We are certainly very concerned about this side: we must print our opposite newspapers in Russia, local authorities put us in the wheels for dissemination, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting the elections, even in the circle of older people," said Milinkevitch, referring to the fact that in the current system of Lukashenko, which considers social security as its main result, the custom of the more officially supported retreatment is not more appropriate.
"On the basis of the end of the country and the increase in commercial deficit, the extinction of social security, "he calling the silence of a cemetery," is only a question of time" - is estimated Milinkevitch.
In contrast to the opposition policy, Russian observers have qualified democratic elections.
Serguei Lebedev, the leader of the Community of Independent States, said to the Russian Press Agency Ria Novosti: "The people do not believe in words but in acts."
Brunetta: "When today, a little dinner before the work."
Never, in the history of the Chigi Palais, we had no turning doors for the entry and out of the employees.
But since now, this new measure is in force against the small males, against which it points and then goes to drink the coffee on the bar during the working hours.
The anti-faining news was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary-General of the Council's Presidency, Mauro Masi.
"Burnetta's tournant doors are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more presence and more services", says the Minister.
Now begins a new stage of responsibility and transparency.
"It's reformism" in addition to Brunetta.
The installation in all the institutions of the Council Presidency is completed with the Chigi Palais.
According to Masi, "the choice of the turning doors is even important from a symbolic view.
No resistance of the employees has been registered, assured the Secretary-General: "This is a process shared by employees, and we had cooperation with all."
In brief, more smaller dinner for working hours; more than coffee or growing.
Brunetta's promise, which suggests, "A good cappuccino at 7 a.m. morning is an excellent and sacred resolution."
During a conference at the Supplementary School of the Public Administration
Rome, the minister of Communication, "in three months, the absence of public employees has reduced 50%, or 600,000 workers more than one year."
And he adds that it is essential to make more effective, the Public Administration.
Italy, "from salary dynamics" explained the Minister in the past 8-10 years have doubled in relation to the private sector, and also the inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees joined themselves to respond to the standards of Brunetta Decree in Codacons.
"Other than the Minister of Public Office today, the data relating to the decrease of absentism on the workplace as a result of disease, writes the association of consumers - the people of active "faining" continues to increase.
In fact, in Italy, thousands of employees of the Public and Productive Administration have been gathered together to declare war against illegal standards contained in the decree.
In particular, in Tar, the exclusion of additional delivery in cases of infirmity for service is contested; the prolongation of the household time of the sick worker, during which control visits are conducted, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions provided by the Minister.
Injuries on the workplace, Napolitano: "Decisive Prevention"
Each day, in Italy, there are 2,500 job accidents, 3 deaths and 27 persons who remain permanently invalid.
In 2007, Inail data confirm that white deaths have been about 1.200.
Numbers that demonstrate the gravity of phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death, and causes almost two times more death than the murderers.
In order to take attention to institutions, social forces and information about this dramatic aspect, the famous Emblem today, in all provinces of Italy, the 58th National Day of the victims of work, institutionalized on October 2nd Sunday.
"The worried data that Amil has distributed, as well as the tragic events of these last days, confirm the importance of the subject of prevention on the place of work", states the President of the Republic, Jorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of Amil, the National Association of Mutilates and Invalid Works, Peter Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses its sincere appreciation for the continuing associative efforts to prevent workplaces, the protection of accidental workers, the assistance to victim families and the sensibilisation of public opinion."
"All of the people, naturally irritated, have shocked the poing to put an end to such tragédics that, by their dimension, suscitate the clamker of media and the participation of the public, even though daily reality presents us dramatic cases, even repeating in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide just "because there is a problem of resources: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector take a very special importance for a more direct conscience from young people in the work world.
It is our duty, to maintain the attention to this phenomenon, not under evaluation of the alarm on social gravity, to apply and to improve legislative standards.
On the other hand, the President of the Gianfranco Fini Chamber emphasized how much this phenomenon of white deaths is an absolute social emergency that insultes the conscience of each of us, and urges all institutions to make a concrete effort to put it rapidly."
The data of the accidents on the work seem to have a slight positive trend, but it does not prevent that the number of white deaths may even be impressing," emphasized the President of Amil Peter Mercandelli later.
"We don't want that this "tradition to the rabais" actually translates in a less attention, because it is just when the attention relaxes, that the tragedy comes.
"We believe that in general, it is not enough to oppose the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be done by several actions."
"In our statement, Mercandelli stressed the need for more controls and inspections, as well as a more important intervention on the training of workers, and this is, since school."
- He added - " that still need to make a further effort in terms of communication and sensibilisation of public opinion.
"But especially, there is a greater sense of the responsibilities of employees towards a phenomenon that represents social emergency."
Mercandelli then declared "the progressive deterioration of the conditions of safeguarding of the inmunity planned for the victims of the work" and the "assistance delay to which the system is oriented over the past few years".
"The goal, therefore, is to return to the worker to the insurance guarantee – has he added so that the purpose of the person who has an accident should not depend on spontaneism or enlargement of the legislator"
MP3 driver pointed to the dog, they risk the audition.
Listen to the full volume music for a long period using portable musical devices such as Mp3 readers, can cause permanent audition lessons.
This is what the European Commission announces, which, in a communication published in Brussels, quotes the view of the Scientific Committee, on the unexpected and recently identified health risks (Csserri) of the EU, published today.
"of this Scientific-Learning report, it states that 5-10% of those who, during a period of at least 5 years, listen to the full volume music using portable musical devices, for more than one hour per week and for week, risk permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I am worried that so many young people who use frequently portable musical devices and full volume mobile phones can inconsistently hurt their hearing," says Meglena Kuneva.
" According to scientific data, the responsible Ue is a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
The most important thing is to make consumers awareness and to make these information in the public sector.
We need to review further, existing control systems in view of scientific opinion, so that they are completely effective and can follow new technologies."
Brussels requested the Independent Scientific Committee to consider the problem, given the intensive use of the portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the brush.
" Scientists concluded that there are good reasons to worry and that the European Commission will now review with Member States and other interested parties what measures might be taken to better protect children and adolescents, against the exhibition of portable musical equipment and similar equipment.
There is already a European security standard that limits the speed level of the musical devices to 100Db, but the concern increases the auditive damage that could result from excessive exposure to such sources of brush.
It is possible to limit these data using solutions such as the reduction of levels and the duration of exposure to the brush.
The Scientific Committee notes that portable music users, who listen to the full volume music (more 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, exceed the current limits in force relating to the maximum authorized sound level on the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions during long-term periods risk a permanent loss of auditive capacity after 5 years.
This is interested in 5-10% of the users of these devices, and their number can be quantified to around 2,5 and 10 million people in the United States.
Rome, Germany ordered to leave the Commission for the future of the capital.
Today we start, in March, in June, we'll be cut off.
This is the calendar set by the Capitole for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capitale", which took place this morning at the new seat, behind the Caricalla Themes.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 components of the Commission will put into consideration the directives for Rome.
In March, when they will be completed, the Committee and the Joint Council will evaluate analysis and projects in order to submit in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "Official Titel" of Capitole and its Master Gianni Alemno.
" The Commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas have been represented to stress Germany, and it must propose Rome's development ideas that could serve political decision-makers, which remain the Committee and the Joint Council.
There is no supervision of roles, but only the will to have a coin where developing a large project for Rome.
In March, she will complete its tasks and will then disappear, because this experience must have a precise time period.
In June, we will present the strategic plan of work by the Commission for the future of Rome Capitale. "
For those accused of the Commission to be unnecessary, since their opinions will not be binding, Germany says: "All depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, as well as on the quality of its proposals.
If quality is there, as in France, thanks to the Attali Commission, as well as in Rome, I am overlooked, his delivery will be fundamental.
Too often the policy is accompanied by the management of daily and emergency in time.
We, on the contrary, want to see before, and far beyond, to a deepest perspective, seriously work on the development of Rome and its future."
Moreover, the Chairman of Rome wishes to stress that "This Commission is not an unnecessary body or a busicratic set: it is absolutely free and will not cost an euro to Roman citizens, and will serve to study and to participate in the best intellectuals expressed by the Capitale.
For Germany, in fact, "we need to have a strategic, firm or immobile scope of reference, to allow our city, to improve, what she absolutely needs, while thinking about its future now an unilateral spirit, ".
A future that, as the master of Rome explains, "not will be limited to common borders but that will look far" not only in the optic of the future Metropolitan city and its legal status of Capitale, but also in relation to the role that Rome can and must have as a capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama, the first anti-American president, this is why.
A famous American politician who wants to pass independence, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, by his decisions, destroyed the United States economy and was reports (e.g. it has always been today as private citizens) with the Islamic enemy."
The attacks against Obama increase the date of elections.
A lady of Miami wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambition".
Obama is really struggled: he believes he will win the highest function of a nation that accounts in all two governments and five black senators!"
Indeed, it is an attack that does not say great things; it is obviously racial attacks, and they do not answer to the question of all the electors: is it a good President? We have also the reviews, which all say that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case, it's still someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain.
A journal of Mississipi, in the south of the United States, wrote a article: once a vote chain, we know whom the American patriote will vote.
This is a aspect of American mentality maintained secret until the end.
"That you want, we'll even see put the cross on Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we'll go out of the United States.
Chooses that have never been revealed until now, as the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
Despite all these reasons, the winning card for democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: what were the errors made by Bush during his mandate? 89 percent responded: Iraq.
America changes.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50.000 soldiers and was sent to her home to feet.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives, and Americans were not forced to make the arms.
Despite this, Iraq was mostly Bush's weakness point.
Who will take the place of George W will have a great tasting to do.
It is useful that the economic devaluation is even feeling at journalists: in the press, it's the time of removal. And many accused Internet, this "assault" of the newspaper.
Fifty hundred American journalists were interviewed by PEW Research Center on the status of their professional and mental control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists today are pessimist about their future.
However, they did not openly declare to the information attachments, feeling less worried about the credibility.
They don't feel isolated as any time.
The problem of American journalists is money, money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a destroyed economic model crisis.
Furthermore, the removal of the newsroom, in the room where editors work at the newspaper assembly, is a great problem.
It is a problem that must be resolved, according to interviewed journalists, if traditional journalism, such as the large public, is not decreased in a result.
A clear more complex pessimism invaded the American journalism.
Six of ten executives and journalists of printer journalists are convinced that journalism at the national level is in the course of a bad way.
Locally, the executive group is 65 per cent.
Publication printed against broadcast.
Journalists don't get bad to see where the web goes.
The largest editor houses are a Internet passenger, often perceived by "the killer" of the newspaper.
The "economic pressure" that journalists feel is increased by 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists admitted to the technology that hopes that it "makes something good" for their journalism.
Today, the biggest acrobacy in the American journalism between the newsrooms, that is, the directors and reporters who work for them.
56% of the directors at the national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level, this percentage falls to 23%.
For some, this is linked to the "security of the work".
Directors who think to lose their job posts in the 3-year-old space are 47 per cent at the national level.
As regards journalists, we go to 30 per cent.
The "safe work" at the staff level (no editors, ndr) in America is still at the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a large country such as the Use, with 300 million people and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, television and Internet, employees often offer what they want, and this becomes a matter of taking or leave.
The directors are almost always receiving large salary, while the editor can win $100,000 per month, in addition to the retrait and payment of insurance.
As regards holidays, the logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in all, a number of years.
But, according to their revelations, the American journalists are often "malades" during the year.
That's the cause of the climate.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA RESTATE A GROTTAFERRAT.
The President of the Second Criminal Section of the Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the instance of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who asked to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a room in Rome.
Coppola is investigated for bankways in the framework of the Unipol-Bnl scaled instruction.
In the last week of his load, he had obtained the introduction of a household in a obligatory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentilni and Gaetano Pecorella, asked that the real estate agent could visit the trail of the city of province to a residence in the capital.
According to the Court, such movements (who the pm has not granted) would enable him to influence his company and have access to evidence that they have received.
Elites in danger.
The phenomenon had already been shown a few days ago, with the vote of the Representative Chamber, in contrast to the $700 billion approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans was, and it is still more interested to punish Wall Street than to save the American economy.
And it's well the New York Times that confirms us that the current crisis shares the Republican Party, even more shared between his old soul of East Coast, moderate, favorable to federal institutions as well as the community business, and its new soul, the contrary, conservatory, hostile to "DC" and the world of financing, particularly in the United States of Center and South.
The soul, rightly, has been deeply feeling with the vote I spoke to you at the beginning.
However, what comes to be quoted is only a example of changes, great changes that the economic earth's tramping in the predicting or well allows to run: not only to the United States but to the whole West, and may not only be here.
In the United States, as in Europe, the crisis seems to make acceleration of phenomenones that have been covered for a few years, so that in the new climate they are consolidated and revealed.
The first of these phenomena is the reactivation, the extraordinary relance, the double state-sovereign category, compared to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of bank-financing institutions who, obviously, have close relationships with the foreign, but which, above all, are involved in a large scale, the balances of persons and families living in one single country.
This immediately creates a political problem for which it governs: how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families that are also a electory.
Shortly, the crisis appears economically, but politically, it is almost national.
Political internationalization seems to be really out of the game or not, it is not a big thing to say: the obvious evidence of the European Union is provided to us that, shared as a customly, between the various interests and between the various national strategies is not possible to decide no common political line.
And so, it is the government of each State who are waiting for interventions, savings and relaxation plans, new rules, and in particular a credit contribution: when a difficult period is over, there are only States who have economic resources, the mass of financial resources that can try to refund things in place.
They also have the necessary means and legislation for the use of them: two resources of an inestimate value, elements of which no market or international organization will never have similarly available.
This new emphasis on the state-nation crisis is in perfect harmonization with the continuing importance that the most recent economic developments in the economy tend to contribute to a sufficiently linked factor: territoriality.
Paradoxally, while we were convinced that we were now in the Kingdom of the network, the more sophisticated technology, the non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now intended to dominate the world, we have taken account of one single, that our future should, in contrast, resolve its accounts with enough materials such as water, collectes, oil.
things that may certainly be transported from one place to another of the earth, but are absolutely linked to a surrounded area to a territory.
Thus, who is sovereign, certainly has more cards than that that is not, i.e., who has the lack of living in a place without collected, without oil and water.
I am now coming to the second innovation, which, however, provides a fracture.
That said Territories, State, Government, inevitably said politically, and therefore the Leadership.
In this regard, economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
From a count, the consciousness of the need for authorised leadership, the search of a person who can handle the situation.
On the other hand, a discrete vague for existing leaderships, economic species that have been discovered inadequate and full of shadow area.
Furthermore, something more deeply, in a certain sense, even worried: a discrédit, a suffering, an image of inadequation, a feeling of dislocation that tends to engage the whole class of directors in a growing number of Western countries.
Thus increases the credibility of various classes, before actions are the same ideas of social elites until now, their way to listen and to be, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to be more foreign to the views of the majority.
In short, the request of leadership, foodly in subterranean way, a powerful and rational movement of delegations from the traditional leaders and political orders, which are expressed in the unproposed "revolted" elections, or well, in the changes of collective humors of these recently, from the conservative ascension in Bavière, at the disappearance of the worklists in Britain, to the rebellion of American congressors against Bush (and it could not be brought to the victory of the right in Italy).
It is a view that the traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rites, newspapers, their intellectual accurateness, their formats, would seem to someone, have still more difficulty, which does not give today, to understand and therefore represent the deep couches of Western society, and that the economic crisis strengthens, increased and potentially affects the economic crisis.
In view of all this, talking about a current "rebellion of mass" at the agenda, it seems clearly exaggerated.
But we say well, keep the large eyes open, that's not unfair.
The supercool to walk on the walls.
Turn the laws of gravity thanks to a super colle and, in the future, walk on the parish as Spiderman.
This is the goal of various American research centres, and today a team of four institutions has almost successfully succeeded.
With an adhessive measurement of 2.5 centimeters, researchers have succeeded to keep a body of 100 kg on a vertical park.
EтуDE- The American Science magazine published the discovery of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Acron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Lab.
The material, invented by the research team, is a development of those we know that uses a special carbon structure, called nano carbon tubes.
"The principle of the colle can be imagined as a series of tubes available as a pile of spaghetti." Zhong Lin Wang of Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta explains Zhong Lin Wang from Georgia.
Scientists have inspired the patches of gecks, microscopical powders that allow the animal to ensure, a perfect adherent.
The tests carried out on various materials, such as the glass, the Teflon, and the drink paper, showed that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the patents of these retreats, and at the same time, that "it's easy to get away from the pari" explains Liming Day, searching for the university's engineering Engineering.
MARCHER SUR MURS? – "This material could be used as temporary adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Can it be to walk on the parishs like Spiderman? Maybe, but researchers think about a very less fascinating use as the connection between the electronic devices, since nano carbon tubes are heat and electric path drivers.
Other applications could be related to aeropathy engineering.
For the moment, no super heroes.
ARE RECHERCHE- The University of Berkeley, California, also wants to search for a new adhesive.
In an article of the American Chemical Society magazine, Californian researchers presented an adhesive microfibras such as hair, which pursuits powders during a surface movement to ensure perfect and constant adherence.
Medicines: never with fruit juices.
Attention to the juice of pamplemoussis, man and poom.
These drinks, especially consumed in the summer because desastreating and rich in vitamins, if associated with certain vital medicines, increased the absorption or decreasing according to the cases, their effectiveness, with even serious consequences for health.
David Nailey, Professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices, if associated with the infection of certain medicines; during the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he launched a new alarm: it is sufficient to a drink of pamplemoussis, humans and pommes, to reduce the absorption of certain vital medicines, cancel their benefits and risks to the health of patients.
Pamplemoussis juice has already been strongly criticized because remained responsible to increase the effects of some antiarthmics, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antistaminales and neurological drugs until toxic levels.
MEDICAMENTS RISQUE- It is the Italian Medicine Agency, which had given the new information ballot for two years, warning physicians and patients to not assess the risk resulting from this mix and to take attention to what it was taken, if they were taking drugs such as Diazépam or Methadone.
PAMPLEMOUSSE- According to the experts, even the juice of man and pomme contains substances that inhibit medicines.
Longue is the list of active principles imposed by pamplemoussis and other jus.
The call by Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmacology of the Public University of Milan: "These findings are generally reported immediately to the various national and international medicine agencies that will need to change the information notes of medicines.
It should always be read of the illustrative papers of the medicines we take, and, if something is not clear, do not make it impressed, but clearly addressed to the doctor or pharmacien," stressed the expert at the Ansa Agency.
The Economy Nobel at Paul Krugman.
The Nobel price of the economy was allocated to the American Paul Krugman for his research on trade models and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a neo-Chinese teacher at the University of Princeton and is also a famous editor of New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most critical solutions in economic and foreign policy in Bush administration.
A few months after the attacks of September 2001, Krugman wrote in a New York Times article that the second event would have been more determined than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A prediction that disappeared from many polemics, which was reproached to the economist for years, but now exactly revealed.
"I am surprising and even a little shocked of the speed with which remembering scandals such as Enron or Worldcom's exploding have lost public attention," said Krugman at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a 'economist of great value', but also a very aggressive, particularly critical distributor to the extents of Bush administration liberalism.
Open Office, this is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It's the day of the OpenOffice.org.3.0 distribution, the open source of personal productivity that aims to touch users and users from the office house, public administration professionals, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following the work of the Press for a year, by voluntary developers monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package is shown to the public with several new news: welcome screens, and the interface renewed and became less important to other important, such as the born compatibility for the Mac OS X operational system, and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) format 1.2, the last ISO standard version.
Open Office took particular attention to the interaction with the Office 2007 suite, and it is actually possible to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.doch, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Thus interesting, some specific functions to some modules, such as the which allows to reduce the sizes of PowerPoint presentations, for example, to send them via e-mail, or to import PDF files into the graphical processing module, keep the original aspect of the page.
Always on this front, it is possible to create "Hybride PDF" documents that combine the typical graphic of Adobe to the elements of a calculation sheet or a text developer.
The cooperation between several people is an element that has made various improvements within the applications: in the calculation sheet, several users can interact, avoid change conflicts, in the development of texts, because each collaborator is allocated a comment color for a better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are even working to bring some OpenOffice functions on the web ( on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the next weeks, they should have the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded to http://it.openoffice.org/download/0.0/download300.htmlet and adds to the English version that was found on the view since Monday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is as normally available for the Linux operational system.
On request, the installation cd can be sent to house or to the workplace.
And if the theme of freeze can be a way to distribute it in houses, it is just in the business, that Open Office has the great challenge, which can already be taken into account on various projects carried out in the public administration and schools.
Without account of realities offering training, consultation and assistance, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also be open to business perspectives.
Open Office is composed of five main modules: Writer, for the equal Word scripture video; Calc, is the calculation sheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for the reval presentations of PowerPoint;Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows to work on databases; finally Drwa is the graphic module.
Objective for 2008, reaching up to 5 million downloads, and considering that today almost 3 million and 600 thousand are counted, it is likely that after the output of the new version, it may even exceed the expected number.
Kohl is also positive, it is the fourth case of doping.
New case of positiveness at the last Tour of France: It's the Austrian team Gerolsteiner, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and the winner of the best bridge maillot.
It's the daily site The Team reports the new.
At 26 years, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist in Cera, the epoch of the third generation, after the Italian Riccardo Riccô and Leonardo Piepoli, and the German Stefan Schumacher, as well as Gerolsteiner.
Blood analysis on the tests of Kohl are part of those carried out in the past few weeks by Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry laboratorys.
If anti-analyses confirm the positiveness in Cera, Austria will lose its third place at the Tour and must be forced to expect two years of elimination.
The news of the Kohl's position at the Epo of Third Generation, was confirmed by the chief of the French antidoping Agency, Pierre Bordry, who informed to the Association Press, has notified the positiveness to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian was placed on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, and thus the maillot was the best grip.
WHAT YORK TIMES WHAT IS ITAL ON THE RECIST?
Italy "as the countries of migrants recently transformed into a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with reticence.
This would turn the Beau country into a country of racism? This is what the New York Times was interested in dealing with a long article on the subject of racism in Italy, as well as the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, originating Burkina Faso, killed the last month in Milan, to shoot a bit of biscuits.
In this case it is clear that New York Times is defined as the "North Paradoxe": Northern regions are both where the registered "more integration and more work", but also "un of the strongest anti-immigrated feelings of the country and the most important support to the North League"
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, NYT also refers to Milan, Parme, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno's intolerance episodes.
Not just.
Even the new legislation wished by Lega to shut up immigration and facilitate the expulsion of clands, it is mentioned as a evidence of the climate change in Italy.
Tendence stressed by the Pope as well as by the President of the Republic: "Georgio Napolitano at his meeting with Benoît XVI in Quirinal, he asked that the State and the Church work together to win racism."
Travellers victims, up to 900 euros for a room.
The place market for students did not know a crisis
According to Sunia's last survey, a simple room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 to Naples, 600 to Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects in the exclusion of the entire groups of young people, of the right to study because of the very high global costs that the home families must support - explaining the responsibility of the Sunia's study office, Laura Mariani, in these cities, the strong demand of students had so deformed the market that a generalized increase in the population has been in love.
In most cases, location offers also include a number of violations: free, non-registered contracts, without limited loans, sub-locations.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions through fiscal revision are needed to calm prices.
Reading in detail the investigation, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Britain area, there is around 450 euros; for a simple room, we go to 650 euros minimum (Blackband Zone), at a average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) at a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria zone)
In Florence, a average bed costs, EUR 350/400, a room around 700.
In Bologne, where students concentrate in the nearby areas of the university, 250/280 euros are required for a double bed, and from 370 to 500 for a simple room.
In Rome, in the nearest areas of central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), about 600 euros are requested for a simple bed, 450 for a double bed.
lower values (550 euros for a simple) for the nearby areas of other universities (Ostience and Cinity).
Only if it is away from the device areas: EUR300 for a bed, and 450 for a simple in the Predestina area, Center or similar.
In Naples, for a bed, there are EUR 300/400 for a simple, 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
Bari, for bed, must be EUR 250/350, at least 350 for a simple.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute term, but they have a larger importance in the quoted economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, where local locations are often taken by extra-Community students, are recorded an anonymized later: foreign students, the loan requested has increased by 25/30% in comparison with the application of Italians.
Again old Paradise cinema, the cities elect the historical rooms.
The historical cinema rooms are closed for the multiplex.
"A city without cinema rooms is a green city, it's like a face without eyes."
The image offered by the metater in the Joseph Tornator scene, illustrates well what happens in the large cities of Italy, but also in the cities of Province,
The cinema marginalization process, with the birth in the periphere of the major multisalles, and the death of monosal consumption in the central areas of the cities, is one of the major events that appear to us inelectable and inconsistent; it has also all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
When it was lost, these are often historical and memory places, "it's like one of my friends disappeared, someone we knowed, with whom we shared a path and so many emotions," observes the meter in the New cinema Paradise, which offers a film to Tornator for 20 years ago, the first Oscar as well as the Grand Prix of the Jews of Cannes, and who recorded the poetium of a province room, and the nostalgia of a way to live in the cinema, can be lost forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of commercialists, want to say all of these five years, 316 traditional cinemas closed, and these are the main cities that were particularly paying the prices: 10 less than Florence, 9 to Milan, Naples, Bologne and Rome, 6 at least to Turin, 5 to Palerme.
Amilie Romeine is headed by 82 lost mono cinemas, followed by Toscane (44) and Lombardia (41).
The evidence that confirms that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advancement of multix, as well as the three Italian regions that have registered the most new multisalal cinemas: 195 screens in Lombardia in the past five years, 81 in Toscan and Emilie-Romagne.
"Italian exploitation has developed irrationally," observed Paul Protti, President of Anec, "that is useful to build new structures, but it would also be to ensure the survival of those already existing, because when a close room in a city, these frequencies are not forced to go to multix.
Without the lack of the delegation in favour of traders, the previous debt of the State is around 10 million euros.
It is honourful that the Government does not respect the existing laws by an ethical and moral point of view.
To support the sector, it would be necessary between 16 and 18 million euros per year.
Notice the case of Bologne, the first Italian city, who was concerned about these closures, decided to solve the situation through the signing of a protocol between Mayori and Anec, the first of that kind in Italy, to defend and promote the mono-sols of historical and peripheral centres.
Among the rules laid down, there are measures of fiscal facility for manufacturers and benefits for the public at the time of mobility: spectrums will be able to enter the limited circulation area and have special tariffs for stations and in certain parkings.
"It's a initiative that pleases me," observes Giuseppe Tornator, "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologne in place of other measures.
However, it is obvious that, in contrast to the super power of multix, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of the sound and image, as the public today is more demanding.
The defence of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important for me: the closerness of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the one that convinced me to do "New Paradise cinema", which I thought for 10 years.
I live in Rome for 25 years, and when I passed before the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via National, now closed, where I lived so much of shared emotions, I turn into the other coast to not see the powdered panels.
Connection between policy and ‘and-rangeta, Master of Gioia Tauro.
“The master of Gioia Tauro was prepared to harmonize the choices of the Mayor for the interests of the Piromalli clan”.
Blessings are launched by the magistrates of the Calabre's Antimaphia Directorate, against the Master and Vice-Master of Gioia Tauro, Jorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external concours for mafious association.
The handets also for Joacchino Piromalli, the old mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his little lawyer, a boss homonym, already condemned for the association of mafious type misfaiders, as well as paying 10 million euros.
"a face against legal and moral regulations, and especially the right sense" writes lawyers, the two local administrations had expressed the will of paying consultations to Master Piromalli.
"As it would have been granted to the clan-written-writing judges- to be officially entering within the chairs, facilitating the opportunities, already considerable, control and orientation of the public administration."
The Chairman of the Regional Committee Agazio Loiero does not hide only "collections between local committees and organized crime, there is more than one" in its region: "They have places where mafious intensity is stronger than in other, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist to the pressures of the ringheta, the heroes who are honest"
The arrests of this morning follow those of July last, following which the police announced that the Piromalli clan was disabled.
Since the end of April last, the Joia Tauro Joia's Joia Tauro Joia has been discharged; in 1991, and it was always due to presumed conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been discharged from their function to administer Ville.
Jorgio Dal Torrione, Leader of UDC at the time of dilution, was appointed to a head of the right centre coalition, after the May 2006 ballot.
It creates the scandale when the prefecture orders the dissolution of the common council.
He accused the Vice-Minister at the time, Marco Minniti, the accused of having handled it all for a political issue, but in view of the request for incarceration signed this morning, the judges explained that the Clan Piromalli had even succeededed to request the change of the A3 project.
As a result of ordered interceptions against Dal Torrione, the pm writes, "the availability to marry the requirements of a business man, representing a more known group near the Piromallli, uniformized the choices of the public administration for the interests of the clan.
When energy is born vagues, the big ones now start .
This is a democracy that takes more than 70% of the surface of the planet and now the great world energy companies are discovering it.
Wages, cuts, marges, here are the new new sources on which colosses like Chevron have put the eyes, and now they try to put it on.
The possibility of obtaining energy from sea movements has been studied for hundreds of years, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has been intensified.
When the price of the low oil price, until 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put on the side, but now the ecological institutions and the new increase of oil give a great burden to the sector
The World Energy Council (WEC) of London estimated in 2007 that 15 per cent of the global electricity needs could be covered by marine oil systems.
This amount would be the double of the nuclear centers.
And moreover, there would be skills and marchs..
Colosses at the attack.
The first undertaking on marine energy was the Enersis, which in 2005, signed an agreement to build an installation in the northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, a real revolutionary step would be said.
By two years of twenty-first-year-old candidates, traditional energy has always been cut on marine energy.
"Chevron is currently studying the ocean energy technology, and he declared the door-spread of a company associated with the American oil colosis, at the economic newspaper Wall Street Journal, and she evaluates the possibilities of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question relates to the obtaining of a permission delegated by the American Energy Commission, necessary to provide a project on marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially if it is considered just in Alaska, the uses continue to extract the oil, and recently President Bush has established a project for new scavations.
In addition to Chevron, there is Verdant Power Inc. From New York and the Ocean Power of the New Jersey, which is the way of the energy coming from the sea, and they are invested until now, although their details are not known, indicated by observers, a growing interest.
Technology to set up.
Experts speak of a technology still to its beginning, in addition to the fact that marine energy does not dismiss the fears of the environmental impact.
At present, the systems like Portugal, or some in Scotia, are small, and they do not seem to create a great problem in ecosystem.
However, to produce large-scale energy, technologies should be used with higher ecological impact.
" And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a bottle system connected to each other.
The powder of the vagues, which makes it moved up to the top and down, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of pistons and cylinders inside the fleeters.
The pressure makes turning a turbine to its tour, food a generator.
Energy is sent to the river through marine cables.
For this time, we have four systems of this kind in the project phase, in waiting for a federal only approval and a part of energy could serve to a military installation.
Verdund Power, on the contrary, has already produced energy for a commercial centre and a parking using six turbines under the Eastern River of New York.
The water movement during the slopes, turns the turbines, creates a rotative movement that produces a generator.
Verdund announced that he had a long list of customers waiting for the requests for energy power.
After the waves, the shoes.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for Electricity Research, now merely the potential of marges.
Although it is an intermitting phenomenon, the sea is more predictable than wind, sun or waves, and therefore more reliable as energy source.
And it is just about the margin energy that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, with other coasts, invested $7 million in 2008 and provides investment up to $35 million in 2009.
