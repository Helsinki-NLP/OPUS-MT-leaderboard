What do you mean?  _SSD in Prague does not know or Voldemort or pastelary
The new designs in the capital will have to be overcome, according to the clear language barriers so that the members of the Prague Board and the municipal Council understand their renewed ODS partners.
The current period was "examined" to the members of the new SSD Council to verify their knowledge of the slang language that has occurred in the last few years in the Council when Praga had ruled the current members of the coalition.
The encoded dictator used by Prague's political flower and birth during the previous period, the Pavel Bém alcalde, including some of the most known personalities, situations and causes of metopolis.
Surely, the new concepts have been tested almost not understanding these known concepts.
At least, that's what they say.
"What is Voldemort?"
"The truth is that I don't know."
"My more I'm a new in the Prague policy," said during the terminology review of "college" the design of Lukáš Kauckī culture.
And in respect of the political veteran, he reacted the same Karel Bśezina.
They may know the "golf hoyo" concept.
"That may be the only expression of all you asked me to use once."
"If no, normally in employment slang."
From the glossary, whose definitions published the Updalean.cz newspaper last June before the ODS vote congress, the edition chose six examples, especially those who are particularly related to the municipal authorities of Praga.
The socialists had to explain the concepts "Voldemort", "Mass of the Golf of Prague", "Ire to the Pastelaria", "no torr", "Traition of the capital" and "blindar".
Three designs accepted the test and a fourth, Antonin Weinert, who will be responsible for education in Praga, first accepted, but did not recovered the phone again.
The fifth designer, Petr Dolínek, refused to do it directly.
"I'm not putting into these things, I don't think of how democratic citizens divert."
"What I am interesting is how we understand in the implementation of our programmes", he stated.
As has been seen, the conceptal Lukáš Kauckī had not been realized that the previous title is an expression of an influenced entrepreneur and a friend of the exalcalde Bém, Roman Janoušek.
The word "Voldemort" does not tell him anything; the only word that you have made in the review is "the largest golf today of Prague".
"It's the Blanka tunnel," says Kauckī, who immediately adds, "but I know better about the news."
"I'm gonna have to point to a course of languages," brome.
Karel Bśezina is not the only one who recognizes the Blanka Tunnel in the golf today, but also the Lukáš Plachī environment design.
Then, both sociodemocratics know who is truly Voldemort and Lukáš Plachý knows where to find that person; and it suspects the meaning of "to the pastelary".
"I think I want to go to a Praga company"; soon it comes to Plachý that it is the headquarters of Janoušek.
Like Bśezina, such knowledge has obtained them from the news, but it does not use such vocabulary.
According to the test participants, there is no so-democratic glossary such a family glossary of coloquial terms.
"I asked my friends, but it really seems that we don't have anything like."
"Besides, among us we use abrasives, sometimes abreviatures, or we make words games with names," says the President of ŠSSD praguense, Petr Hulinský, whose game partners call Hulda.
"In the colleague they called me Bśíza, but I don't know if my partners also call me so," admits his own support Karel Bśezina.
The Updale.cz newspaper tested the name and functioned.
For his party partners, Weinert is Dśda (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, Dśdek ("old"), the representative Miroslav Poche, who was associated before the wrong elections during the party's headship, receives the support of "Igráček" ("playmobil") by some of its partners.
Aids are also the only expressions that sociodemocrats tolerate in the conversation within the party.
Hulínskī does not like to call you Hulda, but the Update.cz newspaper discovered even other appeals for this President praguing.
"The doctor of the Laws" seems to be remembered that Petr Hulínský obtained his doctor in law at the police academy of Bratislava.
The Government wants to restrict the torture of brushes, as published in a brochure
Women considered brushes in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They often have a advanced age, they can't work, for example, for health reasons, only and have no children.
Women who are "building" brushes are sent to a isolated area so that they do not harm the rest of the people.
"The men are rarely suffering so much."
"Young women are also isolated, because they are helping in work and have children," a monja explains that, in the capital of West Africa, Burkina Faso is in a special residence of more than hundred women excluded from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this inusual "social measure".
He issued a information sheet that should contribute to avoid the castle of brushes.
But this has a piece.
"More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso do not know reading," warns the Dai Standard on the devention of written sensibilisation.
The accusations of brushing are also common in other African countries.
In Gana, a neighbor country of Burkina Faso, last week Ammy Hemmah died, 72 years old, when three women and two men tortured her, cooked gasoline and shooted her.
The news occurred in BBC.
The authors claim that an unfortunate assembly of circumstances was denied.
According to its version, women were taken in the oil used for ritual unions.
It was taken in calls when the group wanted to "expulse the wicked spirits" of the woman.
The isolation of the "brids" supports people from all educational levels.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old employee in Burkina Faso: "The devorers of human souls always represented a danger", stated.
While the government tried to cut the castle of brushes in Burkina Faso, last year in Gambia still participated in it.
"The Gambian President Jammeh, after his daughter's death, launched a wide castle of the brushes that, likely, had been related to his death and had tried to kill the President by the black magic."
"To help you to call from the nearby Guinea that, protected by police, military and the President's personal election, were brought to the force of men and women who were elected to the Gambian people to the owner of the President in Kavali", states the International Amnesty Organization.
In the end, arrested persons had to be drinked a poster of herbs with alucinogenic effects, which also caused intellectual and renal problems.
Two of the arrested persons did not survive the stay in the finca.
After international pressure, they finally released around thousands of persons detained.
Bakala's inquilino: calms with carbon stomachs and signs a higher rental
The man, of advanced age and reciprocal age, crossed the doors of the centre of attention to the client of the RPG Byty company of the "carbon paint" Zdeśek Bakala, the largest private owner of swimming pools in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm, he carried a few documents with the new contracts to store three floors: his own, his daughter and his son, which is fulfiling sentence.
The three ends to pillar the liberalization of households.
Instead of 3.500 Czech Corones per month, the child will pay from the next year 4.100 coronas for a double floor with separate kitchen of second category.
"But there is no hot water, and heat is based on a solid fuel chair," shows the man in the new contract of his son, on which the sign has full powers.
"But I confirmed it," he explained the midst, mid-resigned.
The BytyOKD.cz civil association, who qualified the new conditions of acquiring as “incorrect and indecent”, recommends inquiry people who do not sign the new contracts and who are waiting for until 7 December, date in which a guide will publish information on how to take place in these cases.
But, before this, the man just does a damn.
"Chatever says something," he says with bad face.
Ostrava is converting to a large liberalization test laboratory.
After New Year, it will happen with the great majority of the floors that, in the Czech Republic, were until the moment under a regulated rental.
This is why Updaln.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG mine waiting room is one of the four of Ostrava's and, march to nine was already filled.
Just next to the doors are the security guards and its side a machine to cover number.
"Have 2011", you can read in a light button from your tactil screen.
When pulling it, go out of the machine a paper with a number.
Almost no time or read "157" and the number already appears on the large screen situated at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in the cock.
Shortly later, a advanced age marriage comes to ask, but the number of the room is not here for the new accommodations.
Most people are going to solve normal problems, such as anciently: requests for arrangements, insurance issues and similar matters.
The letters with the new accommodation contracts will be reached in Ostrava to the clusters of the inquiliants of most of the 44.000 floors belonging to RPG around November average.
RPG Byty proposes in letters an increase in the loan between 15 and 38%.
On November 18, a special window is opened in the client's care center for new accommodations.
"He's working a week, so he's starting," they answered, after brief doubt, the workers that are in it when the customer is presented as a journalist.
Liberalization and old pools for Bakala's miners are the most delicate topics in the area.
Before the elections, the Vice-President of the Parliament, originary of Ostrava, Lubomír Zaoralek, from SSD, has already been treated, and now are continuously appearing in the journals of the area.
"twenty years later, I want a new land."
"I haven't changed the bathroom's shit," the man mentioned in the introduction is disappointed.
According to the workers, there are more than nothing joined to verify whether they receive a discount in the loan if they are signed at time, as they promised the special offer of RPG.
They will also receive half of the discount on the carriage of February the rest of the inquiry who sign the new contract before 15 December.
However, the window of the mine "liberalization" is uncertainly not able to divide the shuttle of doubts.
"The 360 customers who were here yesterday, so only asked for the rental in 2011 about 40 or 50 people," estimates the wagon employee.
At the same time, RPG proposes on the web and its tables to hold individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If the two parties do not reach an agreement on the carriage, the question should be resolved by an independent judge.
"It is not a threat, but information about the only way to walk and completely in accordance with the law," warns RPG on its pages.
"Here he's not going to judge anyone," he thinks one of RPG Byty employees and a man who is on the street before the customer's care center gives him at least the reason.
"I receive a pension of 13,000 and I remain 5,000 for food; I have no means to accommodate the courts," says.
But immediately, the employee has a doubt.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek warns them in the ways that they don't sign, so maybe people expect", believes.
The regulation of the carriage will stop existing in the majority of the Czech Republic at the beginning of 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase in economic needs.
"Current rentals do not even cover the amounts required for the maintenance of the Community's fund," says Pavel Klimeš, director of the RPG Byty's residential carriage, who adds that the uncertainty state of the Community's fund to the inquirymen is the main reason for the owners to increase the rental.
While in the five years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest accommodations in apartments 4 billion, the number will increase 5.200 million in the four years from 2011 to 2014.
The large screen that covers the roof, front of the seats of the waiting room, now repeats some data that spend on red.
"The increase in accommodation in 2011 in a 15% and less applies to 31.200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG properties."
"Only, it will always be as maximum 7.50 monthly chemistry corones per square metro," is indicated in the screen.
That is only increased in 38% the rent of the RPG Card's 400 pounds.
"In such cases, it is an increase from extremely low quantities, of 19.66 square metro coronas," states RPG.
In 2.600 floors, the rental will remain invariable the year that comes.
RPG Byty promises that liberalization will not affect housing, but will be scaled between four and eight years.
Furthermore, adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money of the loan (consultes the graph) again in the floors, mainly in heat: new windows and warming.
They will have priority for the persons who sign the counterparty agreement.
Architects have understood that offices also need guards
The Adriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new site of the Arch.Design company.
No one would say that she also hids in its inside a small guard with all its own to such installations: colour walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outside terrace.
Since October of the last year, you can take care of her the children of the employees of Arch.Design.
The company of Arch.Design architectic projects, from which the study came from many known buildings of Brno, thought of the first boots of the Avriopoint building in includeing a space for its miniature.
In the company, about 90 people work, mainly at the age of the baby, and they wanted to allow architects and delineants to return to the work after motherhood.
With the possibility of enjoying a reduced time, guard is one of the benefits offered by Arch.Designing its workers in the framework of their social programme.
Constructors and architects in this way have the possibility to combine a required profession with children's care.
The Ministry was an idea of Arch.Designu's own employees and, with the support of the direction, have been funded by the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The ministerial of the company is financed through the European Social Fund in the framework of the Operative Programme for Human Resources and Employment, as well as of the State budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the financing granted (a donation of more than 2,8 million Czech Koreans) were able to purchase the equipment and, two years later, to contract qualified personnel and services.
When finances (2 years), the company Arch.Design has the obligation to maintain the miniguarder with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project has longed one year and in the presentation of the financing application, the Economy Rating company had contributed.
The care of children is in qualified personnel hands; moreover, they are present for their care a nursing and a teacher of the Ministry of Education. The guard would currently accept children without age limits, although most of them have less than three years.
Since this is a "minister", it is only possible to accommodate at a maximum of five children, although the shifts grow more during the day.
The guard operation is flexible to adapt to the needs of parents and children of all workers with the same right to use guard, independently of the jearchy within the company.
Although this is a individual education and care, the contents of the miniatory program are comparable to the pre-school education programme.
In it children play not only, but also receive a quality education: from basic learning to school preparation, they teach to English.
The class has not only table games and games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of small children in the company itself creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents may go to see their children at any time and avoid the stress of collecting the children of the college when they are far away from their workplace.
So, parents are more productive as they work.
It is not surprising that this is naturally a relationship of loyalty between the employer and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design is located among enterprises that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, finally, strengthened the staff marketing.
The house of the bones remains fascinating over 100 years. Watch the insides of Gaudi
The teater seems to be the luxury of a prehistorical lagart, the scalars remember the column of a dinosaury, and the balcons seem to the mouth of a open fish.
That's the Batloo House, in Barcelona, from the Catholic Architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of their similar shape to a squelet, the locals put it "the house of the bones".
His organic forms, their calling colors, the new use of the stone, the blue and mosailic fragments, a fachada that reminds the scams and all of its very curvated lines, all this is typical of the Antoni Gaudí Session.
The port of the house plays with opial lines, delicate colors and textures from nature and fauna.
More attention, a certain geometry, rhythm and a carefully thought order is observed.
Tonight, the whole house's facade seems more impressive, since it is illuminated so that the light of the colours is improved.
Serpentea and the torture of the forms continue to surprise us also in your inside.
The endured wood copy the window frameworks, the barns, the doors' s sweets, the sights and the letters.
The House Batlló, located in the barrier of Eixample in the 43th commercial road of Passeig de Grácia, came from the restoration of a house of Emilio Sala Cortés in 1877.
The reconstruction was two years old, and the house was completed in 1906.
Inverstor, the rich industrial Josep Batlló, initially insisted on detering the previous building and starting from zero, but immediately accepted the idea of Gaudi's new and more cheap reconstruction.
However, the Batloo House, formed by several apartments, did not design Antoni Gaudí alone.
He cooperated in the design of the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
In fact, in their project plans, we were adorned for the representative apartment of the ownership and the mosailics used in the fachade.
In the facade, also workers of other creators and artists.
The cooperation in the Batloo House's proposals was the beginning of the successful cooperation of Jujol with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the Millennium House and the Guell Park of Gaudí, where there are other parts of the same.
As a result of their organic form, locals shortly after their finalization led to the "the house of the bones".
Others, due to the specific opening mechanism, began to call it "the house of the bostes".
It is also said that, at the top of the building, the sword of San Jorge, Cataluña's patron.
Other sculptric elements of the construction conceal religious reasons.
Gaudí projected in the house a single system for the central heat period with ventilation breathers and typical chimenas.
It can be strange your 40 degrees inclination.
During the construction, Gaudi did not comply with the moment's construction standards and did not have an impact on them.
The construction also obtained the relevant permission from the principle, although obviously in it the data shown on the reconstruction planned were so vague that, two years later, its finalization was so influenced by the result that requested to be corrected.
For example, it was shocked that the construction includes columns even to the public aircraft.
The arrangements have never been performed, better on the other hand: only 15 days after the request of the holiday, Josep Batlló requested (and obtained) permission to accommodate the two higher floors of the building.
The own owner was installed in the lower floors.
In the second floor gallery there was the salon and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The late plant was a joy.
The house, of six floors, is fully crossed by a sketch that leads to the terrace of the table.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all the right angles and lines, covering them from curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of space connection.
The common party can be connected fully by opening the doors of the salons and a larger group can be communicated in this way without that the necessary privacy for more intimate conversations is rejected.
The house, with the reconstruction of Gaudi, won not only a new fachada, but also an inusual table and two additional floors.
It also results impressive how Gaudi plays with light, white blue and blue covering the internal patio and traglues.
The game with the two colors provides the maximum light in all the floors of the house.
It was simply based on the principle that the white reflects more light than the dark colors, which, on the contrary, absorpte the sun rays.
Any person can visit the Batloo House, which was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005.
In the first floor of the house there is the most spacious and reloaded apartment of the public access.
The officers decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, at the 150th anniversary of the famous Creator's birth.
With visits, they confirmed, or found, that it was a very useful business and extended visits to the common area and the buhardilla, including the terrace of the table.
The price of the entry to the monument is not unlikely, at EUR 16.50, although students, jubilants and tourist cards receive a 20 per cent of discount.
The amount exceeds significantly the price of the entry of other Gaudi buildings in the city.
If you want to enjoy the real environment of the bed with your lagart towers, you should make a friend quickly from some neighborhood resident and visit them at home.
How to choose colt and summer: women and men are looking for different things
Nothing of a pumping framework for bed; what really trusts your quality to a good bed is the surface to smoke, i.e. the cold and the summer.
First of all, the perfection should be supplemented to adapt to specific users.
During the election, many elements are playing, including weight, height, health status and sex of the household.
It also results important the type of internal in which the couch and the summer is seized.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend chain that does not usually have warming, latex tissue should not be used because "calent" is slower.
Furthermore, it often pains considerablely more than normal polyuretan shoes.
Consequently, it is necessary to give them the most frequent turn.
If the center's channels are not properly aired and, above, are located on a solid base, they keep inside the humidity. It can even appear below.
At the time of choosing a bed, they also influence the habitats.
Whoever has passed for a long time in the foreign, often uses a very high cold with a bluff and will have problems to feel well in a lower and harder surface.
"It was all the hockey players who returned from the NHL that they weren't sleeping here as well."
"For its shadows, houses and chairs, they needed shoes with a wheelchair shoes."
"This type of skin is also recommended for people with diabetes that time problems of the nervous system, so they receive bad information from articulations and skins," explains Sylva Hadamczikova, who specializes in the collected mobiliary.
Many hockey players, as well as other customers, take time by prefixing viscoles.
"How there is no problem, because they have these suitable Temppur and the Italian Magniflexers, but also the checa tropical mark."
There is no longer need to be a NHL player to be able to appreciate the viscoleatic.
This miracle works in a very simple way.
Optimize your stride and shape as a result of the absorpted heat or is adapted to its body heat.
Nothing exercises pressure; during the night, it will not give turns as after a hard game.
Simply, I'm better sleeping.
Viscoleatics also works as a protection against rings.
When you choose the size of the collar, add to its height the length of your feet, i.e., between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be in a double room of 90 cm in total 180 cm.
In the case of individual rooms, for example, solvents, it is recommended at least 120 to 140 cm.
To make a possible visit also be comfortable.
"If not, a simple standard can be applied to calculate the width: to the upper smell, the hands should be shocked up to the smells," recommends the engineer Helena Prokopova, expert of Cechu čalouník to decorater, who has already been taking many years on the healthy dream and the ergonomy of the mobiliary, which teaches in specialized schools.
In double rooms, each one needs its own summer and cotton, so during the purchase, there is a need to provide attention to combine the height of the colds.
In other cases, the summers will be mounted to different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
The smuggles should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the mollusc models with a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters are for the edges that are adapted to the forms and swimmingness.
"When touching it with the hand or smelling in the kitchen, they should not be observed the muelles," warns Helena Prokopova.
Each floor requires a certain type of summer.
The whole bedrooms, in which the cold and the base are like sweet, have no sense in the bedroom.
The colchones breathe badly and can't lay their foundation, which is often done today.
And as each night we tramp between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sudor, it is clear that after some five or seven years the colcon will begin to remember a great (and congestioned) Tamiz.
For this reason, specialists reject slogans who speak of a lifetime of up to 25 years or even of a safeguard for life.
However, everything has a but.
Thus, the sellers give a advice: in the colcons with a width of 120 or 140 cm, take carefully the cleanness and the lavage of the foundation, but better add a cotton protector that can be removed and washed.
Despite currently manufacturing collar foundations with cromalery clothes in all their dangers, so when they are opened are in two parts (which is very important for lavader and the size of the lavader!), their manipulation in the larger models (and by one person) when the collar is upset, it may seem to be a struggle between a mosque weight and a weight weight.
In the bed, instead of a summer, do you have a firm table?
No!
How much for the beds thought to pass the visits one night.
However, it must be done (if you don't have them already) ventilation offices in the table and must be used with a mushroom with sleeves inside and a minimum of 15 cm height with skins (such as the German Taschenfedern) and a skin.
Polyuretan balls should not be used on such bases.
For non-artific lame sumeries and containing between 14 and 18 laminas, the latex or sandwich colchones can be used (e.g., a combination of latex and coco fiber), although it is always better to be a sume with a higher number of laminas, 28 or more, where the lame in the lumbling area are strengthened and it can be regularly restricted.
It should not be used with a muscle ring because it does not react to the reclination.
In addition to adjusting the strideness of the lamps, the protection of shadows can also be used.
This is a special set of lambs that allows to press or even to smell the lambs so that they "rode" perfectly to the shadows during the dream.
For men who have very wide shadows, this is something very important.
They even remembered the manufacturers of balls that, in the "makeys", began to use a more wide area precisely around the shadows.
They also remember women, for which they put a more slower area around the chairs.
For the most demanding customers, there are sumeres with cross- or table structures with the called multitruction.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the pressure is decreased.
It should also be taken into account that, although it uses the cold and uses appropriate sums, if it uses a bad almohad (grand and "mullida"), most of the benefits will lose.
The basic standard is simple: the lunch must support the head and the skins can only reach to the shadows, so that the muscles of the same ones can be relaxed.
The appropriate size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
At the side of the tube, the dinner must be at the same level (when it is combined with the sommer with relief for shadows or the most wide area of the cold) than the height of the shadows.
The modern balls have something to see, as it seems, with the original shoes full of shoes.
manufacturers continue to use, more often, natural materials or at least mixtures.
In fact, the biological shoes are in moderation.
The oil-based materials, with which the polyuretain spum is made, are filled with natural oils, for example rythme or soja.
In fact, almost all known manufacturers use soya.
"Biologically, in the case of colchones, it means that the center is only manufactured of natural origin material", explains Petr Vašíček from the Tropico Plus company.
Similarly, natural substances are used during the manufacturing of the base of the colchone, one of the first true aloe.
But it can also be opted by the microcaps, which frees a fresh forest or lavanda aroma.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men are "refreshing" with vegetables of grain, so that the foundation of the cold abspends the warmth and refreshes the body, women prefer "calenter" the foundation.
The red pig extract improves blood movement, so that women feel warm.
Do you currently enjoy them?
The manufactured collars of cold spun, which are more porous, with a adapted cell structure, which makes it more permitable than normal polyuretanea and offer more permeability.
The combination of strike strikes of cold and viscoletic shoes allows to manufacture shoes from various areas that are perfectly knowing where the head goes, the shadows and the houses.
A good-quality ring will cost you from seven thousand coronas to top.
Those who play a therapeutic role often have a lower IVA, since they are considered health means.
The first obtaining this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It's complicated to smell in collars and summers.
Sometimes the offers of manufacturers or vendors may be approved, which, in cases, offer two colchons for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze colchones with a spum with memory adhered to the foundation of 11.990 coronas.
The second is available free.
The era of the viscoleaxia with a open cell structure, and a great density started with the "cosmic" material of Temppur.
It was initially a material for the NASA, because during the shock of astronaut loals were seen subject to a huge overload.
Temppur is opened with heat and endure with cold.
Therefore, the human, calid, exercises a perfect effect and excellently adapts its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to avoid producing wheels, although also to improve comfort during the dream.
The viscoelous spumb is used not only in colchones, but also for health products, for example for dinners that are placed under the legs and allivians, as well as their movement.
National manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver and similar spumbs.
More parents use people's monitoring devices to control their children
The fear of children brings more people to think about controlling them by GPS.
The system, originally thought for the follow-up of vehicles, can also follow the movement of persons and contribute, for example, to the disappearance of the girl of nine years of Anička Janatkov.
At the time, the device has the close size of a cell box, but will soon be reduced to the size of a clock.
Many people feared the case of the disappeared Anička and began to inform about the available means to better protect their children.
Even the coast to invade your privacy.
"We all tried to tell us that it is not a spy, but another means to reduce the possibilities of a tragedy", considers Petr Pilin of the Macro Weil company, one of the monitoring devices suppliers in the Checo market.
"I recognize that, in some cases, such devices can be abused, for example, if they are put into the cup of someone without their knowledge, but we have not yet counted with such cases."
"The majority of customers really buy it for security reasons," adds Pilin.
In their opinion, children should always know what the "cachate" serves and how they are used in the case of emergency.
The child psychologist Dana Bočková warns the fact that, if the child doesn't want to bring it, he'll just take it away.
"Incl. smaller children show great creativeness at the time to lose intentionally certain things if they want to avoid controlling them."
"Before, parents were greatly trusting in the mobiles, but these could be removed as easy as the monitoring device," says Bočková.
In its opinion, it is discussed if in case of attack such a device is really useful.
"If it is a prepared sequence, the author shall practically always check whether the child takes some type of electronic device that can deploy its location."
"There is the phone."
"Indeed, the use of monitoring devices will be extended, and it will also search for them, as their sale without doubt will be carried out with a lot of advertising."
"In such cases, the crimers always walk a step before the police," says the psychologist.
However, it adds that such devices can help in the case of an unprovided attack of a pedofil.
According to the RC Monitoring company Robert śech, which offers monitoring services for vehicles and persons, even if, after an attack, the monitoring device is immediately destroyed, its presence may serve help.
"The device can be set to send the position regularly after a certain period."
"If he suffers damage, at least the last position of the person concerned will facilitate."
"The most precious devices have an inclination measurement, so if the person is just rescued and remains inmobile, the device will immediately issue an advertising with the position concerned", says śech.
In its opinion, a service of this type can be obtained even with intellecting mobile phones with navigation, where only a special software must be installed.
The problem of the current follow-up units is that at the time it is devices with a similar size to a cell box or low-scale mobile phones.
So they can be lost.
According to Macro Weil Pilin, this is why tests are currently performed with devices that appear a digital clock.
"But there will be the advantage added that a possible aggressor may not identify the device."
"One that identifies it after a certain time, which can make the police gets time," adds.
While monitoring devices are driving in the munch or collapse, they will continue to use the same technology that is used for the monitoring of vehicles.
This is the verification of the position with a GPS system (which is used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough machines to run all the Czechians. But only two years.
The Czech army bought 445 miles [445 km] to take explosives.
Last year, the Defence Ministry added to its 224 miles [224 km] board.
Hence, there are 225 years of existence.
The problem is that the useful life of the table is of two years, four to the sum.
The army purchased the table for explosives to the STV Group, s.g. by 40 million coronas.
The General staff responded to MF DNES by justifying the purchase of a so large amount of measuring, saying that soldiers needed for measuring manuscripts 60 miles per year.
According to the calculations of the army pyrotechnics, with which MF DNES was contacted, it is, however, decided that, in that case, these manipulations should also be performed with frequent use of explosives each year as well as all the general, high command officials, and even secretarians and cleaners.
They did not want exemptions, nor the Minister of Defense Alexandr Vondr and the army captain Vlastimil Picek.
Only so could it be justified that the army runs sixty miles [60 km] of mecha.
That length equals 25,000 explosions.
Even so, the army would have enough existence for more than ten years.
If instead, as the experts say, for the initial training of each new professional, the army would have the new purchase (including the consumption of engineers or special) sufficient existence for the 225 previously indicated.
Soldiers of the rapid intervention brigade were personally sentenced in a short time before Minister vondra because they say that they have only munitions for various weapons, so they are limited to the shoot practices for money.
And we don't talk about the lack of internal clothes.
"I'm not able to understand that these quantities of mechanics are repeatedly understood."
"But it's your decision, and they will surely know why they do so."
"For us, the army is a good customer to which, as a company, we try to satisfy", admits STV Group's commercial director Jan Dśckī.
The port of the Ministry of Defence Jan Pejšek defends the hundreds of miles of measuring, also said that there will be existences of this "munition" as the minimum for ten years.
However, Jan Dæckī, of STV Group, indicates that the table has only a useful life of four years and, in the case of the pyrotechnical products for the army or police, two years.
"If you are stored in perfect conditions, you can last up to four," says one of the soldiers who, for the possible critics of the army, don't want to give their name.
After the end of their useful life, each munition must be carefully checked to see whether it is still reliable and will not harm soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument of the Ministry is that, when purchasing 445 miles of mecha, I got a discount.
"We costed a 60% less than the request of the last year of 244 km," states the Pejšek port of the Ministry of Defence.
Only to compare: the annual pyrotechnic consumption of the police, which eliminate the ammunition of the Second World War or left by the Soviet army, has not been over the 1,500 meters for years.
Furthermore, the police always requests the right amount as to explode the munition before its useful life is completed.
They decided it for security for pyrotechnics and also while there can be more modern and reliable table types.
The Ministry already has clear difficulties to end the decades of thousands of munition tonnes of the time of the Varsovia Pact, when the Czech army was prepared for a campaign in Rin.
According to the pyrotechnics with whom MF DNES spoke, after a couple of years the following problem will be caused with the current: there will be a need to remove hundreds of miles of old measuring, which is now buying "barati".
Even now, I still live from the contacts I have given thanks to the competition
The fact of winning the "Company of the year" competition helped Lukáš Pytloun in the sale of the Frenchs of his hotel.
The last edition won the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukáš Pytloun of Liberec.
Your success history seems to be out of a film.
Lukáš Pytloun liked to travel.
In the foreign area, it was found that there was no quality accommodation in Liberec.
With the shore that he met with static works in the foreign and a bank credit purchased a house that was a mid-five-five-five-feed.
Being that I still studied her third year at the university, it was very courageous.
"In the present place, the quality and price relationship of the accommodation in our area has encouraging me to do something about this," says Lukáš Pytloun.
He started to accommodate the first rebuilding floor to foreign workers.
All income that had been invested again in the building, which gradually converted to a pension of 54 rooms.
Since then, in seven years in the business, there were four pensions in Liberec, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of around 300 in all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the Pitloun design hotel of four stars.
However, this year opened another of the same quality.
"We've just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tcé, which we sold our concept of franchise, and others are interesting in a Pytloun French", said the entrepreneur one of the last year.
"As this sale of licenses for the opening of hotels, the fact of winning the 'Company of the year' competitor, adds grateful Pytloun.
The victory increased its famous and popularity in Liberec as well as in the area.
"The people recognized me on the street, still happily happily and, I have to say, that it was very pleasant," remembers.
Nevertheless, recommends everybody who wants to try any company that participates in the competition.
But it is believed that it is not necessary to win, but that the participation is already useful.
It states that, until the time, it continues to live from the contacts and known that, without the competition, it may not have been obtained.
" With some people I knew thanks to the competition I began to cooperate normally."
The name associated with success, in its opinion, also included in employees,
in total around seventy.
"I have seen that they show a greater loyalty and they are proud of participating in something I have received general recognition."
"It's not, not very much, my own personal success, but that's the result of the hard work of all the team."
"One that is my name that appears in the first place", says today modestly Lukáš Pytloun.
My successor wanted you a year more quiet than we had in Farmet
The Euforia for the Victory was soon dismissed by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, it is possible that Farmet has already been worse.
Farmet's company office, Karel śarskī, received the first prize in the last edition of the Vodafone Concourse "Unit of the Year", the last year in the "Slave Casha" of Praga.
The jury valued his efforts, with which it made it possible to convert a small technical talent to Skalice into a sign with a volume of hundreds of millions of business.
"I can say that the premium has not only encouraged me, but all my partners and improved our trust in fighting competition," says the winner of the last year.
The history of the company Farmet begins with the desire to do something useful.
So when the State proposed to the father of Karel śarský the acquiring of a small talenter as compensation by the ownership embargo during the community, he was not too doubtful; he refused to his position in the company where he worked and, with a couple of partners, found the company with his father of plastic piles.
Shortly later, they started specialize in vegetable oil presss.
Eight years later, they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in the centre of Europe.
There was also a greater presence among non-specialized public after the success of the competition in the media.
"Do not only our customers have started to consider the Farmet Mark as a significantly better, but also foreign partners began assessing cooperation with an undertaking that made a greater success in their country," says Karel śarskī.
Last year, maybe it was not only a sample of the Euforia of Victory.
It has also been acknowledged by commercial results until 2008 and, partly, of 2009.
And just 2009 was the hardest year for machinery sale.
The improvement of the crisis, which has not yet reached so many citizens, has resulted in the delay of their investment projects and began to limit the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"We, obviously, are not free of such a situation."
"Income reduced to 40%, we had to limit the production and even had some disappointed", explains Karel śarskī.
A viable company must, in case, take poorly popular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and maintained the profits of the company, although it was at lower levels than before the crisis.
Despite all, where Farmet did not pay expenditure was in research and development.
"We have built a research and training centre, strengthening the presence of the international market and obtaining great national feast values," says śarskī.
Everything indicates that they have already left the crisis back.
Income returns to increase and, with them, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement is expected to support a feeling of victory, but in a quietest atmosphere," says Karel śarskī.
A survey that develops rigid standards
The survey of Absurdez of the year is part of four times of the business tour.
It has already been possible to eliminate some rigid standards.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdez survey in the year was the obligation to bring documents to which officials can access online.
The decision adopted it more than a third of almost four thousand voters.
For example, the administration of social security requested an extract of the market registration, although its officials could obtain it with two mouse movements.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Checaan social security administration will no longer request a extract of the commercial register when it performs a control of the taxes of the assured", stated Jana Buraova's portal.
The purpose of the Absurdez survey of the year is to consult the rules and regulations to respect the companies and entrepreneurs in Checa and to try to eliminate the absurd ones.
This year forms fourth part of the business tour of the Hospodaá publication, which is noviny and begins to create afficiation between the general public.
While the edition of the last year contained with the participation of three thousand voters, this year almost reached the four thousand.
And it is not surprising, because we still have various legal obligations of sovereignty that should be respected simply to trade.
"He wants to take a number of roles necessary for the statement of taxes first in the world", says Karel Havlíček from the Association of Small and Medieval Employees of the Czech Republic.
Since years ago, simplification of business standards is a declared goal of all governments.
However, in comparison with the rest of the world, the situation of improvement is particularly in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions to have a company, Checa is located in position 74a, i.e. eight worse places than the last year.
Absurdez of the year was the first time in 2006, and each year is repeated.
Everyone may indicate any administrative or bureaucratic absurdness each year between April and September final, when the complaint is closed.
The proposals can be performed on the website www.firmaroku.cz. Afterward, the committee organizer chooses seven candidates for the "anti-premium" and, in October, allows the public to vote on the Internet via www.firmaroku.cz/absurded and www.ihned.cz.
Give the absurdness that you receive more voting.
For this year, more than 100 were presented, in particular 105 rules and regulations that do not mean.
The examples were sent both entrepreneurs and professional and journalist associations.
Among the "finalists" of the computation, for example, the requirement of vehicles for the maintenance of roads and autopistas pay the piece or that the employees with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms are divided every two years on the walls.
The list of the seventy proposals for this year is published on the pages of the competition.
The advertising of the competitor, which is always held at the beginning of November at the Wenceslao de Praga Beach, is part of an event in which often participates in political and social personalities in the world.
For example, this year, in the case of the complainant Eva Svobodova, Director of the Association of Small and Employees of the Republic of Czech, or Petr Kuśel, Chairman of the Trade Chamber of the Republic.
"Economic prosperity cannot be maintained if the State keeps it continuously to employees, so my goal is to eliminate a minimum of thirty paragraphs that are currently innecessably complicated in the trade", announced the Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kokurek.
The efforts to eliminate absurd regulations are not in the waters of bourbons.
In 2007, what was worried more to people was the obligation of the employer to communicate with a three-day prior business office in the permanent operation area, the intention of accompanying a vacation or exposure.
This obligation was eliminated in the new industrial law.
The obligation to vote in 2007, i.e. the communication to the work office by foreign workers from work travelers up to 30 days, was eliminated in the law of the green card.
And the third is the winner.
Absurdez of 2009 was the regulation for physioterapeutas to have a large spectacle, a necklace and two floors in their consultation.
Thus, this year, the Ministry of Health issued a communication, saying that he had removed the obligation to have a fever.
A new category recognises socially responsible enterprises
ecological, humanitarian, educational or sportive projects are evaluated.
The newness in this fifth edition of Hospodaáské noviny is the category called Company responsible for 2010.
The committee of this complaint is to support responsible and fair enterprises.
"In this way, we want to support companies that care for the impact of their environmental activities and support socially responsible activities", says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of the mobile operator of Vodafone, organizer and patrocinator of the competition, such as the contest of the year's Rebellion.
For this new special subcategory of the edition of this year of the main Vodafone Company Concourse 2010, companies were presented for which trade success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities would fully vary between one and another, the common designator is the support and consideration that they offer.
In a case, for example, persons with disabilities, in other personal or health issues of employees.
Among the ten finalists of the whole Republic, for example, the Prague Software Company Et Netera, which supports the training of informal sports equipment among its workers, which then participate in various sports tours.
Another example of company in the Pardubice area is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has already been the main fund provider for disabled children.
In Podśbrad, there is a role that is particularly concerned about the health problems of its workers, because they represent more than 70% of the plants; therefore they received the title of undertaking responsible for the central region of Checa and the Vodafone Company Concourse of the year ended in third place in the region.
In Olomouc, the accountability company MiRyz Soft, which reduced the working time, even under the average of 35 hours of weekly, without reducing wages.
The title was also granted because it was priority to purchase checa manufacturers, supports Community activities in the area and respects the environment.
"We tried to recycling the maximum possible for our production and administration activities to produce the less possible impact on the environment", explains the Employer Miluše Ryznarova.
The IT Enlogit company in the Usti region also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each container, offered them a ergonomic shield and keyboards; also supports the work from home and its business events using the catering services of a local protected undertakings.
"Only, we support the shoe Person in snakes, which helps in particular the local Roman community," comments the representative of the Employment Ondśej Searchø.
The Pranii Lavanderia company is also a good place in the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive grants in a special way that impacts their pension funds.
"We give benefits in food, transport, improvement of qualifications and ocio," said Josef Strapač, from the construction company of Bruntal Czasch, winner in the Moravia-Silesia region.
It was automatically designed to all regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the year that responded to the questions of the registration form and sent it to the organizations before 15 August.
The organizations removed the forms that were not complete or wrong.
"If the representatives of competitive enterprises did not answer the questions, they couldn't participate in the company complaint of the year, but they were not disqualificated by the "principal" Vodafone Company complaint of the year."
"The individual candidates for this computation are not allowed, since this is a subcategory of the main company competition of the year", explains Karel Goldman from the Bison & Rose adviser.
The police held arrests during a public substance in the construction of the Agricultural Fund, Pilsen
The police against corruption held various arrests in the construction of the Agricultural Fund in the last days.
Detectives married a local entrepreneur of the media sector and the Luboš G.
It seems that this intention is to handle an current public substance for the refund of the rights so that the substantial land had received it a specific interested person.
He had to pay him to Luboš G. half a million coronas.
"To the moment I can only say that the police is looking for a person who is born during a public subscription and a public complaint," said Plavo the chief of the general fiscal Pilsen Antonie Zelená, adding that at the time it is not possible to disclose more details about the current investigation.
After twenty-four hours, the police left the 46-year-old employer.
As regards how it could affect the public substance, given the few official information, it can only be speculated.
The portfolio of the Lubomira Agricultural Fund responded to the questions of Pravo, saying that the police really carried out the arrest at Pilsen's headquarters and was during a public subscription.
"It's a customer, not one of our workers," said.
According to ˌerná, the public substance is called "Convocating for the presentation of land transfer proposals in accordance with the land law" and is being held when a number of interested parties appear in relation to the offered field.
"They, during the convocation, offer a higher value than their refund, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced."
"In accordance with the offers, the order of purchasers is determined and then the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person offering the largest offer" explained the port of the Fund.
Luboš G. had information about whom would be submitted to the convocation and, as it is both interested because he acquired various refund rights, proposed interested in the field that would not participate in the substance.
Please, it was covering a committee.
This would explain that at the time of the arrest there was so much money above.
Luboš G. had special contacts in the Pilsen Fund for many years.
It was because of the former head of PF Václav Sankot, who was accused of dispatching the replacement of lands for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Luboš G. has just been obtained from the Fund for the construction of public infrastructure, especially where a large route should be built to the industrial area of Borskaá pole.
Then he changed them in a very useful way with the judge by a house in the city’s historical center with a very higher value.
In this case, the loan had to be involved because, in other words, the blocked lands would avoid construction.
Familys should pay additional costs of hundreds of colonies per month
Homes must be paid from January not only for all types of energy, but also by water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, higher accommodation.
Thus, families will have to get out of the card, from January to January, several hundreds of corones for more than now.
The electricity price increases in 4.6%, the gas around 2%, some cities must pay up to 10% for water supply, and many also increase the price of central heat.
The slowing of electricity for families living in apartments should be at about 100 coronas more than now.
However, the main electricity providers reduced prices because it has increased support for the production of renewable sources, in particular photovoltaic.
However, the gas is moderate, especially at the time when heat is most useful, and therefore it is higher consumption.
In this case, it should also be counted with a couple of hundreds of coronas more than the year.
While electricity and gas are covered throughout the country, the price change of the central heating would be from one to another.
The slower of prices plans it mainly the largest municipality.
For example, the homes of Pardubice or of Hradec Kralové will pay from January to January for the central heating over 50 coronas more than a month, while the Liberec family will pay more than 1,000 additional corones per year.
Residents in Prague should also support an increase in 9% of water prices and heating, especially if the city increases the infrastructure rental.
If the rent wouldn't go, the pragiens will pay an additional 6.8%.
The prices in Prague, however, will continue to be among the lowest of the country.
In the northern Bohemia, where the current prices are among the highest, both rates will be 7.4%.
They can significantly increase the prices of the accommodation of 450,000 pools in Prague, where the regulation will end in January.
For example, the CPI Byty company, belonging to Ustí nad Labem around 2.500 floors, will increase the rental from January to 100%.
The company shall bring the courts to those who are not in accordance with the new household.
Regular car rentals, which benefit from residents of around 300,000 floors, could increase the year that comes to 10 per cent.
Checo youths are joining with Fernet and ron. The beer is no longer in the way, because it makes slow effect.
Fernet, ron, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen to their parents.
These are the drinks that cause youth drinking health care with a age less than 15 years of age.
Childs who end in the hospital continuously to overcome the rescue are no longer an exception.
This results from the experience of doctors with such cases in hospital pediatry admissions.
"Brink the wine is no longer in mode, because they're too late in throwing them."
"There are the strong alcohol drinks now", states the Chief of Pediatry of the Hośovice hospital in the centre of Bohemia, Ludśk Pelikán.
"When you can get a bottle to your father of the alacena, it may be whisky, but it usually is Fernet and Vodka."
"The vodka has the advantage of healing with sweet and not smiling so much," explains.
It also confirms the port of the Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinova.
" Normally, you're usually treating Fernet or ron."
"These are modern alcoholic drinks, especially among schoolers."
"In some cases, they use awaiting that they covered at home," adds Jurinova.
According to the Chief Pelikán, they are thirty-five-year-old drinkers who are often appearing in hospitals.
Before Hośovice, where he worked since this year, he worked for a decade in the carriage in Motol, where ambulances brought young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to get in four times."
"He took up to the twelve years when they brought it with 3.5 blood alcohol, in addition to a mixture with ecstasy," states the doctor of the Department on this case.
"He was found at the Holešovice Festival at some dance party."
"It's interesting, that his mother did not surprise him that his daughter was gone 48 hours," the chief surprised.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or even their clear tolerance towards drinking by their children, which is considered the main cause of increased alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, it is not possible to speak self-dependence.
"He is understood by alcohol to a person who has a chronic dependence of alcohol for several years, with all phenomena associated with the same, which is not produced in children."
"In those drinking alcohol repeatly, but it must be a systematically failed social or family environment", explains the chief Pelikán.
According to the Jurinova port, this year in Motol’s pediatric clinic have been hospitalized up to average November 40 workers.
However, statistics only show those who have a serious intoxication and should remain in the hospital.
Youth drinkers who, after the ambulant medical recognition, go home with their parents or with the police, do not account.
In addition to the cases where children are just gathering after the school and drinking, for Pelikán there are three statistical highlights that should be mentioned: the day of wedding, Fine of Year and the end of the school course.
"In such circumstances, drinks for bad notes or, on the contrary, celebrate the start of holidays."
"In the day of the bride I came to see in admissions until seven children ebriated the same time," added Pelikán.
Beverages who pass the night in disintoxy under the supervision of the doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day do not suffer a terrible resacon in their homes.
Morning head pain, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided by injection of a glucose sugar with glucose and with nutrients missing the body.
"They's bringing it much better, because after the smiling night, they get up well and don't hurt them."
"Only there are confuses about where they are", says Pelikán, adding that patients often lose good humor at least when they see the expenditure they have generated.
The transfer to ambulance and hospitalization in a room for serious patients is costing a decade of thousands of coronas.
"I often use the cost as a way to educe them, when I say them directly to the children how much their embryo has costed and they would have to pass all the summer in a job for young people to win enough to pay this night," adds Pelikán.
The medical insurance, in its opinion, may be a returning measure, which usually returns to persons the treatment costs, does not make it in the case of children drinking.
Two L-159 aircrafts are first in aircrafts in Spain
Two L-159 flights from a total of five, for which the Checa Defence Ministry replaced the C-295M Aviation, part of the March for Sevilla, where the manufacturer of the House - EADS aircraft was found.
It's the first time that a device of this type is found in the hands of someone who isn't the Czech army.
At the time, they were only in the foreign area to carry out flights of practices or demonstration.
This is the biplace version L-159T1, which until the time used the Checa army and was still able to fly.
The three remaining aircraft are the L-159 monoplace.
These are still maintained in Aer Vodochody and the intermediary of the sale, Omnipol company, has already been charged by them last week.
Jan Peješk, from the defence press department, indicates that it is still not known when the fysiologically retired planes of Vodochody will be removed.
"Monoplace aircraft L-159 were, instead, separated from the reparated aircraft long ago, without investment or additional contributions by the Ministry."
"The biplace L-159T1 changed in their current state," said Plavo Pejšek.
He added that the army was not left without biplace aircraft, since in May 2009 the army signed with Aer Vodochody a contract for a amount of 200 million coronaries for the construction of four unnecessary L-159 devices.
One of the new aircrafts has already received the army in July, the other will be delivered to the end of the year.
According to Pejšek, EADS understood that flights were added to the equipment of some aliad countries.
"The contract clearly indicates that the EADS company is to retire aircraft L-159 and will serve for the practices of NATO pilots."
"They, therefore, depends on the buyer to decide how to use them in this framework," says Pejšek.
The Hospodaá noviny newspaper published before the time that, for example, Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of 5 L-159 for a Casa flight and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.500 million colonies were approved last year by the Government of Mirec Topolánek.
The Defence Minister did not convoke an offer for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current defence address states that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159 to the foreign.
The Czech army purchased Aer 72 aircrafts, so only uses 24, so he wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of aircrafts house may have judicial consequences.
The European Commission has already condemned the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice because it should choose aircrafts by carrying out an European appeal and not to contact a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three Casa flights, and the last should arrive to Kbely's Prague Airport in 14 days.
A larger index than the cancer indicates a lower risk of cancer suffering
Mans who have the longest index of the cancer are subject to a less risk of suffering prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Monday in a British magazine on cancer.
They could depend on the textsterone level, the male hormone.
"Their results indicate that the relative debt length can be a simple test of the risk of suffering prostate cancer, especially for men with a age of 60 years," stated the coautor of the Ros Eeles study, Professor of the Institute for Cancer Research at the Warwick University.
Therefore, debt could help to determine what men should be subjected to a test of prostate cancer, especially if this character is associated with a genetic risk or other harmful factors such as family health problems, as indicated in Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, follow-up was performed with a British homolog of more than 1.500 patients with prostate cancer and simultaneously 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the indic dense of the right hand more shorter than the angle.
The same probability was to suffer prostate cancer as 19% of those whose dents were from the same length.
In the case of men with a larger index than anular dense, this risk was reduced by 33%; for men with less than 60% the reduction reached 87%.
The relationship between the two dents concerned, determined during the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the feto is exposed in the matrix.
A lower textsterone level corresponds to a larger index.
Previous studies indicated that the teststerone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great cheque and former President of the Scientific Academy, Professor Václav Pačes, said that he knows the study, but that he does not seem to be the relationship between the dent length and cancer can be "demonstrated fully".
Czech Republic under snow: D1 and D5 are closed
Checa, as most of Europe, loved the juvenile quarter of snow.
The roads and oils are mainly covered by compact snow, and the shipping machines have circulated all night by numerous areas.
During the morning, D5 was closed between the kms 89 and 93 in direction to Rozvadov because of several accidents of industrial and tourism, as well as D1 in Brin in direction to Prague.
The news transmitted them to the operator of the Ústedniyo autotoklubu (UMAMK).
In the mile 91, a truck was shocked in 93, two industrial vehicles that caused damage.
several tourists also ended in the kitchen.
There are also problems in the D1 car in the 185 km direction to Prague.
There they shocked two trucks.
The drivers should slowly round after Brno in the 190 kilometer or cross Brno and be included in the 182 km in Køvalce.
There have been some knifes of several kilometers.
An accident also occurred in the D11 road, just along with Prague.
Praga is covered by a skill of several centimeters and the thermometers indicate -7 or C.
For example, they are training tops in Prosek, although it is also congestioned čtrboholská.
The safeest transport is the metro.
The circles circle with a delay, for example, in the line between Karlovo námśsti and Námśsti Míru.
On the eighth morning, another crisis state in Prague will be produced.
The problems are also affected by rail and airports.
As a result of the nest, the Czech Railway company deserved seven connections for three speeds.
The problems, for example, affect the line between Prague and Kingupy or Praga and Beroun.
The travellers should check what the current situation is.
Ruzyn Airport was closed from Tuesday night to five of the morning.
Today, most of the roads of South Moravia can be circulated, but with extreme precaution.
In Vyškovska are closed to the movement three secondary roads, in Brnčnska are forming nest languages and Blaenska needs chains to access some higher access to higher points.
One of the most affected places was Vyškovsko.
Eventually, the connections are closed: Russianov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
The fressors will be required to rip them out.
For the time you can't say when the movement will be opened.
In Hodoninska, there is a career required in the Bílé Karpaty area (white Carpates).
The roads of the region which, since this is a protected natural area, must simply be stopped in inerte state, are cumulated up to five centimeters of snow, as indicated in the MTK.
In Checa, between two and ten centimeters of snow, more than north of Bohemia, where the neighborhood reached 18 centimeters.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, we caught around 15 centimeters of snow.
Nevadas gradually return to Checa.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapons"
The American army is employed in Afghanistan a new "intelligent" weapons known only by the name XM-25.
The generals expect that the new rifle influences the local conflict with the Taliban and that "changing the progress of the game" makes their victory.
The new weapons are like a small weapon and with a extremely precise point.
Your guns are shooted with a laser with a precision of several meters.
The special ammunition of 25 mm of calibre created for this rifle and the high load of explosives that contain actually functions as a small granate.
Projects can be programmated to exploit not only when they attack the target, but at any point in their balistic tractory.
They can be used against enemies who are hidden after an obstacle, a wall or a tricky.
Uncertainly, you can not use a normal protection and, when your rain swimming rain of metal shoes, it can be essential in the battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new gun is the first weapon for childhood that uses a "intelligent" technology.
"The soldiers handle it in such a way they find the goal, point their laser ray, which determines the distance, then obtains a precise miracle and, in the same way, corrects the projection line and approve the gate. "
"We say that 503 meters have been measured."
"When the chat is pulled, the weapon is loaded and launched the project to a distance of 543 metres, less than one, two or three meters," says Audette.
400 jobs are transferred
Fujitsu consortium was transferred to Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of the next year, 400 employees will change their workplace of their previous office building in the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg at Astro Park.
The Japanese consortium Fujitsu was transferred to Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As he informed the giants of the specialized sector in computers and its maintenance, 400 men and women will be transferred in July of its previous Marienbader office building in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a great complex of offices on the Lyoner Street Street in the Niederrad barrier, Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu port explained that at the average of 100 other employees more than the consorcio, which were previously designed by the region, will be located there.
The offer is very attractive, and the collective office in Astro Park will also favour the way workers work.
Moreover, Fujitsu will be the only inquiry in Bad Homburg.
The director Bernd Wagner said, "In Franfkurt-Niederrad we found a central placement with a excellent infrastructure."
The brilliant connection with the airport is very important today for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new changing of a significant company in the region resulted in joyful yesterday among those who were favorable and deception among those who were opposed.
Frankfurt's Economy Section Chief Markus Frank (CDU) stated that there has been a Global Player.
This is a "magnical recognition of the placement".
Fujitsu is located in the city, the residence is a great impulse for the Niederrad.
Bod Hombruger's alcalde, Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regrets the decision of Fujitsu.
The address was informed before the city about its intention.
"We offered the company our help," Korwisi stated.
However, the good contacts from the computer manufacturer with the owner of Marienbader Platz could not change the difficulties.
At the end and final, the economic reasons caused the fall.
Thus, there is now a great empty place that covers the famous place.
"I hope the owner and the owner of the building will show cooperation."
The immobile used previously by Fujitsu in the Rathausplatz and the neighborhood "Verticale Kile" were part of the sovereign buildings of Marienbader Platz for 10 years ago from a convergent project on the balneary city.
As a joint project of the city and a private company of projects between station and household, it is a new entry to the city, which is responsible for the massage building that previously used shoes as shopping places and building levels.
In 2001, the investment advisory and calculation companies, the software manufacturer for reservations systems, the Amadeus Start, and then joined Siemens with the Fujitsu computer manufacturer house.
In 2006, the building employed by Fujitsu was acquired by the real estate group of Frankfurt, German Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later returned to Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu Consortium, which is the Oriente of Tokyo, is recognized as the third largest IT provider.
It provides companies, such as computers and servers, and provides specific services.
The sucursal in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, in all ways Fujitsu accounts with more business in Munich.
Field Fujitsu Technology Solutions is located from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following branches in this place will be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
This is why 7.000 square meters have been hired in the Astro Park office building.
The old complex of the twenty-five years, its name aludes its plan with a star form, hotels between others to the central electronic association and the electronic industry.
Amazon cancel the server - Amenazas against Assange
The anxiety is increasingly supported by Wikileaks.
The Amazon Internet Service provider has removed the opening platform of your server.
It may be back to political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, seems to be detained in England.
Wikileaks’ revelations platform is always the white of the critics, always stronger in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are currently looking for an Internet patriarch in Europe.
The famous American senator, Joe Madrman, calls other countries and companies to Wikileaks' boicot.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, which is located in the list of people searching for Interpol, must remain detained in Great Britain, according to a article.
"Whileaks issued from Amazon's server."
"Freely shut up in the country of freedom", reported the public activists of the revelations through Twitter message service on Thursday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company Amazon had removed the Wikileaks documents from his server.
Internet activists had recurred to publish secret diplomatic documents to Amazon Services website so that they could face high access to documents.
By Twitter, Wikileaks explained: "Perfect, we will allow our dollars to contract people in Europe."
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, "he should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped the use of his server through Wikileaks, after an employee of Senator Joe loverman had requested investigations, informed the CNN chain according to a call to the Ladyrman office.
The President of the Senate's Security Council had threatened Amazon with boicot, informed the British Guardian.
"I had wished Amazon to take these measures before the previous information publications classified by Wikileaks," said the Senator.
It also requested that the platform also prohibite the use of the server in other countries.
"The illicit, monstruous and unconscious process of Wikileaks puts our national security into game and threats to life in the world", stated in an independent senator communication.
"No firm responsible, either American or foreign, must help Wikileaks with its service to extend robbed material.
The founder of Wikileaks, Assange, which is seen in Sweden for a suspect of violation, is located in the list of people searched for Interpol.
According to a article of the London newspaper “The Independent”, the Australian of 39 years is detained in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
The Internet activist has constantly qualified research in Sweden as a trauma of his enemy.
The Wikileaks porter, Christinn Hrafnsson, stated in London that there have been threats.
"I was even called on a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why I'm afraid of the security of Assange, Mr. Hrafnsson stated.
Therefore, the location of the Wikileaks founder continues to be discovered.
Hrafnsson obviously reacted to the statements of North America.
In America, the former Republic of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, stated that the Wikileaks statements should be judged by tragic and must be executed.
In Canada, he stated an advisor of the government chief Stephen Harper, clearly with irony, on the television, Assange should "slaughter" and Obama could "use a drone".
Among the White House and Assange grows a great debate.
Robert Gibbs, President of the United States Barack Obama, was qualified by "riddle and absurde" that Assange had requested the department of the State Secretariat, if she was responsible for recently ordering diplomates to participate in sponjage tasks.
"I'm not sure why we should importate the opinion of a type with a web page", said Gibbs.
"Our external policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than their website."
The American Government must demonstrate the effectiveness of the protection of its databases in general.
Russell Travers, Adjunct Director of the National Terrorism Centre, was appointed an exceptional task, announced the White House.
Travers is responsible for developing the important structural reforms, which are necessary to the light of Wikileaks filtering.
The White House also wants to check the ways, as well as to change the full information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the American Government announced that to be taken on the security of departments and activistas, Wikileaks' publications should be threatened.
"We've done everything possible to contact them", stated Philip Crowley's portal.
"We're prepared to help protect them if it was necessary."
The university of the heavy
The "Gelato University" in Bolivia is prepared in the best times of the year.
The basic course of three days for future helders has the maximum influence and visitors throughout the world.
Really where the whole heat comes?
The glacier and the gelatorium.
The heavier prepares the cream in accordance with all the rules of Italian art for the preparation of helmets.
The helium spends with a spot the helmet of the displayer, exhibits it on the ship and sell it.
To know this, it doesn't need to go to Anzola of Emilia in the province of Bolivia.
But whoever wants to know more about helles should not visit the "Gelato University" of Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the iron university with the frozen in 2003, so that the helmet of its machines comply with Italian high ideals in all parts.
The basic course of three days for future helders has the maximum influence and visitors throughout the world.
There are also more special courses for more days on chocolate heated and practices in the heavy of your own home.
In these times of crisis, some play with a new professional career, others rise in the swimming pool their desires.
This time are 40 participants from 19 countries of all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, Professor of this art in California, loves the short movement of food and in the future wants to offer an European quality product on the land of the industrial helmet.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business adviser and wants to create something own in some years within an enormous work.
Two young Egyptians suggest opening a heavy in the Cairo.
A man from Malta and another of Brazil wants to improve the quality of the hells of their bars, and a Canadian house love, Julia, comes because their children love Italian hells.
Head of Luciano Ferrari explains the ideal quality of the perfect helmet later to the participants.
It is not only decisive for his good pleasant, but also for his sweetness and its good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his training or birth cover of the national high house and mainly from the country: "The Italian ice is just the best, and therefore every ball has something romantic."
The first step to preparation seems easy.
Luciano escapes the basic ingredients: milk, nata, powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large battle, which smells all with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and at the moment he swallowed it up to four degrees.
Then open the machine's grip and get a pastorized white base cream, the base for all types of milk flows.
Unfortunately, the teacher asks: Can healing cream only be designed with natural or without a stealing element?
How can some desire to experiment?
Lucian advises to get away from the trends of the time.
The one who speaks of helmet "not only of natural ingredients", at the best time has used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar-goma, cold.
Of course, you can be prepared helmet without stabilizer, there is only one day to buy it, put it in a tass and the customer will smell a heat of granite.
Some variations are allowed in the basic mass.
They're using aromas.
As regards the fat, Master Luciano distinguishs between the ingredients that are purchased in the fruit section or in the sweet of the supermarket.
Goodbye, there are powders and pastas.
"All suppliers will try to collapse ingredients aromated in their goods."
"But you have to try."
Be already with fruit sorbetes with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or even with the white base mass ice cream, that with eggs will become a amazing cream and with powder as a basis for all possible chocolate funerals.
Now the participants of the course can use the helidars.
Lucian let them make every time four different types of shock, chocolate, moca and avellana, with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less grain aroma or other natural ingredients.
Realize the same experiment also with fruit iron types.
It knows better not necessarily depends on having more aroma of topha or cleaner fruits.
It is not necessary that the healing of ambassadors beats seed fruit, if there are more adventures.
The working group develops the sweet helmet of kiwi, which uses more fruits, less water and something less stabilizer.
First, a balanced mixer highlights the helmet sacred, says Luciano.
The preparation of helmets is a problem of artimetic: the melocoton clean is used with a lot of sugar, the proportion of sugar of the basic receipt must be decreased.
For the limon flow there is no additional part of sugar.
Luciano takes a tool to determine the quantity of fruit sugar (measuring of the winter for Oechsle in the wine).
Happily, tables facilitate the account.
Developing heat requires not more than physical application, as previously.
It is not only helping the utmost for the automatic processing of the basic mass.
There is also a instrument, where it is shocked simultaneously the prepared heat mixture and was frozen at the temperature below zero.
Nevertheless, all automatization remains out of the small folder.
The brazilian Gustavo is missing himself and his companions from the top to the top with pure fruits, like if it was a gigantic minipresser without control.
"In all courses," says Master Luciano, "that's just a question of time that happens something like that."
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European Food Safety Authority has been infiltrated in the industry experienced with transgenic plants.
This issue is currently the group of experts of Testbiotech, which is considered an institution for the independent assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
"In a conspiration theory, but we did not document it well," Christoph Then, director of Witness Tech, said Monday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, director of the Ephsa expert group on genetically modified plants, and another expert of Efsa has also been contracted for years in the Ilsi Association.
Consorts such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer cost it.
Kuiper has significantly cooperated in the control rules of genetically modified plant plants, which is in a clear conflict of interest, criticizes Then.
The provisions of Efsa are in paragraphs with the same terms as the documentation of the Ilsi situation and imitate the company's writing, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
It is the second time that Testbiotech criticizes a collection of interests.
Thus, recently, a Ephsa's high-range manager was without support or transitional time to Swiss Agriarkonzern Singenta, and has changed with that his band.
Shortly, also Mediadeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) revealed personal connections between the EU inspection authorities and the industry, which carried out by the Environment Officer General, as well as a clear EU Parliamentary.
However, Efsa cannot recognise any conflict of interest.
All formal data, as well as some of the industry, are ordered in a report.
The experts working in Efsa are not required that they have no contact with the industry.
But they should be exposed to these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
It is called itself as a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and policy, inter alia for the assessment of the risk for biotechnology without the load of Lobby.
In this issue, independent experts such as Then criticize that transgenic plants are currently allowed without investigating food for animals and that the influence of the genetically modified plants in the environment is not checked.
"We want to know what, for example, the maize genetically modified in the agriculture", says Then.
The current practice consists of verifying only isolated proteins, but not the entire transgenic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If no risks are searched, how are you going to find?", asked, accused, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck thinks the same way.
Since 1994, science investigates the field of genetic engineering and currently works in the Zurich Technical Institute.
In this area, the industry is increasingly trying to influence or dissuade critical scientists in the United States and in Europe.
So there are few scientists that are not influenced by consorts.
For enterprises, critical studies are not generally published.
"The industry controls security research", says Hilbeck.
The raster of the stones
Uli Gsell has achieved some, in total 400 kg.
Monday was before Stuttgart station, with Tuba to the shoes.
There were manifestations
Nevaba.
The story is known: In September, they arrived the scatters and began to throw a great throne of the northern ala.
The land of Stuttgart never again was the same: thousands and thousands were demonstrated against the s21, the suspension of millions in the station.
As precisely, the majority of the alpha was shocked.
Round in 6.000, 7.000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rugish stone, rising between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
A couple of strikes have been assured.
"These stones are religious."
"Don't have to disappear."
It is entusiasmed: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and natural."
As once he said, he was smoke of the cigarettes.
I still don't know what he'll do with the throats.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell also.
The stone raster of Stuttgart leads to a forest in Tubingen in a previous deposit of ammunitions from the French army, where Manuel Rongen established his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man is treating old stones.
He purchased everything resulting from demonition in Stuttgart.
"I would have dishonored, smiling the grave or send it to the shooter," says in his office, a wood box that once it was a guard box.
He was insulted and threatened, explaining, when in September, in the newspapers, which had purchased the rest of the northern low to the waste company.
He spoke to the enemy of 21S for several days.
And she explained that I couldn't do anything for the dry.
And when it happened, it was the most reasonable, when the stones continued out.
Some 200 S21 enemy took the mass of 80 kilograms cut, with a switch price from 6,50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as remembering but also with the hope of the power of returning it to a reconstruction.
Rongen had purchased 500 tonnes, 25 trucks.
Nearly half of the forest is still in the forest, the rest has been sold.
Duration of gardens, gardens from landscapes, managed by projects.
They came out of all parts and took what they could take into the sleeves and above.
The stone of Stuttgart of the impulse has long been converted into the wall or Kröuterbetten's delimitation.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," Rongen says.
"If it wasn't the political component."
Following your whole earth, it takes a tour for its great kingdom of 20 hectares.
He studied right, interrupted his studies, and later biology, interested in computers and finally worked with stones.
And it's loved by stones.
Go to 4.000 tonnes of stone.
Transport your treasures all over Germany.
He said to be the greatest trader of old stones in the country.
Frena.
In the snow there are artists of picated sandistic stones.
"Their belongings to the point of Dresden Marienbrücke," explains.
Calize alba, amarilla, calid, entusiasmed.
"My loved stone."
The way crosss the forest.
It's a lot: Arenisca red, a previous strike from the Karlsruhe station.
And continue.
"Travery sweet."
Anciently the mazizos belonged to the tribe of Stuttgart.
For all parts of the snow, stones and history, amazing traverty of the police headquarters of Stuttgart, red grain of the Sankt Blasien Church, in the hospital of Heilbronner.
That's a job, that's a lot of efforts, that's awesome.
When Rongen thinks about how he screwed before the stones and moved them with a simple appearance and a cart, he feels very dedicated.
"I'd be a scandale if something would be destroyed."
It has not been rich, in absolutely very rich.
But today 14 people had to do the stone treater, also canters, a sculptor, a fool, a veder, and a garden have been installed above in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfied," said the man who is in charge of use of the rest.
He's got to go to Colonia in a little bit.
There are also stones to save.
Trust of talents around great potentials
Rejoice an active afluence in the buffet.
16 students are cut around the panecilles, the tomate soup and the sweet.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Vokswagen manufacturer of cars have invited a talent to mechanical engineering and design students.
In a type of ideas, they need to talk about the car of future with VW workers and also learn everything about Volkswagen.
Recalling and in the same way, many enterprises, such as VW, are gathering in a body fight around the most privileged minds in cooperation with universities.
Your mission: To contract students with more talent from universities before they enter the job market and to be contracted by others.
And since universities do not facilitate publications on their students' skills, they are trying to attract exceptional talents in practical projects and capture them.
The second project day at Braunscheig Technical University, the consortium wins talents.
A lady of the staff department departments boligraphs, gomits and folders with the VW logo.
Explains the illusioned young talents the practice programs and works for students and shows their ways in the consortium.
Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig carries the project with VW.
It benefits both parties: "Learnings enter into contact with the industry and purchase experience."
"In their time, VW can know students, observe more closerly the interesting candidates and consider them as possible future workers."
Some collaborations, says Selle, are not little common.
The newness is in which students are so desired so directly.
"The main point was previously found in the technical projects", says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates is worse.
In many branches, companies cannot already choose their employees between a large group of demandors.
If you don't have to announce and, above all, to obtain a high-qualified work hand.
All students of Engineering disciplines are in a excellent negotiation situation.
According to the Alemana Engineering Association (VDI) in Germany, there were 40,000 vacant engineers in October.
And, according to the VDI prognostics, this empty of engineers will grow even more.
In the auditory and advisory company, KPMG, Roman Dykta is responsible for the talent box.
It organises costly contract events, such as KPMG, a modern type of yincane, where participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send to eight very promising students to the US next year.
Furthermore, participants may observe KPMG's branches and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go into two election rounds in the output.
Only the creation of many participants is going to the U.S.
universities are increasingly experiencing in choosing and cleaning the high potential of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the cart we want to emphasize the mass."
"The simple traject was only a short."
For Dykta's catalysts the notes and results.
"Together, we have a similar action in the last year with all participants."
"Some are close to their end, and they want to ask for work with us," says.
In addition to the direct approach in the campus, they are also at the castle, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, classical with their work holidays.
"We tried to get students in the specialized holidays."
"Solar intersolar," Sytha Stübe states, as a staff responsible for the Solar Technology manufacturer world.
The Bonner company has about 1.500 employees in Germany.
Stebe knows the problem of the new generation.
Currently on the company's website appears 35 vacation posts.
"It's been very complicated to fill the vacation posts."
"It's a lot of time and money," says.
A shorter way is the contact with the teachers of the university.
Solar world cooperates with several higher schools, for example, the University of Freiberg.
"Professional teachers suggest that they can do practices with us or carry out their tests.
There are no public campaigns for solar experts.
This is why the company needs to be promoted with other advantages: personal environment, swimming jearchy and comfortable communication.
"A great consortment can normally not offer it", says Stebe, the staff responsibilities.
In searching for employment, money is no longer the most important.
Decisive factors are flexible work hours, children's assistance or good-ascension opportunities.
According to a study of Great Place to Work Instituts, Solarworld has the place 55 among the 100 best employees in Germany.
The institution prepares a annual list of the best German employment providers.
For the question of the employee, I satisfy that it is with the work and the environment in the same way and observes the predetermination of employees.
Stabe, the staff task also expects additional points in its classification for its aspirants to work.
"I think that the applicant is particularly set out in the external classifications of a potential employer," said.
Wolf Reiner Warler of the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want a long-term strategy that will be a good name as employees.
Advise your customers the most authenticity.
And that means, according to the warler, mostly internal measures.
"The best way to be attractive as employee passes through the own employees", ensures.
In the sector's gear, it is called Employer Branding Internal, also promoting corporate identity within its own template.
"Another satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
When it works well with people and identifies it with the company, then the employee is directly promoted by friends and friends.
"It's like a game with pandilla," says the warler.
Obama holds new oil perforation
From the coast of the United States of Florida to the Golf of Mexico, in these years no new oil perforation appeared.
The Government of Washington issued a condensed prohibition and thus cancelled its previous plans in an unacceptable manner.
The Atlantic coast also remains new perforations that are now seen.
This announced the Minister of Internal, Ken Salazar, the Tuesday.
What caused this strict prohibition, which will at least take the next five years, is the explosion of the petroleum platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the deterioration that the life costs for 11 workers and caused the greatest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had granted new perforements in the west of the Mexico Golf under the pressure of opposition and industry.
The parties wanted to decrease the dependence of the United States of new foreign oil supply.
Even today, it has not been cleared about who is the responsibility of the unreparable black marine in the golf.
The British Energy Consortium BP is located in the centre of the criticism, which is faced with millions of demands.
A research commission undertaken by Obama will present its results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the minister of the Interior, led the perforationmoratory after the explosion.
Afterwards, various petrolean consorts submitted requests for new perforation attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to defeat a new disaster by using more harder controls and more strict security regulations.
Currently, the responsible control authority, which has been accused of corruption charges, has fallen in decrease, is being reformed in root.
A parallel advertising that the lucrative fiscal lamps will be closed for oil and gas consorts.
The industry publicly announces that total extraction in the golf will be less thanks to a more strict regulation, until date.
" Government plans are the largest fren for the growth of oil and gas industry," says the current survey carried out by the Advisory company BDO before the prohibition of extraction of Monday.
American Energy Alliance claims the insecurity in the sector: "Nobody knows what changes exactly with the regulation."
Investment in new extraction projects will soon be extended in detriment of growth.
Ogoniland is ruined
The water of the rivers is oil marron, sweet as a gas line: thousands of green litres have destroyed the nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live from rob, corruption and illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari looks good.
"Don't smell you," he calms the environmental activist to journalists: "How is going to pass oil enough before your eyes."
The Nigerian of 37 years has been able to photo kids walking in the water to the skin with the light reflected in turbulences on the surface: With the colorful water light, the scene seems almost beautiful.
We don't see that on the floor they're frozen oil sharks.
Before here, he was swinging legs, explaining Esther Badom on the east of the Bodo-Jetty River.
At the time, fluid waters are totally dead.
Five years ago, in the formed humidal form, a impressive amount of oil was covered by a rotating tube.
The fish of the surroundings of the small town of Bodo had to take six hours to reach full fishing waters: which, in the heart of the Niger delta and located in Ogoniland, is considered one of the most affordable regions in the world.
In the way of the river's rear which pass by eating, the extensive desolation results obviously.
Instead of clear water, the ship engine removes a marble heat, who summers its hand in the water, will cut some full of oil.
The roots of the eating trees are high from the ground as dark palms of regaliz, and they are tristely isolating the palms that shock and shock their palms.
In vanour they are looking for bands of birds, as if they were in the humidal as always: When the outside barrier is rolled, there is a fantastic type of calm of a previous paradise with gasoline oil.
"What happens here is a ecological struggle," says, ham, Celestine Akpobari. "We lived in constant danger for health."
The baile comparison will be.
The area of the ogoni residence is a reign of battle field for years: over 60 years ago the first European operators were cut down here, there was organized the first resistance in the 80s with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, where they had to put their first manufacture Shell consortium in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for oil employers.
Even today, it is prohibited for enterprises to Ogoniland: While they bombed more than two million black gold barriles in the whole delta region, three times greater than Switzerland, with more than 5,000 sources of extraction and 7.000 miles of tuberculosis, oil fields in Ogoniland were quiet, the location is too instable for consortium.
Each twenty-century meters exceeded steel platforms as water sculptures: "Baths of ships" were caredly called the heads of the perforadors.
They have up to 50 years, most of them have a total corrosion.
Each moment falls a head, thinks Acpobari, where a constant oil chorus in the water.
According to the evaluations of experts, more than 2 billion litres in 50 years have been found in the ecosystem of the delta: Year after year, the amount of penetra oil, such as the ship "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the Sea of Alaska, one of the largest echoological disasters of the history of mankind.
Whoever is responsible for the long-term environmental region, it will lead to it.
While shell's consortium and oil robbers are responsible for more than 90 percent of contamination, ecologists see the heads to break and tubers with fires as the main causers.
In Nigeria, Shel applies mainly low security standards in the world, reproached the scientific Richard Steiner to the consortium in 2008: only the tuberculosis defects index are "too much greater than in another place".
In a place, which seems to be forgotten from far, appears a full oil tanner under the free sky, appears figures of among the eatings: they are sneaked and covered by oil.
Among one of the many barriles, who sometimes are bound to perforation, sometimes arbitraryly dispersed on the ground, flame a fire: a small illegal relief.
In the barriel, oil is calmed in the more hours of fire, explains Michael, the chief of the group.
First of all, the gasoline pinees through the tubers in the ceiling, later the skin oil tube and finally salt diesel.
In this way, Michael and four employees are produced daily to four 300 litres diesel barriles: "We have 34,000 nairs", around $22.
Detaine habitats use fuel shortage in one of the largest oil states in black Africa.
Nigeria only accounts with a single resident.
With the absurd and low price of the diesel of only 40 euros-cept per litro, illegal calendars can also offer less: thus reduce the value of their primary material.
It comes from the "bunkers" which took the network of tubers that crossed Ogoniland: According to experts, this step lost at least 16 million litres of oil per day in the entire part of the Niger.
Only an unsigned part of the preserved first material is clearly refined in an illegal manner: organized criminal networks, which also belong to political and high military charges, keep the best part in aljibes and sell it in the world market.
Activist Akpobari considers fully academic the debate on whether the environmental disaster should be better in the manner of the population or the flow of production.
"If oilers do not behave as invasions and have not had completely destroyed the natural habitat of fish, there would be no sambatage, nor robs, nor illegal resins."
While the conditions of the ogons are mostly destroyed by Shell to the point that only appears a deduction of consortium: "I want to be better present to another nationality, such as China."
Michael is nervous.
"I'll be time to disappear you," says the muscle Olimann.
"The soldiers can come in any minute."
If the army's special unit takes the illegal rebuilders, it does not threaten them to arrest them, if not with a painful soborn.
Soldiers from the north also want, like all the Nigerians, to benefit from the first material.
"This condemned invent has made pieces full to our country", says Akpobari.
Researchers detect dangerous factory defects in the A380 engines
It seems that A380 has a great security problem.
In an investigation of a machine that carried out a forced atterrissage, researchers found a possible factory defect, which could produce "a catastrophic failure in the engine".
Qantas airport wants to ask the engine manufacturer.
The Qantas Airbus passengers who experienced a emergency at the beginning of November had much more luck than what can be imagine: Australian air security authorities thanks to their investigations a great security problem in the engines of some A380, and warned the possible factory defect.
The potential defect has complicated effects: In a connection of malnutrition, fixes can be caused by a fat or grieve, the ATSB authorities have announced in a juvenile report published.
This could have caused "a catastrophic failure in the engine."
This affected the motors manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 flights of the A380 series.
Among those found the Qantas-Airbus that had to carry out a forced aircraft on November 4th in Singapore.
Australian airport starts legal media against the manufacturer of British turbines.
He sent a request in the Federal Court of Sidney that could provide more legal measures against the company.
Alan Cœdès, director of Qantas, declared that his airline would call for compensation for the incident of November principles.
In the motor brand, they lost pieces and its board is deteriorated.
Rolls Royce distinguishs the type of gas as the cause of damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines around the world have to be displaced.
Australian investigators announced that they will carry out more security tests to superbows with the motors affected.
The security recommendation is the result of a cooperation with Rolls Royce, stated by Martin Dolan, ATSB's portal.
The security problem has become the sufficiently important to inform all affected ones.
After the Qantas device’s emergency aeroplane, the airline kept its A380 fleet on earth for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines maintained about three of its 11 A380 temporaryly on earth.
Air was the engine of A380 as a precaution measure.
This double aircraft is the largest passenger flight in the world.

Godche Bank is looking for a buyer for its gymnastic tours
The German Bank wants to separate its symbol: According to a article, the financial institution seeks buyer for its office towers at Frankfurt's headquarters.
The ownership could provide up to 500 million euros.
The German Bank recently resolved its headquarters: the gemell tours were modernized in the Frankfurt banks barrier; while bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortment wants to appear to benefit the costs of the reunification, and search for a buyer for both rascaciels, as the "Financial Times Germany" states, based on a portion.
The portal does not designate the reasons for the sale in the project.
"We always verify whether the property should be owned or sell, and then return to homes," said.
As a result, the largest credit institution in Germany returns to dismiss the company's headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank purchased the gemell towers in the average 2007 by 272 million euros from the investor of a house fund, and then implemented the relevant arrangements.
Energy reforms reached a number of EUR 200 million.
A sale would like a lot of money for the bank.
The experts of this area calculate the value of the tours of the newspaper renamed as "Greentowers" in around 500 million euros.
If the buildings are renewed in a bank fund or an independent investor have not been discovered today, the portfolio has stated.
Thousands of people of fight for failed mines
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought in the seed mines, which were defeated after many explosions in a mine.
There was no chance of finding chairs, since security measures are still precarious in the place of distress.
About two weeks ago there was an intense explosion in the Pike River mining near the city of Greymouth.
29 mines of age between 17 and 62 years were entered in the mine.
A survey was introduced in the place of disgrace, but it did not find any sign of survival.
Because of the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue equipment could be decreased for security reasons.
After the second intense detonation, the authorities and experts declared that there were no possibilities to survive miners.
The body could not be restored until the date.
The family and friends currently remember those who have fallen with a remindering act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the flattering sunlight in Greymouth in the southern island.
You keep silence for two minutes.
In home of the settled mines, 29 tables were placed with castles, lamps and mine names.
He also had personal photos and objects, under clothing and surf tables.
The flags were located at the middle of the country's government buildings.
New Zealand hoped that mines return to the surface "of the depths of the land", said John Key, President of the Neozeland government, to the participants of the Memorial Act.
"But they never returned home."
He cannot take his son's death until he didn't see his body, Lawrie Drew stated, whose son Zen was sepulated in the mine.
With the President of the Government and the families of the victims, many foreign diplomates participated in the Memorial Act.
At the first explosion, on 19 November, mines were also settled from British and South African origin.
Saving workers started expansioning a fire within the carbon mine in the southern island of New Zealand.
As explosive gases have been extracted, the abrassive temperatures of the mine will begin to fall down, says Gary Knowles, the police higher, to the journalists.
Shit, warrier!
Does the goat goes in the art cine?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn returns to explore the gender borders with its epoch of battles "Walhalla Rising".
In what public will the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have been thinking about rounding "Walhalla Rising"?
A viking warrior captured with a single eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is free of his torturers and killing his enemy with almost superhuman fights, it is ideal for young spectators who are looking for bloody action, precisely because our heritage likes to use brutal methods to kill and launch their enemies the trips of their body with life when he is a bad humor.
On the other hand, Onejo, as in reality is called, does not say almost any word during the whole film and other characters stop taking for as much one or two phrases or a couple of dead crys.
On the contrary, they are calling and enjoying the great and terrorized montuous landscapes of Scozia, which the bastiers offer the viking world some thousand years ago.
Better ideal for growing and interested cinemats in existingism and very quiet camera movements.
When a film has several recipient groups, it is a punishment that cannot be discarded mutually.
The director Winding Refn considers his sakes and trilogy on "Pusher" drug traffickers as a Danish type of version of Quentin Tarantino, but it is fairly refused to make its works for all publics with something more humor in the main course or something less brutal from the artistic house.
A brain mass and a trip that brotan can't depend on most of the followers of the art cine.
The majority of the fans of the action die from abroad, if one takes a ship to Jerusalem with a troop of violent cristal missionaries for interpretative reasons, and there is a everlasting life in peace and nest before his team comes to America and returns to calling there.
It's the latest that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a film distributor in Germany and is only published in DVD.
It is a disaster against the magnificent images, but also because, after the presuntuous and bloody fatal, a piece of cine sometimes is hidden, which worth some attention.
This film does not treat dialogues or logical action, everything is atmosphere, a febril dream transformed into film.
And so there is no shock for spectators.
Refn is just a moment of relaxation and its glass pictures and the sweet sound band makes him a cloud in your gargant, especially the amazing hate, which from the hearts of the persons goes to him.
Only a small young sweet, who supports the One faithfully, keeps something like innocence, all the others are possessed by anger.
However, the hero of a single eye, whose reasons are never explained, becomes at any time a warrior coming from hell to the enemy and provisional partners, perhaps in the embassy of the same devil.
It represents the loss, but maybe only for those who are lost in any way.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious movie that can be hated and admired, to enthusiasm, changed and surprised.
A experience.
Misterious land movements
The OIEA Nuclear Energy Organization has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country refuses to view this topic until controls are allowed.
On the average night from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli fighting aircraft F-15 I attacked a mystery cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the east of Eurorates; the largest and nearest city, 30 km is Dair as-Saur.
His name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Organization (OIEA), which is a reactor that, in view of the Syrians, built with aid from North Korea on the cube, hidden in a valle coming from the river.
According to the U.S. International Intelligence Service of the CIA at the end of April 2008, a reactor is designed under the name of the very suitable nearby El-Kibar for plutonium production, with nuclear weapons.
Instead, the technique only serves for other purposes than for those of the 50s.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blue satellite images.
They showed an animation by computer where the reactor components were before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the Norwegian model of the Yongbyon nuclear center.
Moreover, they taught photos that showed the building from the nearby or inside.
It was a short time ago that the reactor was in operation, says, but he was not equipped with fuel bars.
Today, three years later of the bomb, it's just more known than that at the time, the enigmes were made more than the time.
The previous President of the United States, George W. Bush recently discovered in his memories that before the CIA attack was absolutely sure that Syrians had built a reactor in the Kibar, but only saw indications that the country would exist "a nuclear weapons programme".
In Europe, several secret service agents prefer to be more careful and only talking about a "reactor", although they consider the CIA's presentation as "speakable".
There is no solid tests, as well as the IAEA.
When it was asked to be sure that it was before a reactor, a high diplomat of the United Nations responded in summer the IAEA ' s "a sufficient material to have questions".
The Syrians switched a lot of rapidly from the shadows of the presumed "unused military building" and shooted the land to consciousness.
However, in June 2008, an OIEA team under the command of the former inspector Olli Heinonen found uranium races in the Kibar, which had been produced by people.
In addition, the IAEA obtained satellite images on a Member State, commercial salers at the right time after the attack, which should have a higher information value than those submitted by the CIA.
However, these photos did not reach the market because a unknown customer, perhaps Israel, has purchased them in an exclusive manner.
The IAEA is therefore not able to verify its authenticity independently.
Syria always understood that he had never had a secret nuclear programme or built any reactor.
The uranium carried out of the Israeli weapons, explained Damaskus.
OIEA rejected it as inverosimil after analysis of particulates.
Since then, Damaskus refuses to discuss on this matter, as regards satellite images.
In addition, controllers are prohibited a second inspection in the El-Kibar and the entry into the bombed building.
The Israelites also observe a strict silence.
"We will never comment", Ehud Olmert, first minister in function at the time of the attack, has recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not produced results since June 2008 and "is progressively transformed into a serious problem of credibility for the authorities", as an Western high-ranging diplomat in Vienna, which finally depends on a serious offence against the non-proliferation of atomic weapons, seeing IAEA.
The IAEA considers three more teams as the key for progress in the clarification, which should be "in functional connection" with the presumed reactor, and others like these are still existing.
Inspectors have not been given publicly to know what teams are treated, nor what functions they have or if they seem suspected.
According to the Southdeutschen Zeitung, the IAEA has appointed Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayaah, again derived from the nearby cities.
Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these places and found a complex of buildings near Masyaf with satellite images, which is probably one of the suspected objects.
It may be located in or immediately on the side of a military base, Syria for this reason prohibits the entry into the three places of the IAEA.
In Vienna, Syrians fear a record that the United States requested the IAEA to shoot military plants.
Nuclear detectors were warning about the teams thanks to the warnings of the U.S. secret service.
By satellite photos, the OIEA has indications that material is transferred between the three places and the cable to the east of the Eurorates.
A western diplomat in Vienna stated that at least one of the teams could be "related to the fuel production".
But there is no "no indication of sensitive activities", nor of uranium or reconditioning; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is urinum that is not enriched.
From where the uranium must come and where the plutonium should be later separated for bombs, for these central questions are, in the best cases, pleasing suggestions.
There are no doubts about whether the ruinings, the valuable stores that can be restored, are found in the three places.
As they disappeared the hundreds of loads of the ground trucks, nobody has information about where the shoes remain.
The OIAE considers the mine of sal al-Tibni, situated in the few kilometers from El-Kibar to the other part of the Eurorates, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 as an area for radioactive residues.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the previous IAEA inspector, reported it with the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
But photos from the orbit show that Syrians made land movements in the three certain suspected places and removed large containers after the OIEA requested the entry.
It may be accidental but only contributes to disappearing the suspect.
Furthermore, in the diplomatic sector, the IAEA has used a few months to develop an inspection plan there, which Syrians would allow, to maintain the possible military secret, only the deployment shows the size of the interest of the inspectors.
However, Damaskus also criticizes this proposal.
The Western diplomates in Vienna have been calmed for the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter has not been so urgent, for a couple of months ago, Glyn Davies, a type of ambassador of the United States, strictly called exceptional inspections, one of the most strict means that nuclear authorities have come to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, director of the IAEA, who should propose these inspections, has spoken of "a option to which I am open in the future", but still empty.
This is very attractive: For this reason, the majority of the IAEA Governing Council is needed, and some of the 35 representative countries there are not exactly emphasis on a scale.
On the other hand, how did a diplomat think, "and what happens if they find nothing at the end?"
Love in War times
There are problems since Angelina Jolie started in summer with the address of his debble still unnamed.
She itself wrote the guide, a history of love between a bosnia and a serbia.
You don't know much more about this, but this is enough for angry.
The rumor is very persistent, the woman, the musulman, loves her serving violator during the war of Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women's associations have rapidly protested, with which at the last time they transferred a few days of wheel planned in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film is round in Hungary and the powder, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women's organization of victims of war wrote to the United Nations High Commissioner, UNHCR by Jolie and requested a meeting with the actor, informed a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the embassy of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
It is not diplomatic. Women offered him a meeting in Hungary who rejected.
The meeting was placed in Bosnia, said Hasecic.
There are no history of love in violations fields, and the position of Jolie about victims is sufficiently about the guision.
His organization agreed with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has recommended that Jolie as a U.S. Ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly wrote Jolie for the scenes?
The bosnical culture minister who read the guion, offered after a strike and enlooked a recording permission in Sarajevo, is not of all clear reason why Jolie was not even all.
The young author reiterates that he does not pursue political purposes with his film, and he has much effort in the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the horrible consequences of the war and to vote to all the parties involved.
His content remains precise.
On the network, a second sinpsy of the film that sounds very different: Lovers were together before the beginning of the war and return to find when she, a Muslim Bosnia, is deported to a serving field in which he worked as guards.
What it feels significantly different is the variant "training victim is in love of torturer".
It's sure that the film of Jolie really starts before the war.
The pressure on it, says Jolie, is "injustice and based on wrong information".
You can now achieve peace with the Hollywood hackers: While the guide continues on the network illegally, as many others previously.
Nothing as far from here
This afternoon ends back to be good for the Irish.
No raster of suffering
Instead, the home team dominates its customers in Sweden, Finland and the United States.
The fans cry to joy while the high music turns up, shoot the ground with the feet.

The strange spectacle is called "Beerpong", and the winner prize is 500 euros more than a flight in Las Vegas for the world drinking campion in January.
Cyan Tanner is a quiet type, this extreme drink game, and the computer discreet actually does not make good mygas.
And the 26-year-old kid try to enjoy it, get away from the fulminant question, which will take him the future.
The difference in Las Vegas is not in its plans, in January will take a personal interview in New Zealand.
"I have a bad presence," says.
"He's very far from home, and I don't have any job there."
At least: His girlfriend waited for him in Auckland, "from a shot made his dream work as a event manager, maybe it's a good sign," said the young and dream.
Because of the bad perspectives in the house, two of the three brothers of Tanners have already been looking for luck in the foreign.
His sister Yvonne, a social workshop, is in Sidney, his brother Colin currently works as IT adviser in London.
Young people go: In the island there are many families like the Tanners.
100,000 Ireland will leave the country in a near future, pronounce the economic experts and the ESRI social research institutions in Dublin.
By 2015 there are 200,000 migrants.
A great loss for this small country with only 4,5 million people.
Prognostics are confirmed, there is a migratory wave comparable to which the island suffered in the 80s.
After a decade of progress, which brought great welfare to Ireland, the melancoly is now expansive.
The economic crisis focuses mainly on young, Irish well-formed, for which to now, everything is costing above.
Labour loss and social decline seemed absurd in the years of boom.
Everyone needs to have money in abundance.
But three of every ten men and women under thirty years are in the couple.
In Irish Times, there are letters to the director in mass of young immigrants who wants to say: "In Ireland, everything is hungry."
"It should have a resurrection against political and bankers, but whoever can, is going and lose our country, and with that to a whole generation."
"The last to close the door."
Leanne Caulfield, a legal student and president of the Irish students' unions, is coming a sommer future because the government is dedicated only to mountains and no longer offers future perspectives to young people.
"Reduce minimum wages, but they do not have strategies to achieve new jobs", says the 20-year-old girl.
Notes how your partners are going from non-recommendated practices to the following.
Your most concern, explains, is to have to migrate in four years.
"This idea is triste and depressed."
People like Stephen McLarnon try to see this topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a holiday that offers a service around the theme to work in the foreign area.
"To those who start working, do in the foreign is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to direct your car," says the manager.
On your website there are pictures of a boy who practices surf in Australia and another practitioning snowboard in Canada.
The message is clear: Working in the foreign is not how to do in the galleries, if not deliver freedom and diversity.
Since half years ago, Sean O'Donovan knows how to build something on another place.
Since there was nothing to do for the 29-year-old engineer, we are currently working with 15 Irish partners in the construction in Germany.
Now you get up a model shop in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, she goes to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan sees his patriarch only a few times because he works for more hours to pay a credit for his home in Ireland.
"The situation is a bit crazy," says, "for a long time ago it was the first time that he put his home's ombrol.
"I give money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I'm never so good."
He smile something, and she's going to be through heavy rooms.
The small house is in a elegant residential area with garden care before the houses, in the entrance there are large and cherished cars.
O'Donovan bought the house together with her sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100% funded by a credit.
"It was crazy time, I had easy money without many questions," says.
You're afraid to fail the credit?
O'Donovan thinks a rat, serves more hot tea, and says, "I have no kids to eat and I'm young; if everything comes badly, I can start from zero."
The civil engineer does not like complaints that are currently often listening.
"No one must be hungry, our situation is not, with a lot of difference, so dramatic as in the past times in the island," says.
"To work a time in the foreign is not the worst thing can happen, perhaps with that we first feel as Irish."
It was remarked and accounted about his father, that in the last major economic crisis was in England.
"After seven years, life continued to Ireland, very simple."

The Democratic Rutin
It continues to increase democracy support in Latin America, as well as support for private enterprises.
Crime generates greater concern than unemployment.
Furthermore, in most of the regions, Brazil is seen as a most influential country than the United States.
These are some of the conclusions of the last survey of the Latinobarometer in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been regularly concluded since 1995, it allows to monitor the changes in the region.
In the results of this year's survey, conducted in September and the beginning of October, there are two related issues.
The first is the relatively animated humor in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has significantly increased in various countries in the South America coast (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached a average of 6 per cent annually since 2002, democracy support has increased from 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent in 2005.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy has been restored after a great decline of production last year.
However, only half of the surveys in Mexico and Brazil, the two most popular countries in the area, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Graph 2).
Around 44 per cent of the surveys in the region had been satisfied with the way democracy works in their country, the same number as the last year, but significantly more than 25 per cent registered in 2001 (graph 3).
Around 34 per cent stated that they trusted in the Congress of their country and 45 per cent in their Government, the same amount as the last year in both cases, but significantly higher in relation to 2003 (17 and 24 per cent respectively).
For a decade ago, economic turbulences in Latin America have severely affected the support of democracy.
The fact that it has been maintained during the world financial crisis is probably due to many Latin American countries that were only affected by a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, the existence of a stronger social security network has contributed to protect the poorest.
(The Economic Commission of the United Nations for Latin America reported this week that the percentage of Latin Americans living in poverty as only marginally increased in 2009 and that this year has been reduced to 32 per cent.)
However, the state of spirit would significantly be from a country to another (see graph 4).
The good economic performances of Brazil and the popularity of his summer President, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, are reflected in a general sense of progress.
This feeling is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and has increased violence crimes.
The second time since the surveys have been started, more surveyed in Latin America mention the crime instead of unemployment, such as the most serious problem that their country is faced (see graph 5).
Another 31% claims that, whether they or a neighbor, there has been a victim of crime in the last year, a number that has been reduced from 38% of the last year and is the lower percentage registered since 1995.
The more positive economic performance is reflected in more support for private enterprises and market economy: about 71 per cent of the surveys in the region claim that private enterprises are essential for development, while only 56 per cent in 2007 (see Graph 6).
Another 58% convicted that market economy is the only system that will allow its country to develop, against 47% in the past year.
It is interesting that 62 per cent of the surveys in Venezuela think the same (and 80 per cent supports private companies), although his left president Hugo Chávez is exposed to numerous private enterprises.
Brazil is a larger leadership in the region as indicated in 19% of the surveys (for 18% in the last year), followed by the United States (9%, the same number as the last year) and Venezuela (9% against 11% a year ago).
However, the United States is the most influenced country by the surveys in Mexico and most of the Central Americas, while Venezuela obtained such a title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and the Nicaragua.
Elections to the slaughter
No one expected the general elections held on 28 November in Haiti were perfect.
However, they were much worse than the fear of foreigners who tried to help the country to resort to their problems.
A number of votes were introduced in the urnes, some voted several times, cut papers in the shops, destroyed election collections and intimidating acts.
The election college opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including groups displaced by the earthquake of January, were able to find out where they had to vote.
Some of them, at the end, were given for winners.
A twelve of candidates to the presidents, including several of the most popular, claimed fraud and requested the cancellation of elections.
Protests, some of them violent, expanded throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the United Nations larger official in Haiti, declared that they were "a relatively good election in many senses."
The observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Communities have stated, consequently, that "we do not think that these irregularities, for serious things that are, are necessaryly invalid the process".
In other words, the spectacle continues.
The election authority, which, according to its contractors, is compromised with Rene Preval, the outstanding president, and his candidate, Jude Celestin, should announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The deficiency is expected to be performed in January.
All hopes for elections have still not been lost.
The two major candidates of the opposition, Michel Martelly, a raper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former woman, have removed their initial request in which they requested the invalidation of the vote.
But it can still be problems if the election authority declares that Mr Celestin, who has only support, if he has somebody, has passed to the second round.
Bearing in mind that the epidemic of colliera strikes the country and more than one million of the survivors of the earth continue to live in shops, it is expected to be a great abstention.
At the time, many Haitians wanted to vote, but they did not do this because of the lack of organization.
Additional of 250,000 identity documents, necessary to vote, had not yet been distributed before the elections.
There's a lot in the game.
Aid donors consider that the choice of a popular and legitimate government is an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And, as it has been patent, they also think that the Haitians themselves.
Advanced from points to the center
In the weeks that have been overlooked since his husband, Christina Fernández, President of Argentina, has enjoyed a great sympathy among the public that has increased its population index in 20 points, up to 50 percent, the largest level which has been registered since its election in 2007.
Despite all that it can become a successful campaign for a second mandate in the elections of the year, which will depend on whether the clearly affected Mrs. Fernández leaves the intransigence of her husband, his predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this regard, the indications are not concluded.
Mr Kirchner, who had continued to be responsible for the economic policy, even after his wife was chairman, had the habit of elaborating budgets that were undervalued tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to pay additional income to its discretion.
In the theory, the government of Mrs Fernández lost most in the Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation which has deceived after Kirchner's failure because of a cardiac attack on October 27.
Some discreptive members of the perronist movement have faced Ms. Fernández.
However, after some chaotic meetings, in which a deputy gave him a bridge in the face and other Members accused the sovereign government, the Congress decided to reject the budget of 2011.
"I'm not going to discuss," said the President.
Consequently, the 2010 budget will be applied to the next year, which will provide the President a further action margin than the time to expend.
The economy is significantly improved: it probably grows up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11,1 per cent, but many private calculations, in addition to the salary requirements of the unions, are about 30 per cent.
Mr. Kirchner, who took the power in 2003 when Argentina was at the edge of the economic failure, made that growth and poverty reduction were its priorities instead of inflation control.
It was refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressed the private sector and made that the INDEC, the Statistics Institute, was adapted to the official inflation statistics.
Is President Fernández now going to modify these policies?
He has convoked meetings between the private sector and the leaders of the trade.
In addition, their officials claim that they want to limit payment increases in the next year to 18 per cent.
The economy has been stimulated by the high prices of Argentina's agricultural exports in the world.
However, inflation has limited the impulsion to growth achieved with a great de Valoration in 2002.
Perhaps Mrs Fernández is given signs to want to restore the financial links of Argentina with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government reached an agreement with the bonus holders who had been rejected for a forced restructuration before the debt that Argentina had not been assigned in 2001.
Today, Ms. Fernández seems to be able to celebrate an agreement with the grouped creditor governments in the Paris Club, which should be around 6.7 million dollars.
The Kirchners always stressed that this would not imply the FMI's supervision, as normally is.
However, last month, Amado Boudu, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will provide "technological assistance" to develop a new national consumption price index, which seems to be prelud to the cleaning of the INTEC.
It is not clear if President Fernández wants to continue in the policy when it ends its mandate, taking into account that he has no longer his husband.
If so, it will be necessary to win the support of the media class, most of which you have been angry of kirchnerism.
When the Argentinans return from their steady holidays in March, the sympathetic wave for it will have been deceived.
If you want to win other elections, you must decide whether you reput or not, with calmity, many of your husband's policies.
Average burden by China
Taiwan's voters are closely approaching a species of closer unions with the continent.
What does Taiwan think about his big brother on the other side of the stretch?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70 per cent of the electors, took place on 27 November to elect alcaldes and design them of five urban districts, which seems to be a wide evaluation of the President, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma has become a defender of the feelings of the continent, making innovative business links, including a partial free trade agreement, the greatest change in the relationship with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma's passing the test, but just a while.
While its Kuomintang Party (KMT) has been winning three of the five chain elections, he did not get the majority of the votes.
On the other hand, the Democratic Progress Party (PPD), which has been encouraging by total independence from Taiwan, almost 50 per cent of all votes against 45 per cent of the KMT.
If they were the presidents, Mr Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election has been elected two years ago, the proportion of votes of its party has decreased around 8%.
For the first time, the PPD posted with KMT in boards.
In the elections, the typical elements of the Taiwan elections were seen, including routine camping trucks and large aglomerations with bandrites and girls of dance clothing.
And the mysterious trial of rigor murder did not fall.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, KMT's honorary President, was a campaign for one of KMT candidates on the night before the elections.
A man of the multitude shooted the young man directly to the face, shooting him and killing a transhuman.
I wonder if it was not possible to determine whether the man intended to harm Lien or become the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the police, the shoothes affected the elections, seeming to be suspected about the PPD and caused voters to smile by KMT.
Maybe the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that the question of the continent was not addressed in itself.
Instead, candidates talked about public accommodation plans and employment.
They normally enjoy their real independence and hate China's military threat.
As a result, KMT is generally avoiding advertising its links to the Government in Peking.
But this time the PPD also avoided encouragement against China.
He responds to the new conscience that Chinese trade is essential for the economic survival of Taiwan.
For its part, Mr. Ma stated that his policy on China was acceptable for most Taiwanians.
It is expected that the Peking Government continues to support them with the trade, in accordance with its strategy to achieve the return of Taiwan.
China did not lose time by sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a Summit on the Protection of Investments and Medical Cooperation.
Indeed, you would also like to get political integration, but first is it.
The best will expect the presidential elections of 2012 to this end.
In any case, the PPD has been revended.
Two years ago, a bad situation was found: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was arrested by corruption.
The President, between 2000 and 2008, openly encouraging explicit independence.
However, under the leadership of Ms. Tsai, there has been a new generation of moderates, and the PPD is being endeavouring to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been welcomed as a candidate to the Presidency, as well as its Tseng-chang mandate under Chen.
Now your game is doing everything possible by showing that you can also have relationships with Pekin.
Ms. Tsai announced the plans for establishing a group of experts acting as a contact point between the PPD and China, provided that negotiations could be implemented without pre-conditions.
Ms. Tsai says to the Taiwan public that its party represents a "reliable alternative" to Mr Ma's precipitation in respect of China.
Mr. Chen looks funny for the change.
In a declaration issued from its cell, he stated that the candidates of the PPD would have been better stopped if they insisted that Taiwan was an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, that was not submitted to the presidents.
Even without intercending Mr. Chen, the PPD will have difficulties to choose between its possible candidates.
KMT should also conduct a conscious review.
The values of Mr Ma have been poor, despite the impressive economic growth; the candidates of KMT did not want to camp with him.
The lack of popularity seems to be mainly the unemployment and the growing differences between rich and poor.
A KMT port states that you will restructure your office as well as local teams.
The large exhibition of the PPD suggests that Taiwan's support to a approach is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanians consider that economic integration in China is inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a known colonist, "the point of non-return has been crossed."
Names to the Grammy: Jazz Esperanza Spalding's song is the surprise choice in the Artist Revelation category.
He acts on a President's request and maybe people will be set in you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bajist and songer selected personally by President Obama to act in his ceremony of the Nobel Premier of the Peace in 2009, summoned one of the surprises of the Grammys this year with a high-level namement in the category of Mayor Artist Revelation.
Bearing in mind that Spalding has been an appealed figure of the jazz since his 2008 album, "Esperance", the name of what you think, but respects the standards of the Grammys, which should be a artist who has not left the market more than three albums before writeing what "determines the public identity of that artist".
His ambitious album of 2010, "Chamber Music Society", without doubt, has a great progress and, taking into account its light and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great ability with the influence of pop, funk and Latin ritmos, can at least set a distinction between Spalding and the way towards the success of Norah Jones in 2003, the nearest equivalent to the voters of the Grammys, which have recently been concentrated in the field of jazz for this category.
In the remaining categories, the voters of the Grammy made honour to Vijay Iyer Trio's "History", a exciting and magnificent disk that was one of the favorites last year.
Among Iyer's competitors the saxophonist Veteran James Moody with "Moody 4B" and the technicist John Beasley by "Positootly".
Trombone Shorty, a favorite strenger in New Orleans and a normal invitation in "Treme" of the HBO, was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which, on the other hand, is significantly inclined towards the fusion as in Stanley Clarke's albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber's albums.
Darcy James Argue's Secret Society has obtained a mere recognition in the category of large groups, composing of the large camera jazz of Billy Childs Ensemble and the always arrased Dave Holland's album, whose "Pathways", was a great example of the democratic leader of the bag in his band.
Names to Grammy Prizes: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey in the best direction of classic albums
The names in the field of classic music for the 53th edition of the Grammy Premios include a mixture of music and composers throughout the world.
The main names were for Michael Daugherty by "Deus Ex Machina", on piano and orquest, of five movements, and Steve Mackey with "Dreamhouse", a work for three outctic orchestras.
Between the nameds with the south of California, the Estonian Composer Arvo Pärt is found for its syntax No.4 "Los Angeles", a part of Los Angeles' Filarmic and extraordinary in the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer based on Los Avner Dorman is also appointed by its Mandolin Concerto.
Classic music names are distributed into three categories that cover orchest, oper, coral and single albums.
The classic producer category of the year includes five nameds: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The names for the classic music album are Bruckner by the Royal Concertge construction No. 3 and No. 4 of the Royal Orquest; Daugherty by "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Sinfónica Orchestra de Nashville; Steven Mackey by "Dreamhouse" of Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" of several artists; and the "Requiem" of Verdi de Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the names are Berg by "Lulu" of the Royal Opera House's orchest; Adolf Hasse by "Marc Antonio and Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaya Saariaho by "L'Amour de Loin" by the Germans Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin by "The Enchanted Wander" of the Mariinsky Theatre and Arthur Sullivan by "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers named a gramy for contemporary compositions include Pärt by the Synfony No. 4, Daugherty by "Deus Ex Macine", Hans Werner Henze by "Appssionally Plus", Magnus Lindberg by "Graffiti" and Shchedrin by "The Enchanted Wandererer".
The Sinfonia No. 4 of Pärt was entered in the Disney Hall in January 2009 at a meeting recorded by the Los Angeles Fieldroom, directed by Esa-Pecca Salonen.
The piece, from about 30 minutes, is "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the old magnificent Oil Mikhail Khodorkovsky, incarcerated in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" is appointed by the instrumental solist action with orchest.
The composer of Los Angeles wrote the piece of 15 minutes specifically to touch it in Mandolina Avi Avital, which interpreted the concert with the Metropolis Ensemble, based on New York.
"The composite with the next East sounds and numerous scales and ritmos from North Africa," Dorman stated in a telephone interview.
Leader Peter Boulez, 85 years old, was appointed in the orchester category, by directing Chicago's Sinfonic Orchester during a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the named instrumental solists are the pilgrims Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; the organized Paul Jacobs; the violinist Julia Fischer; and the arcist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The names as vocalists are all women this year: Anne Sofie Van Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonova, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mixing category, the above Jessye Norman was appointed by its recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song".
The mixed proposed in Themecule obtains the approval of the management commission
The Mixed Project for Themecula has obtained the unilateral support of the local management commission after more than five hours of public witnesses, often acknowledged.
Criticals attacked the project, saying that it promotes terrorism and sugars.
However, the members of the committee decided on Thursday night that the new religious center respected the local legislation and would be impressive from the ethics point of view.
"Thank of good people came to show their support, both Christians and Jews or Bahaies, of all religions", said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic center of the Teacula Valley, on Thursday morning.
"The truth is that, as an American citizen, I am honoured."
"Those shows that justice is prevailing."
"The opposition is really minimum," adds.
"Solo they're talking very high."
"In this valley there are wonderful people."
The meeting began at six nights and was almost half night; most of the time was dedicated to people who intercepted in favour or against the center, almost the same amount in each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the website of the magazine.
"United States does not exist anymore", read one of the comments.
"This is another Simon Planet with Ms. Libertad dead on the sand."
"America has fallen."
The construction plans of Islamic centres have also caused protests in other parts of the country, including near the zero area, the New York area where the attacks occurred on 11 September 2011.
In the Themecula Valley, Ian Mahmoud Harmoush has declared acts of violence.
His congregation of about 135 families past years, living without troubles in the Riverside area, but he wanted a higher and better space than the store that was covered in a shared property with a water filtering system manufacturer.
The new mixture of 24.943 square feet, with a Mediterranean architecture style, would include two minerals and up to 43 feet.
A surface of 4,32 cels in Nicolas Road, about two miles north of the Chaparral Institute.
Opponents can still recurr the project before the municipal Council.
A resistant microbiology to the arsenic presents the possibility of new forms of life on Earth... or in other places
The discovery of a bacteria that can use the arsenic as one of its nutrients was widely the possibility of finding new forms of life on earth and, perhaps, in other planets.
While researchers found the curiosity bacteria here on the earth, they say that there may be ways of life without the main elements that were considered essential.
"This body has a double capacity."
"You can grow with fosfor or arsenic."
"It's become something very spectacular, although little lack of being a life-type really "aliensa", commented Paul C. W. Davies of the Arizona State University, co-auteur of the report that appears in the online edition of the Thursday of Science publication.
Since many years, there are six important elements for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, fosfor and azure.
However, researchers have found that the bacteria, found in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow up after replacement of the arsenic fosfor.
"It makes you figure out what it is possible." Ariel D. Anbar of the Arizona State University, coautor of the report.
According to Anbar, the finding is important for life searching in different planets from the earth, since researchers need to be able to recognise life, know the aspect of it.
The study focuses on a discovery microbiology on the Earth.
However, the convocation of a press route to discuss, where the details of the discovery were not discovered, generated a great speculation on the Internet about the possibility that the report indicates the discovery of extraterrestreat life.
He didn't.
What the discovery is that in other planetary environments, organs could have used other elements to stimulate their biochemical and that the assembly of "station" elements that we are considered essential for life may not be so fixed", commented Charles Cockell, Catholic of Planetary and Space Science Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, the UK.
Cockell did not have a part of the research team.
"This work is renewed because it demonstrates the replacement of a element by another in the biochemical and the basic biochemical structure", added Cockell.
The discovery was not achieved by case.
Felisa Wolf-Simon of the NASA Astrobiology Institute, which directed the study, focused on the Mono Lake because it presented high arsenic levels.
Archenic and fosfor are similar from the chemical point of view, so that a microbiology exposed to both could replace one by one another.
"The arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to the fosfor."
"They can therefore be complicated with the organisms that differentiate them."
"But however, the arsenic is the sufficiently different, so that it does not work as well as the fosfor, so in and, in some way, appeal the biochemical machine," Anbar explains.
Researchers recognised the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to more arsenic concentrations, which could be adapted and used to grow.
The microbio grows better with fosfor, but the fact that it shows that you can live with arsenic in its place is the possibility of existing naturally a form of life that uses arsenics, either in other areas of the earth or in another planet or moon where the arsenic is most common.
Jamie S. Foster, a helper of microbiology at the University of Florida, indicated that the idea that the architecture can be replaced by the fosfor is not new, but there was never found an example that shows that it works.
Archenic was most common in the first eras of the Earth, so researchers speculated that the first way of life could have used it.
"I know that it suggests that there could be other ways to generate life, not only the way life was formed in the ancient Earth," said Foster, who was not part of the Wolf-Simon research team.
The investigation reported the support of the NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Health Institutes.
The robbed dogs were found missing in Compton
The two dogs were missing from the four robbers before the Bellflower Motel, as they said, the officers of the Los Angeles Headquarters were held on Thursday.
The four competitive dogs, two Asiats and two Corgi Galles Pembroke, disappeared on Monday, when someone stole the Chevrolet Express truck in 2006, where they passed the night, before the Bellflower Motel 6 as stated by the authorities.
Two of the canines were recovered on Monday at night, and the two remainers were found afternoon, afternoon, Steve Whithmore, a porter of the sheriff's headquarters' office of Los Angeles.
"The good news is that dogs are good," Whitmore stated.
They're in a good state.
"He's returned with their legitimate duties."
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in which barrier, nor the circumstances of the discovery.
"He's conducting a research."
"We don't want to say anything," said Whitmore.
"We're following a pistas."
I couldn't find the dogs, Christina Rickard and David Peek, to make some comment on Thursday.
They met with their two actors in a refugee of green animals in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's assistants found the bus and the two dogs separated in Compton.
According to the authorities, the Asiats (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a ten-month dog) had not suffered.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek intended to show in the competitions of the area this week on behalf of the Japanese dog owners, continued to disappear until Thursday night.
Peek and Rickard, who lived in Redding, were in the city for the ACC/Ecanuba National Campeonato in Long Beach this weekend and were intended to show Trace.
Other dogs would show them in other competitions for the days before the ACC/Ecanuba campionate, as stated by Peek to The Times on Monday.
South California is one of the stops in almost two months that the couple takes part in Canadian competitions.
On Monday, Peek and Rickard did check-in on the motel.
They are normally in motels and look at the just truck on the window of your room.
They brought to three other dogs (a boxer cry, a parson Russell territory and a Britishtany, who sleeped with them in the motel room.
But they left the Asiats and Corgis in the carton because they had a very sweet shock and would be more fresh.
They left the slightly open vents so that the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard declared the rob of the truck on Monday at six of the morning.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the Corgis, with microchips to identify them.
The Thursday was not clear if a reward would be given or not.
Leon is ready to rule again, while MGM's restructuring has the final approval of the court
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally reached green light to start again.
On Thursday, a Federal Court of New York has officially adopted the "prearmed" plan by creditors to remove approximately $5 million debt, launching the way that the enterprise of 86 years of entertainment focuses on the production and stereo of films and television programs.
The fall of Thursday confirms that the plan comply with the requirements of the US banking code, so there are no other legal obstacles to MGM retain under the founders of Spigls Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, which will be converted into the main executives of what will be reduced.
Personals will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 integrated.
In fact, MGM will not go from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a $500 million credit instrument to finance the operations and production of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the credit, which is contributing with $75 million for its account, and is expected to be financed at average December.
The study restructuring process began in May 2009, when the Moelis and Co. Investment Bank was contracted to provide advice on the management necessary to order its finances, while fighting to make interest payments for $3,3 million per year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, an ex-president of Enron and experts in the recovery of enterprises in Queebra, known for his work in Crispy Kreme Duughnuts.
The attempts of Moelis and Cooper to solve the financial trials of MGM and to satisfy the more than 140 research creditors required much more time than expected.
After several months of discussion, the parties agreed to put the company to the sale at the end of 2009.
However, the substantial has taken some posters and no one was intended to pay for more than $2 billion that were looking for creditors.
Before the spring of this year, he returned to the design table while the MGM team began working in a restructuring plan which, after months of discussion and internal deficiencies, was finally supported by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially goes out of the bankrote in the next weeks, the companys of Moelis and Cooper will receive multimillionary bonifications for their work.
Moelis and Co., who has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper companys, which have been rebuilding $37,5,000 per month for company administration services, will receive a number of $4 million "success honourarys".
Barber and Birnbaum planned to restore the production in MGM, which was just a film this year, and he met a year-year pizzar of seven or eight films that will come out in 2012.
They also plan to co-financiate two films based on "El Hobbit", together with Warner Bros.
The study needs to concert a separate loan between 265 and 275 million dollars to finance its part of these two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who had about 18% of MGM debt, had tried to correct a study fusion with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the largest shareholder.
However, the recent discussions between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to maintain the balance of its budget for gifts
While iPad is the main candidate to be the most wonderful game of this year, maybe followed by the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both may mean a significant meal in your budget for gifts.
Consider that by the price of a iPad you can buy five BMX bikes from 99 dollars each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic salts with accounts, or about 48 sides of the Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your budget for gifts in balance.
Recently, I visited three national players, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Walesale Club, to see that electronic games could buy less than $80.
It was immediately clear that the Moore Act has been working; the technological game this year probably will be more powerful, costing the same and even a little less compared to the last year.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new games with partner web sites, two of the most famous of this type, Webkinz and Club Penuin, have more offers.
And the games impulsed by button piles are growing, as well as players with reloadable batteries.
There are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, except that you are otherwise indicated).
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13 dollars, for three years and more) are swimming games of a cobay that can play a note when their bargs are opened.
An appreciation equals a note, and a second appreciation begins to wear a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Warning: Once you start to press, you can't stop.
For a dance combined song, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
Having provided from the Elmo Live technology last year, the animator swimming munch of 14 pulses plays shift games like Simom Dice, and can make the moon step, thanks to its innovating legs articulated with slopes with block device.
The children who tried the game used Mickey as a dance instructor, although their parents were complained for the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you can remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational games.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and more), with a filling card cards designed to convert a car passenger in a meeting with an auto-cover or temporary board.
If you are pleased to give your child your smart phone, here will be three independent alternatives.
MobiGo of VTech (60 dollars from 3 to 8 years of age) is the most precise and easyest to use, presenting a qvalue keyboard; although games do not teach so effectively as Leapster Explorer (70 dollars from 3 to 12 years) is the first important point of Leapster line, with a new and brilliant screen.
No version is compatible with the old cards.
iXL of Fisher-Price (90 dollars from 3 to 7 years) uses a iTunes type system to present games and e-books, and has a burn for SD cards that allows to visualize family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (30 dollars, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a game of five blocks only larger than a cell box, each with its LED screen.
The goal is to weaken words by putting the blocks in line before the time ends; it is formable for an unproved word weapons competition.
It's increasingly the games that have some kind of online connection.
Only based on your presence on games, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penuin.
To buy your son a online mask in the Kunuin Club, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penuin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, ($5,12) which includes a currency with a hidden code.
When you cancel the online code, your child gets enough credits in the Club Penuin shop for two items.
These could include swimming poets or a puffle mask game.
Hexbug Nano (10 dollars, for 5 years and more) is the last in a microbot line stimulated by button pills.
The false insect moves rapidly on 12 silicone slicks that live, in aleatorial addresses.
It's pleasant to make a block lab to see if you can find the output.
It's also durable.
We were able to leave the kitchen table and even pass arat inside our dog's mouth.
A more moderate side of the maintenance of the order in China is promoted
As a urban instructor, Tang Shenbin marked the step in a place of the city, inspecting the nervous people to his office, emiting commands in a low voice with military authority.
He wanted the women of Changguan, the police corpulents of the city order of China, feared and disrespectified by their powerful measures and their inclination to violence, to communicate a certain impression to a spectrum pugnate.
Fire!
"Attention!"
Show them, smile, "Why are the beautiful girls!"
Four young men who only passed with white winters and every green olive oil adjusted to call attention.
Four black sweet couples perfectly aligned.
Four elegant shadows placed perfectly above the hair attacked with blue and white rays.
"Perhaps, I think you have a normal appearance," said Mr. Tang, unfortunately.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to clean the image of the urban inspectors of China.
A city ordered that all new recruitments have a level title.
The province of Guangdong changed the green green color of the uniforms to a presumably more attractive blue.
Whan, in Central China, replaced the use of the force by intimidatory sights: in 2009, 50 officials were rounded to a snack snacks snacks snack, and observed it with the skin constantly frustrated for a half hour, until the ambulant seller collected its things and marched it.
Xindu, a urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen a radical image change.
Since 2003, the district has adhered to its urban police 13 women, expressly elected by their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give you to the police a more sweet side, female.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to struggle in order to increase the very respectful respect of China for these cities.
And for a good reason, they would argue the critics.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to comply with the city's orders by imposing currencies and other administrative penalties.
But the media of Chinese news is routinely a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of the province of Hubei killed shoots after using their cell to film them while solving a protest against a dishwasher.
Last year, a Pekin inspector training manuscript was cut and published on the Internet, where it was described how to shoot crimers effectively without blood.
This year, a ambulance seller of Shanghai sandwich suffered brain damage after a ring with five officials.
A full video game of violence, available to download online, presents inspectors trained by Chinese who attack street salers.
"Chengguan has left a cycling in the government," regretted China Daily, a national publication, last year after another tactical discussion.
The newspaper required "a really meticolous cleanness."
The sceptics say that the current approach is very far from this.
After the district would ask for eight new women ' s recruits in October, a editor in The Beijing Evening News was asked whether women had real duties or were just a scenic distraction.
The answer seems to be a little of both things.
The advertisement of the district requested women from 18 to 22 years of age, with a good figure "and the five harmonious facial races".
They should have a height above the average, more than 1,6 meters or 5 feet, 2 (11.42) pulled.
The retirement to the age of 26 is binding.
The officials said that the work was physically too slow for women over 25 years.
"Your image is the important thing," said him an anonymous district official in Rednet.com, a guest website.
"Before, the external qualitys of the candidates shall determine whether they comply with the requirements, such as height, weight, facial races, etc."
Then the temperation "and the internal qualitys".
Women's chengguans are like flowers, said, and added, "Other than being flowers, they have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, subdirector of the district administration office, is not concerned to support this description.
But he noted that higher requirements were standard in many Chinese work warnings for both sex.
Then it comes to the demand of harmonious facial races.
If this means being appropriate, it is a matter of debate between Chineses.
Of course, the low or disfigured should not be presented.
"We can't allow a coat or a joker to work here," said Mr. Zheng.
"It wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who patchs the Baoguang Plaza near a monastery, has 22 years of age, with its colored legs and a quite curve mouth.
She doesn't think the acent in her look is sexist, said.
"Do you think I look sexy with this uniform?" she asked with a sadtonic look.
His work partner with today, Xu Yang, of 21 years old, said "We must present the image of the city."
They are not opposed to their own work at a time, they said, because they have higher carriage ambitions that are just to help solders in the carriage where they are supposed to circle their business.
Each morning, the squadron is faced by more than a twenty-five of ambulance sellers that are launched at foot or in bicycle, trying to sell so many panecilles or tofu tasons as soon as possible before being shocked.
"Mr. Wang, you have to go."
"We have told you many times," said Mrs. Xu while a seller was missing, temporaryly leaveing his car shooted by a bicycle with guards of believers.
The officials describe their duties as more monotones than extincts.
"This is more or less the same day," said Huang Jing, 20 years old, who studied marketing in his free hours.
Very rutinary.
One reason is that women officials do not have the power of their male homologs to confiscate the goods of solders.
They can only threaten the offenders to their men's supervisors.
This aims to protect them from the repentant public demonstrations of spirit against burocracy, which are common in all parts of China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the Provincial capital of Yunan, were shocked after the false shooting that some of the officials Changguan killed a soldier.
More than a twelve of chinguan police or officials were blessed in the night episode; 14 government vehicles were shocked or taken fire.
By the time Xindu has avoided such violence.
But calm is only guaranteed.
Only two streets of the peaceful Baoguang Plaza, where women's officials patroled that morning, more than 50 people gathered in a skin.
The officers had confiscated a motor that was repared in the area instead of in a taller, as required by the regulation.
The moto's duty cryed shirtly.
The situation was held for 15 minutes before the officials, in a bad sense, opened step to their vehicles and were fast with the motorcycle and their kitchen.
Li Xuedong, a 40-year-old coordinator assigned to the male squadron, remained behind, with its white insigny back to hide his name.
As women officials, coordinators, 40 years older men play a pure support role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to keep an elegant image.
"while we struggle verbally."
"Atimes we struggle physically," said Mr. Li with total nature.
"The majority of the time is the public that begins the fight."
Scientists will not raise charges against Senator Ensign
Senator's lawyers announced the Monday that the fiscals of the Department of Justice had excused Senator John Ensign of the criminal imprisonment that had resulted from their affair with an ex-agency of campaign and efforts to ensure work through lobby for the husband of women.
The decision ended with the most serious legal threat to Ensign, the Republic of Nevada, which was considered as a potential candidate to the Republic of the Republic for 2012, until the scanda on its affair had national titles last year and damaged his career.
The Ensign Office said that it was "safely content" by the decision, which came after a complete year's investigation.
The Senator could still address a disciplinary measure of the Senate Ethics Committee.
The lawyers of Ensign said that the Department of Justice had told us "informed that Senator Ensign is no longer a goal of his research and that he has no plan to put a position against him for this issue."
The Department of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The announcement was a surprise for many attorneys outside the Department of Justice, who said that they seemed to have significant evidence to indicate that Ensign could have been inflicted to violate a federal offensive ban on lobby.
Interviews, e-mail and other documents that were distributed first in October 2009 in New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his helpers, to get lucrative work through lobby, to achieve the silence of Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, on the matter of the senator with her.
Ms. Hampton once worked as a treasure of Ensign's campaign.
Insign was in contact with several political patrocinators to find her work on Mr. Hampton and avoid on their behalf after they had contracted Mr. Hampton to make lobby for them, according to the documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an Assistant of Ensign, it was excluded according to the law to make lobby for his former employer or Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said that the inusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were intimate friends before the business, appeared in disappointment with the called "revolving door lobbying bank", which seeks to limit that former state employees use their connections to make personal business.
From the evidence that has been public, "It seemed to be a first case of conspiration to violate substantially the status of revolving door," said Stanley Brand, a lawyer of Washington, who specializes to defend clients investigated by the government.
While the officials of the Department of Justice refused to explain the reasons behind the decision in the case Ensign, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the department had been careful to accept political processes after several important reviews for its section of public integrity, including the decision of the last year to abandon the processing against the former Senator Ted Stevens, in a fair conduct of procedure.
The federal fiscals "is clearly some cobardes", said Melanie Sloan, Executive Director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a group of defence who brought a number of complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This is basically means that high-range government officials can now suggest that laws do not apply to them", he added.
Paul Coggins, the principal lawyer of Ensign, said in an interview that received a telephone call from a department of the Department of Justice on Monday and another called more on the next day, saying that the department did not want to take charges against his customer.
The Ensign Defence Team had been cooperating with the police in trying to convince them that the Senator, as its office reiterates in a statement, "he acted in accordance with the law".
Coggins was refused to explain in detail the legal arguments given to the fiscals.
"I am not comfortable to enter into details about my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we think they have taken the right decision," said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to change a investigation in a complaint separated by the Ethiopian Group, claiming that a payment of $96,000 of Ensign's parents to the Hamptons has violated the federal election law.
The election committee said he had no sufficient evidence to demonstrate that money was not more than a gift.
NV Energy is an important company of Nevada who had supported the Senator for a long time, which has made work through lobby thanks to the help that Ensign to Hampton gave him.
A email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, the Head of Ensign's officer John Lopez, communicated with Hampton and said that it was "making" the Interior Ministry on a debate.
He also attended a breakfast with Hampton and another client in Nevada, Aligiant Air, and called the Transport Secretariat to establish a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had contracted to Hampton to do lobby.
When the news of the affair appeared during the last year, Ensign asked for forgiveness to his electors and rejected his position as four-leader of the Republic in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for many months, Ensign told him two weeks ago to the journalists that he planned to be requested for a third mandate in the Senate.
When the Ensign's voter Jennifer Cooper announced that Ensign was not already a criminal investigation, he said that the Senator expected that the Ethics Committee would follow the example of the Department of Justice and conclude its investigation.
"The Senator Ensign has desires to continue with its hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada," said.
Cheshire's appeal will call Twitter
There was a average twelve of them "chateing" in the lines of the court room.
A minute, they sent reports of the great witness through Twitter.
Finally, the defense said, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process of violation and children attacked their beds in a house that was taken to fire.
The Thursday, the widely followed process by Steven J. Hayes, who was sentenced by the murder of three members of a family of Cheshire, Connecticut, is ready to reach a official final, with the imposement of the judge of death sentence voted by the jury.
But the lawyers of Mr. Hayes have made written in the Court which declares the arguments of the appeals that may probably be employed to courts for years.
One of the most provocatives states that the intensive reports on the process, including the broad use of Twitter by Massive Information Media Journalists, created "a circle atmosphere", and soon generalized and soon with expansive details made public payments an inadequate influence on the jury.
The complaint could bind the judges of appeal to address the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the court room.
"In accordance with what I have experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of the new technology in the court room affects the rights of the person to have a fair process," said Thomas J. Ullmann, the principal lawyer of Mr Hayes' defence.
The Judge of First Instance Jon C. Blue, of the Supreme Court of State, laconally rejected the requests in a failure last week, saying that the media of news were "certainly controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been brought by the passion.
But probably it's not the last word on the subject.
For decades, the appeal courts have recognized that the coverage of celebrated cases may generate questions on the imparciality of a process.
In a historical fall of 1966, the Supreme Court of America reaffirmed the condemnation of a Cleveland osteopata, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, said in his decision, in the case of Sheppard vs. Maxwell, who had "a carnaval atmosphere in the process" because of the media.
The crime had been inspired by the television program and the film "Filgitive".
Some lawyers said that the courts of appeal that examined Mr Hayes' sentence in the middle of the century could feel intrigued by the argument that new rules could be necessary to control the form of communication from the court rooms, something immaginable in the time of the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a general reason for concern about the impact of the new media" in high profile processes, said John J. Donohue III, a professor of Stanford Acts, who studied the death penalty of Connecticut and wrote a report in which it was said arbitraryly.
Professor Donohue said that some judges of appeal could feel intrigued by the idea that restricting immediate communication from the court rooms could make the judges more fair.
The Twitter question is only one of the many themes deleted by Haies lawyers, which will probably be discussed for years, delaying an execution.
The lawyers of the defence also claim that Hayes could have been damaged when the Blue Judge refused them to test the reactions of the potential judges, showing the spoiling photos of the crime scene during the selection of the jury.
Some swear said they were horrible by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and their daughters, Hayley, from 17 and Michaela of 11.
Defence lawyers say that they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and support that the judge wrongly removed a jury that had criticized the fiscals, and that it had incorrectly been pressed for a verdict because of its strange decision to order it to the jury for a weekend.
The jury was not secuted.
But its arguments on the effect of the intense coverage of the process may affect most of the interest.
They were noted in a refusal to the architected verse last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates to the Governor and Senate of the United States.
They argued that the media were continuously slow to the fire of the emotion on the case.
"The daily aglomeration of the media, cameras and reporters outside the court," the lawyers wrote, "he was never seen here in New Haven and maybe in the whole state."
Your attention in the coverage of Tweeter is controverted.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint about the fact that the immediate news was more important than the reports provided slower, they were a lucrative vision that would make the policy of the Court on Covering would be weak in future processes.
However, some lawyers had said that the courts of appeal often felt affected by the arguments on the adjustment required in the courts because of social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pressing for that complaint.
In his writing, the decision of 1966 of the Supreme Court, which rejected the condemnation of Dr. Sheppard due to the coverage of the process, was referring to the decision of 1966, and made clear that the new means would require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the case Sheppard vs. Maxwell of the 21th century."
Can the citizen have a bridge to join the divisions?
After a notable campaign for invective and negativeness, this week has been launched a few civilians in Washington.
Is it a pregnancy of a real future bipartidist cooperation or an illusory moment before a rapid turn to the party struggle in the capital?
The spring meeting between President Obama and the leaders of the Congress had not made any progress on the major issues that should be treated during the coming session.
But they all say, it was at least a short discussion on the differences of the two parties, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to rule, instead of being another empty episode to win partiist points.
The public meeting of the President ' s Chairman ' s deficit commission was also civilized, despite the political differences persistent among members.
It seems clear that the close interaction for a month has generated a mutual respect that overcomes the ideological fraction that is still separated to members.
This is only enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Both parties are now in a period of test, and they are mutually able to identify signs of cooperativeness and commitment, while trying to assess the limits of public view and the patience of voters for a renewed party war.
The reason for the meeting of the march and the later evaluations of the same by the participants were made at least demands or accused.
The philosophysic differences between Obama and the Republicns are too large and are very deeply shocked as to suggest any rapid change of the climate that has existed over the past two years.
Where taxes, expenditure, health assistance or social assistance are concerned, both parties are in opposite pools.
In all ways, the November election has summarized the humor in Washington, at least short-term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed in the way to say things," said Pete Wehner, a official of Bush administration now in the Public Ethics and Policy Centre.
"They are inevitable after the elections.
The elections deleted partial paths, which will then be extented.
That's good."
In some matters, in particular those contained in the agenda of the summer session, the Republics and Democrats have no option to find a solution.
Bush tax reductions arrive at the end of the year, and no one is for this.
Both parties want to find a way to maintain some or all reductions, permanently or temporaryly.
Similarly, it is likely to have a commitment to enhance unemployment subsidies, probably because the Republicns cannot believe that they are in favour of the reductions of taxes for the rich, rejecting the unemployment subsidie for employed workers.
After the Monday's meeting at the White House, there is more optimism for possible treatment on these issues during the summer session, together with the ratification of the new START Nuclear Disarmament Agreement (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty).
But William Galston, from the Brooking Institute, warns that successful cooperation in the substantive matters of the summer session will not necessarily lead to a continuous bipartidism when the new 112th. Congress is gathered in January.
He stated, on the contrary, that it is very likely and even inevitable, which begins a period of disappearance.
"When things to be done are carried out, psychology will turn the situation to a confrontation in a short term."
Wehner also expressed scepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civilism can lead to true cooperation.
"I see the majority of what will happen between 2012 and 2012 as a test for the main event of 2012", said.
The reasons are very important to see the Constitution of the new majority of the Republic in the House and the voters of the Tea Party, which have decisively contributed to their creation.
The more conscious of having the Republicn leaders about the dangers to exert their position, they know that they should try to comply with their promises to recover the State expenditures and to cancelle the new health law.
These partial lines are already clearly observed in the initial responses to the recommendations of the Deficit Commission, including the reform of the tax code and the increase in some taxes and age of jubilation and expenditure.
Co-presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have been responsible for one of the most difficult works in Washington and, according to their own evaluation, have introduced the issue of deficit in the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the committee of 18 members to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and have been struggling to reach the number near.
The largest resistance is among the officials elected in the panel, suggesting that, at least now, there are few bases or desires for the commitment.
Galston predicts two stages in the battles between the Republicns of the White House and the Congress.
The first year will occur in the form of partial choosing, when the Republics challenge Obama on budget, taxes and medical assistance, followed by a period of greater bipartial cooperation.
What would cause the change?
The public view.
There are considerable evidence that, despite the recent election party, a majority of Americans still want to see both parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a dead point, as occurred in 1995, both parties will take attention to the reaction of people.
Whoever you think you're losing probably will change course and find compromise.
However, this may be a optimistic vision.
Participism and polarization are currently larger than those in the mid-90s, and it seems to have a larger ideological shock between Obama and Republicns of the Congress that had between President Bill Clinton and the Republicns at the time.
At the same time, both parties activists come in 2010 as the only priludio to a more transcendental election in 2012.
Since this reality, civilism this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more efforts from both sides to find common points in matters that are still shared.
A U.S. filtered document addressed to Moscow as the paradise of corruption
The city's control is in hand of a "cleptocracy" and leaves a part of the soborns and protector money that was directly recovered to Kremlin, according to the U.S. Ambassador in Russia in February.
It was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service managed large shock systems, which helps to explain the high cost of life in Moscow.
They recure money not only of legal business but also of organized criminal groups.
Each road from the bureaucracy, which is what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "Vertical Authority", takes its part as the money falls on the scale.
The note, sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published by WikiLeaks on Monday's website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censured.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still a chain of Moscow, and he was guilty of him for most of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev dismissed him in October, but there has been little evidence of cleaning since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who has an important construction company, have systematically rejected corruption accusions over the years, and he has winned several library requests on such accuseds.
In September, when in a Russian television channel asked him about a documentary that would suggest it was corrupt, he stated: "It's a crazy, a parent, a fastidio."
According to the surveys, Russians believe abrummentally that their society is corrupt.
But it is unlikely to find the details explained in detail, since they were in the Ambassador's report, and it is unreasonable to be the diplomates of a foreign country who do this.
"The direct slaves of the city of Moscow with criminality have brought some to call it "disfunctional" and to claim that the government works more than a clergy than a government", states the note.
" Criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (a term of the criminal world and the mafia which literally means "the" or "protecting") which spends the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) and the fiscal office, as well as all sectors of the government of the city of Moscow.
"The analists identify a structure of three levels in the world of Moscow Criminal."
"Luzhkov is on the top."
"SFS, MVD and the Military are on the second level."
"Common criminals and corrupt inspectors are finally at the lower level."
"This is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill a empty in some areas, because the city does not provide some services."
The report states that the SFS recovered the money of larger enterprises and that the police calls on smaller trade.
One source, stated in the report, “explied that Moscow's commercial duties understood that it is best to obtain the protection of MVD and SFS (not the groups of organized crime) because they are not only more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but also protected by law”.
"Protection against criminal pants is no longer a priority."
The note notes that while the recovery of money is complete, the protection may be irregular; even those who pay are subject to the arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly find their business closed by a pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but he admitted that he has made little progress.
The ambassador's note informs about men taking males, probably full of money in the same Kremlin.
"In his fight against corruption, Medveev must trust in the burocratics," said George Satarov, director of the India's expert group in Moscow, in a recent interview.
"But he is a part of this burocracy."
"He does not belong to a political class, because there is no more political class in Russia."
Without the policy, without an opposition, without separation of powers, it stated that corruption is inevitable.
At the national level, India estimates that corruption costs for Russia more than $3 billion per year.
In a recent survey on global corruption perceptions carried out by the non-governmental Transparency International organization, the country was classified at post 154 (the countries are at least corrupted).
The revelation of the note of the U.S. Ambassador, which has not occurred until the night of Moscow, will certainly cause disgusting within the Russian government, and despite Luzhkov can be condemned by the deficiencies of Moscow, it could be an opportunity to argue Cremlin that is solving the problem.
Interviewed for the CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that the WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted to a remark that claimed that the US diplomates called Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this is related to our interaction, which is an important factor of household policies in this country," said.
"But to be honest with you, we do not suspect that this would have been done with such a angry, with such pressure and, you know, that it would be done so immorally."
The veterans of the Red Jemers obliged to face the past
In a concretely illuminated school, with smooth and discovered walls, the director of the Second School Anlong Veng recorded the man who had built it, the last leader of the Red Jemers Ta Mok.
"There's all right to Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and was worried about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
known as "the Carnicero" for its brutality during the government of the Red Jemens, the commander remains popular in this remote ex-Rood Jemers in the northwest of Camboya, where he built hospitals, pumps and other infrastructures, and still lived thousands of former soldiers of the organization.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Jemers retreated before the government, the long-term reliable loyalty has been finally disappointed in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to face publicly those who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a secondary school text book that first teached him the history of the Red Jemers to the children of his former soldiers.
In July, a mixed court of the United Nations and Cambodia issued the first sentence of a former member of the Red Jemers, sentenced to the former head of the known Tuol Sleng Torture Center, Kaing Khek Iev, who was best known as Duch, to 35 years of prison.
With each of these events, anxiety has grown among the Veterans of the Red Jemers of Anlong Veng, complicating the efforts for reconciliation and its intentions to reintegre the Cambodian society.
"There's resentment and fear between the former Jemeres Red, but they can't do anything", said Chhang Youk, director of the Camboya Documentation Centre, a independent organization that investigates the regime.
"To them, life under the Red Jemers was glorious, but the rule has become a symbol of evil."
"This is generating divisions within the families."
During the Government of the Red Jemers of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, we were executed or died of hunger, disease or work, about 1,7 million people.
When the Vietnamites invaded and shooted to the government leading by Pol Pot in 1979, the rest of the regime and their militarys fled to the border of Camboya with Thailand.
There they started an insurrection that was duration until the last movement that was returned in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary directed the war of war from their bases on the mountains and forests of West Camboya, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
However, in the mid-90s, after a peace agreement supported by the United Nations leads to the first democratic elections of the country in 1993, the large groups of Red Jemers began to desert to the Government, culminating the revenues of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a prison of Phnom Penh in 2006 while waiting for the process.
Without the support of their benefits, the oldest fighters of the Red Jemers fell into the absolute mercy that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel ustalgia by movement.
While some of the Red Jewels' elite officials have maintained their local administrative positions in changed their weapons, racial soldiers remain a poor and not qualified farmers.
"This people have obtained little benefits after the relief," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Recognition, which offers public forecasts throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They have incorporated the agriculture ideology of the regime."
"They were created without no concept to do business."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who joined the Red Jemers when he was a adolescent in 1974, led in the wild near Anlong Veng before being dedicated to life as a poor farmer in 1998.
"The life with the Red Jemers was good," said.
"The Mok gave him to eat everyone."
"But now life is hard because we have to shoot us."
The current court of the Red Jemers has also caused concerns here.
At the beginning of the next year, the court is expected to start processing Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Minister of the Red Jewels.
The court ' s mandate is to process the main leaders and those who are more responsible for crimes, but did not say if he would follow cases beyond those four.
This has not served too much to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The recent speculation of the media has been focused in Im Chaem, 64 years old, who was a district head in the province of Banteay Meanchey during the Government of the Red Jemers at the end of the 1970s.
In 2007, she told the investigators of the Cambodia Documentation Centre that had supervised the construction of Trapeang Thma charge, a project where it is thought that thousands of forced workers died.
During a recent afternoon, In Chaem returned to work in the fields on wood pilots on a landway journey in Anlong Veng's pools.
When the sun rose long shadows on the skin, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Red Jemers.
She stated that if the complainant would not be submitted by the court.
"Camboya is in peace and stable," said.
"If there are more processes, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who was distant from the Red Jemers in 1978, has also warned that there will be instability if the court continues to be more suspected, although experts and historians ask it.
"Camboya must cast a shoe and shut the past," said.
But face the past is just what Camboya must do to advance, said Chhang Youk, from the documentation center.
"The reconciliation, according to Khmer, is back to join the cut pieces," said.
"It's our obligation to meet these cut pieces so that we can understand."
The center produced the first text book adopted by the Government on the Red Jemers, called "The History of Democratic Kampachea", of 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the secondary school text book of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages on the Red Jemers.
As in the majority of Cambodia, young people from Anlong Veng know little details about the Red Jemers, despite the connection of the city with the regime.
Toque Valeak, 19 years old, said that the new text book helped students to understand a major part of their history.
But his parents reacted with scepticism when he brought the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the text book and the court," said.
"They have suspects because they are not safe about the number of people who will process the court."
This resistance has made that the reconciliation process is complex and difficult, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the text book and the court are starting to produce an impact, stated.
In all ways, here the Red Jemers keep a powerful love.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a way with swimming smells and a covered platform tastes leads to a rectangle of the black holin covered by a oxidated shock.
The body of Pol Pot was burned here over a lot of neumtics after his death in 1998.
Num Sothea, of 31 years old, was a cellular seller on the board of the road, said that he didn't know much about the man he was crowned there.
"But he has a strong spirit, and many people from the place come there to reward him," he said.
It was the birthday of Nuom Sothea, and later that day he decided to walk to the place of the last relax of Pol Pot, where he would leave a mature plateau hand with hope of having good luck.
Belarus accepts to refuse your uranium reserve for weapons
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to protect the nuclear material throughout the world, the Government of Belarus announced the Sunday that would renumber its high-riched uranium reserve, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The treaty was revealed in a joint statement published after the Minister for Foreign Affairs Hillary Rodham Clinton was meeting with the Minister of Belarus for Foreign Affairs Sergei Martynov at the margin of a security summit.
For years, the United States government had tried to convince Belarus that he was denied from its highly enriched uranium and seemed to have arrived to a point without returning the past spring.
But the US officials told you to Washington Post that a couple of operations classified with Belarus in the past two months were carried out to retire 84.82 kg of uranium which was qualified for the arms of a Belarus investigation installation.
This prepared the field for the Monday Agreement to remove the rest of the material, about 227 kg, according to a officer, which spoke from the anonymous due to the confidentiality of the topic.
The agreement seemed to be one of the most important results of the Nuclear Security Summit of 47 nations chaired by Obama in April, which was excluding Belarus.
And so it was a good achievement to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next Summit in 2012.
"I have really been admired by the fact that they wanted a place in the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
"This shows that this process is working", said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Society, a group that promotes nuclear security.
Clinton said the agreement is "a very significant and important step" given by Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama promised in Prague to protect all nuclear material in the world in the next four years.
Since then, the United States government has helped six countries to defeat all its highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A twelve of countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the moment of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, the Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, had stated that the nation would never deny its uranium.
"We have preserved the uranium highly enriched ( hundreds of kilograms of what is basically uranium qualified for weapons) and uranium of low enrichment," said Lukashenko at that time.
"This is our matter first... we're not going to manufacture suicide bombs, and we're not going to sell them to anyone."
"We used it for research, it's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States for a few months and pointed out interest in reaching an agreement.
The officials said that the first task to remove the uranium of Belarus, in October, was particularly complicated, since the material was slightly irradiated.
The officials said that it was loaded in a special train that traveled over 2.000 km to a Russian installation for storage and elimination.
According to the officials, the second operation finished Monday and was held in a flight.
The US government costed 13 million dollars for tasks, and most of the money was used to provide it to Belarus the installation of uranium-based enrichment investigations, which is not appropriate for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Beneiawski, a employee of the Energy Department who worked in the Global Amenaza Reducation, said that "It was coordinated and orchested with much care to strengthen confidence" which leaded to the agreement signed by Clinton.
James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus had at least 40 kilograms of uranium qualified for weapons, as well as hundreds of high-enriched uranium pounds.
Belarus will try to eliminate its reservation until 2012, according to the joint declaration.
The relationships between Belarus and the United States have been stressed for years, mainly due to the awesome repression of Lukashenko of human rights.
But the statement of the Sunday suggested a potential detection.
It was stated that, while the progress in these global security issues was welcomed, the United States and Belarus recognized that more respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue to improve bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens."
The Spanish Government did not put reparations to the CIA flights
The Spanish Government did not repay the CIA flights with Taliban prisoners and Al Qaeda with direction to Guantánamo by Spanish territories, according to a telegram, the U.S. Ambassador in Madrid.
This reflects the filtered documents (cables) by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, where the first vice-president of the Government, Maria Teresa Fernández de la Vega, requested that the Spanish executive was informed to "to demonstrate that they performed an appropriate monitoring on foreign aircrafts that trail Spain".
In June 2006, after a report of the European Council, in which he accused of compliance with human rights in contrary practices to a twelve of countries, including Spain, a meeting was held between the former American Embassy Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The vice-president acknowledged that the Council's report "he had joined the Government of Zapatero outside of the game" and stressed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"The Vega underlined that Spain has no reparations to intellectual flights through Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "disprovened" reports Aguire in a cable.
Also, the titler of Foreigners, Miguel Angel Moratinos, pointed out to the embassy that the Spanish executive would like to give to this matter the lowest possible profile, although, while being in the hands of the judges, the government had a limited influence capacity."
By its part, in January 2007, the Inspector Vicente González transmitted to the Ambassador that he would not try to block the initiative of the judge to request the declaration of documents of the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and of the Department of Defence on the flights of the CIA.
"These reports do not contain any criminal element or any sensitive information", explained the Ambassador after talking to the fiscal.
However, the United States reflected its concern for "aparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German fiscals" than for the declarated information of the NIC or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discretely between governments," regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007, in a lunch between the U.S. Ambassador and the Minister of Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, it commented that "but the Spanish judges are rather challenging of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate," he gave instructions to his collaborators "to avoid comments of retorical inflammate, in an attempt to shine the temperature."
The Ambassador also expresses its concern for the action of the PP in this matter.
"Our experience suggests that the PP will not doubt any indication that the Government of Zapatero has tolerated or deliberately ignored EU action that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the Government of the United States", states.

People would win 4 scanners in the Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the towns of Léida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and deputy experienced in recent autonomy elections, the Catalan PP has the view to generally because it has advanced or not, the perspectives are more positive, since the number of votes that this training has been obtained in these generally doubled to what it receives in the catalans.
Thus, the populations of catalan received 610.473 votes in the overall 2008, while in 2006 autonomy, the figure was 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC reached 384.091 votes.
In order to maintain this trend, which has been nutrited of a CSP vote transfer and the fidelization of the PP electorate, analysts of this training have calculated that, if general elections were held, the PPC could pass from 8 to 12 Members in the Congress, while the CU would also win four (ample 10) and the CSC would lose nothing less than 9 Members (of 25).
These calculations would be found that the catalan plate is essential for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the people, ERC would lose a deputy - now he has three - while the ICV would remain with a deputy or win one.
However, to maintain the electoral calendar, the most immediate quote will be produced in May 2011 with the municipal committees, where the populations may also be decisive to the end of the socialist hegemony in the four province capitals and in their incidence to the deputy of Barcelona, one of the most budgetary administrations - 661 million euros for 2011 -.
As well as popular nationalists, the possibility that the PSC lose the training of Barcelona, Tarragona, Léida and Gerona, where socialists would not obtain the majority or possibility of return to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Since the Republican debacle, it would not be discovered that this training loses its representation in the Barcellone Consistent – 5 per cent of the votes - should be obtained.
The PP has increased its vote figures in the four capitals and could be decisive in Barcelona, Leida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can protagonize the flight in the capital of Tarracon, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist alcalde, Josep Felix Ballesteros.
In Leeda, the PP has only been located at 500 votes of the PSC, whose alcalde, Angel Ross, maintains very good relationships with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, has been found in several occasions.
People have also grown in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is presented in 34 municipal governments in Cataluña and aims to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
Catalan cell facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaida
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, Thailand there were 3
The seven Pakistanians and the Nigerian officials of the Police Information Commissariat in Barcelona formed a historical cell that, directed from Thailand, facilitated passports to different groups of Al Qaida, including "The Tigress for the Liberation of the Tamil" (LTTE) and "Laskar and Taiba" (Let), the last author of Bombay's attacks that caused death to 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Interior has given great importance to these investigations, until the point of ensuring that with the Kampai operation, the Al Qaida falsification device was "debilited" at international level and, therefore, "her operational capacity".
The investigators estimate that the cell, in the two years active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were false and then distributed to the groups that integrate the Criminal Galaxia Al Qaida in order to cross the European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The surprising cell is not the only one that the yihadist network had operated in Europe, so that the investigations have participated in other European police units, in addition to the Thai services, in addition to the Thai police services, so it is not denied that in the EU's territory, the next days similar to the development of the night in March in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanians Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Sitikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Batutunde Agunbiade), in Thailand another was developed with the capture of the Pakistanians Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Syrian Kijbumung.
These were those who directed from Bangkok the cell in Spain and other European countries.
The catalana network - part of it was shooted in 2009 - was mainly robbered to passport tourists who meet the requirements marked by the "World Islamic Force".
The documents should be named by men between 25 and 45 years, with a validity of several years and without strike vis.
In the research, it is stressed that no date has been found to be linked to arrests in Cataluña with the Bombay's attention, although the author of this attack, "Laskar and Taiwan," has been one of the groups of slaughtered passports in Spain and then false in Thailand.
However, it should be reminded that days before this warning was made, from Cataluña were sent through a transfer agency of thousands of dollars that were "inverted" in the purchase of mobile cards, which later were used by the "command" integrants that ended with the life of 106 people.
The police has been insured by a lot of documentation.
The PP requires but is covered by the tax conciert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity last night to exhibit it personally to Artur but its conditions to support its investment as President of the Generalitat, identical to those already addressed during the campaign, and that they are summarising to give priority to the recovery of the economy and to presum the philosophical adventures, as the economic concert that nationalist leader wants to propose in the context of its mandate.
The Chairman of the Canadian People's Championship of Artur, but with the security that he had obtained 18 Members in the elections of last Sunday, has more than enough to do it, since the CU candidate needs at least one of the training that will exercise the opposition to hold in the investment vote.
A possible effort with the PP depends on the future partnerships that nationalists want to keep in the Congress when general elections are held, but at the time, the discussions that these days hold, but with the rest of political leaders are in catalana key.
And with regard to the President of the PP, to support an investment "It's going to cover all sovereign and independent speechs," as well as the economic concert - similar to the Vasco country - that the Convergent leader intends even to submit referendum.
Both leaders are commonly able to adhere the political device of a very inflated autonomy administration and the elimination of the tax of events and donations.
The details of the Mas's investment negotiations will be undertaken by the PPC, Jord Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But it has already been meeting with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition -, Joan Herrera (ICV) and will today do it with Joan Puigcerkos (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laport (Solidaritat Catalan).
Heritage states that deaths were not by "floor of measures"
The officers of the Centre of Olot did not denied that their chairman would kill more than 11 elders
The responsibilities of the heritarian La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered yesterday a press route to reiterate the damage caused by the institution to the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilme, the nurse who was employed there, killed at least once elderly who had been in charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, was composed of the reader of the centre, the lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be able to exercis the accused of the deaths" but "the legality and responsibility of us to take the procedural situation of civil responsibilities".
And it is that, in addition to the social disgrace that the entity may suffer because it has not been identified at time by the crime activities of the caster, the great threat for the Charitat now covers a substantial compensation that are already calculating the legal representatives of the families of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilme acknowledged that the first crime was retired to August 2009 and that since then it has not stopped killing.
The judge already pointed on the car that ordered the exhumation of eight bodys - old patients of the heratric - who suspected that in many cases no doctor had been able to explore the losses, but that, taking care of the age and pathology of the patients, the telephone transmit was discarded.
Caritat, through his director, rejected this extremely yesterday and pointed out that "the lack of measures could not have been at any time the cause of what happened."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in the case there is no only indication that there has been an unclean action by any person who is not the same person."
The already baptized as "Angel de la Morte" condemned 11 murders before and declared that the first crime did it on August 29, 2009 to kill a second grandmother for a month and a half later.
In this case, he tried the death by pulling him a overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime that did it by helping a mixing of seated pillars.
The Director of La Caritat points out that it is complicated to control the access to medicines from the center.
Insulin pinches and seat cocktails would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his ham, would be used to eliminate the suffering of internal, to give them death.
However, analysis are being made in the laboratory which should clarify whether Vila did not lie and seeks a less cruel death for his first victims or if, on the contrary, he burned them through the inside, as it has already condemned with the three women who died between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, it does not give credibility to the manifestations of the caster, nor even to the number of convicted murders, who do not reject that it is higher, and justify their attitude in the various versions that Vila has given in their visits to the judge, and in the short sense that it has to change its way to walk after having done, successfully, eight murders.
That is why they say that justice is available to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB threat
Inversers reacted slowly yesterday to the threat of Trichet that warned "the markets should not subsist our reaction capacity".
Peripheral differences have been strongly closed, and the actions of the European banks have increased over 5 per cent.
However, we should not stress the ability of the ECB to be wrong, and the euro has just highlighted what is a concerning sign.
What has been produced yesterday is own of an illicit market as it is recovery but motivated by closing short and very spectacular positions.
The institutional investor will late in losing fear.
A month ago the ECB quoted us today to retire liquidity measures and will be to be retracted tomorrow for four times in two years and the remaining.
The Federal Bank requested to end the public debt purchase plan by inefficiency and eliminating all extraordinary liquidity measures and to leave so unlimited access per week.
After the Irish crisis, we hope that they extend current liquidity measures " at least until March" and keep the quarter substance with limited access to the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that you continue with your bonus purchase program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not comply with the generated expectations will turn the excellent reaction of the markets last and if they are still obliged to remove liquidity measures, that God assists us!
Like at the May meeting in which they stated that they had not had no or contemplated the purchase of goods and lost the markets, they could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May the Bazuca announced Monday, and the Wednesday said that he had already purchased a lot, causing a new market deployment.
Last night the substance of letters to one year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Tesor only issued 500 million to 5,28%, compared to 750 million to 4,81% of the previous substance.
Even so, the men in Portugal falled 30 basic points throughout the curve, reflecting clearly a market feeling change after Trichet's words.
In Ireland, the figures of the Allied and the Bank of Ireland were published.
The estimated figures are about 10,000 million to short-term and 15,000 potential and have up to February to obtain private capital or will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with stress tests, the figures are assurable within the Help Plan and help to reduce incertitude.
However, on March next, the Government will have to obtain the Parliamentary approval of its new budget and has not yet sufficient support, so Ireland is still a focal of incertidum.
Angela Merkel has moderated his speech to relax the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on December 14th, in which a political commitment is needed to demonstrate that we are an unity and that we all touch the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to touch Wagner and the rest of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the Chairman had the opportunity to present the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will adopt on Friday.
Reform of pensions, transparency in autonomy communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privacy, measures to reactivate employment, sounds in the ears of investors such as Vivaldi's four stations.
The double effect Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish Bolsa has risen at 4,5%, the double than the rest of the European Bols.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Spain Bank has been rapid and condensed and we have benefited from the surprising effect.
Today there is a key substance of a good to three years that will be benefited by the Trichet effect, so we hope that it is strongly resolved and helped to divide the doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to request a Help Plan would be an automation.
We would give us a liquidity line that we don't need, the Tesor has more than 40,000 million in liquidity available the trial than in March, a good type and will close the access to markets without it.
However, the strategy should continue to be the woman of the César, "not to be, it looks like it."
Anyone, we can.
The President of Eulen will condemn Vega Sicilia's meeting requested for his children
The time not amazing in the open conflict in the Alvarez family, Eulen's owners and the Year.
David Alvarez, the founder of the group, will impose, in view of the "null of full right", the court joint of the next January 16, requested by five of its seven children, and in which they will try to make their majority valuation and to be made with the management bodies of the holder of the Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Alvarez and his sons Jesus David and Maria José are providing legal batteries for the new judiciary chapter in his litigation by the control of the group.
The founder of the maintenance of business services to the company does not seem to be prepared to be present in the government bodies of El Janeiro.
His administration advisory was discovered by five of its seven children who were appointed Administrators at the assembly of shareholders from 18 January of this year and whose imprisonment was recorded in the Mercantil Register.
The judiciary of El Year for the next day 16, convocated by the Mercantil No. 2 of Madrid, has again opened the box of the trunes in the area of the Alvarez family.
The rise to the judge to establish the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism which guarantees the convocatory of the joint.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Paul, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquirez, is qualified by David Alvarez as a "desperate resource of the applicants of their five children to, through processal arguments, clearly fraud of law and abuse of law, try to confirm and sanctify the radically no match of 18 January," according to its official calls.
This argument will be the basis that, once the meeting has been held, it takes its impetus by considering that it is "null of full right".
The same protagonists, who keep a discreet silence, have already tried to convoke a meeting in June.
In January, the seven children of David Alvarez controlled 100% of the capital in Bodegas Vega Sicilia, including other assets.
However, the founder of the Service Group claims the use of 51 per cent of the capital, according to the family protocols.
This matter is the substantive issue that the judge should decide once the view of the request of impunity, for which there is no date.
Red Bull triunfa in F1 with a secret weapons of Siemens
A software design improvements in real time cars.
Since Red Bull rolled into the World of Formula 1 in 2004, his history in this selection of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into consideration the options of a new school and, despite the falling trajectory from the last time, last November, at the end point of the campionate, all posted by the Ferrari triumph of the Fernando Alonso.
Unlike the ability to be a pilot of the finally campion, the German Sebastian Vettel, nor the ability of the Renault motor that promotes his car, in the world of the Formula 1 has become the "secrete weapons" that the multinational Siemens has put into the hands of Red Bull to convert it into a winner team.
This is in fact a powerful process simulation software that Germany put on the market in 2007 with a very far away from high automotive competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer instrument has been used to design manufacturer mount chains throughout the world, energy plants, high precision tools.
The goal is to reproduce, simulate faithfully the product or process before building it really, avoiding defects and expenditure.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon's photo cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan’s most famous useful cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for the industrial division of Siemens, explains that the use of this computer instrument in its Factory Formula 1 has enabled Red Bull to design and to make effects "in few hours, almost real time", the changes, changes and improvements identified during the cars and tests.
Russwurm explains that students had a average of 10 technicians in their team that were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in vehicles during each time.
The Red Bull team today works 180 young high-qualification professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project any luck of changes in bolides.
The Siemens director explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all the elements of the Red Bull bolides, with the exception of the engine, which is from the whole Renault's responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aircraft and security elements are amended.
Changes can be made from the virtual reality of simulator to reality at less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced production systems through high technology laser and high technology autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this technological perfection is the number of $40 million that each form 1 team can pay as maximum for each time to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has mounted the high-tech factory to design and produce its boliads in a location about 50 km from London.
This is two buildings where visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered "high secret."
The template for this committee includes 580 people, including their two pilots, the Vettel campion and Mark Webber.
The heritage of the Red Bull 1 formula, uncertainly, is the recent Sebastian Vetell campsite.
Among the many technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has made the service of their participation in the circuits, other protagonists whose competition is inestimable and its notoriety.
The Fabric Technology Chief Steve Nevey states that five years ago it could be said that I+D's progress in the cars was 50% of the victories and pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, these percentages have varied and the technology totals 85% of success, while pilots provide 15% of the added value.
Nevey recognizes that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by the computer because "that are undeterminable gladiators".
HP will install in two years 20 own shops with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugusted yesterday in Barcelona his first exclusive shop in collaboration are his partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of 20 trade networks between 80 and 100 square meters that multinationals expect to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will combine this initiative with the 16 areas already presented in multimarket centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and The Court of English.
HP Spain's Vice-President, Helena Herrero, set an example of the remodelated shop in the Great Barcelonese Vía, property of Pont Reyes, who has been working for 30 years.
The North America Group has prepared a plan for 200 brand sales points in Europe in 2013, including 20 Spanish institutions.
The first openers were Bucarest (Rhumania) and Belgrado (Serbia) last week, being the third of Barcelona.
Herrer did not want to declare the following openings, although he acknowledged that Madrid could be the next destination.
He also assured that the shopping philosophy will always be the same, supporting a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and is responsible for the exclusive shopping mobiliary design (with products that can be touched interactively), which will have an identical image in Europe.
In addition, HP covers the training of establishments personnel.
Helena Herrero refused that it was a French system and stressed that the exclusive trade network aims to "measur client service and pymes in purchase, care, possession, and even packaging".
Barcelona's shop includes a space with a world-wide pilot pilot program that is responsible for resolving the potential problems of HP computer equipment in guarantee.
A online service connected to a technical center in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So, in 10 minutes, we can solve problems that sometimes can be late up to two days."
"This system is particularly designed for pimes and users, since large enterprises have already contracted technical assistance services", noted yesterday Helena Herrero.
Sabadell's "robar" a million customers to their rivals in three years
More optimistic than other guidelines, the Delegated Board of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a hard year for the bank, but initially discard a new crisis of liquidity and vaticinating the end of the passive war.
Nevertheless, it provides a deployment of interest margins, which will be tried to compensate in part by committees and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to catch in three years a million special customers, its depending assignment.
Sabadell has found a way to explore the next three years and so can survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will initiate in 2011 a new director plan for three years.
In addition to surviving without need to return to the public aid of FROB, it is to win market share with the caption of a million new customers - 700,000 if they discount those who can get out of the bank - their larger assignment, since until now they had been more than the pymes and companies than the minorist customer.
This year he captured 250,000 private customers and 500,000 companies.
The market share in particular is 3,5%, while in enterprises exceeds 10%.
Another basis for the 2011-2013 plan is the productivity, or that is the same, of austerity, with the reduction of costs as an objective, and the challenges that the bank will exposure when the results of the year will be presented.
In these days, few banks have been able to establish a number of public objectives and objectives, since the financial crisis has been transferred to all plans of the global bank.
Saadell, in fact, will close this year its Optima plan, set four years ago, although it was initially for three, but the market situation has made it to expand a further exercise.
The customers that let the shooting boxes go to their main goal.
In a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 will be a "facility and transcendental year".
The executive believes that the outcome of the crisis in Spain will be "slow".
Furthermore, in two or three years, "so much hard to create employment", something essential for the survival of bank business, said.
And although it believes that the passive war - which punishes the margins - is reduced, the price of the risk prices that are paying banks and boxes for their emissions to obtain liquidity is already transferred to the credit price to compensate the fall of the margins.
"The issue of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a factor of pressure on credit."
"We have not closed the grip, but the differences are higher," said Guardiola.
Banesto already gave the juvenile orders to its network to limit long-term credit and undergo the price of differences - see Five Days of 22 and 27 November.
He also acknowledged that the tendency of the bank is now "it's to get up of committees", but "is a competitive framework".
The director plan of Sabadell is based on organic growth, but, as always, the group does not remove corporate operations.
No, indeed, it ensures that in Spain "will demand greater sizes".
"The year that comes will move everything," she kept.
Reaffirms that capital requirements are "softly" and do not reject any Spanish financial entity between red numbers.
He pointed out that the FROB can spend the market in the fund captures before new recapitulations.
By ensuring that Sabadell can survive in the temporary closure of the markets, it remained important for some Vatican bankers as a new liquidity crisis.
It indicates that it can't be issued, but in contrast to what happened in June, a short-term financing can be obtained through rest, which loves the crisis.
ECCA discards a second oil of fusion in the boxes
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, discarded yesterday that it was going to produce a oil of shooting boxes and returned to initiating the speed with which the sector restructuration is implemented.
When he started the concentration process of the Spanish boxes, there were various entities that ensured that they would not participate in this first stage and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation Cajas de Ahorros (ECCA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, discovered last night that this new oil of operations will be produced.
"I think that the largest part of the fusions has been done, the integration of Cajasol to the Civica Bank group cannot be said that it is a second round, which there are adjustments."
"The majority is completely done; it may be that, instead of 17, we go to 13 or 14, but all the great processes have already been done and protected by the Spanish Bank, which has also cooperated very much in that way," said the director.
In statements during a disagreement of the Aragon Guidelines and Executive Association (ADEA), Olavarrieta expressed that the concentration process is "to the most possible speed, and we must be very satisfied of how it will be made within the terms that it is not now marked in the business plans with the Bank of Spain", emphasized.
"From of 45 boxes with a average of 28.500 million assets to 17.500 million is a process that does not have a paragon in the history, reduceing the number of entities in 62% to be much larger to comply with Basilea," said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "you exist a number of very unfortunate views on the slowness of the process" which demonstrates "a lack of seriousity and sense," because "what the Spanish Bank does is remember that we must be within the period before the end of the year."
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the most strict financial system of all Europe and "probably" of the world, and assigned to those who put it in the jury screen a "fake of knowledge".
The directive pointed out that, within the current economic countries, "we can be very calm" with the situation of the financial entities and the rail boxes, a system which has undertaken a "important" concentration process and that it would be the most fast possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish bank was very deeply stopped from the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but has established the conditions for the whole Union.
Market pressures have caused a double governance response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has progressed new adjustments from tax reductions to the pymes, the regulation of private placement agencies or the removal of the 426 euros of help to stop, until the 49% of the AEA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and of 30% of the State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of the ex-president Felipe González, has been subjected to the critics to the cancer Angela Merkel for his responsibility to defeat the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
Before Merkel's position is not a mistake in its communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another turn of tourism in the euro's difficult refination process.
And there, Germany has a radically new vision of what must be his future, which shocks to keep the old traditions of a good part of its partners.
In view of European resistances, Germany began to speculate on the three possible results of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by its own, Austria and the Netherlands, between other countries, while the southern would leave the monetary area.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although now it seems fictional science, with a very favourable flow of view, is nearly 50% of the population.
The third, a euro reset, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigor, currency for the transgressors countries, possible suspension of payments for some of them, and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
German position is clear and is defined for a long time, so now they do not have an excuse.
First, in 2009, when both the FMI and the European Commission stimulated the deficit, the German Government left a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between the fact that Germany believed that it should be done (Financies and Stabilities Plans in Public Finance), and what were practiced by its European partners, including France.
The second in front of the Central European country, when Merkel was deeply enlarged the Greece's salvation decision.
It was already a critical pherose, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public view and public opinion were very contrary to the salvation of Greece.
Finally, in recent Octobers, the new Merkel emerges with a clear position, demanding the reform of the Union treaties, to make it possible for the saving of a country and, at the same time, to bind private providers to run with a part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as an anti-European, since it has prevented the Irish crisis and all the other.
But its proposal, although so edulcorated, has been adopted and, in the next months, should be attended to the reform process of the Union that possible to those measures from 2013.
Germany has brought a red line that doesn't think crossing.
And everyone is saying that, although it is now to take measures with which it may not be very agreed, from that date the euro's former function will have been completed.
2013 will mean the birth of a new currency area, where infractor countries are severely sanctified, can be declared in payment suspension and, in that case, the private sector will also run with a part of the cost.
Germany has noted that we must follow a serious growth route with high shore and investment rates, consumption moderation, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external salts.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge squads in the payment balance, such as the Spanish growth in the years of the tree, is not just tolerate it.
The invitation is clear.
And we wouldn't understand it.
It is not only to reduce public deficit to 3 per cent in 2013.
What they require is much harder.
And the worst we could do in these circumstances is to lie to ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulences make a more tranquility.
And we use the opportunity window that they gave us, until spring 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero also understood it as well as its dual show (the promised reforms after the Sabbath meeting with the major enterprises and the announcement of the last night of new measures) suggests that, despite the critics of Merkel, it has been opened the test that it must be ordered at home.
But the red line that Germany has brought there is, and it doesn't seem to move it.
And, among the possibilities that they consider, it can not be excluded.
So, Germany can always tell us that he had warned us.
Legislative sport and fraud
Treasures like Alonso and Ramos before the Ajax demonstrate engineer but not want to escape a sanction.
The extremely urgent expulsion of two players of the Real Madrid Real (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the negotiated party on 23 November against Ajax in the Championship Liga has caused to write tint rivers about whether such a conduct is or not anti-sport and if, where appropriate, both players should be sanctified by the EUFA.
As you know well, in the absence of a few minutes to finish the game (which your team had clearly winned), the two players lost deliberately time at the time to get out of the missing feelings to cause the album to show them the second cart on death.
Thus, and since the Real Madrid will already end as a leader of his group, both players will comply with regulatory sanctions on the next ligary party, against the Auxerre, and may pass clean cards at the next stage.
Finally, the EUFA Disciplinary Committee has sanctified two parties to the team trainer, José Mourinho, and with different economic amounts to the players involved.
The provocation of a amazing card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, but more frequent in the fútbol world.
It is so extensive that is part of the echos, of the non-scribed rules, but followed by this sport.
The part of the debate occurred in the reported case should be protagonized by a team of the Real Madrid entity (which is presuming nobleness and honour, and in the past time has been multiplied to its players by analogous acts) and the orchestrated dramatization, in the view, by Mourinho, who adds more episode to its diligent history of historic and provocator technology.
In any case, the debate turns around whether this type of conduct does not expressly prohibit the principles of sport, i.e., if these actions do with law fraud; therefore, they are indeed respectful actions with the sporting regulation, but it seems to be aware of their sense.
The question is to consider the type of damage caused by the sporting spirit.
One of the goods that understand the sports spirit is the physical integrity of the opposite players, aspect that with these actions was not put in danger, i.e., there was no violent game.
Another of these goods to whose clean game is to avoid the team of infractor players is injustly used by the opposite team, what was not happening.
However, the paradoxical action of the king Madrid players is that it was not encouraged to what we normally characterize as a trap or fraud of law, because their violation of the rules was not hidden to try to avoid sanction, but it was exactly the most clear thing to receive the punishment of the arbitrator.
They expected and accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders obtain in the intentional misses.
Here it seems to be necessary to realize that it is not put in a disvantaged situation to the rival, nor benefits in the same party, since the result of the action is obviously to leave its own team with less players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next party, because the club can't tell them players.
Of course, the benefit is that players will start the next stage of the Championship Liga without cards that can threaten their participation in a future party.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, because the equipment can be removed to the first changes, and in addition to this action, the players comply with a sanction party and pass to the second cycle of cards, where the suspension by cumulation of cards is produced with a less than in the first cycle.
So, to go around, it's not so clear that it's a advantage.
Finally, these actions do not go against the sporting spirit, which is part of taking strategic decisions that favour the maximum benefit of what they allow the rules.
In the case of us, the players did not act in order to avoid the application of the sanction (this would be a clear case of law fraud), but better chose when they were subject to it.
They took a strategic decision without punishing punishment or flying out of the same.
Although the border between the engine and the fraud of law is difficult, in this case I think it was a clear case of engineering.
Politeics, I seem to have two factors: because it was two self-expulsions and the way the transmission of the directive to cause them.
The damage caused by the principles of sport for these actions is not both ethical and ethical.
Offspring of offers to capture group shipment scenes in NCB
The calendar dictatory focuss on the reserves for 16 and 17 days this year.
They are proliferated by employees who want to pay between 20 and 30 euros.
As the tour and lottery, with the arrival of December, they also return the grouping scenes before Christmas, which continue to exercise oxygen ballon for reconstruction and octopus of Barcelona, but that because of the crisis, they have displaced in an inadequate prices to be able to capture the majority customer: almost everyone wants to pay between 20 and 30 euros in the cemetery or eating, they match entrepreneurs and associations of the interviewed sector.
To completely complicate the accountability, the calendar of this year (the falling Wednesday) has focused on requests in the week of 13 December, with the result until the date of a dinner reserve for days (16 and 17) and only movement for the previous week.
As has been happening since 2008, when the flash vacation stage began, many companies have removed the collective dinners for budgetary matter.
In order to avoid the tradition, many workers keep it paying from their own bottle.
Anything the conyuntura, ones and others require battle prices, confirms the President of the Gremi de Restauracio de Barcelona, Gaiity Farràs.
The representative of the patron, on the day of today, is not inclined to vampire how to be the feasts of this month.
"The people think it's much before booking."
"You want to get out, but you have the warnings in the price theme," points out.
The business will be well "to those who give good quality to good price and with good service", adds, and recalls that customers tend to cut a scale with the crisis, so that the franch around 25 euros has become majority in demand.
In a survey in various centre institutions, the failure of requests is observed for the night of 17.
The Soteras Group indicates that there is a true boom of applications for that Friday, with the intention of expending less than 30 euros, which have responded to adjusting its menus to the countura, with full forms from 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Funda and others), the calendar's peculiarity has made more pre-reserve, even since the beginning of November.
"We made it impossible to keep the same prices in the past year, with menu for all costs from 19.95 to 30 euros," detailed.
In AN Group, who abandons El Mussol, Attic, Ququ, and until a total of 23 locals, optimities are maintained after detecting an increase of the facturation from the second half and a good, although concentrated, business perspectives for Christmas.
The sources of the group highlight that 18 will also be a hyperactive day at the level of friends groups that preserve feasts.
The six group menus have added a shipment with 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that it is expected to pay 10 per cent more than the last year in change to require more details, such as cable.
They also see green browns in some enterprises that return to invite their employees and feel that the volume of groups is something greater.
By the Facasarm patron (including institutions such as Bars Association, Restaurants and Ocio de Barcelona), its vice-president Enric Gomá, trusted in starting seeing the end of the tunnel and claims that the reservations are "animated" in all, although clients "negociated to the maximum".
That's true, the illusion for the festivals has not fallen down, pays who pays, indicates.
The Pakistani nuclear programme generates great concern in the EU
Islamabad produces atomic weapons to "a rhythm faster than any other country".
Wikileaks filters confirm links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department filtered by the Wikileaks port confirms the huge concerns caused by the Pakistanian nuclear programme.
In spite of the details of the clauses and games offering the content of the discussions and thoughts of the nord-American diplomatic representatives in Islamabad, documents show that cooperation between both countries in the field of atomic security instead of going to grow, "decree" and that the inestable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "a faster rhythm than any other country of the world".
The particularity of Pakistan's nuclear programme - that weapons are not assembled, but that are still stolen by components to defeat their destruction in the case of attack - is one of the main reasons for development in Washington.
This lists the embassy in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before visiting the National Security Council, James Jones: "The nearness of some nuclear installations in the territory under the Taliban attack, the smiling dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is contemplated, not only by the United States, but also by Russia as proliferant and reasons for guarding.
"Pakistan has had to contract personally with strict religious believers to protect nuclear facilities; given the fall of educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunity to recall people working in nuclear or mixed programmes," said the U.S. Expert Yuri Korolev, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at a meeting with their American victims.
The most renewed documentation filtered by the port of Julian Assange is the increasingly smaller cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in nuclear proliferation issues and the high Pakistani rhythm of nuclear weapons production.
A post of the embassy in May, who qualifys the communication with Pakistan, states: "Transparency is frequently unnecessary; aid offers remain without answer or are discarded."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, the official of the National Intelligence for South Asia, notes that "in spite of the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons to a faster rhythm than any other country in the world".
The Ambassador Patterson also requests Washington, during a visit from the army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, to let "so clear" to the responsible person that "the Pakistanian army must end with the taxi support to terrorist groups".
To the caza of the chief of Wikileaks
Obama names a high responsibilities for the fight against terrorism to avoid new filters.
Interpol emits a red warning to follow the movements and place Assange where he is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, is a complex laberinto where it is difficult to be sure about the facts.
Last night, Interpol issued a red alert to "localize and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, it is not a traditional arrest order.
Moreover, it is not new, but date of 20 November.
And it is not necessary to see the last filter of more than a million diplomatic documents from the United States but to the accused of sexual abuse that Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, ensures that "the police knows where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
It was the 20th day when the international police body sits in Leon (France) said the order to Sweden's request, but he did not reveal it until yesterday, after receiving authorisation from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 Interpol countries have indications to identify or locate Assange "towards their provisional and extraditional arrest."
While Interpol cannot order the arrest of a red warning person, many of the Member States, as they have explained the organization, are considered the called network notes free to carry out a arrest - which must accompany the national police body - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, such as the case of Sweden and England, where it is believed that Assange is.
The movement was inflicted by the lawyers of Assange, who published a letter last, claiming that the founder of Wikileaks of 39 years of age has been prepared to respond by videoconference to the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They also remember that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the fiscal case, compared to the Mitico Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's security chief.
"This seems to be a castle, not a legal persecution", says the mix.
While the world seeks it - and from Australia his mother defends the innocence of his son -- Assange remains in unknown stop, but not called.
The Monday gave a interview to the director of the magazine Time through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the division of the United States State Secretariat, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that it was responsible for ordering US diplomates that spot in the United Nations by violating international treaties which the United States has signed, it should be dimitted," said.
His opinion was denied yesterday by the Press secretariat of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who qualified for "ridical and absurde" the request of division.
"I'm not sure why we need to import the opinion of a type with a web page," said the CNN chain.
Obama himself has been responsible for the antiterrorism fight, Rusell Travers, to prevent new documents fleet.
The attempt of President Barack Obama to remain important to Assange contrasts with the views that these days proclaim political and conservator comments.
Peter King, the congressist who will preside from January to the National Security Committee in the low room, requested the Department of State to consider the possibility of include Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to interfere and funds and to pursue any of the contributions or assistance."
Moreover, Tom Flanagan, an adviser of Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to turn back after saying that Assange should "slaughter".
"Obama should convert it into goal and use a non-floored plane or something."
Who didn't apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist Minister, Arkansas' Expeditor and possible candidate to the presidency.
"Whoever is in the Government who filtered the information is a tragic fault, and anything that is not the execution would be a very friendly punishment," stated in the Fox chain.
Puigcerkos search for peace in ERC with guides towards Carod
The Republican leader will allow a secret vote on its continuity to the party.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcerkos seems to have found the receipt to complete the internal revue in the ERC lines, not north for the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The Chairman of the party is conscient that his division mask is insufficient for the purposes of exercising Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is now so diluted as his own mentor and that it can absolutely cause the head-infringers that had with other extinct flows.
The left leader will therefore try to win the new critics with rings that allow him to blind up to municipal elections.
To begin, Puigcercus announced yesterday that the more than 200 national ERC advisers could be expressed on their continuity in secret.
By rolls, and not at the top of the hand.
If the carodists want a certain punishment vote to the President, they can do it without fear of reprise.
In fact, the head of rows wants to avoid the division image as well as the subjection to your person.
In several interviews, he stated that it would not be considered to be ratified with half of the votes, but added, without needing percentages, that it would not be a good result "to the Bulgaria".
The next Carod requires the President more than to put his duty to warranty, a pledge that is not valuable when Puigcercus controls the maximum organ between conventions.
But when you don't have enough majority to force divisions, you will try to agree with the executive a road sheet from here to May.
For that reason, they are expected to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that the address will submit to the vote of the national Council on 18th.
Its intention is to avail Puigcercuss in turn that this promises to advance the 2011 Sunday, something that the cúpula has already given.
The leader of ERC acknowledged that the "poliphony" damages stability and that its goal is to make that the organization will once again be able to lay the shoot doors into the inside.
In this line, the article that the consuler in functions Josep Huguet stated in his blog.
Bearing in mind the ideologist of Puigcerkos, the Titleer of Innovation was due to the fact that the leader will be reflected "a change of various objectives".
And he put five, of which they highlight two.
The first, "recommendate" the executive to represent at least 90% of the war, i.e., include new characters from the African sector in Carod.
The second may be the great news.
Huguet proposes to liquid ERC once the assembly as a operational mechanism.
He therefore proposes a reform of the statutes that allows the conventions to celebrate through delegates elected by sufragio.
Finally with the assembly model, one exception in the Spanish game system, has been an obsession of the Puigcerkos team, which has already struggled in this sense in the last two conventions.
Indeed, the convulsory couple of 2008 left the load to review the assembly in a specific Status Reform Congress.
This quote remains long, since the internal marine in the last few years was conviction to address the matter.
Now, without the critical sectors of the oil, it may be a good time to restore it and try to close it forever.

Maintenance of China objectives to reduce winter gases
The representative of that country in the COP16 ensured that his country has made huge efforts to reduce the carbon shoes and detailed its offer to reduce 40 to 45 per cent of its emissions of winter gas.
China maintains its offer to reduce 40 to 45 per cent of its greenhouse gas emissions to 2020, assured its Wei, representative of that country in the COP16.
In its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), its Wei ensured that its country has made huge efforts to reduce the carbon skin and to convert to its industry.
In fact, in the past four years, her country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce the emission of winter gases.
However, it was clear that China will not change its goals, but will continue to work together with the international community in this regard.
It pointed out that the Chinese climate change strategy was divided into four sections: dialogue; capacity construction; institutional construction and support for pilot programmes.
All of these rubbers have been made progress, including the adoption of a new Energy Law, which collects the objectives proposed for the reduction of gas emissions in the past year.
On the other hand, it stressed that in China, the federal authorities have been coordinated with states and local authorities in order to achieve the energy-speed goals, effective energy use and emission reduction.
Furthermore, they have been undertaken or already concluded various multiannual plans, both financed by the Chinese government and by governments of other countries.
For example, he reflected that the Energy Efficiency Programme, which was implemented during the past five years and received investments from the United Nations (ONU), the Government and the private initiative.
A provincial climate change project is also undertaken, the other for the change of incandescenced focus by shockers and one more mixing and adjustment, has detailed.
In the same table, Martin Krol, scientific counsel from the Government of that country on climate change, ensured that the efforts of China have been higher than those who are generally thinking.
For example, I exposed, the emission by winding gas capture in China is of six tons per person, while in the United States is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution to the pollution.
It has also made no previous efforts in energy use, as 20 percent of energy efficiency in the past five years and was expected to do more up to 2020.
Appealed to Legal Exilation of Spino: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN declared that the former panist leader was in his right to join the National Order Commission to claim what its right agrees.
The national leader of the PAN, Caesar Nava Vázquez, ensured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barientos was appealed to legality and that the former panist leader is in his right to advise the National Order Commission to claim what its right agrees.
In an interview before the protest of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as the ruler of the State, he said that the expulsion of Spino in any case is a decision taken on the local area.
"This is a self-determined decision of the Sona Order Commission."
"Mr. Spino has his right to recall, in its case, the Commission of the National Council's Order, so that it is a decision taken in the field of a competent authority," noted.
On the other hand, he stated that it was not time to think in 2012 and that it was never in the negotiation table an alliance for the presidency candidate.
Nava Vazquez was convinced that national action will be strengthened from the internal election of the next 4 and 5 December, where his successor will be elected.
"This (a partnership in 2012) is a theme that has never been in the negotiation table, at least not at least now, was a approach to the local election that was successful and achieved the goal," said.
The panist leader needed that the PAN supported it for 71 years of dialogue, so "we did not fear internal competition; the account "we enjoy and strengthened it", acknowledged.
He said that the advice will, without doubt, be able to choose the best or best leader to require National Action for the next three years, where he will provide the staff "to whom the Council determines".
"I have that absolute silence and open, any of the five stages would be proud to give him the office of the President of the party."
He pronounced that the representative who registered the party in the past elections of 4 July will be reflected in the following contents, although "is still not a time to think in 2012."
"Together it is to join the Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments employed from alliances in Oaxaca, Publa and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observing throughout the country, so that "Third hopes, angels are placed in them, and I am sure that Gabino will be at the height of expectations".
On the question of PRI critics to President Felipe Calderon for his speech within the four years of his government, Cesar Nava called the prisoners to reflect the sex of the former President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than the Fox and Calderon; they start to defend them; that goes out of the clothe," he stated.
He believed that the holder of the federal executive could express, such as those who did in his speech in the National Auditor, because there is no censure in the country.
Promote Obama on Twitter law for undocumented students
"If you agree that to adopt the Dream Act is the appropriate, you call your senators and instruct them to adopt the law," tweeted the American President in the social network.
President Barack Obama was summoned today to national mobilization in support of the Dream Act Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his own Twitter social network account.
"If you agree that to adopt the Dream Act is the appropriate, you call your senators and urge them to adopt legislation," tweeted Obama.
His short message is opening a cybernetic link with a more comprehensive document requesting the public to communicate immediately with the senators, since the vote of legislation is imminent.
"As a voice that is expected soon happens, now it is the time to make your voice is listening," states.
The message was released after 42 representatives were threatened by blocking any legislation, unless the extension of the Bush Taxes and the financing of the Government was approved.
This block, announced in a letter signed by the 42 representatives of the Republic, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START Treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
As questioned by the Republicn block to the Dream Act and other projects, the presidential portal Robert Gibbs trusted that once the fiscal issue was resolved, a calendar can be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think there's a long time."
"We all agree that we have to solve the fiscal matter before the end of the year..."
"I think we can achieve an agreement at some time in that, and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," said.
The leader of the most senate-democratic majority, Harry Reid, announced the Tuesday that he would ask for a "debating vote" for the Dream Act, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted from the next Thursday in the Senate, although it is most likely the next week.
The senatoral version of the Dream Act or the American Suege would legalize some 8000,000 young people who entered in the United States before 16 years of age, have remained in the country in the past five years and entered into a superior or army education institution.
However, the parties require 60 votes to adopt the initiative, which requires the competition of a Republican pugnate, at the time that partial organizations of the project protagonize a intense scope to ensure the approval of the law.
Democrats, most of whom the Dream Act support, have 58 scanners.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson de Nebraska, said that he will vote against, and only one Republicn has expressed its support to the law, Richard Lugar de Indiana.
Thus, the Dream Act partys require a number of Republicns to be summarized if other democratics decide to make the initiative wide.
Among the most shocked Republicans are the Senators of Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and Senator George Lemieux, Florida, who completed the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch, of Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but have declared that they will not support it again.
Another Republic who supported, John McCain, has not defined its posture at this time.
Although the Representative Chamber has a different version, analists agree that Dream Act faces the greatest obstacles in the Senate.
With literature the dent in the ring
The second round of the language funerals was a step in which the participants made the gala of the narration
"It's from the sex in the language I understand, but... Is the dedo in the ring? what is waiting for me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, invited to open the second round of the funerals of the language, cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish, and that this occasion used the subtitle of his question (in another feast the redonda table was given to the sex in the language, explained).
The thirst in the language... "Please us in apprehensions," sweetly spent the Argentinan writer to the public, mostly young people, which was quoted in the International Fear of the Guadalajara Book (FIL) to listen to this moderate table rounded by Marisol Shultz and where they participated in Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela reads a text that gave to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would then define as a great account, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist that is looking for knowing what is the "langa" goes from a doctor who does not get answers even though they are on the same shield.
From infectolog comes convinced: "Pacience is not my strong, maybe it's my sweet."
Finally, after a frustrated approach to the traumatolog who stole him the alien in half of the pastel, but who shocks him that liga is not a scientific term; it is the psycho-analist who reveals the mystery: "The llaga is the real open, the symbolic is the cycatriz".
The protagonist suffered alliedly and concluded "of the ring only by means of knowing that it is the real open and that there is no place," but convinced that the joy and the tramps of the language should be very interfered.
Valenzue her, the writer, played both.
Nicaraguense Sergio Ramírez also exhibited a delegy narration that referred to Elogio of the Invention, where the dog in the ring is not appointed but at a time is found.
With magic realism pincels, the account of a famosa famosa, which touched the same clouds, brought back to men who had gone away, or repaired the characters that had lost a sleeve, narration that came to speak later America, the great news that did not miss him from the beginning of his own cronists that counted it and quoted to Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticized the exceedances of this account by the conquistators.
"Chervantes who invented us to all (the writers) made a bull of the fingered witnesses that appeared in the stories presented as real, but in another way, they would never have come to tell the history of America with imagination that she had missed until the potential."
He highlighted, however, "It's the luxury and the embusters who think best" and it is where it converts reality and lies, where it is no longer known that it belongs to a band or another, where the fiction literature reaches its apogeon.
It's actually called the "cervantine tradition".
"For his heritage, we are what it is understood."
At its turn, writer Mayra Montero took and welcomed the variety of interpretations to place the invitation of the FIL with its round table The dedo in the ring.
The Cuban-Purricans pointed its own towards the great band of social violence that is traced by its country - and shares Latin-American-Product of trafficking and sales of drugs.
"I think that the good literature, the good poesia, the good songs will enclose a taxi commitment that is of course not predicted," said, after quoting that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment between authors and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of this last.
On the evening, the Spanish poet Luis García Montero closed the Spanish poet, whose intervention also endorsed "of that deed in the language of the forced writer of the writer".
He considered that in a world who lives on the slow, also in the intellectual costs and in the control of the consciences reset in dogmatism, forgetting "what behind each statement is a little no, and behind each rejection there is a small one."
"To be debtors of our thinking and to be a duty of the reality, we have to die: and mature often means put the deed into the ring and smiling those who are much more comfortable thinking of loading, white and black, in established ideas, without mortality and mourning also the powers that prefer a world in white and black," said, inviting to recover the sense of writing.
Roman goes for his first title
Ruben Omar Romano accounted with three finished cuts, he had shocked in his car, but he has already been able to reach the decisive series in three times.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end, there are also two different styles marked by its technicians, which are among themselves with a contrast marked by the results.
Ruben Omar Romano accounts with three finished strikes, he had shocked in his car, but he has already reached in three times the decisive series, although even now it is white and that's why this occasion is very special for him.
The argentine has finished console with the medal of the subcampe, a step behind the winners and curiosely with the same team has played consecutive finals.
The Santistic Strategy came to his first end as a trainer at the Open Tower 2002, when he took the Morelia's ends, with which the 4-2 before Toluca falled globally; and then, in the 2003 Clausure also came to a decisive duty and also lost it with 3-1 globally and was precisely before Rayados.
It was already with Santos Laguna, in the Bicentenary Tornee 2010, again before the Devils, Rubén suffered a revenge, since his team ended a 2-2 in front of the shoes after 210 minutes of game, but in the skin of criminality was put into advantage by 3-1 with two chances to sell the title for his three players finally failed from 11 steps and suffered the 4-3 tour.
Rubén has already lost two finishs with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, therefore he does not want to run the same luck, seek to get out of the wrong and to celebrate a title for the first time, although he claims that the institution is the most important for him.
"I want to get out of the camp, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for a affection to which I have to do, and therefore will come the title for me, but it's the most important thing," commented the timonal when it was asked about the numbers that he has in contrary to play ends.
Very viable has the previous end, of which, assured, has learned very much, "The only teaching we can have is that until the silver arbitre can't celebrate the end, we're prepared at the gate, the players also, because once before, with two criminals to take it, we're already prepared to get out and I think that this is a teaching, until we can't be done the party."
Knowing that this series could be defined in criminal tireds, which is not worried to him, because it trusts in its players: "There is never seek to reach the punishment of criminals, one seeks to end in regular time, but sometimes there is no need to be prepared, in the previous tour we were prepared, unfortunately made us a bad game, sometimes by the nervouss or the anxiety to have the title in the hands, but it went to us, that left us something to this end that we wouldn't expect to reach this instance."
Romano has in his hands to stop being a sub-camping technical and to try for the first time the glory that the titles give.
EU changes rules for visa
The persons should accompany the Visa Service Centres before their interview in the Advisory Section; the cost will be lower and the time of expectation.
From 10 January 2011, it will change the procedure to treat a visa at the United States Embassy and Consulted Embassy.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicationers should be addressed to the Visual Service Centers (ASC, by their letters in English) before their interview in the Advisory Section.
The ASC staff shall take the biometric information of the applicant, which is reviewed by the Consulting Section before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain benefits for the aspirants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, and it will not be necessary to make a payment for concerting the quote, another payment to process the visa application and another to provide the message service.
The aspirant shall only perform a single payment that covers the three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: the equivalent to $140 for a tourist visa, $ 150 for cases of visa with request (including visions for temporary workers) and $390 for tradeers and investors.
Persons who want to renew their visa will not have to take a interview with the Consulting Office, but will only visit the nearest ASC where they will submit their documents and take them to them.
Since biometric information is taken in the ASC, the applicants requesting a second quote to be interviewed in the Consulting Section shall remain in this less time than in the past.
Similarly, those who request for a visa in the Consultants in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and New Laredo will no longer pay the additional service rate of 26 dollars.

NASA will announce foreign life
The US Space Agency quoted the press to present tomorrow a finding that will cause an impact on the search of living in space.
The National Administration for Aeronautics and Space (NASA) of the United States will bring to know tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory that there is extraterrestreat life.
The discovery will be presented on a press route on Thursday at 13:00 a.m. at NASA's headquarters at Washington by experts in astrobiology, science described as the task to study the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the universe.
By quoting the press, the NASA assured that it would present "a finding that will cause an impact on the search for foreign life", which resulted in speculations of experts from other countries.
The discovery could show the theory of existing creatures by our and in hostile environments that were thought inhabitable, and in the table they would consider the possibility that they become intelligent as humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
It seems to be a microbiology found at the fund of the Mono Lake at the Yosemite National Park in California, where it lives in a environment that was thought to be too venenous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
In some way, the creature uses the arsenic as a way to survive and of this capacity increases the possibility that similar life may exist in other planets that do not have our welfare atmosphere.
According to astronoms, if these bodies use arsenics in their metabolism, it will be demonstrated that "you there is another form of life, a second way of life, other than what we know."
The Space Agency will know the real range of findings at the Sunday Press Conference.
The conference will participate in the geology Pamela Conrad, who studied the possibility of life in March; and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studied Titan (the largest moon of Saturno), will be under the perspective that its chemical is similar to the earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and Block Pattern Opposer
With reforms to the Organic Law of the Congress, instead of ‘bipartidism’, they declare.
The 60 legislation was not installed when in the Congress there was an opposite block, headed by the Deputy of the PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesus Manual Montalvo, who was declared independently, and the four questions were: the arrival of the 'bipartidism' to the House.
Before the installation session of the 60th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, de Convergence; Ezequiel Reynoso Spaza, PT; Javier Covea Corvedo, PRD; and Montalvo Patron, 'tronaban' against the reform of the Organic Law, since it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterate, from the start of the 'bipartidism', because they are now two people, at the same number of parties, who will control the Congress.
These four Members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the RDP, were the only ones who voted against the Division Meeting, headed by the Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca panster.
Corvera Quevedo, detailed that these reforms in institutional way were the political marginality of the PRI and PAN.
He declared that in the next days they will speak to the representatives of the PAN and PRI to change the scheme, part of a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be availed again by both parties and the opposite coalition was concluded.
"As it comes (the opposite coalition), it is what I see, because we are excluded, from any decision, not even have the political defence to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, from Convergence, mentioned that there are coincidences with the PRD, PT and Patron, and therefore they are in compliance with a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, continued, that the Congress after being monopolic, now be "doopical".
"The spirit is not the spirit to reform the law that has everlasting bipatideism in the Congress."
To begin, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are talking with other partners and partners to be more, the convergent has enlarged.
Hezekiel Reynoso Sparza, of the PT, explained that the Congress had now become a 'botin' between two, in allusion to the PAN and PRI.
"Before he was just a party, now they're dividing it between two."
Pattern Montalvo, was requested to respect the personality of the deputy, and it was given its place in the negotiations tables.
"It is not for covered agreements, it is not for 5 which we probably go to do 9 Members, listen to the five that we see, separated in different fractions, we have decided to unify us to find a place in the negotiation table, that is the theme that in the reform that they made them agreed, we are outside and we are not agreed with that reform."
Sell $2000,000 more for the supplier
Payment of Mazatlan another cheque to the questionnaire propitaire of electric material company.
A more than 200 thousand weight for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was sent by the Auditor.
With this, the amount paid in this second seventh to the propietary of the electrical material company is 1 200 million weight.
According to the Municipium Transparency page, this last shop number 9258447 was sent on 16 November last, by the amount of 200 000 144.56 weight, under the concept of "contamination of accounts to be paid".
The Tesor Luis Miguel López Moreno had advanced that she would get more money from the Common for this supplier, which was observed by the Supreme Audit of the State to sell to a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total that still is granted to you, and therefore how many more cheques are missing to be sent for Camacho Palazuelos.
"He hasn't been purchased anything, it's just paying to him what should be, as the rest of the suppliers," said in a interview.
The last "repared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two of 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and this last, 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal of the State, as noted by the Act when a company is questioned by the ASE, so that other Governments use their services, the Ombudsman ensured that they did not return to use its services.
Before, on 25 July, Northwest published a revisation to the Cheques that issued the Ayuntaggio to its providers, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, the Alcalde Jorge Abel López Sánchez in Camacho Palazullos paid the Municipio more than 10 million weight through 42 cheques.
He also performed transactions with Jumapam, where he covered cheques for more than 3 million weight.
Urgent to accommodate tourist sites
They regret the tourist accidents of the Foreign Tourist for misleading conditions of the Gloria Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlan.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a shock of the Gloria Sánchez Taboada, the tourism sector Mazatlan requested the authorities to take care of the areas and sites that are in bad state and design a bad picture of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, Chairman of the Dorada Zone Trader Association, recalled that, in various cases, the image of the destination was regarded and reverse the evil that tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said that the bad state of the streets and banks has affected because tourists are coming to pass and see the desorden and get back to the nearby business.
"Politicals do not know what to close one day a company and have no idea of the dinner that is lost, or instead they would not do the works in such a way and without the appropriate planning."
The hotel José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the Auditor.
"The municipality will have to take its responsibility and avoid passing again, how to do so I give preventive maintenance and not only fall in the correction," said.
"We are desired to enjoy a clean city, because not only because of being a tourist area, it must be given the maintenance, but as a people who have a clean site to live and the Ombudsman must change their strategy to keep the city well."
There are other sites that also shine unclean and incomplete, said, such as the Escudo and the Venate of Mazatlan.
"How, to come to the tourist not only depends on the promotion, it must have a good product, a city that has cleanness in its beaches, in its adventures, permanent maintenance in what the tourist attractives are", said.
"The proper attention has not been given, and this kind of facts makes evidence of something that is notorious for everyone, the maintenance is missing."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Subsecretary for Tourism Promotion, expressed that it is urgent for the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlan, because they are not used in a proper manner and design a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that should be online together with the municipality and be priority to have the city on the day, clean, ordered, and that it is attractive because it is of tourist vocation.
"Freestly Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural sites and places that will have to be ordered first, clean and put online to make attractive works so that we can sum them in the inventary we have to promote the destination."
Request IP results to the Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE, proposed that Members have the great responsibility to be an example of a better Sinaloa for the various challenges faced.
A dignified and free work legislation between parties and the State Executive claims the business sector of Mazatlan, because there is a convulsionate Sinaloa that faces major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60 legislation, integrated by seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 PAN, three of the New Alianza Party, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of Convergence and one of the PVEM, which sums a total of 40 popular representatives.
Among the list of expectations of the new integrators of the State Congress is that they will be carried out a clean and compromise management with society and with the various sectors that require a responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of partiism or patriarchism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, President of the Employer Coordinator Council, proposed that the recent 40 deputy members of the State Congress have the great responsibility to be an example of a better Sinaloa for the various challenges faced by the State Congress.
"We hope that Members really exercise their right, free of agreements between parties, because they are costly doing arrangements to ensure their own interests and become carnaval comparisons of governments and the leaders of the parliamentary fractions."
He said that they are certified by the commitment to establish the necessary points they go forward to the Governing Body.
"We are occupied that they will come to a dignified work and, above all, compromised with society and sectors because they were the synalogues who gave them the vote of trust in the past elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, President of the Hotels Tres Islands Association, considered that one of the great challenges of the 40 popular representatives was to empower and summon forces to seek the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important is that they emphasize economic growth, which generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that will somewhat promote the generation of employment."
As regards tourist activity, he requested that new legislators give him the weight reviewed within the State budget to strengthen the State Tourism Secretariat.
"I have understood that it is the second Secretariat in the state of minor budget and it is incompatible as an important economic activity and generator of divisions and investment and which is directly tasked with the agriculture industry."
Furthermore, resources are required to be marked to decent tourist projects and to coadminister it to the State and to update the Alcohol Act that have not been able to resolve in previous legislation.

Munichs, cars and bikes, among other games, are the angel of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.

However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, Mary Guadalupe, Isaias, José Joan and Miguel do not lose the hope that Melchor, Gaspar, and Baltazar give them the games and the clothes they want so much.
The family lives a humble house of the Salvador Columbia Allend and lives on the day because the father has no fixed job.

Adelaida, of 4 years old, wants a munch or bicycle, while his sister Isabel, 3 years old, would like a barbie munch.
For his part, José Alfredo, a 10-year-old-old-old, aspire to have a "monster" car and to his sister Jesus, of 8 months old, to sugger a sweet clothe for a year.
"He said to me (Josea Alfredo), 'I would like this monster', but I said to him, 'I'm seeing the son', 'for I was very sweet," he recorded with tristety Cettana.
For the older children, who were at school, clothing and calmed, would be the ideal.
Mary Guadalupe, 11 years old, is the 12th age; Isaiah, of 10 years old, is 10, while Miguel, 8 years old, uses eight tall.
Joseph Juan, 14 years old, misses his tennis, so a couple of such five or half six would be very helpful.

Catorty detented drug traffickers
Thursday, in Estonia, a decade of persecution was held in the context of the dismantling of a production network and sale of Cannabis.
They have been arrested by 14 persons who will face various charges.
Persecutions have been produced in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly where drug production was carried out.
"Around 750 plants of Cannabis, four kilos of hachy, money and equipment for the production", says Louis-Philipe Ruel, portal of the Security of Quebec.
In total, 11 men and three women were arrested, including two of the network leaders, two men of Sherbrooke.
The detentors had to compare in the Sherbrooke's justice palace in the following hours to their detention.
Cannabis production accused, ownership with the aim of trafficking, compliment and services robust, among others.
These persecutions have been produced after a long investigation that has longed about one year.
"The information provided by the public has been given to us in detention," says Mr. Ruel.
In this police operation, about seventy agents of the Quebec Security Safety Research module, Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphremagog police Department participated.
You may fight against clandestine migration without problems
The draft legislation of conservators that, according to the Government, should solve the problem of the loaded paternes of clanian migrants, will probably be a great opposition, since the three opposition partys have announced the Monday that they could not support it.
"I think I'm mainly in the Charter."
"I'm meeting here with a party that has created the granito you're sweet," the liberal leader Michael Ignatiff, who was around the deputy after the weekly meeting of the chakers.
Liberians claim that the draft law in their current form, which would allow to hold up until one year to any person who is proven from a identification ship as transport of illegal immigrants, is inflicted by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom.
The leader of the Quebec Block, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the law project because he pointed out the wrong white.
"We are opposed and, as it seems, all the opposition partys are against the project, so we will see what the Government does," said Mr. Duceppe.
The NPD's criticism on immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected the critics that indicate that its party is not sufficiently strong with the clanian immigrants.
"Neodemocratics agree that measures are taken against the parents of clanists and that is what we propose with another law project, C-35," states Ms. Chow.
"We do not support the conservators' law because it attacks refugees and encarcers children for at least one year," explains Ms. Chow.
The Minister of Immigration, Jason Kenney, has accused the parties of the position to play political and to make a opposite case of the will of Canadians.
"The large majority of Canadians tells Members that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations against Canada and treat the country as if they are a felpud."
"Ire hoped that Canada takes a strong step," says Minister Kenney.
The Government has not announced a reliable vote on its draft law, which could bring the country to some elections as a result of its rejection.
However, a conservator has reported to the QMI Agency that the Government would request a vote to ensure that each deputy that will be opposed will be explained later before its electors.
The new unit does not get an unity
Despite the possibility of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collapse by Jean Charest, numerous observers continue to request the establishment of a public consultation commission on the matter.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea has not been addressed two days ago: Quebec would have been consulted with the Department of Investigation of New York since January of the last year.
The methopolis has a permanent unit against corruption since 1870.
Thus, the announcement of the march has shooted by surprise to more than one.
It should be said that, during a permanent Council meeting on the police services of Quebec held on 29 October last, this measure was never discussed, despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
This was enough to the criticism of the Quebequencian party to address the issue of public security, Stefane Bergeron, qualify this announcement as "a chister's chister's conjection" and as "the last hour chapped solution".
For its part, Minister Dutil has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future unity.
"See the results when we announce it," just indicates.
"We are aware of this problem."
For the Chairman of the CSQ, Rejean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public survey.
"Why more is obsessed by Mr. Charest in avoiding the creation of this research commission, more people share our view, i.e., that's something to hide", explains.
"The only way to have a research commission is with Jean Charest's division," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance of the National Public Administration School.
To get out of this dead point, it suggests Quebec that it provides a special mandate to the general interventioner to carry out an investigation on the collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the general intervenant," concludes.
It also believes that Quebec could grant the intervenant the same competence as a Commissioner, allowing it to comply with people to witness.
The creation of a permanent square is not the only project in cereals in the Charest Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code in order to improve the adjustment to this type of crime.
This application seems to be taken from the police of the Marteau Operation, which has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that legality is not explicit in this kind of investigations.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his Homologo of Justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently encouraging to make certain amendments on this subject.
During the early 2001 operation related to driving groups, although the Criminal Code was not adjusted, 131 were arrested.
Afterwards, Ottawa emphasized the adoption of the gangsterism Act.
Rivers under extreme supervision
several water courses are closely monitored because of the strong precipitations that have been registered in several regions of the province from March.
Thursday, a land run in Shawinigan, Maurice.
As preventive measures, houses have been evacuated.
Tonight, another land swallowed in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
The road was shocked.
From Tuesday to Thursday night, several regions have registered strong precipitations between 40 and 70 miles of rain.
It is also expected to be between 20 and 40 miles from now to Thursday and Wednesday, as part of the region.
The sectors located north of the river and the outdoor Valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimeters of rain.
Since these precipitations are summarising to the swimming of the snow that has already been cumulated in certain sectors, it is feared that different rivers are discovered.
On Thursday night, the Quebec Civil Security Unit issued warnings for the Uareau and Achigan Rivers in Lanaudière.
The northern rivers, in Saint-Jerome, in the Laurents, and the Chene, in Lotbinière, have already caused inundations in the past and are under monitoring.
In the Lanaudière region, strong precipitations have caused some lakes in Saint-Julian, Saint-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, the strong rains have draught a provisional bridge.
As prevention measures, ten residences have been evacuated.
In outdoor, the discharge of certain lakes has caused the closure of several ways, especially in the municipality of Mansfield and Pontefract.
The Civil Security Unit continues to be warned and monitored, as Annik Bouchard stated, the Security Council.
The Quebec's predicting Centre, by its part, issued an advertising Monday by communicating the strong growth of several rivers, especially the Maskinonge, the Assomption, the Uareau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Loup.
Culpan partly to Dupont
The Quebec Stéphane Dupont Radiopresenter has suffered a certain report to the Canadian Council of the Television Rules (CCNR) for controversial statements regarding social assistance, Haitians, and its large language in the radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and its CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express its view, but certain statements contained "incomprehensive information on social assistance, an inadequate negative representation of Haitians and Great Language that should not be used in the emissions that should be distributed during the day".
The Council also pointed out that the discussions on self-smoking, including the dissemination of the name of two persons who had been killed, did not violate the radio dissemination codes.
The CCNR had received a number of complaints related to comments made in disseminated emissions between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued after a complaint from the Common Force of persons receiving social assistance from Quebec.
The group claimed that the amounts mentioned in the emission were not correct.
The presentators should report reliable data and not to lead to a lie.
With regard to suicide, the presented Stefan Dupont had demonstrated that suicide was a cobarde act.
The majority of the members of the Committee have concluded that the message submitted was that the self-smoking should not be considered as a solution to the problems of life.
"The majority of the Committee believes that the episodes placed in "Dupont le mid" have addressed a delicate and appropriate topic. "
Therefore, any guilt has been rejected in this regard.
The last dispute refers to the statements made after the earthquake of Haiti.
At that time, Stephane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had protagonized a medium-sized confrontation that had sustained numerous reactions.
The Chairman of the HOI stated that he had not done any donation to help Haitians because he could not know with security if the needy would actually receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments are not abused, but its accumulative effect is an inadequate negative representation of Haitians.
"I fulfilled my suspension of three days above."
"My deputy is clean for a half years," said the presentator.
In all decisions, the Committee declares the major language emission.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio chain has cooperated "including more than the required".
The results will be minimum for the emission, which should, inter alia, announce decisions once in the higher hearing hours of three days.
A king of the Kung-fu in Montreal
The monsters of origin Nacereddine Zemmal had an extremely peculiar recovery.
The atleta, which is highlighted in "Sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and thai box, goes up to the Tatamis and rings of the world in searching for new challenges.
"I stopped practiting marcial arts such as Kig-fu and kickboxing for 12 years in Algeria," Zemmal explained, who lives in the metrópolis since 2008 to progress on the professional level.
"In my case, I'm looking for fights in all parts because, for those who do not enjoy the ground game that implies mixed marcial arts, there are little competitions in North America."
The atleta, who works as a security agent and as employee of the UPS company, recently gave bad news to its rivals, wining two gold medals in the World Carte and Kickboxing Association, held from 23 to 30 October in Edimburgh, Scotia.
"I winned in the kickboxing categories full contact and Thai box," explained.
"I'm currently prepared to participate in the Copa del Mondo de San Shou in China."
"He will invite sports who have been finished among the first four posts in the last world campaign in each category."
"In 2009, I won the Bronze Medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, it ended in eighth place."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the return in fifth place, but I reached the third place in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"It's interesting that I've been progressing in every competition."
"To this step, I'll be the first time or the year that comes."
The "san shou" or "Sanda" is a originary discipline from China, where it is enabled to shoot with the pumps and feet, and to swallow the opposers on the ground.
The conflicts are originally held on a platform and, less frequently, in a ring.
The most famous pugilist in this kind of fight is the American of Vietnamic origin Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of marcial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal so needs to keep a competition in his car, it will certainly listen to the great tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of the Kig-fu.
"This competition is the most notoric and prestigious China," explains the sympatic boy.
"It is like the equivalent to the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium of Thailand)."
"He has been an incredible experience."
Zemmal wins his first battle in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), but lost at the end.
"He who has won me is a real professional," he thinks.
"They have four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg). "
"The winners of semi-final are faced at the end of their category."
"The following, the camps of each category are faced to coronate a single campion, the king of the kung-fu."
450 million in contracts without contributions
Hydro-Québec has granted direct contracts for a value of $450 million to engineering undertakings for Eastman-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
There is a consortium formed by BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor, which has been obtained without a submission of the most important contract, the management of the project, a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called Energy Gerance, was established in 2004, due to the decision of Hydro-Québec to trust in the private sector, its responsibility to manage this important hydroelectric project of $5,000 million.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Management Consortium obtained the conquisite contract without previously being made public contribution.
For the Party, the resource to enterprises poses a serious ethical problem that threatens competitiveness and causes a decrease in prices.
"This is a new method of collection and the elimination of competitiveness."
"I mean, people, instead of doing it secretly, do it now openly," said the deputy of the Party, whose Sylvain Simard is on a press route.
Before the morning, Mr. Simard planned the question in the national Assembly because, as he states, he does not understand how to benefit the public interest in this way.
The Minister for Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied afternoon, noting that a compulsion has been made with this contract.
"I'm going to smell", protested, defending that the PQ had acted in a "dehony" way and "with lack of strictness".
He pointed out that "the minimum" would be that the PQ would apologize.
Consortium formula is a common practice in the whole world.
Normally it is an alliance with a time limit that allows two or more enterprises to group their knowledge to respond to an income for a complex project.
The Eastman project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the size of works.
The works have already started and will continue until 2012.
In all cases, the contract has been granted without the competitive in the game; it has been treated in a negotiation.
In addition, the consortium formula has stopped being the exception of the standard in Quebec, including for relatively simple projects.
As published last week Le Devier, the formula of consortiums in the technical advisory sector is subject to an investigation in the Government.
A rapid look at the Quebec's commercial record allows to identify more than 200 consorcies, of which some seem to be permanent.
Thus, the company Dessau works in association with most of its main competitors such as CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche and Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are decades of them, leads to a single legal person, i.e., Dessau.
As regards the Consortium Energy Gerance, the Minister Normandeau noted that "the territory of the Bahia James responds to a special work dynamic and Hydro-Québec specifically answers it since 1970."
The large leader of the Eastman project, Real Report, of the Baie James Energy Society (SEBJ), has explained the fact that the project management contract has been directly granted.
"If you respond to a offer and there are few participants, your prices will be higher."
"You have two options: you can contact the actors of the sector and say: We're going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement and a good price."
"But the idea is that what is important is not the price, but the competence of people," said Mr. Laport.
The contract granted to the Consortium Energy Gerance is part of a broad list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Czech Party.
The contracts were granted by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After the verification, Le Dever identified 109 technical advisory contracts granted between 2002 and March 2010 to enterprises or subsidiarys, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Genevar consumed 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account its participation in energy generation.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, $449.783.344 were assigned to $295.131.564.
Sylvain Simard understood that the four companies forming consortium (BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor) are "good known from the Quebec Liberal Party".
The Minister Normandeau has left that the PQ is also linked to these companies, which "financing" before needing it better for its leaders.
The "verde" label does not inspire confidence
More ecological, but deeply sceptic.
Consumer only trusts in the actors of sustainable development, as well as in the trade marks or in the environmental certificates to guide its elections.
According to the Barometer of Responsible Consumption, whose first results have been published yesterday, the situation is even worse. Consumer is summarised in a medium-sized universe where it pulls messages that defeat more responsible consumer, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that it even slows its commitment.
Even if it has increased the consumption of products called "socially responsible" in 2010, the chebequens seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not believe the environmental commitment of enterprises or the ecologist advertising of them, reveal the measuring tool developed by the Sherbrooke Observatory of the Consumer responsible University.
Another conclusion: half of consumers doubts the reliability of official certificates to bring fair products, as well as the credibility of the products and brands that brings labels by indicating that they are "responsibilities", states the Barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6% of the Quebecians are seriously taken to the political talks on this issue.
In any case, the information on responsible consumers seems essential to stimulate this consumption sector, currently supported by about a third of the Quebequens consumers.
In fact, the lagunas and the doubtful nature of the information make 46% of consumers decline this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
Furthermore, a third of the Quebecs say to dislocate also the results of the ecological products or services that are trying to sell them.
On the other hand, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, in particular, changed the mark of one or more products to respect their convictions.
61% has given priority to purchase in their barrier shops and has prefered to buy growing food products in its region, notes the Barometer.
More green and responsible (the index of responsible consumer has reached 64 points over a maximum of 100 points this year), the Quebec Consumer Homo likes to take the position of the king of the recyclope that tries to reduce its impact on the environment by causing the protection of the fauna.
However, according to the Barometer, this social consciousness seems to be from doors (of its car) outside: in 2010, only 28 percent of the Quebecs indicated that they have used public transport or shared cars to defend their ecologist principles.
Furthermore, 39.1% of the participants of this wide investigation, which has finally completed their first edition, supports the use of the bicycle and footwear movements.
A loan for the State to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, who asked to be financially compromised in the recovery of the chineses eXcentris complex, accepts the Angus Society and Parallele Society to cooperate, but only through a loan.
The Angus Development Society and the Parallele, who expected a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to return to purchase Daniel Langlois the eXcentris film complex in the boolean Saint-Laurent and returning to her true Chinese vocation, have not obtained what they requested.
The Government has accepted its involvement in the matter, but in its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec Government proposes a loan which would actually be less than the initial expectations; it could be a viable solution in winning conditions, at least in view of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected the past spring a first action plan and a request of 12.8 million, but since then the applications have been revised to low.
The Chairman of the Cultural Business Development Society (SODEC), François Macerola, who was leading to eXcentris, sent a proposal and a plan of action to the Minister of St-Pierre.
He sent a last report a decade ago.
However, SODEC received an opposite from the office on Monday.
Paralléle and Angus have a period of time until 31 December to respond to the same.
In any case, it seems to be fully dismissed by a State donation.
Remember that the Quebec's Customers Association and Complex cinematographic ownership opposed a direct investment from the State to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture must not finance real estate projects, since it has not been done with other film rooms.
On the other hand, various representatives of the sector demand considerable economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the officer of the same, has carried out for ten years the load of the author cine in its places of the complex, after funding its own construction, which could justify a derogation by the Council of Teasor.
The lack of rooms for independent films was patent in Montreal and eXcentris had been able to fidelize his customer.
The Angus and the Parallele company, directed by Christian Yaccarini, emphasis on a private financing campaign, waiting for a meeting of $700,000 to open the way to purchase.
Since spring 2009, just one of these rooms, the Parallele, continues to design films in eXcentris.
The goal of the future purchasers is to reopen the three rooms on 27 February, projecting the precious film of Xavier Beauvois "The men and gods".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not returned to contact with Le Devoir and we don't know what he thinks and his group of proposals to the low receipt.
The slow of Canada is upset...
The new United States diplomatic cable distributed by WikiLeaks reveals what the United States consider as the complex of Canadians regarding the United States, but reflects both the feeling of superiority from these to Canada.
The United States diplomates are surprised that Canadian electors do not think of Canada and the United States' relations when they are going to vote and believe that the visit of President Obama has helped the Conservant Government to reach their budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy of Ottawa and Washington, which have been made in public last night, offer more details of the content of substance.
A cable of 22 September 2008, i.e., during the federal election campaign, reports at what point the United States do not enter into the issues discussed by political leaders.
This caused a great surprise to the US embassy sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins offers some explanations on this situation.
"The political leaders want to be conditioned by a almost minority complex inherent to Canadians at the time of treating daily home issues, instead of leave such choice to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign) " , writes.
Consequently, the United States are "the proverbial elefant of this election: everything represents, but potentially too dangerous to talk about it."
The embassy has even more problems in understanding this "soordecedor" because the two countries keep intense political and economic relations.
"Logically, it thinks that the capacity of a candidate, a party, and, moreover, of the head of a party to manage these essential relations should be a key factor in which electors should think at the time of vote."
This feeling of importance can also be observed on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, responsible for business in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Their travel will contribute to the survival of the government during the vote of confidence at the beginning of February on the federal budget, through which Canada will first deficit in the last decade because of a rebuilding plan of between $30,000 and $40,000", writes Mr. Brese.
There is no indication that the Government had to extend the Parliament before Christmas to avoid the replacement of coalition or the opposition partys condemn their survival to the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another report of January 2008 signed by the Ambassador Wilkins warned to Washington about the more negative image that transmits the diffused dramatic series in the United States CBC.
The embassy is concerned about the Border's emission, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which little references are performed to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even the followers to the CIA to realize energetic interrogations.
Another cable account that, during his first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French homolog Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to join some of Guantánamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner answered that, but he depended "of every case."
At the end of the meeting, they wrote: "He provided a document to the State Secretariat in relation to Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old musulman of Canadian origin."
The Secretariat accepted revision of the issuer.
Finally, we can recall that souls have been calendared in relation to the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old advisor very close to Stephen Harper, declared in the CBC radio that the responsibilities of this massive flight should be "sistered".
In the United States, Mike Huckabee's eco.
A world plan to renew lighting
Yesterday, the United Nations has proposed in Cancún a plan to renew household, commercial and industrial lighting in hundreds of countries to reduce winter gases (GEI) in a amount that is almost a third of the additional reduction that should be implemented to stabilize the climate of the planet before 2020.
This ambitious plan is marked in the whole of the concrete projects that the United Nations expects to be adopted in Cancún in order to compensate the lack of binding commitments in industrialized countries.
According to the previous plan, if the incanded bombs, which are still monopolising between 50 and 70% of the market, are replaced by fluocompact bombs or, even better, by the bombs of electronic diods (DEL or "LED" in English), much of the 1.800 million tonnes of GEI issued in the planet to light humans would be avoided.
The lighting is responsible for 8 per cent of global emissions.
It is equivalent to 70% of the emissions of the planetary automobile park.
In Copenhagen, last year, large embassy countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and other, including Canada, were compromised with voluntary reduction plans that should reduce the global GI emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt of this amount should be decreased to stabilize, before 2020, the increase in temperatures in two centigrated levels to avoid discontrolling.
In the incandescenced bombs, 95% of the energy is dissipized in the form of warmth and the rest, i.e. 5%, produce light.
In the case of fluocompact bombs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with new LED bombs, the energy consumption is two times further reduced.
Fluocompact bombs last a average of 6000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bombs, like those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the study of the United Nations), have a life hope of 25,000 hours and consum less energy than an incanded bomb, which allows us to make a idea of the burden that can be achieved with the substitution plan that would be applied in hundreds of countries.
These new bombs can also work with restates and emit very little heat.
Moreover, they do not contain anything of mercury.
several experts have demonstrated their reserves in relation to fluocompact bombs, since they contain mercury and that they should be removed as dangerous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers put instructions.
However, the report indicates that the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluocompact bombs, but the carbon thermal centers, which employ a large amount of mercury to produce electricity that is deleted with the incandescenced bombs.
Only in the United States, these centrals emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the benefits that would provide this international programme to each country.
For example, Indonesia would like to be shooting a million dollars a year in electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, i.e. the equivalent to 3.5 thermal centrals, which would build the cost of 2.500 million.
Cost of Marfill wishfully expects the announcement of the election results
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, requested the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential elections in Costa de Marfil, since they have expired the deadlines.
" The Secretary-General highlights the need for the full independent election committee to announce the provisional results immediately", highlights a chairman of the United Nations head.
"He asks all Costa of Marfil parties and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and support any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure exercised by some foreign governments, the electoral committee has left the limited date of Monday to midnight without being published the results, three days since Sunday's election.
The President of the ECI had commented on the television that the Committee "continued working" to announce the results.
Wednesdays have been multiplied in the world the requests that the ECI finally declare the name of the winner of the second turn between the summer Laurent Gbagbo and its opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo band has the cancellation of the Constitutional Council's "fraudulent" votes in the north, in the hands of the former rebellion of the new forces (FN) from the falling state shock of September 2002.
Pascal Afi N'Guessan, director of the campaign of the President of Costa de Marfil, stated that the intimidating manuscripts of the elections carried out by the FN in the north of the country had dismissed the followers of the stakeholder to vote.
Every election could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council accepts the complaints submitted by Gbagbo.
However, Gbagbo's opposers consider that the highest court in the country is not neutral, since Paul Yao N'Dré is directed by a nearby political partner in Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northern man who defeats any relationship with the ancient rebellious, has judged the "naceptable" late in the publication of the results and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not been so far as to re-evitify the victory.
Their partners claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and to submit a complaint to the Constitutional Council after the prevention of the election committee to disseminate the results, would be illegal.
The second tour of the presidency, on Sunday, had to have led to the process of reunification and reconciliation of a shared country for two years.
The United Nations has warned Monday to the Political Class of Marfil Costa that could be considered responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had ended on the first turn, on 31 October, with 38 per cent of the votes against Alassane Ouattara (32 per cent) which publicly received support of the former President Henri Konan Bédié (25 per cent in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stabil in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (OIT), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable in 9.3 per cent in the continental territory (9.7 per cent in view of the overseas departments), as indicated in the data corrected with the provisional variations (CVE) published on Thursdays by the Insean.
The number of stops remains in the continental France.
The data of the second quarter have been confirmed, 9.3 per cent of the active population in the continental territory and 9.7 per cent of the DOMs.
In one year, the unemployment rate has registered an increase in 0.1 points.
In general, 3,4 million people in the metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter, but they wanted to work, are or not available in the two weeks to work and find or not jobs.
The situation of young people present in the labour market has continued, with a new increase in the unemployment rate up to 24.2% in France continental (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in a year), 25% including WTOs.
During the third quarter, 637.000 young ones between 15 and 24 were in the sense of IT.
For its part, a slight increase in the number of advanced persons, up to 6.4% in France continental (+0.2 points in three months and one year), i.e. 482.000 people over 50 years, a population of 6.6% with DOMs.
Only a parity has been recorded between people of age between 25 and 49 years, with 8.3% in Continental France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in all France.
The Insean has since 2006 without publishing the monthly party rate, after a polyemic on its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the EU Statistics Agency, has continued to do it and has announced the March a rate of 9.8% for France (including WTO) in October after a 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guerini investigated and arrested
Alexandre Guerini, 53 years old, is investigated and incarcerated in the prison of Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, in the context of an investigation on public contracts subjectly fraudulent.
Alexandre Guerini is investigated by abuses of social goods, abuses of funds and public goods, coverage, active corruption, the trafficking of influences and the possession of munitions, as indicated by its lawyer.
"Alexandre Guerini will fight and answer all the questions that the magistrate plans to you, not fantasms."
"It's easy to follow you by a lot of retraceable acts, another thing is to demonstrate them", stated its lawyer, Florence Rault, before the comparison of his customer.
Mr. Guerini, the brother of the PS leader in the Department, Jean-Noël Guerini, had wanted to transmit a document to the judge before his comparison.
Wednesday night, they started investigating and also incarcering one of their neighbors, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr Lucien Simon, the only thing that his client has done has been to take care of the lawyers that should be managed.
As regards the allocation of contracts or the purpose of the funds related to their implementation, there is nothing to be known in this regard, according to the reader Simon.
In the context of this issuer, it is also investigated from Friday Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Services of Aboriginal Aglomeration, by miscarriage of funds and compliances, but have left him in conditional freedom and it is prohibited to meet with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have reproved you."
"The Instructor has taken into account the explanations and has left him free", explained his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Morning night, on Thursday, asked four other persons and left them, under the judicial control of two of them, as stated by the Adjunct Inspector of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Joint Director of Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), has been accused of "traffic of passive influence and corruption".
Two officials of the Abuagne Aglomeration, Michele Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been interrogated by "sustration and abuse of public goods by a person dedicated to public service" and by "compliance in the abuse of public funds", respectively.
Finally, the partner of Alexandre Guerini, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated by "including the abuse of social goods".
Between those who have faced Mr. Guerini, Stefan Brungo-Girard, in prison recently in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affected by Côrcega.
The investigators suspect that their companies have service to blame the capital of the big bandidism.
The investigation is carried out in the framework of several judicial instructions initiated against X in April 2009 after receipt of an anonymous communication, of course fraud in the allocation of public contracts, especially in the residues sector.
A close source of research notes that the investigations focus on the conditions of allocation and functioning of a seed in La Ciott, which collects Abuagne's waste, as well as other cities of the urban community of Marsella (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss: Eliseo has exagered the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the destination of Clotilde Reiss, the young French investigator detained in Iran by "spionaje", has experienced in the public in France, warned the diplomacy and highlighted the deterioration of the relations between Paris and Teheran.
All under the look at the United States diplomates.
American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how Eliseo has explained its strategy to the United States to give them advice to manage their own "rehenes" crisis in Iran (a small group of senderists).
They show how French responsibilities tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the French youth was not made in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and seeks the United States justice for the traffic of materials for the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they reveal the cruel reality of how the French Presidency tried to handle the media to give the idea that the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played a key role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, I didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegraph issued on 12 August 2009 in Paris is the title "Iran: French comments on how to manage cases of rehensement".
Eliseo's advisor for strategic affairs, François Richier, joined by the Director of Quai d'Orsay for the northern Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talk to the American diplomatic Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise the United States to do what follows to repatriage their own citizens who retained force in Iran.
"Fromed", they say, "solver continuously" in the media the words "based human rights", "innocence", "immediate release".
Everything to join the Iranian regime, careful of his image.
"When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it more often."
Because, once ago, the negotiation attempts for discrete channels, "the silence will not solve anything", the Iranians are "experts in dilatory manuscripts".
Mr Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is "a normal Iranian tactic: the take of rehens for the political chamber."
It announces that the release of prison of Clotilde Reiss (which will be produced on August 16, the day of refugee in the embassy of France) "this will require the submission to Iranians of a large amount of money" (230,000 euros of rewards).
Furthermore, Eliseo expects other crisis of rehenses, a phenomenon that "shoulds to increase".
Iranians could "in a next future to stop another of about 800 French citizens living in Iran," says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss goes from prison after twelve days, but it's been blocked in Iran.
The following information is distributed: the irani Majid Kakavand, whose extradition requests the United States for the illicit traffic of delicate electronic material to Iran, has been released in Paris for decision of a judge.
The U.S. Embassy, as many observers, doubts this strange match.
For Washington, who is near the Iranian clandestinian networks of purchase material for the nuclear programme, the excarcelation of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Has France accepted a exchange?
Release Iran in change of French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4th, François Richier guarantees that it was not so.
Eliseo, said, is not only "a huge surprised by the judge's decision," but he tried to oppose the same.
"Increased negotiations between the French presidency and the Minister of Justice" (in the time, Michele Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot annul the decision," comments.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "strict" monitoring of French information services.
Eliseo's advisor marks a number of phones, shut up, and then informs the American diplomat that Iran is now in some buildings of Paris managed by the Iranian Embassy.
During the detention of Clotilde Reis in Iran, Eliseo is not excited in efforts, uses communications and "flights" organized in the media to believe that the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influent" role of "mediator".
The United States observed this activity with some ironia and confirmed that the manipulation brings its fruit, since several printing articles are transmitted to the French official version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 mentioned "the blitz" of French officials.
To what such "gratitude" should be asked to Mr Assad, the embassy in Paris is asked.
"In spite of its full declarations of lovingness, French officials recognize in private that they have just a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then addresses the reasons they have brought to Eliseo to give this fiction.
The great communication efforts "in order to validate Sarkozy's open policy towards Syria," it believes.
A policy initiated in 2008, which "in view of numerous critical voices in France and the foreign, has ended to be premature and dismembered."
By “exagering the Syrian role”, Paris tries to “to show Syria the joy that can be learned if it plays a constructive role in the region”.
The goal also consists of "single the seed of the discussion between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. Embassy knows it of a good source.
On August 11, François Richier trusted him: "We do not know whether the Syrians have done something or not."
"But in all ways, we thanked him."
"At least, this should cause confusion between Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her in the Eliseo.
In a communication, thanks the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria who have played a "active paper for the release of our companion".
From midnight, young Koreans can't play online
The Suriname Government will adopt a law called "Cenicienta" which will prevent adolescents to participate online games after the middle of the night by blocking their access, as they have indicated, by government responsibilities.
In December, a law project will be submitted to Parliament to ask online game companies to block access to these games after a mid-day night to young people under 16 years of age, as they have indicated representatives of the Ministry of Cultural and Family.
"My children play all night, and then they are difficult to study in the school and bring normal life during the day."
"We think that this law is necessary to protect your health and right to dream", stated the AFP Jo Rin, the ministerial responsible for the Law project.
Online games will be again available at six morning.
The companies will have a year to prepare for the implementation of the law, necessary.
The Government is also requested to enterprises that limit the daily access time to these games when young parents request it, he added the responsible.
Furthermore, you will make available whose free IT programs are requested to limit the Internet connection time.
South Korea is one of the most connected countries and journals regularly news about various facts linked to intensive Internet use.
The country is also the uncertain champion of the world competitions of online games.
In November, South Korea obtained four gold medals in the World Cyber Games, where other 58 countries were covered.
World 2018-2022: FIFA designated the organizationing countries
By the torture caused by corruption suspicion, the Executive Committee of the FIFA designates the juvenile to the organizing countries of the Copas of the world of 2018 and 2022, a clear political choice where the influence struggles and lobbying can lead to primary on technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the edition of the FIFA competition 2018 will be celebrated in Europe, traditional disciplinary bastion (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain and the Netherlands).
The edition of 2022 will be much more exotic, since the International Federation expects to conquire new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a star in the African continent in 2010, or continue with its implantation in the United States or the East Lake (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities that were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the embassy of Qatar, the Belgian and the Netherlands leaders, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) witnesses the economic and political interests playing in a world.
The transactions between pustikers, therefore, are possible to end up until the last minute.
On the other hand, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, English, Spanish and Portuguese candidates (2018) and US (2022) have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not be too weight for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of vote.
Sunday Times, responsible for the exhibition that leaded to the corruption of two members of the EC (Reinald Temparii and Amos Adamu), could have denied the opportunities of his country, with the fútbol, which only welcomed the World once, in 1966.
The BBC added milk to the moon by disseminating a documentation that has proved to three influenced members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Liveou.
Suffix to disgust the FIFA and join the English responsibilities, which have been launched to a intense lobbying in the last few weeks with David Cameron.
The Head of Government expects to revise the shock given successfully by its predecessor, Tony Blair, who had achieved in 2005 for London the JJ.O. 2012 organization.
This intense activity, will it be sufficient to restore the light from England before the EC?
It is not clear, since the Duo Spain-Portugal also has a number of strong points thanks to its stages, ready to experience (Mundial of 82 in Spain, JJ.O in Barcelona in 1992, Copa of Europe in Portugal in 2004) and its futbolistic culture.
However, the sovereign economic and financial perspectives of both countries could be cut off their ambitions.
The possible reprises against English and doubts about the solving of Spain and Portugal is the only way to give points to Russia, converted into a weight outer, despite the lagunas in their candidate (stations, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to move to Zurich and declared a "unfair competence in the preparation of the vote" in a direct hearing to the accused of the English press against the members of the EC.
"He's getting out of sweet traces, trying to compromise them," said Putin.
For 2022, the United States, who have experience in 1994, seem to be the most logical favorites.
The first world economic power and headquarters of FIFA's main patrocinators, the country seems to have benefited from Japan and South Korea, which have developed a excellent project separately.
However, these new candidates seem to be premature for two countries who have organized together the campaign in 2002.
Another risk: World Concept of 2026 to China, firmly wished by the FIFA, which would cause Asia to remain without possibilities for 2022.
In addition to Qatar, which has presented its project based on future stages, and Australia, the FIFA would continue to extend to new horizons, but both countries have more risks than certain.
Australia, as Japan and Korea, could also be harmed by the deficiency of payed TV rights (in fonction of time difference) by European countries, the dorsal shore of the war for the FIFA.
Second mandate: the test
Gaulle had really doubted.
Mitterrand had understood it.
Valery Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not have any doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is less.
One mandate in the Eliseo brings to another.
The current head of State will therefore be a candidate in 2012.
However, the evidence of this is not well combined with the mystery that is usually associated with the presidency.
So it must always seem to be doubtful.
He did one side and to the other.
In 2006, although they did not believe it, the friends of Jacques Chirac claimed that he did not remove a third mandate.
On November 15, in a series ton, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that his decision would be taken "in some moment in August 2011".
The fact that you treat the UMP Members, on Tuesday for the night in Eliseo, the possibility of "twelve mandates" has caused a certain revue.
Is this the official announcement of your candidate?
Not much less.
The President indicated that the constitutional reform of 2008 was limited to two the number of five years of mandates.
He simply transmitted the facts, not an advertising.
It's not the first time you speak of the presidents, with a jocoous ton in meetings of this type.
"In the worst, or best, of the cases, you will still pass seven years with me," was resolved in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010, "Don't think I'm not planning what will come after."
Your previous statements are not closer to the candidate, nor at least.
They have comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the cart for the candidature in the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Segolene Royal has gone to the palestra what leads to Nicolas Sarkozy to be sincere.
Better the contrary; the fact that its candidature in 2012 is clear is what leads many people from the PS to claim that the battle is organized before it was expected.
On the other hand, the bad sonds.
First, the right electors prefer the candidature of François Filon to the Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion on the subject in the UMP," he immediately reacted and carefully the environment of the Prime Minister.
"If you think you can lose, it's not a candidate," Jean-Pierre Rapharin believes.
"You will always think you can win", corrects Alain Juppe, resigned before evidence.
Euro: The ECB is obliged to maintain its purchases of State letters
The last meeting of the European Central Bank's Governing Council (ECB) of the year should enable the criteria for the outcome of the crisis or at least to announce the interruption of a large number of non-conventional operations of monetary policy that should be completed at the end of the year.
As a result of the crisis of the European sovereign debt, Frankfurt's emission institution can, without doubt, not be allowed to be such a pertinent if it does not want to deteriorate a more complicated situation today on European obligations markets.
Political costs would be equal to high.
Last night, during a press route, the French Finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, has supported the active role played by the ECB in resolving the debt crisis.
He did not want to say if he considers that the central bank should do more, for example increase its State acquirement programme.
"I reserve my opinion for my European partners."
In Brussels, during its hearing to the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Committee, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, has not been shown more eloquent about its intentions, indicated only that the State's purchase letters on the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we decided" during the juvenile meeting.
The only one that is clear is that the ECB will maintain its main invariable type in 1%, the lower level of his history since May 2009.
In practice, the acquisition of Tresor obligations by the ECB has been doubled last week until up to EUR 1,350 million.
In addition, according to the market operators, ironly, Ice-Irlandic and Portuguese titles would have been purchased again.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have purchased 67.000 million euros since May 2010.
Among the market operators, there is no doubt that the purchase will be followed (see page 29).
Economists do not prevail any significant changes in rubber.
Although the loan operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's slaughter, it still performs limited liquidity allocations to benefitous conditions and with durations between one week and three months.
Economists hope that this device is extended today for a few months.
"I don't think you'll change considerablely your program."
"If no, it would be the risk to cause new tensions in a short term", says Michael Schubert, an economicist of the Commerzbank.
"It is more likely that a progressive output is produced during the first quarter of 2011," warned by the Norbert Bröms, economicist in Sal.
Oppenheim.
With regard to public debt market interventions, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchase of these obligations to keep the market stable", adds Norbert Brms.
Bearing in mind the importance of the exposure of European banks to the euro area's sovereign debt markets, the emission institution has no choice to maintain its presence on the market.
"The lack of investments in the market must be compensated to any price and act so that it prevents a marked decrease of the results assigned by the most fragile States," said a major obligation manager last night.
Because if the types of interest are covered by the clouds, States have more problems to reduce their debt, or even to stabilize it.
This is the price to protect the euro.
In Italy, the government of Berlusconi captures the time
After Italy has started a worried way in the week, the situation was slightly improved last night with the refluction of the types of obligations for 10 years.
A recovery of precarious calm.
At the outcome of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, regional Presidents have stated that Julio Tremonti had listened to the situation of "inconscious" and that it was expected to be a weekend "inconsistent" statements later dismissed by the interested person.
In any case, the difference with the German long-term types had reached the record of 210 basic points and the price of the covery contracts against the risk of heavy (CRQ) was shocked up until 263 points, causing a certain revolt in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi stated that the difference with German types was more than 400 basic points in Spain.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was expressed "deeply worried" by "market turbulences" and for a possible county from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not as Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economicist in the Hudson Institute.
Indeed, its problem is the lack of growth and the smuggling of income associated with the same, which causes the State to face the risk of not being able to face its funding needs.
The last predictions in Brussels have clearly been a cold water garden for the government.
It is estimated that Italian growth will be reached by 1,1 per cent in 2011 and 1.4 per cent in 2012, while the Senatarian budget is based on some 1,3 per cent and 2 per cent respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, public deficit will represent 4.3% of the GDP the year (for 3.9% expected by the government) and 3,5% in 2012 (only 2,7%).
The smell that new budget provisions may be implemented after the festivals, by an amount of EUR7,000.
"In the case of necessary, new audience measures should be taken", says the Commissioner of Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
At the time, Italy has supported international institutions.
"The basiss of their economy are in order and their good state accounts, as we have long said," says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administer in the International Monetary Fund of Italy in the FMI.
"There is no immediate problem, no short, no long-term debt, because, despite its significant debt (119.2% of the GDP in 2011, NDLR), the efforts for stabilization requested in Italy are less than requested to other countries," says Pier Carlo Mauan, OECD's economic leader.
The problem of political instability remains.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a censure movement in the House of Members, after which elections could be advanced at the end of March.
In that case, a short period would be opened for decision-making in the case of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on the strengthening of crisis combating mechanisms
Christine Lagarde has repeated it last night during a press route in Paris: "I think we have already shown Sunday, night and day, that Europeans are clearly solid, decided, engaged with the defence of their currency and its currency area."
However, the registered relief last night in the types of European States' obligations has stimulated Governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot still talk about a principle of normalization.
The Standard & Poor's Qualification Agency announced that it could decrease the debt calculation of Portugal, the most frequently white in the current speculations.
"Come in May, there is no really political clarity and transparency, which is significantly worse on banking systems", they believe Exane BNP Paris's economists.
Specially because "the political rhythm is much lower than the market rhythm".
Conscious of this harvest and the dangers that you hide, European countries intensify discussions to strengthen existing crisis output mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the Ministers of Finance, which are more directly affected and, in general, with their G-20 Homologs.
This also takes into account the meetings of the European Group and of the Ecofin at the beginning of the week.
The ECB is meeting today.
In the agenda, the type of non-conventional measures to support the countries of the euro area in the marketing collision (advises above).
With regard to the European Financial Stabilities Fund (FEEF), its Executive Director Klaus Regling has started March in Singapore a recruit by Asia to inform the East League Investors of the Crisis News in Europe.
Although the goal of these visits is not to recur funds, it is certainly preparing the land.
The first EDF Title emissions are expected in the next month.
Last night, a U.S. official representative trusted the Reuters Agency that the United States would support a potential increase in the mobilized funds through a direct MFB ' s direct commitment.
With regard to countries who are in the first line, Portugal and Spain, these are prepared to adopt structural reforms, in particular with regard to the organization of the labour market.
These reforms are subject to audience measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to progress on a different way from Greece and Ireland.
Both of them want to avoid demanding international assistance before applying their own budget corrections and decideing on the structural reforms that are essential to increase their trust in a sustainable manner.
Capital partners of European funds are finally drawn up the options available to accelerate the normalization process of public obligation markets.
On November 24, Axel Weber was the first in launching the idea that, if the 750,000 million euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not doubt that they would return to the cartridge.
Barclays Capital Economists, one of the first lines in the European public debt market, consider that a amount of around 100,000 million additional euro would be sufficient, preferably "in the form of direct liquidity injection.
There is the instrument for this: the European financial stabilisation mechanism, currently equipped with 60,000 million euros.
An advisory that, without doubt, could, in detail, review the European capitals.
In particular, if the market conditions are worse.
Near and glass: 24 apartments in Narrow alert
Nieves continue to cause movement difficulties, especially in the secondary network in Britain, and may affect various economic activities.
Currently, twenty-five departments are located in Narana warning because of the risk of nevada and glass training.
You, Eure-et-Loir, Double Serve and Vienna have joined the twenty divisions that were already in Naranja warning, 10 from Thursday to midday and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group by night.
According to Meteo France, the strong neighbors affected the northern Gironde and Charentes, although they also slowly nest in the island of France.
2 to 5 cm, at times between 7 and 10 cm, in the departments affected, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm in the parish region.
The departments affected are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Baja Norwegian, France and Lemosin.
Nears are sufficiently strong to cause movement difficulties and to affect some economic activities, warning Weather France.
In the Coasts d'Armor, access to different departmental routes was prohibited for more than 7.5 tonnes of vehicles, including Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudeac axis.
According to gendarmes, transportation in the secondary network of Britain is complicated, so they recommend that it is not driving safely in the case of need and the movement of certain TER vehicles has been prohibited during the day.
During Thursday, school transport was prohibited in Picardia.
There was no specific measure planned for midday night to limit the movement of weighted vehicles.
The prefecture “invites all drivers to drive more prudently on the roads and to adjust their conduct to the situation”.
The Civil Aviation Directorate (DGAC) requested the airlines to cancel on Thursday 25 per cent of its flights in the parish Roissy airport and 10 per cent in Orly because of the planned nevada.
The DGAC recommends aircraft passengers to contact their airport.
In Great Britain, Gatwick Airport, on the south of London, and the Edinburgh, Scotia, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro del Grand Paris: first financial borrowers
Since the debate on the modernization of transport in the island of France has reached its argued point, thousands of millions have been reached.
At least, in the debate.
In particular, we talked about the 23,000 million for the Grand Paris Metro that should build the Grand Paris Society.
To begin this SGP, the State has announced a fund allocation of EUR 4,000 million.
At the theoretical level, this sum will enable the SGP to obtain prices on markets to finance a part of its double bucle.
Today, finally, we have the first accounts.
The 2010 Rectificative Finance Act, reviewed in the Commission of Finance of the National Assembly this morning, contains the devices planned to find the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase in the office tax in the island of France.
The first, according to article 15 of the text of the Law Project, is "in benefit of the public institutions of the Grand Paris Society".
In addition, it is fixed in numbers: "The product of this tax is of EUR 117 million per year".
The second is a change of a tax on offices that already exists "to modernize it, increase its product and to allocate this increase to the Grand Paris Society."
How much would this method be obtained?
Who knows.
No numbers are given in the text.
But it's over 4,000 million.
"Financies must be added to the $4,000 million from the allocation of funds that the State will mobilize and grant to the Grand Paris Society as a result of the project," we can read in the exposure of reasons.
The SGP does not surprise this system.
"When income are created (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the 4.000 million later, as we explain."
"The budget will be registered and will be used on the basis of the needs."
The SGP will start receiving 4.000 million in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the $4,000 million are not included in the credit, can cause a slightly fired parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be on December 7th.
Hackers Venturers and Diligent Spirits
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it develops a apparent skandal, a scandale that seems so simplely scanned towards the hypocrisy that rise the relations between States, citizens and press.
On the other hand, pronounce deep changes at international level and provides a future dominated by return.
But let's walk.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each expeditor created by a secret service (independently from the nation to which it belongs) is formed exclusively by printing.
The "extraordinary" revelations of the United States on the sexual habitats of Berlusconi so reflect only what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlin) and the Khadafi's immediately disculminator profile has long given ideas to the cabaret artists to create their sketches.
The standard according to which secret expeditors should only be formed by public knowledge news is essential for the dynamic of secret services, not only in this century.
If you visit a library dedicated to historical publications, you will see each work repeated (for the Grial, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templates or the Rosacruz) exactly what was written in the previous works.
This should not only be the authors of hidden texts who want to do unfair investigations (or do not know where to search for news about the unbelievers), but because those who are dedicated to the ocultism are not just trusting in what they already know, which reiterates those who have already learned.
This is the mechanism of the success of Dan Brown.
The same applies to secret expeditors.
The informator is perceived, as it is perceived (or has a little anxiety) the chief of secret services (if it could not be, I know what, editor of the Liberation), which only considers what you can recognize.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that sent the American Embassy from Rome to the Department of State was the same as the newsweek previous week.
Why, then, have such a resurrection caused the revelations of these expeditors?
On the one hand, they only say what every cultivated person already knows, i.e., that the embassy, at least since the Second World War, and since the heads of States may be called by telephone or cover the aircraft to meet, have lost their diplomatic role and, except some limited representation exercises, have been transformed into spots centres.
Any spectator that sees research films knows it perfectly, so only we seem that we don't know it for hypocrity.
In any case, the fact of repeating it publicly affects the duty of hypothesis and gives a bad image of the United States diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker may consult the most powerful secrets of the world's most powerful country is significantly affected by the department of State.
Thus, the scandale affects both the victims and the "verduges".
But we enter the real nature of what happened.
Anciently, in Orwell’s time, it could be designed to all power as a Big Brother that controlled every loop of his suicide.
Orwell's prophecy has been realized since it was possible to control every movement thanks to the phone, every transaction performed, visited hotel, autopsy, the citizen turned into this way into a full victim of the eye of power.
But when it is shown, as now, that even the crypts of power secrets can not escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship stops being unidirective and will be circled.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen (also the hacker, chosen as the citizens' venture) can know all the secrets of the power.
How can a power that can no longer be able to keep its own secrets?
It is true, as Jeorg Simmel already said, that a true secret is a empty secret (and a empty secret cannot never be discovered); it is also true that any knowledge about the nature of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually a white secret, without secret, because it comes from the public area; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks has done, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to remove all powers.
WikiLeaks didn't hurt Sarkozy or Merkel, but I, and much, Clinton and Obama.
What will the consequences of this damage caused to such a powerful power?
It is obvious that, in the future, States cannot put any reserved information on the network, as it would be like to be published in a full road card.
But it is also clear that, with current technologies, it is not expected to keep confidential conversations on phone.
Nothing is easier than finding whether and when a State Chief has moved into a flight and has been in contact with one of the Homologs.
How can they maintain private and confidential relations in the future?
I know perfectly that at the moment, my predict is what of fiction science and, therefore, novelly, but I imagine to government agents that are moved discreetly in diligences with uncontrolled itinerarys, bringing messages that have been learned of memory or, as much as, hiding some written data in the tacons of their shoes.
These information then remained in one copy, in key locked chains: at the end of the account, the Watergate's sponsor attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I wrote that technology is currently progressing as a cancer, that is, back.
A century after the uncabeed telegraph has revolutionated communications, the Internet has returned to create a telegraph with cables (telephones).
Video channels (analytics) had allowed cine researchers to study a movie step by progressing and backing, discovering all the secrets of the mount, while now the CDs (digital) only allow for progress or backing in chapter, i.e., to large proportions.
With high speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while in flight, with the shipping movements, we need three hours and medium.
Therefore, it is nothing out of the normal way that communication policy and communication techniques bring us again to the horse cars.
A last comment.
Anciently, the press tried to understand what was in secret in the embassy.
Today, it is the embassy to request confidential information to the press.
Climate: France's chaps in their financing promises
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to consider whether the proof of rapidly disblocked funding has been respected (called fast start or early) by the developed countries.
And the French shoes have been shocked.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries were commitmented to providing $3 million between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has forced to allocate EUR 7.200 million in three years and France EUR 1.260 million (i.e., 420 million per year).
During the opening of the COP16, the EU has put its best letters on the table to convince its partners that their commitment to fast funding is true: a detailed report on the measures of its Member States, a press route, a great supplementary event, the distribution of platforms...
Transparency resulted and was really worthy: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same as the same level of accuracy.
The EU announces that it has released EUR 2.200 million in 2010, which is in the right way towards compliance with its commitment of 7.200 million in 2012.
But if we study the situation detailedly, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, money must be "new and additional" to ensure that additional efforts are carried out without prejudice to official development assistance.
Unfortunately, it has not been reached a agreement on what means "new and additional".
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Currently, each who chooses the reference to it is most appropriate.
For example, the European Commission has taken as a reference to 2009: international financing is maintained and has been added 150 million in three years in a rapid financing concept.
Other countries have chosen similar references for the year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional."
In other words, it does not refer to the expenditure of previous years or to the total level of official development aid.
In particular, the total amount of France’s aid to developing countries can remain stable (or even decreasing), while aims at respecting its commitment in the field of "new and additional funds" ...
Another crucial element, the distribution between donations and loans.
Once again, there is no standard and every one chooses the calculation method.
Some, as France, believe that each euro provided is equal to a given euro.
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: efforts are not comparable.
While the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are rewardable (frequently, projects related to the reduction of emissions based on more effective technologies), it is impossible to present an euro that will be recovered as an equivalent to an euro that is given... as so much, it should only be counted for its commitments the cost of the loan for the country granting the loan (i.e. the equivalent to a type of interest).
However, France does not use such a reason: "respect" its commitment of 420 million euros makes 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros); consult the EU document to see it in its own eyes.
This is the only Union country that uses the loan so frequently.
Germany uses it in 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respects its commitments with 100% of donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union provides an euro to comply with its commitment, France only provides ten cents and considers that the efforts are comparable.
A good truck!
In its rapid financing, France makes a double abuse: on the time-based action and on the other hand, in relation to the real financial efforts.
Given only 36.1 million euros, it can give the impression that it costs 420 million "new and additional", as he had promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (for it seems to be Bercy who has been busy arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (for what would the other Member States continue to give when they can simply provide?) as well as in negotiations, since developing countries are not tokens...
The chapter of pre-financing is a short-term mining in relation to all climate negotiations.
But it could be a snake of more in the great machinery that is the CMNUCC.
We hope it's not like that.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn from this first year of pre-financing.
First of all, France could announce a change in its calculation method for 2011 and 2012 with the intention of respecting its commitments and the remaining countries of the European Union.
However, in particular, France could make progress in the discussions on long-term financing (another important chapter that is currently discussed): we will not be free of the question of the "additional career" or of the method to computerize the loans.
France could change its post to become so progressist in relation to this issue as it is with others.
We are therefore the hope of the new Minister of Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, which will come to Cancún the week that comes.
A surprising announcement on the rapid start of France and its vision of the "additional career" and the use of loans would contribute to improve the international confidence level to progress in negotiations.
Child pesticides advertising
A 10-year-old child in a day of 81 different chemical substances, according to a study published Monday by the Generations Futures Association (the old movement for the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, who warns that its results "not have a significant statistical value, taking into account the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustratives of the treated problem," acquired in Oise and Paris supermarkets between July and September the foods that usually consumpte a child of about ten years in four foods and a tently day.
These foods taken as a model, respecting the official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruit and vegetables, three of milk and 1,5 litres of water per day), as well as the golosins, were examined in the laboratorys in searching for chemicals, pesticides, weighted metals and other contaminant substances.
The plate is abruming: 81 chemical substances, of which 42 classified as possible or probable cancer cancer and five substances classified as safe cancer, as well as 37 substances that can be acted as endocrine disorders (PE), according to the studies of various institutions as well as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"But in practice the totality of cases, the legal limits for each of the chemicals individually are not exceeded, our study clearly shows that the exposure of consumers to pollutants may be concerned with cancer and/or PE results concerned," said the Association.
For the breakfast, mantequilla and milk tea contains only more than a decade of possible cancer waste and three considered as safe cancer, as well as nearly 20 waste that can harm the hormonal system.
The manzana, which was imported from Brazil, as tented for the college, contains traces of six chemical substances, including a banned employee in France.
The same applies to the green Jews of Kenia, including food, where the study has detected traces of a powerless insectified in the EU.
Moreover, the Russian filet, the lake tsunami and even the bread or chicle were directed with pesticides and other chemical substances.
In the water of the griff, analysis found the presence of nitrates and cloroforms.
In the dinner, the salmon wheel was the most "nutritional" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic plate used to calendar the food in the microondes was not completely clean.
The final risk generating these "contaminants cocktails" for the consumer "probably underestimate", says the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), by its part, has proposed "for the seriousness of the situation" to apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to "the increase in diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study of the European Food Safety Agency (AESA) indicated the presence of 365 different pesticides identified in the fruit and vegetables consumpted in Europe, which were 76 in cereals.
