The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, signed the Act on the introduction of administrative responsibility for violation of the deadline and order of goods (work, services) in purchase for public and municipal needs.
The law aims at addressing the extreme challenge of non-compliance with its claimant obligations in the implementation of State and municipal purchases.
Another two years ago, the situation when the entrepreneurs could not receive payments for the already implemented public and municipal contracts.
The President of Russia then appointed the Advocate-General to address the issue of special control.
Since businessmen themselves couldn't be able to deal with unreasoned claimers who had not been supported by contract financing, they were all trying to abandon the payment obligations and included in the treaties of illicit conditions.
The problem was generally in the country.
Since 2015, the prosecutor's prosecutor ' s payments for public orders have been submitted, as a result of their consideration of the diplomatic responsibilities of 4,5 million officials to the administrative 533, 75 materials have been condemned for criminal investigation.
Finally, the debt was debt to more than 66 billion rubbers of the employees.
These huge amounts were far covered because of the non-payment of multimillional contracts.
In the basic debts, numerous, systematic delays for the service payment of entrepreneurs were made where more modest amounts were paid.
That's a personal case.
A small company manager wins competitors for social transport services in a number of millions of rubbers.
The man put all its trade funds, fully complied with the obligations, but the money set for a period did not receive.
The result of a long-term financial composition of payments, taxes and credits that would lead to banking if the entrepreneur is not in charge for the prosecutor.
Now, in a number of regions, the problem has been maximized.
However, at the first half of 2017, a joint amount of debt for public and municipal contracts identified by the Prosecutors of the Russian Federation was about 27.4 billion of rubbers.
In regions where debt indicators continue to achieve critical values, the prosecution works in the ruling anti-crisis management regime.
The General Prosecutor is on the journey meetings with the representatives of the local authority, which are subjectly selected by all the offenders of violations and measures to immediately eliminate them.
These operational meetings have already been held in Yaroslave and Eccaterinburgh this year.
The principal improvement of payment disciplinary of public claims can implement the Federal Law No. 189-FZ " on changes in the Russian Federation on Administrative Discrimination in the part of the administrative responsibilities of the complaints for the delay and order of purchase of goods (work, services) in order to ensure public and municipal needs " which was signed last week by the President of Russia.
The draft law was developed by Russia for the Gender Procurement Initiative.
The new law complements the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Criminal Discrimination, which prescribes 300,000 to 500,000 rules for violation of the official person of the timeliness and order of payment of goods, work and services in public and municipal purchase.
And if the official has already been sentenced by administrative for similar offences, it is expected to dismiss the duration of one year to two years.
All the prosecutors of the Russian Federation have already been assigned to ensure the application of these legislative novels in practice.
The Civil Rights Protection Group announced a warning to move to the Mission
The National Association for Promoting the Progress of the Blue People has published warnings for people traveling to Missouri, because of the discrimination policy of the State and racist attacks.
The Declaration of the Group calls on: “Prevention for travellers of the National Association to promote the progress of a colour population, actually until 28 August 2017, calls upon African travelers, guests and citizens of the Missouri State to be particularly careful and enhanced in the state journeys with regard to a number of doubtful events in the racism, recently situated in the entire territory of the State and the hosts.”
According to the National Association of Promoting the Progress of the Blue People, proclaiming the movement warning of the group has recently built the Law adopted by the Mission, which has made people more difficult to win discrimination, as well as that law enforcement bodies are often selected by their representatives of minorities.
“ You have a violation of human rights.
They stop on the roads because of the skin, kill and kill them,” reported the Cansas City Star, Rod Chapel, President of the National Association to promote the progress of the Missuer people.
"We hear the complaints often as we have ever heard."
This is the first warning of such a kind announced by the United States State.
The Panel focused on incidents such as the reduction of black-train students at the University of Mission and the death of 20-year-old Thory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances this year after he ended the benzine during the state journey, and the police arrested him without proclaiming a crime.
The warning also indicates the recent report of the General Prosecutor of the Mission State, which is likely to be stopped on the road for black drivers above 75 per cent than for whites.
“ The purpose of warning that people are aware of situations and warning their parents and friends and colleagues about what could happen in the mission, ” said Chapel.
“Their people must be prepared or otherwise, whether they take money for the loan or report to their parents that they travel on the State territory.”
According to the last data of the FBI report on hatred crimes, 100 crimes were registered in the Mission for 2015, which makes the state of sixty-five in the State with such violations.
The movement warning is also a response to the new Missouri State law, which would be more difficult to restore the case against the legal person in relation to housing or working discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Freedom Unit (ACLU) announced warnings for travelers in Texas and Arizona after the new immigration control laws that the local laws prescribed to arrest persons for immigration laws that, according to the ACLU, should increase the number of checks on racial signs.
Transition warnings are generally issued by the State Department in respect of other countries, but recently public organizations have been in response to specific laws and trends within the United States.
Two men died as a result of the police patrol in Egypt
The unknown police patrol was shot in the Egyptian city of Isna, reports Reuters with reference to the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
During the shooting of two men, including one policeman, had died three injuries.
All prisoners are put to the hospital.
According to the office, the police stopped the car, after which two armed persons were opened by fire guards.
One of the wicked ones is detained, the second was able to hide.
The Russian law supports the cancellation of free shipping for non-reported aircraft
Head of the Russian Olympics, Olympic, stated in the television interview of the CBK, that the "possitive" is to adopt the free-free shipping law for aircrafts.
"It must be able to create conditions where a person who has no bag may buy a dechevel than the one with the bag has," he stressed (quote for ASS).
Mr. Safons said that, despite the fear of the citizens, it was not necessary to pay for the shipping of high clothes and mobile phones in the handle.
"It would be right to calm all our citizens and tourists and say that it's to the top clothes, to the zones, to the mobile phone, to the episode or even any computer's relationship," said the head of Russianism.
The previous President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, has signed the law which provides the law of the aircraft to exclude the free-free shipping rule of a aircraft.
It is about the fact that the aircraft may determine the number of locations and the weight of the bags included in an unexpected tariff.
Vladimir Putin ordered to eliminate the pollution of Baykal
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, at the Baykara Protection Meeting, reported that significant areas of the Lake have been extremely polluted in the past few years.
It was intended to determine the sources of financing, plans and executives to eliminate pollution.
Mr. Putin also urged to make full correction of the polluted territories.
The President ' s 'REA News ' s should also be identified with the objects that continue to work here, purified weapons of most of them.
He also added that the Russian Prosecutor-General had to check out the identification of environmental harmful activities.
In his words, there are problems relating to the emergence of natural calamities and a number of distant environmental violations.
"I would like to emphasize this: not all the substances to check, but the measures are also necessary to know here, but it is illegal and environmental harmful activities and take appropriate measures," he stressed.
Previously, the Ghan Procurator reported on the reduction of fish stocks in the Baykal Lake and proposed to increase the number of objects under environmental supervision.
Remember, 15 June, Vladimir Putin in the direct line stated that legislation was necessary to change the rights of citizens living on the natural territory of the special protection regime.
He had reported about the problems of the management of the Oilhon Island, which is in the Baycale Natural Territory.
The Head of Minor Prostitute of Sergey Donknah immediately proposed to address the problem by identifying the border of the Baykala Water Zone, but the Government of Burkaria recalled that this change was not sufficient because restrictions were associated with a number of regular acts.
Previously, in the Middle East, they proposed to address the problem by amending the Earth Code and the Environmental Protection Act.
The new temple appears in Jugree
In the village of Sweden, communities from the representatives of the indigenous small peoples of the North of Rhabtany, together with the people of the Belarus area, participate in the construction of the Orthodox temple for the honour of the Nicola Chodoleitor.
His location is a swimming beach, the temple will be well seen away, so it will serve fishermen for a travel shop.
According to the representatives of the communities, the construction work has been completed this year, and the cowboy has now been established.
The EIB fleet had been transported.
Kram was appointed to the holy Nicola Chidocre, because it is read by the Orthodox Church as a traveller, including fishermen.
In the world, the fishing swimming pool provides work to the employees.
Local inhabitants are waiting when the temple opens their doors, and children even write to school associations about it as a local appropriation.
Disneyland with death penalty.
Why are Singapore complying with the laws?
I'm talking to Changom's local business, sit in a shopping air.
Changing the situation in Singapore, it smokes one smoke for another, but the oaks are attractively constituted in its hidden office.
After the end of the conversation, the businessman is sent to the nearest urn, 100 meters to it, and it takes the shoes there.
Chang reports that the public place is 500 local dollars.
You know, I've just developed a reflex: I can't get a phantric from the box to the bridge.
And now all the video cameras.
And indeed, Singapore trutuals in the center of the city are clean as in the museum.
Chang says: three months ago, his 18-year-old son, his neighbourhood, had graphed the wall of the old colonial building.
The court acknowledged the man who was in the bandalism and condemned the slaughter.
What?
Imagine yourself.
He received ten shocks of a wood shock in the jungle and held a week in prison.
We don't have any physical punishment.
As in Singapore, the higher level of life and the unlikely urgence laws have been identified at the location of the AIF advisor.
There's no one thinks to abolish the death penalty - explains the lawyer Victor Li Hong.
And the Government has long referred to the view of Europe and the United States in this regard.
If a person transports a large party of drugs or sells it, he is the seat.
In 2002, Changi was detained by a 22-year-old citizen of Australia, who was with him 400 g of cocaine.
The Australian Prime Minister was protected by sanctions, international human rights defenders and even the Pope of Rome.
However, the man was still buried.
After that, the narcotics of our country strictly turn into the side.
The following is: Singapore states that laws have to comply with the OECD, not only modest and sky-based persons.
I don't care who you're a million, a Vice-Premier, a famous artist or a Eurovis.
The option in this case is one: if you find a cocaine pool, you'll be shooted.
When you go to Singapore and meet some warnings, you're just wondering how much it's forbidden in this city of State!
For example, the skin is sold only in pharmaceuticals and can be purchased by a doctor.
The kitchen will not be discarded, but it should be rolled in a metro, shooting $1,000 in local dollars.
For four days, I met two people with white tablets on the shoes, "I'm shooting."
For a shooting shooter, more than the shooter often calls for the shooter: a week to remove parks and shoots.
6.000 Rub. pays the " criminal " forgotten to cut water in the public toilet, and when trying to make a small need in the lift of the house, a special detector is blocked by the doors and sends a signal to the police.
The total ecosythical laws include the prohibition of bleeding on the street, the public performance of the songs and even the excessive heat of the room plant (!).
In avoiding the fire of smokers, it is not possible to shoot in metro, other than 50,000 Singapore taxes.
In general, there's a thought: as you do, you have to struggle something.
That's not really true - it's trying to make me convinced Mohammed Kabri-Kajaria, the owner of the local tourism.
Specially fantastic laws exist only on the bowl, and in the past twenty years, I have not seen that someone has been inflicted for their violations.
Why do they keep?
That the citizens don't have to resolve.
In compliance with the basic rules, it is uncomplied.
So, if a young man is sold in the kitchen of cigarettes, it will be sentenced to all at the time: the master of the shop pays a great amount, the assaulter will receive the shoes on the "day" shoes and the seller will also put and settle in prison.
That is very rare because of the so serious laws of crime in Singapore.
Is that right?
In the past seventy years, we had a chaos on the road - automobilists ignored the lights, moved as they wanted, sit down on the rule.
After a year’s breakdown, it has been succeeded.
Now the driver, drinking a visa portion, knows, if they stop, the police will not leave the shooting, set the cost of the apartment, and they are sent for years.
Many foreigners in South-East Asia seem to be a variety of concentrations.
In 1993, the American writer William Gibson called Singapore "Dysnelland with Death Criminal Chair" - a guest from the United States was in fear of the general richness of the people, the "purer airport" and the "Occulent Nature".
The discovery of such things appears artificially and should not be in principle.
The first days in Singapore, and you're surely afraid to get a paper on the throat, you're shocked if you're coming to the metro with a marine.
But then you're coming to the small Indian area, and on the other hand it's a model explosion: the bus stops are shooted in the cars.
"What about this?" - You're surprised.
That's how, the singapores are shiny.
Everything's done.
Not for any such crime, but you have to know, if you are calculating, you're not going to defeat because you have violated the law.
It's just enough for a man to make himself normal.
It is certain that the authority of Singapore is fully authorized.
But you know what?
In Viet Nam, I moved very carefully - the motorcycles often cut off the hands of Smartphones and cameras.
In the centre of Paris, the bombs and demands are full.
They're not all trying to shoot up on our streets.
However, Singapore has become the most peaceful, clean and safe city on earth by the assembly of dragons and disgraceful (related to the death penalty).
You're thinking about it.
Such human nature: Remember, and no one in Russia was shocked by the rule until it was shocked.
Although the main part of Singapore is not the trap, but the voluntary compliance with the laws.
And we should think that in Russia, people would also be pleased in clean streets, absence of metro-term, and welcome those who travel a lift with a public toilet.
There's a physical punishment - thank you, don't.
In the rest of the Singapore laws the minimum stands for them.
No holy thing?
The White House of Trampa is now struck on the Liberty Statute.
The most reliable sign of the mode is when it begins to fight statistics.
The Americans do not understand it worse than all of the other -- the theatrical contribution of Saddam Hushin's statue in the Firdos area in Bagdad in 2003.
Steven Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Government of Trampa, knew uncertainly what he had done when he took a symbolic point on the Free status during the disaster interference with the journalist CNN Jim Acoty on the proposals of the President on the root reduction of legal migration.
We're honest, Miller hasn't tried at the same statue.
The pool of passenger vessels and artists, pictured by the Freedom Statute, would strike it if he tried to do it.
But he tried to the meaning of her, and especially to the meaning that she was accepted in 1903, 17 years after the monument finished, when the text of Emma Lazarus was added.
"I don't want to enter the story, but the State of Freedom is... the symbol of American freedom that saves the world.
It was added later and not part of the original status of freedom."
Miller correctly put the facts, but as he himself said, it's not really the story.
It is about the current sound of the voice of Lazarus, the only ones in which the State is invited not any immigrants but the poorest: "There are your lips, your poor, / your dreams that are smiling freely, / Unfortunate displacements of your powerful beaches."
There's never been any "unfortunate displaces" on our screens.
Miller didn't take literature, and he understood that these people were not waiting for in America.
This statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: this is really the point of an American sense.
Lazarus, and her friends, fighting for putting her words on the statue after her death, were very well aware of what they have done completely a political act.
The sculpture should be marked as a relationship between the French and American Republic with a classical image of the Free Women.
Lazarus changed its meaning: in her shocking a woman's figure is not Abstract, she has a voice.
And she received a complete name: the mother of the Exiled.
The association of stigmatization and image was a limite pheminist and a devastating attack against American nativeism.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statistics, the right to change it back.
In 2010, John Baptist, who was his parent, said that the Freedom of nobody was likely an early non-consistent non-consistent who was born in the dark world: " Freedom is going forward.
It has a set of freedoms from the United States to the rest of the world.
The faculty does not need to shine the way to the United States."
Limboa's prevention is really on the point.
The meaning of the statistics depends exclusively on the vision.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see her as they would have seen, unfortunate, but full hopes of people on the ships after a long and often heavy swimming floor.
This means literally to look at the world by the eyes of people who are looking for refugee and a better life.
The article answers them the words of hope and hospitality that they dream to hear.
And of course, it's not the prospect that Miller and Tramp ever wanted to recognize.
Their faculty needs not to make it possible, but to wipe out hate, which is the only source of their power.
The World Champion 2017: Nil Blake apprecies the Skotlandian members of the collection of Britain.
Alid Doyle remembers the time when only two Skotlands were in the assembly.
Nil Blake, director of the Federation of Athletics of Britain, stated that 16 of the Skotlanian part of the World Championship had a "important contribution to the team game".
The recursive number of Skotland flights was elected on Friday 2017 of the London Championship.
Blake believes that Skotland is "also special" and that the Federation of a easy attraction should take into account.
"We know that and try to understand and support until they have the capacity," said Blake.
"I spoke to people at the Skotland Institute, and they think it is related to what they did.
The Skotland Federation thinks they have to work with what they have done.
The British Federation of Easy Atletics, which they have done, must work.
And people on the street think that's the same.
I don't know why the situations were so able to be, but it's perfectly smelling."
Some of the Skotlands claim to meal, including Lora Maure and Andre Batch, which will compare Mr. Mo Faroch at a distance at 5000 m; and Elid Doyle chose his captain.
"Elyd's modest.
Her captain was great," says Blake.
" Many lightways, independently of their shocks or not, and from where they live or train, have been out of this room, feeling proud and victory.
The pain and sincere feelings that Alid had put into her were wonderful."
The manufacturer of a silver meal champion of the Society, who is on his fifth Championet world, will run a distance of 400 meters away, says that 16 Skotlands in the British collection are "incredibly".
The previous refund for the world championship was equal to seven, 1983 and 2005.
Lora Mur, a specialized run in the middle of the distance and killed five British and two European recursions last year.
She will run up to 1500 and 5000 meters.
Chris O'Her, who will participate in the rent of 1500 meters, is another Skotlandian who should be attentioned: for the spot of his lucky season, which has been winning for the selection of the British collection and the annual conceptions.
Doyle reminds her first championship of the world when Lee McConnel was the only skoolander in the team.
The captain's team says that she was "incredibly proud" that so many of its co-conciliators were not only in the collection but will be claimed to be shocked and fighting for the end.
"The head of the collection chooses other team members, so that was in any case a great honor, but I know that your friends have made a statement for you and for you, that's a perfect person for me," she added.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the Skotlandians who entered the collection.
This shows how much we have done.
And they're all the lightways that will try to spend on the shooting.
What about my captain?
Yeah, I think she was good.
I just pointed out that we were very happy to take home Championet of the world.
So this is simply how it is important to receive support from the farmers and use what we are talking again at the Olympic Stadium.
I got another chance to go to his farm and to participate in the snake, and the atmosphere will be wonderful there."
Blocking critics in Facebook: not move to public position if you are not ready to listen to the critics of the electors
The founder of our country understood that it was a critical press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not prevent them to criticize it from all internal policy to its political principles.
His criticism, of course, was disappointed.
But he didn't touch his critics.
Because, in 1783, Washington said, "It could be able to take the freedom of speaking and of us, deep and smell, leads to war."
I'm going to go to the Governor Maryland Larry Hogan, who would try to be more like Washington.
The underlying Hogans blocked and stripped at least 450 people who expressed their view on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Civil Freedom's Unit gave it to the court.
The underlying Governor called the search for nothing, and the comments in the Internet were written in the spirit “no and what”.
"It's just Facebook," they say many.
But it's also important.
And it's especially important when it's talking about the Hogan guy.
It is a surprising popular Republicn Governant in the democratic advantage of the State.
He is in the second place of approval among 50 gouverneurs of the country.
Hogan isn't an incredible reactioner.
He demonstrated a strong hand in the administration of the State and commitment to its principles.
He also uses the Facebook as a primary way to connect his electors and shows his shoes on his page after the chemistry of the head.
Thus, blocking people coming to the Governor's page, which is declared as an official public forum and carried out by the Administration for money payers, is unnecessary and finally unnecessary.
In the Vasington Post interview, the secretariat Amile Chas protected the Governor's actions, claiming that the locking of comments is just their modernisation.
But it's too easy - to use the image of the trolls, spammers and the chatters that slaughter in the Internet.
Post talked to some of the real people who blocked Hogan.
And that's the real people that are not truly, the teachers, the businessmen, the pastors, who are referring to their elected leaders.
All of them say that their comments were respectful, contained and not cruel.
The pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to the fact that Hogan is Catholic.
The lawyer Lakshmi Sharma Raman, in Bowai, Maryland, did not express hate but asked for a crime to be a pleasant hatred.
"I wrote a huge comment that I have disappointed the lack of his reactions to hate crimes and to other news of the last time," she wrote in the section of comments to the Post article.
"I also don't like the idea that when many people leave comments on one and the same topic, some say that it is so called a strike, instead of acknowledgeing that they have business with a large group of unvoluntary citizens."
What the underlying Governor is called "concentred spam attack", others probably would be called "active life position".
In the eve of the Facebook, it is easy to communicate your image, just block critics or strike negative comments.
This is much less pool than before the need to send people, gather and shoot newspapers with critical transfers or arrest and smell the protesters.
But this is exactly what happens now, just in the number.
Hogen is not the first person who criticizes that he doesn't want to listen to Facebook and others.
The President of Traampu was pronounced by Twitter users who were engaged in his Twitter account.
One of the first, turning decisions on the subject was adopted at Virginia this week.
According to the U.S. Environment Court of Alexandria James C. Casheris, the President of the observing Council of Laudon violated the First Amendment, invading the elector in his Facec Book.
And in Kentucky, the Republic-Republic Gubernamenter Mattu Bevin, a claim for the American Union for the Protection of Citizens' freedoms for his behavior in Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so difficult.
During the era of Washington, the available email costs were almost the same as the Internet today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers grew four, and the authors of anonymous letters were strongly violated by its authority.
And even then, Washington had an anonymous troll.
People under the pseudo-written "Juricola", "Valius", "Belizarius" and "Porcius" wrote letters in the newspapers expressing the decision of Washington.
According to the historical documents collected by the Online Documents of George Washington, his office was engaged by the petitions that criticize his position on the Treaty on friendship, trade and maritime.
But he didn't try to stop them.
The freedom of speaking, anchor and speaking is based on our State.
And the true leadership means agreed with that.
Ron Rafferty is hoped to be the goods in the Renascens Club.
The former champion of Europe, Ron Rafertti, is expected to be in the nearest three days when the Renesens Club in Eastern Latvia takes twenty-fifth Skotlandic golf tour for old sports.

Returning to this hole of the world is magnificent.
It's a beautiful place for golf games.
Remembers last year are returned, and for me and my wife, Sheron, it was a very special impression to win last year.
It was a very special time, and we will always remember it."
Returns to the battle of the country, Gary Orr, joined to the European Tourism for old sports, after it had been completed in that year.
This event will be his first appearance in Skotlandia with the time of the tour "Abenden Asset Management Scottish Open" in 2013.
“When you play home, it's always a little more important thing,” said Helensboro Orr.
"You want to be good, but you're feeling that more burden."
I played with great joke again, and I showed a good golf.
"I am satisfied as everything will be received."
On the field of this triumph, the former winner of the Tourist of Masters and the Champion of Mayor for old sports Paul Broadhards, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNalty.

The British roads are learning to deal with harmful emissions
It has already been tested on the roads of the United Kingdom.
The country’s transporting Agency, as reports the Autocar publication, has been observed of the positive results of the 100 meter tonne testing set on one of the shoes in the north of the country.
The tunnel height of 6 metres is built from a few new polymer materials that can absorpte harmful substances contained in car rentals.
However, the establishment of the entire network of these tonnels is only part of the extensive measures that the authorities of the United Kingdom will take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the tunnels network, the Englishs are planned to expand the network of loading stations for mobile motors, to implement a number of activities on road reduction, to expand the use of the commercial vehicle on electric ships and to modify the park of heavy cars.
Official statistics, four of all polluted atmospherics are being transported, and the unpleasant air quality is due to 400,000 premature deaths per year.

Poverty and death in the Indonesian 'Slood Land'
Good evening, Bardin Degey does not use a swimming pool.
She's even rarly useful.
In his village house in Enerotaly, the capital of Paniy, in the Middle Indonesian province of Papua, the household is usually simplely placed with a sweet cardfel here called “note” in the eye.
After half an hour, the clamps swimming up and eating with unselfish hands.
Degey is sit on the ground field, not the kitchen, and here she works at home, such as the strike of a mutual water from the close to the paint.
The slaughter serves in the room without snakes.
She was the age of four women of her husband, and therefore she was not forced to work in the field.
Many of them have been distributed.
Of course, afternoon may be dangerous: many men from this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are soldiers.
“No one decides to walk in the village after five nights,” she says.
This is a remarkable opportunity to see a daily life in the high-level Papua, the former Dutch colony, joined to Indonesia in 1969 after a doubtful referendum, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote on a privately higher hand before the occupied troops.
The existing movement from the Netherlands quickly argued its angry against the Government of Jakarta, which keeps a cruel control over the region, without allowing foreign journalists and rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially separated by Papua and the West Papua, and the independent state of Papua New Guinea is the eastern part of the island.
The Enerotali is the city that has been distant as well as the buried; the road is included in the mid-hour journey from Jayapur, the Administrative Centre of Province, Nabura, and then the five-hour trail on the loading car.
There's no public transport here.
The population of about 19,000 people are from the village houses covered by bamboogs, and the cuts of the heavy cuts have been improved in different markets.
There have been little indonesians who haven't spoken about journalists, and almost no foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, my paucas was worshiped by the god named Ug.
Other changes have also been changed.
“We were inadequate to take this clothes,” says Degey, showing his legs, cut into the hands of the prison, the dark sweet and the bright shock.
"We've brought only a card on the tv."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, 28 per cent of its population lives in poverty and the level of child mortality and gramm among the worst in Asia.
But this is also the Indonesian golden land.
The world's largest gold machine, Graceberg, belonging to the Freeport McMoran Company, is about 60 miles away from Paniya, a higher province near New York, where 153.000 people live.
Only in 2015 the Freeport company has reached the gold and the media for about 3,1 billion dollars.
At the end of Papua, the forest stocks, which are estimated by 78 billion dollars.
These riches, however, have a challenge for Papuas, safeguarding that the powerful armed forces of Indonesia remain here with its deep presence.
According to the New York Times report in 2005, Freeport company payed for local military and units $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including $10,000.
More autonomy requirements from Papuas are threatening the existence of this golden dry and unfortunately slaughtered.
According to the approval of the rights defenders, the military forces of Indonesia have been killed by over 5000,000 Papuas since 1969, and still thousands have been forced, subjected to torture and freedom.
On the basis of the approval of the Asian Human Rights Commission, the mass murders of the indigenous populations of Popea for seventy years may be considered to be genocide.
Only in the past year the Indonesian police arrested over 3900 peaceful protesters in the region.
“We lose everything” report published in 2016 by the Brisbanian Party contains a witness of the beliefs conducted in the previous year, such as punishment without courts, torture, especially the parties, such as in other cases, violent and electrical points, and the cruel consignment of peace demonstrations.
“ It is difficult to compare the number of victims because the occurrences have a place every week, ” says Andréas Harsono, who conducted research in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
Haiki was displaced, as the resources of Papa’s residents from other Indonesian regions took place.
3.5 million people of the province are Christians, but the demographic indicators are changed through the arrival of Islamic economic migrants with the Gustavo-Indonesian islands – Yawa, Sumari and Slavesia.
The Yavanian shoes, "warnge", sell a smoke and a sweeter with a sweet soss.
Local people are trying to keep competitive.
“Migrants started to sell smoke and fruits than the Indigenous people of Papua” explains Abet Jou, a twenty-year-old Panya's born in Jayapur, the Administrative Centre of Province, because of the work.
"It was because of the indigenous people of Papua, Mother, Mother, the Women, lost their market. "
The President of Indonesia, Joko Vidodo, who was known in the people as Jokoya, pleaded to deal with inequality and violations of rights in Papua during his presidency campaign in 2014.
At his path to the President of Jakarta, the former carriage was supported by 27 of 29 districts of Papua, including Pania.
But Papua has almost nothing changed, and local people feel loyal.
“ Our hearts are disfellowshipped, because we voted for Jocks in 2014, expecting that he will fulfill our hopes for resurrection of justice,” said Jou.
Indeed, only two months after the October inauguration, Joko Panya survived the tragedy.
On December 7th, 2014, a group of 11 children was on the street and the skin of birth giants in the Enerotali, when two Indian soldiers were shocked from the darkness.
The scared children told them that they should be involved in the fair.
As the local pastor Javet Tebay reported, one of the soldiers had been buried on their tons and a few days later returned from four soldiers.
According to the victims and witnesses, the soldiers who were drunken were shocked for children and took their examples of expenses.
Then one of the soldiers shot the group of children.
One child, a 15th-year-old Julian Aimeemo, was so shocked that was shocked.
A few hours later, a government building was located near the electoral commission, and the next day the situation was shocked.
About thousands of Papuas men, women and children have gathered at a football field before the local police office and the military team centre to need justice.
They brought the ritual desires of the balls with them and filled the shoes, the dance of the Papuas tribe, the shooting and the birds.
Some protesters began to swing stones into the police office and the military base.
When the situation was caught, the soldiers in the internal radio connection were ordered to say: “If the torpe is opposed more than three times, shoot them”, he sounded as the official document that saw the TIME magazine, but which was not published in local media.
The fifty-sixty-year-old Erientias Kaime, head of the Kjo Coto area in Enerotaly, felt the risk of approaching and calling for calming, calling on a call to go home.
Nobody wanted to listen to him.
“ When I returned, I was soon shooting at the left floor, ” he told the TIME magazine.
I still don't know who shooted, but he says that the gun came from the sheriff's gathering soldiers.
"The shooting, the shooting was a lot," he adds.
In the local population of Alfius Job, his two - year - old brother, who became a witness to the shooting.
“ I went to him and checked his body to make sure that he is,” said TIME magazine Johanes, who, as many Indonesians, uses only one name.
"I saw him died... I kissed him."
General Yotje Mende, senior Police Inspector of Papua, said to the reporters that his officers were only “protected” on their basis because it was attacked.
“We should protect when people are threatening to kill us,” in 2015, stated the representative of the police Commissioner Poujo Sulistio.
“This is the question of life and death.”
According to the Human Rights Watch, five-year-old protesters were killed, and more were arrested.
The murder news came to Jakarta only on the next day.
After three weeks, Jokoy was a pleasant talk in Jaipur, expressing the condiction of the victims and pleading to address the question of historical abuse of the authority in Papua.
“ I want this situation to be immediately resolved to never again in the future,” he said.
In October 2016, Viranto, Minister of Security, said that it would establish an unfair organization to put an end to historical violations of human rights.
But we almost went out of the reserve.
“The majority of violations has happened for a long time.
Some of them had a place in nine or at the beginning of the nucleus.
The fact is that we, of course, want to take these violations, but there are procedures that we need to pass," he said.
Then Virranto rejected his words, speaking with the TIME magazine in Jakarta on 5 June, and said that it was not planning to create organizations to consider complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, "They will be decided through the court."
The Virgin, whose United Nations was accused of “criminal crimes against humanity” in the bloody vote of the East Timor in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua, including the incident in Paniya, had already been released.
Seven victims from Paniya met such statements with mature infidelity.
“ In the past three years, I was asked four times, but no change was completely changed, ” says John.
"I'm lying."
He says that the years later, he's still in fear.
"I'm afraid," he says.
“I am afraid that I have arrested the soldiers, and I fear that they will shoot me.”
His brother Jacob also expressed the view that the people of Paniya were afraid to discuss the event.
He said he was killed by military after he helped to fill four victims.
And he said, “When we buried the body, they came after me,”
The starba hasn't stopped.
On Monday, the Indonesian police shooted in villages in the Neighbourhood of Pania.
During the assembly of the villages and the building manager, which refused to help a man who had no conscience, a man died in the hospital, and 17 had been assaulted, including children.
Man, twenty - year - old Ravian Doww, who shooted the fish in a nearby shock, died on the road to the hospital.
Devastated villages protested in front of a building area belonging to the company.
According to the police, the villages shocked stones in officers that were in response to warning shoes.
However, local people say that a mobile brigade (Indonesian Spencer) has become shooted and killed one man.
“ We were in such a panic, we were afraid of return, ” reported the TIME magazine of the Twenty-ninth anniversary Badia, who lives in the hospital and saw how quickly the prisoners were given.
“ I was hiding at home two days. ”
The Acti Parliament needed to respond to the officials, and the mobile police brigade from the region.
Pania was always a ill place for the Indonesian Government.
The inadequacy of significant development results in the injury of the tribe mee, monks, donations and donations displaced on the whole territory of the pine green of the central high-earth regions of Papua.
Many have joined the “Free Papua Movement” (OPM), a resurrected army, who claims that the rights of pausins is protected by constraint attacks and infringement of people in Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the senior OPM leaders have been from Paniya, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Koyoya.
As a response measures in the past few years, thousands of people have been arrested and unfairly detained by military under the premium “Protection of National Independence”.
Some haven't come back.
Among the populations of Papua Panii is considered “persistent, forgotten place”.
Poverty increases in illness.
A small portion of the quality sold in Enerotaly is too precious for local inhabitants.
Brothers in the same way are unable.
People here grow all the foods: mainly, note, and some fruits and breastfruits.
Agricultural household is a women's work, each of which may be able to spend for four-five fields of a swimming card.
They generally remain a large part of the family's wealth, and the rest are sold at the local market.
Ten clubs are only 100,000 Indonesian rupes (75 cents).
Since then, economic inequality was increased between the Indigenous Papuas and the new immigrants who had arrived in large numbers after the introduction of new aircrafts to Nabuki Airport.
Many of the existing vacances are usually more educational and state migrants.
Papoua has typically lacked money or ability to carry out its own competitive business.
“Young people don't want to stay in the village... because there is no job or money,” says John Gobai, Chairman of the Panii tribal council.
The isolation of Papua has been removed from the views of the rest of the world.
Moreover, the limitations to work on international media remain awesome.
In the past year, French journalists Frank Escoughy and Basil Lonshan have been deported from Papua for “unsufficient coherence with relevant organizations” even though they have issued rare permissions for videos.
According to Felima Kine, the Vice-Chairman Director of Asian Organization Human Rights Watch, the promises made during the pre-selection campaign of Jokoy restraints the media work in order to facilitate transparency and development.
“Another journalists who are now trying to report from the Middle Eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and Western Papua are faced with new dangers: refusal to the visa and to introduce the black list,” he stated in the statement.
The lack of attention from the press means that the international pressure on the Indonesian Government is mainly limited by the direct neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshallways and Solomons of the Islands – requested the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate “divergent and widely distributed violations” in Papua, including the shot in Paniya.
The same country has been supported by OPM in the past.
The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Indonesia, Arramanata Nasir, dismissed the statement of the group, reported journalists in Jakarta that "Indonesia still operates a democratic system and there is a free press, and therefore it would be difficult to cover the evidence of episodes of violation of human rights".
Local people want to take attention to the situation of more foreign governments.
When a official delegation from the Netherlands, who was the Dutch Ambassador for Human Rights, visited Jayapur, on 4 May, and the local people were infringing the silence, prayer: “We want freedom”, as the source that was also present at the meeting, but wished to remain an anonymized.
In Indonesia, the new presidential elections were held in 2019, but the papas say that they are not re-declared for Jacques again.
“Jhokovi is a man whose good purpose is, but it is around people who are involved in the gun in Paniya,” says Gobai, chairman of the council of the tribe.
He wants to know that the people of Panii, except that they live in the darkness of the threats by the old army, were polluted in poverty, and the education and health are in a regret.
Gobay says that the people of Pania, as well as the other pausées, consider their voice rewarded for Jacques, a long time that he must pay.
“They don't need money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite threats and threats, the families of the shooting victims in Paniya have carried out the last symbolic innocence: one of the victims of the earth had been entered directly against the police and military participation.
Knowing that justice may never be disappointed, they will at least not allow the guilty to forget their crimes.
“ They killed a member of our family, ” says Jacobs, not taking up his head.
"What else would we do?"

It was known for the mass dragon in the Ural Military Centre
In the Elean School Center, where a mass drama occurred, a work group of senior military officials arrived in the Central Military District to investigate the circumstances of the incident.
Some details of this fear have already been known.
According to the Mash table, which appeared on the B Kontakte page, the U.S. Military Party No. 31612 severely slaughtered from the unexpected bed.
It was started from a line named Sayan demonstratively ignored the order of the officer to settle the torment.
The officer stood the soldiers from the sixth mouth.
Saana supported the first mouth.
By half an hour of 140 young men were slaughtered in the slaughter and slaughtered.
More than ten people suffered in the mass dragon.
The WHO has checked information on the powder.
A study showed that at least one fifth passenger in the United States had prohibited aircraft objects.
The survey showed that more than 20 per cent of aircraft aircrafts had been conducted in a shipping bag or accidentally through the point of view of the United States Transport Security Administration, including at least 6 per cent of the aircraft, in spite of the prohibited feet or other severe objects.
Another 1 per cent reported that later they found that they had a fire weapons, bombs or explosive substances.
The investigation carried out by the Stars Jet Charters company, Inc., and more than 1000 persons, also showed that young passengers were more strict to violate the rules.
From the respondents who acknowledged that they were aware of trying to flee with something prohibited by ATT, 19.7 per cent were millionary compared to less than 15 per cent of the Generation X members.
A.T.A.P.A.s. is often being made food and water.

We are expecting that most of them are aware or unreasonablely, and they're going to swallow the contraband by considering those who fly most.
As the company indicates, the ATB rules are very complicated and inconsistent.
People often don't know exactly what smooth they can transport in.
It is therefore unexpected that the large part of the ATB's chosen is forbidden ironicities.
Some time ago people thought that ATTB could be considered forbidden to transport books.

Chapter of EPA Prutit is rejected by the purpose of refusing the rules on emission reductions adopted by the Ombudsman
On the next day after the request of 15 State headquarters, the Environment Agency rejected its decision to derogate the rules adopted by the Ombudsman to reduce emissions of air pollutant air and education.
Priit explained its decision that his Agency is now more than previous administrations, as well as the needs of the environmental controllers of individual states.
He did not mention the case against his previous position in the Federal appeal Court.
The controverse has been round to the period of 1 October, which the states must ensure that the 2015 land-level standards are complied with the ground-level standards.
In June, Privat announced that they would respect for a year to give its state more time to study the plan and avoid "the inadequacy of local decisions or obstacles to economic growth".
Praitt, who was appointed by President Trump to his current post, was the general Prosecutor of the Oklakoma State, was long known as a follow-up opposer to the ecological standards.
After the movement to Washington, Pruitt sblotched or repeated standards against chemical or gas-energy industry.
The unexpected change of the rate in the environment is a normal legal vision of the Puitt Kurs to return to the previous standards.
In the last month, the Federal Appeal Court in Washington decided that the head of the EPA had exceededed its powers by trying to delay the implementation of the Administration of the rules required by the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce the loss of metal.
In the statement issued at the midnight, Privat suggested that the course of the zone standards was slightly changed, he simply complied with the EPA ' s obligation to cooperate with the states in the integrated time-building process of new standards.
"For the previous administrations, the EPA was often not able to place in the current period, then waiting for the groups of activists and other persons and discussed the time for the settlement of the case," said Pruitt, which gave more than two decades to the EPA at its previous post.
"We do not believe in the regulation through judicial processes, and we relate to the deadlines set.
We are also seriously treating our rule and the authority he gives us."
However, the EPA statement states that the Privat may at any time again use its "fulfilment for the delay and other data of the authority" to ensure that the standards "jcyjdfys in a clear course and all available information".
The Republicns in the Congress have a broader review of the rules relating to ozone.
The draft law adopted by the Party of Representatives in the last month is intended to defeat the 2015 Regulation as a minimum of eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this issue.
The General Prosecutor of New York, Eric Sneyderman, who had launched the coalition of states in the EPA for this week, said that the group intended to continue legal pressure.
" The change of the course of EPA -- after our courses, is an important winning for the fight against health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkians and more than 115 million Americans, which are directly influenced by their city's help," said Sneyderman.
At the site of New York, California, Connecticot, Delaver, Illinois, Iwa, Man, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Orion, Pennsylvania, Rod Island, Vermont and Washington, and the district of Colombia.
Earth-level ozone occurs when normal pollutant substances from machines, electricity stations, oil and chemicals and other sources are in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The emerging person may cause serious disorders with the feelings of these people by bringing to thousands of premature deaths a year.
Health Protectors and Environmental Protections welcomed the unexpected change of the Privat course.
"True thinking about how much pressure was needed to get this perfectly logical step from a man who is intended to protect the air we breathe", said Lori Anne Bard from the Centre of Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to resist the ideological campaign of Trampa and protect those polluting air and their special interests."

Happily, this horrible scene, which won on July 22, is only an incentive.
But when the Roger's shoes shocked a shoe, almost all the shoes were breathing.
Since 2005, activists return to the Mouse of Mors Ford to play again on the night when the cocklecklacks sleeped two black-coup pairs, Roger and Dorothy Mallok and George and May Murley Dorsy in 1946.
No one was condemned for these murders.
"Certainly, no man was arrested for all these years - although we see them close to us, although we know who they are," says Tyron Brooks, who helped to organize the order.
"It's a skin in our history and it's a stone in our souls."
71-year-old Brooks, former member of Georgia, who is struggling for human rights.
The spectacle is a dramatic call for action and an annual reminder to the inhabitants of Monroe that the injustice has not been corrected.
"We want to investigate, we want to end up, we want to restore, we want reconciliation, but first we have to achieve justice," he says.
"We can't go to healing and reconciliation until we reach justice."
The king captures the simple body of one of the victims of drought in Mors Ford on 27 July 1946.
According to Ann-Bi-si-News materials, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighbouring graphs were suspected in the lifting.
But no one was sentenced.
Although the suspected decades remained free, the rights defenders said that the city has always known two related guiding motives: policy and sex.
In April 1946, the decision of the Supreme Court first authorized the black citizens to vote on the plomers that were to be held in the summer.
During the same elections, the FBI reported that the black user Roger Malcolm was shocked in the shock of Barnett Hester, the white landowner, because of the woman.
Brooks say that Hester was sleeping with her wife Malcolm Dorothy, and that the child she had to be born was not a husband.
According to the FBI report, on 25 July 1946, Loy Harrison, a large white landowner, paid $600 to release Malcolm from prison.
He went to prison together with Dorothy and their friends May Murley and George Dorsy.
But when they went out of prison and went to the Mors Ford Mouse, the shooter was around the car.
"It was explained that he organized and commanded Harrison's murders," was concluded in one of the FBI reports.
"By obviously, there was a complaint between the law enforcement authorities of the State and the city who had not only participated in murder but also destroyed the evidence and hidden the personality of witnesses."
Brooks call it short.
"This was a trial for election rights," he said.
"All of them have killed to send a black signal to the city: if you register and vote, you will be the same."
Just 10 years ago, Cassandra Green directs an annual spectacle that plays the thickness of the Mors Ford bridge.
Her spectacle is overlooked, he is slaughtered, and it is about the deep racism that, as many would like to think, is no longer in America.
It's hard to see and it's harder to turn away, but Green believes that it's the main thing.
"We don't want to talk about Lincha's judges, because they show us our own nature," she says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't hear me or you don't hear what I've survived."
The spectacle rescue began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors were white, the other blacks gathered in place and listened to the slipped review of the drinks.
Wayd Marbo was a register with Green.
He played a few years of the main member of the clan, but he says that the role was not easier.
"I think I'm missing, because it's not the man I'm," says Marbo.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to come back at that time."
Actors, Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, repeat their roles.
Spectal begins with Malcolm, who has discovered Hester's sleeping with his wife Dorothy, crys and touchs him.
"I said, neg, go out of my house!".
Cry Rascon in the answer.
It's shocking.
And at the same time, all of them (at least all black actors) are disappointed by honey.
The ring's laughing all.
"What is it?" asks Ascona.
He's worried and funny.
Do I play?
"No," he said, "in the midst."
"I just don't think the white ones were saying nigga."
Yeah, it's ridiculous one of the black artists.
"You need to spend a strong 'r'."
Similarly, energy is changed in the room: the discomfort changes the feeling of companion.
Everyone must do it right, not only for drinks, but also for the memory of four killers.
The scene starts first.
This time Rascona says the word "n" is clear and strict.
No man's laughing.
The spectacle ends evil and fast.
Cricky, shoot, and then calm down.
The woman in a snake black clothes stands on the body of the actors and performs a tragic song of Billy Hollyde Strand Fruit.
His voice is interrupted through the word.
In a hundred yards from it, half of the riders get out of the eye of laugh and pot.
Among the rabbits are almost equal to the number of black and white.
One couple came out of that, New York State, to look at the presentation; many live very close.
They were almost eight hours old to Georgia, while Brooks drived them into the polls of Malcolm and Dorsy.
To this time, the murder remained only a story, but now when they stand on the same place where people were cutting, they seem to be shocked here in the air.
When the last note of the song, Green invites people to come closer and look at the body.
Childs die to their heads, they smell to a sweet pink of blood, and the unmovable bodys and the shoeting one another.
"It's not really dead," is a little boy, like to remember yourself.
A few minutes later, Green thanks the slaughterers, and then it's over.
The actors strike out the shoes and cut the legs out.
Bradshaw understands Marbo, a man in the coast that played the main cockleck.
Nick Rascona understands two other actors and, soon, smile, falls into their smile: the emotional load of the spectacle was finally inflicted.
"I'm all right," one of the women's shoes.
"We know that your heart is good.
You had reasons for this."
Afterward, the snakes sit to dinner with the actors.
On a table, a white couple from Atlanta has a living discussion with a black couple with which they just met.
Dennis Daplenski with work is looking for words to describe what she feels after the spectacle.
"It's like to listen to these horrible, horrible words, and... people who look like you, and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"After that I think there's still a shock," she adds, "that it's called that the police's shot."
In the other edge of the room, Tyron Brooks had a general attention to the work of the human rights defender.
He said that it was started to plan the submission of the next year.
He says: "The path is encouraged to us, because it is not only the fear of what we have survived, but also the teaching of us."
"For if you don't get out of this lesson, it may happen again.
Those who do not study their stories, who do not know their stories, are attributed to her replication."

After the unilateral winning of Harry over the former world champion in four pregnant categories of Eric Broner, on Saturday on the Showtime channel, both boxers are in the fifth best boxers outside depending on the pregnancy categories.

Successful to you."

“ I went up to the category for Broner [140 feet], but I’m not so big.
I'm little for 140.
I want to go back to the helmet.
And he's got to get up to the top of 135 feet, and then we're going to build a unit.

New test results were published to evaluate the age of asylum assistants in Sweden
The recent tests of refugee visitors in Sweden, which have made a new medical assessment method, indicate that more than 80 per cent of the protested persons of the age of 18, but not yet believe the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Medical Agency (Rates Medicinal Network) began testing this year.
They were developed to assess the age in providing asylum more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) discovered that it was not able to determine the age of some refugees who claimed that they were uncomprehensive.
At this time, Migrationsverket sent 6 880 cases to test, and the judiciary office has now published results of 2 481 tests for the average March to 31 July 2017.
Eighth per cent (2002) tested as people of 18 or older people, and in 25 cases, the judicial physicians estimated that the tested “incredibly 18 or older person” was tested.
In the case of 432 cases, the person had said "also less than 18".
Tests are conducted only when human age causes doubt.
According to Johannes Geranceson, the results of the last month are corresponding to the results.
“We are not looking at a great difference with statistics over the last month, the numbers are completely relevant,” he said to the Portal The Local.
The higher part of the cases in which people were estimated as the age of 18 are not required to indicate that refugees have been lying about their age.
In May, the Agency published 581 test results and reported that 442 cases “approximately the age of 18 years or more”.
However, in consideration of 581 published results, the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper found that in 243 cases the person openly stated that 18 were implemented in that year.
The method of medical assessment of the age in order to make the density and theography of colleagues and give them to the analysis of the donists and rentgenologists is also criticized in some instances.
One of the sceptics is the endocrinologist of the Carolin Institute of Crow Marcus, part of which the work is the evaluation of the biological impact of people in order to determine whether they have passed through sex or later normally.
“I had reasons to think about this, and I don't think that we should use the methods of measurement now.
Biological age is so uncertainly defined.
If we can't determine him with confidence, we don't have to do what we can," he said the Metro newspaper.
However, Gerancen of the judicial medicine has been expressed to the accuracy of the tests: “In general, it is possible to say that the risk of taking a child for adult child is wrong.
With the greatest risk we face when the person will be 18, in that case, he is about 10 per cent."
I'm thinking if I'll be balled at the president's position.
During the working journey in Burrastia, Putin was ready to consider whether it was able to be able to be paid at the President of Russia for elections in 2018, it was transmitted to the Interfax.

"Good, I think, thank you," said the President.

"If there are no heads, before the heads are far away, to the election campaign far," said Peter.

As the financial rules of the football are affected by the movement of Nepal to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unlimited costs from the European football clubs are not prevented by the world's transfer of Nemar from the Spanish Barcelone in the French "Sen-Germen".
Whatever the consequences could be further on the scene, for the "Sen-Jermen" Parri of the WEF, the Director of the European football Authority, whose authority prohibits the teams to participate in the prestigious tourism League Championship.
According to the financing "fair-pay" rules introduced by WEFA in 2011, the PSJ should finally be shown that Naimar's transfer was financed without a large loss.
Barcellone paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) only for the release of Brazilians from the contract, and Nepal will receive punishment for tens of $1,000 per year.
There are some financial aspects of the movement of Nepal to France.
The “PSJ” may be precisely disappointed to take Nemar and add it to the galactics of other stars, if you consider the financing of the team from the rich energy of Catar's legal family.
The clubs have the right to expend large amounts to purchase players, but they should be balanced in terms of legal income sources to achieve rentabilities in their football business.
“FFP” entered Michel Platin after his election by President WEFA in 2007.
The former French footballist believed that the clubs used in major debts in their efforts to achieve, in general, jury, and risked disaster if banks or owners stopped financing.
In 2011, the FFP stopped focusing on club debts and turned into follow-up to their losses.
As a result of the change in the business model, which Roman Abamorvic was used in Chelsea in 2003, was to buy a club with good capacity, and then to be seriously costed to improve the team and establish a worldwide bread, as a difficult plan.
During the current third year of the 2018 evaluation, clubs may lose 30 million euros.
And despite the struggle of Platinus from the Presidential post in 2015, his predecessor in WEFA Alexandre Chaferin is still decisively urged to keep excessive costs.
“The FFP is alive, and we will move forward to the rules,” said the Association Press Agency last week, André Traverso, who controlled the FFP in WEFA.
The “PSD” would and will pay the purchase of the Nymar contract at one time, it may be able to distribute the amount for all the terms of its contract.
Nymar signed the five-year treaty, so that the transfer value can be shown in an annual accounting as the cost of 44.4 million euros during the next five years.
During the first wave of the FFP sanctions in 2014 to the “PHD” and to the belonging Abu Daby, Manchester City, were applied to serious sanctions.
The “PSD” was established in 60 million euros (82 million dollars), which later was reduced to 20 million euros, and was required to limit its composition in the Champion League during the 2014-1015 session 21 players instead of ordinary 25.
EDF is monitoring clubs that may try to overcome its financial inspections by developing their income from the club owners.
The Catar Company would be able to fund the GSP, but if the amount of financing would be higher than the standard market estimates, the WEFA would not allow it to be considered legal income.
That happened in 2014, when WEFA decided that the amount of financing “PSD” by the Catar Tourism Office was dismissed.
It was reported that the part of the Nymar's shipping in the SPS could be paid as a payment by the organizational Championship of the World Champion in Catare 2022.
But “PSJ” and Catar-2022 refused that Nemar will become a world championship, and such a maneuver could easily find WEF inspectors.
The last sanctions imposed on the CPS mean that WEFA will be more careful to follow any attempt to comply with the rules.
As reported on the fourth persons with the situation, WEFA did not have a preliminary discussion with the Nymar transfer.
They communicated with the Association of Press with an anonymous conditions, since they were not authorized to discuss the situation of the PHJ.
According to the latest report, the EUR 542.4 million had been reached in 2015-1016 CPS over 10 million.
The accounting for the last financial year is not yet published.
“PSJ” expects that Nymar's arrival will be a favourable mail for the Panzer shops, sell attributes and footballs with the team logotype.
The club predicts that the traffic will grow as a minimum of 30 per cent because of the new player.
The fact that one of the best footballists was dealing with the Spanish flags tried to prevent Naimar's transfer, claiming that “PHJ” would violate the financial fair-bearing.
“ This apparent case of the “financing duty”, with the club and the state,” stated the Spanish newspaper “AS” President La Liga Havier Tebas, which means that the final owner of the PSJ is Katar.
Arsenal trainer Arsen Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sporting magnet, shares the doubt of La Liga about the financing of the State club.
“ This is all the results of the fair participation, and it has completely changed random football over the past 15 years,” said the Wenger Friday.
"When the club belongs to the country, maybe everything.
It is very difficult to comply with the financial fair, since the country may have a lot of ways and a lot of reasons for being presented by such a serious player.
The President will determine the order and location of the provision of sentences
Where and as new Russian citizens will be attributed to the FEF, the President will determine the second amendments to read in the relevant law developed by the Committee on Legislation and Guests.
Another week ago, the deputy planned to determine the order for sentences in the law.
From the provision of the treaty clamp will be released to 18 years of age, as well as inadmissible, the amended text in the draft "RF Citizenship" (e.g. in the "Edition"), which will consider the Committee on 11 July before reading at its second meeting.
The idea of introducing sentences in the entry to RF, instead of the formal signing of documents by President Vladimir Putin, supported 6 June during the meeting with the Vichelai Voluntana.
The deputy made this idea as an amendment to the second reading in the draft legislation, which provides for the cancellation of the citizenship of those who later have been condemned for a number of crimes of terrorist or extremist nature: for example, for public calls to terrorism or its public adjustment in media or Internet (e.g., p. 2205.2 CFR) and for the shock of aircraft, train or water transport, but only if the act is related to terrorism (art.
According to the draft legislation, the log of it was the same: by formulating documents to citizenship, a person is signed under the promise to comply with the Russian legislation - instead of extremism, he violates this promise.
The draft law was introduced in April by the leaders of the thinking fractions of Vladimir Vasiliv (Russia), Gennadei Zugan (CPF), Vladimir Jillini (LDD), Sergey Miron (Russian Jurisdictional) and the GD Wachelalawin.
On May 19, the deputy adopted it in the first reading.
Last week, the Committee on Hospitalization and Legislation adopted the text of draft legislation to second reading, but now it has been reprocessed again.
It now states that the order for sentences will establish the President of RF.
The parliamentarys had to describe the procedure directly in the Act of the FIR Citizenship, which stated that the ceremony should be in the trading condition before the public herb and the Russian flag in the presence of the representative of the MDM.
However, the text of the draft legislation was not understood where such events should be held - a list of places where the RF herb may be placed, regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
They include courts, heads of heads of subsidiary offices, municipal education, courts, prosecutors, heads of the executive authorities, etc.
It would be likely to be the CASs.
To make a trading clamp that wishes to obtain RF citizenship will be after the officials check their documents.
However, the Russian passport will receive only after a sentence, it should be made out of the document.
A week ago, the project said that the sentence should be before the signing of the statement.
The updated text indicates that Russia will be sentenced since 18 years, not from 14 years.
The rule for which sentences will be released to unacceptable or limitedly deficiencies, as well as those who cannot make it possible to read, read or ownerally sign the sentences.
Furthermore, President RF has the right to free from this procedure and "persons",
In the updated legislation, also, the special order of acceptance of the Russian citizens, which are considered by Russian portraits.
They should be officially rejected from the Ukrainian citizenship, providing the relevant statement to the Ukrainian Authority.
The notified copy of the declaration must be sent to Russian officials.
It is not necessary for the "human" citizenship, as well as now, if it is prescribed by an international treaty or if it is not possible "in the power of those who are not defeated from the reason".
The corresponding amendment to the law proposed a group of deputy, among which the first Vice-Vice-Vice-GD Ivan Meller (CPF), the Natalia of Pole, Paul Crashiningers and Irat Farkhov (the only Russian) were.
I think many of you know that you get the help with Ukrainian in reality, just impossible.
Consequently, many people are waiting for a decision on the CF citizenship, explaining the head of the thinking Committee on Hospitalization and Legislature Paul Crashiningers (ER).
Furthermore, the text indicated that the limitation of certain jobs for foreigners would not be distributed to those who were writtenly rejected from the "now" citizenship and made passports in Russia, but "not depending on the reasons of it" had remained to be considered citizens of another country.
Foreigners are now prohibited to employ municipal service posts, to work on objects and organizations related to Russia's security.
Any person with double citizenship or a type of residence in another country cannot be a deputy of the Hospital or a member of the Federation Council.
It is planned that the law should enter into force since 1 September 2017, at that time the necessary signs should be prepared.
Notturgy is the "Chark of America's flight" and "Detective Train"
The current history of a newspaper recalls the glorious days of the 80s; the era of the grain in the 1990s (or mostly when the masters of David Wayne and Michael Schwoalter made the committee of the sketch for MTV); and it was about 2001 before her stars, as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Pauller and Pole Rad had been transferred to more serious news.
As cultural facts, it is the increase and enhancement of our epoch with its permanent memories of Facebook.
But as Francis, she seems to be an analysis.
The "First Day of the camp" was a good surprise, not only because of the absudist humor (including the original history of the speaking of the Forest Bank, heard by H. John Benjamin).
The result is the main shock: Middle age actors play sexually worried children who have only achieved the age of perfection, and they are not able to return to a part of the shock.
"Tween years later," where adults were already playing, they have less deep emotional roots, and their parity is more unsystemized and includes the rifs of the Starker films of the 90s-year-old Roke.
In one episode, Apple Powerbook, four rodlicks and some other things since 1991.
Many of the sudden steps are the same.
Welcome Kup (Shooter), now a writer, has not yet been obtained by Caty (Margerite Moro).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't disappeared with girlhood.
And there is still a ridiculous and suburb conspiration in which Ronald Reagan (such as Shawlter), which is now stressed by George Bush-older (experienced couple in the implementation of Michael Yan Blake).
As always, the best part of the Francis is a disappearance from it.
Specially pleased to see a young Rada, who makes the song of Matthew Dillon from the Odiaches, whose old man, an old man, now looks old.
The success of this Francis could be the caselessness in the spirit of the recursive Seven Up series until I think that it would be the logical conclusion of her: "World American flight: twenty years later," where the company had been in the last scene to film the Golden American flight."
The "detective" in Amazon is called to another type of newspapers: remembering the cold war from the Americans, the "Strong Brondy" or even the "Black" with its shapes of the East and West.
The committee created by Brian Gattoud and Alexandro Tanack with the register Rizm Thomas is a television: the Rumanian Police Drama of the 80s on two polices in Buharрест, who are fighting for the truth, the atheism and the Marxist-Lean.
The main roles of Gregor and the idealist Josefa are executing Florin Piersik and Cornelly Urich and heard their English dialogues in Channing Tatuum and Joseph Gordon Lewit.
That's a ridiculous idea.
But just a idea.
There are several visual shocks (the police shocks have time to look at the shocks, as Americans could look at a football).
The chairman vote team, including Jenny Slett, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevini, allows us to play interestingly in the "smell of the voice".
But "detective" is so holding for the deceased propagandistic drama -- there's even a killer in the rock mask of Ronald Reagan, which often looks like it.
Six long episodes are broken, and it is not very common.
If it would be slowly done, "Detektive" could be better to do with her stiror in the spirit of a agepropa; for example, when Gregor and Joseph come to the American community, two sweet men are sitting in the Wednesday.
This image of the Communist says that the western culture is possible from which to be grained.
We do so even with our recent history and with them.
The original fund for Russian Supercube for football between Spartack and Lockomotive is 30 million rubbers.

England's bank maintains rates at 0.25 per cent
It is expected that the Bank of England later announces that percentage rates are not changed after a weak economic growth and a deterioration inflation have been made to highlight the earnings of the possible improvement.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth remains unreasonable and left percentage rates without changes in the increased pressure on family income.
The Commission's monetary and framework policy specialists (MPC) voted with 6 against 2 per cent for the maintenance of rates at 0.25 per cent in this month, with less number of members of the Committee ' s rates, as a weak economic growth was decreased.
In its quarter report, bank inflation was limited to the increase of 1,7 per cent in 2017 and 1,6 per cent in 2018 and warned that the pressure on family income continued, while still expected that inflation is up to 3 per cent.
However, the bank warned that the increased rates in the next few years would be necessary to control the inflation brochure, and said that business costs may be stronger than expected for financial markets.
The members of the Committee also promulgated to reject the part of the public comprehension of economic development, which has been implemented a year ago, as a result of the bracelet.
From February next, the bank will close the urgent financing plan for which it provides low credits to banks, although he reported that it would now be in the framework of the plan to provide more than 15 billion feet, up to 115 billion feet.
In the bank decision protocol, “in accordance with the main predictions of the MPC, the growth of the currency internal product (WFP) remains slow while the pressure on real income continues to affect consumption”.
On the basis of the tax, he repeated that to stop the inflation, the “unnecessary relief of financial policy” was needed in“no more” size than the market expected.
At this time, the markets provide the first increase in the third fourth next year and another in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all increases will be “progressive” and “limited”.
Bank proposals for increase in this and the next year below than the projects made in May, which were equal to 1,9 per cent and 1,7 per cent.
Bank left its instinct prognosis in 2018 to 1.8 per cent.
After the news, the sterling falled in relation to the dollar and the euro.
Fund fell to 0.5 per cent to 1.31 US dollars and 0.4 per cent to 1.11 euros.
The decision was not to change the rate after the recent inutilities of growth were expected to increase, and GDP increased by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter of 0.2 per cent in the past three months.
According to the representative of the bank, the growth, judged overall, remains at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, although the end of the year is little.
The last report of the inflation bank was fewer for the joy of households affected by high inflation and very few increases in the payment payment: according to the bank's words, pressure will be increased before being reduced.
Bank added that the financial policy “not can prevent” the wages in the next few years, but expected that payments would be “important” to the end of his three-year predict.
Economics also have increased resulting in the growing demand of British products resulting from a low-fund rate of fund, which compensates part of the lower consumer costs.
The decision was adopted a year after the rates were reduced in August last by 0.25 per cent after the shocking results of the shocking ratings from Europe.
According to the evaluation of the bank, it may be necessary for four years to make full impact on prices and economy.
Before the bank has made its last tax decision, the sound of the expected increased rates grew, since the inflation has increased the pressure of home households: three specialists asked to increase rates up to 0.5 per cent in July.
In the last month, inflation has fallen up to 2.6 per cent from 2.9 per cent in July, although the bank reported that the fall was expected and reimbursed in the next months.
According to the bank, the higher indicator compared to the planned 2% is the result of a low amount of fund.
Andrew Montreak, Director of Epothetical Brothers of Coreko, said: “If you take account of the recent decline of sweet rates, it will be more competitive, since creditors require business opportunities and account for a good year.
The line seems particularly favorable for those who are close to the end of their existing treaties, as the refinancing of credits, often with the possibility of lack of the Commission, and with a low rate, becomes popular as ever."
The State Health Service writes the controversy of HIV 10000
Since September, patients will be accessed to the "revolutionary" preparation for HIV prevention after fighting in the High Court on the financing of preparation from the State Health Service.
The National Health Service announced that the pre-positional prevention of HIV (PRIP), the treatment taken before the sex, which was proved to reduce the risk of infringement in persons in the risk group, at average 86 per cent, will now be provided for health services during the initial three-year test period of approximately 100,000 people.
She agreed to finance the test after the Appeal Court supported the decision of the High Court in the past year, in which the National Health Service claimed that there was a possibility to pay the PRI, despite its statement that it had to finance local authorities.
The step announced in Friday was called the President of the National Health Service of England Simon Stevens, and the National Monitoring Office of the Distribution of AIDS (NAT) was called it as a “return moment”.
Before the full launch of the program throughout England to April 2018, the venerological diplomas in London, Briton, Manchester, Liverpool and Shefffield will start registering people, and more distributors will be joined in October.
Pre-Positional prevention (PRP) is the rate of HIV preparations that were taken before the sex to reduce HIV infection risk.
As shown in the study, PEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infringement among people in the risk group.
In receipt of the PRI before sex in the human body, the sufficient number of preparations specified to prevent HIV infection.
Such preparations can be taken daily or not after two hours before sex.
Patients with the right to prepare are homosexual and biological men, transgenders and people who have HIV position and have not been successfully treated.
Dispansors will take appropriate participants agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgenders and persons whose partners are unknown, whether their HIV status of antiretroviral therapy is detained.
Persons who live and applies to the doctor ' s general practice in England will also be able to make a request for potential participation in the nearest venerological diploma that takes part in the programme.
The programme will be 10 million feet, and the National Health Service of England this week after the International Tanner to purchase was signed by the Preparatory Treaty.
A study was built in order to assess all the Clean data possible for the collection of Clinical data about whom is the objective of the preparation, its reliability and use.
“ This important renewment should be added and strengthened by broader and successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It was another centuries of more than three decades of success against one of the largest threats to health, with which humanity has occurred.
Debora Gold, President of the NAT (National AIDS Distribution Control Management), said: “This is a turning point in combating HIV.
The PRP, if it is grammatly emphasized to people who need assistance and risks, will enable to change the situation of HIV epidemia in England.
Since September, people in the HIV risk group, through this study carried out in England for the National Health Service, will receive access to the new open-ended resources that could be used by the person to control himself, without discussing this with a partner that will lead to improvement in many lives.
We welcome this news.
Jan Green, President of the Terrence Higgins Fund, said: “The first time, it is to be worried about the testing of the country, and that no one of the HIV risk groups should be forgotten.
Now, when we are providing an experimental PRP, we go to protect more than 10000 HIV risks.”
Sheron Hodgeson, the Deputy Minister of Public Health, said: "We are very welcome to the start of the PEP test, which has been very delayed for months and delays from the Government."
Data shows how revolutional this prepatrie could become as part of our approach to prevent HIV and stop transfer of this year's infection.
This test approaches us to a step to a comprehensive understanding of the PES' advantages.
It is now important that the test is as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people in the HIV risk group and to continue to step up to the end of the dissemination of HIV in society.

According to the document, he had played a positive role in the Etnulturn, Social and Social Development of Tataristan and the Russian Federation in general.
The treaty between Moscow and Kazania since 24 July 2007 was arrested for 10 years.
On 11 July, the Chairman of the Tataristan requested the President of Russia to extend the agreement and to maintain the name of the head of the region.

In Russia, there were difficulties in receiving international driver rights
AIDS units have experienced the deficit of international driver certificates.
In order to obtain such rights, a few weeks should be waiting for a real problem for departures who want to go to the border on their car or take it there.
It should be noted that the situation with international driver certificates remains contrary.
IWU was introduced in order to understand more about the national certification, as the information is explained in five languages.
The requirements for international rights are recorded in the Vienna Convention on Road Movement in 1968, but in countries ratified by the Vienna Convention, Russian rights are also recognized.
However, it depends on the specific police or prosecution contracts, and some of them require an OMI and some of the sufficient national rights.
In order to be affected, international rights drivers are still obtained, but it should be taken into account that the authority of non-ratifying countries (e.g., United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) should not be acknowledged by national rights or undertakings.
There is now a problem with the blocks of almost all the HIBD units, reports "Commerceng", conducting research in a number of regions.
Yes, in Moscow's units, there's only four months of HHID tanks.
It can be recorded at the hostage site, but there is a shooting in the middle of August.
In the Krusoisk IU, it is not possible to get "for technical reasons", without details, the Samaritan area says honestly that there is no blocks, the same situation is also in other cities.
Many of the mosquitos have already been discussed with the problem, and the following communications are often often available in the communitys:
Irina Burmistrova: "Remember why Moscow cannot obtain international rights?"
That is right, because all the HID offices have finished the blue.
Elena Podkolzina:
The international law must be obtained urgently.
In Moscow, it's always a long time to get away, it's not going to get out of the bathrooms (which there is but it can't give it).
The portal of the hospital shows that in Spb's time is free to the floor.
Have anyone been worried about receiving another city?
Does it work?
As explained in MWF, the requirements for international driver certificates have changed, so the Hosaut Inspection Unit has implemented new blocks.
This may be related to the deficit, in fact, unexpectedly what changes have been made before.
Blocky purchases the Centre for Trade Safety (SCN BD) and then sets them into the HIDD unit.
In the last few years, all contracts were with AO Gonzak: almost 2000,000 MWB blogs were made in 2014-2015, 150,000 blocks were purchased in 2016, and 900,000, but the last contract was concluded with OOO on 18 July 2014 for the production of 70 000 blocks.
There's a version that the CIA just didn't sleep at the time, because of the deficit.
However, there are other versions of lack of burns: because of the crisis, many people have become self-reaching to Europe, but in the more delicate Asian countries - China, Thailand, and so further.
What rights have been taken there, until the end is unexpected, therefore people and the people are overcome, and therefore a swimming demand on international shorts.
Recently it was known that professional drivers should be checked to confirm their qualification.
The proposal was made by Mintrance.
The new image of the International Driver Certificate (IWU) operates since 31 May 2011.
The Ministry of Justice refused to believe in the construction of the Cross Mosque
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine Paul Peter said that it would not believe in Russia’s ability to build a bridge in the Red.
On Thursday, 4 August, he said in the portal's interview.
There is no respecting international company, even a bottle or haech, because it is risking to lose its business on the EU, the United States, Japan, in countries joined against Russia's sanctions.
"There is, in my deep conviction, there is no prospect in this project", said Peter.
He added that Russia was not able to implement a large infrastructure project self-sufficiently.
Russia can not normally build smaller objects.
I know that after the Olimpiade in Sochi, the whole stadium began to be destroyed.
"I think that the best instrument in this situation is the sanctions against companies that were so inadequate to join this project," said the official.
On July 31, the buildings completed the shift of the Cross bridge.
The counterparty of the Cross bridge is completed on the shipment, which is situated at 45 meters (45 m) from the foundation of the construction.
"On timely motorists have prepared the installation on the swimming array faces", reported in the project centre.
In April, the president of Russia, who was President of the United States, informed the fact that the object was delayed by the graphic.
The Cruz Bridge is connecting the Cruz Metrostry and the Krusodaric Territories.
In Spain, an employee who had not been employed for 10 years
How should an angelic patient (or an absolute uninterference to the public service) be the Spanish chief of Carlos Resio?
The permanent passenger was slowed for 10 years.
However, Mr. Recio was still cut off.
But not his direct chief.
What isn't happening only in the Bureau world.
It seems like it's a long time to shoot all the shoes of the people.
However, the employees will always be surprised by those who live well.
On this occasion, "sensation" welcomed Spain.
There, the officer of the architecture, Carles Recio, died of the entire ten years of work.
In that regard, he regularly received forgiveness.
The total amount of EUR 500,000 per year.
And this is the wonderful time Mr. Recio.
He was authorized by the decision of the Valentia ' s legislative congregation.
The investigation discovered that the bad passenger was in office at 7:00 a.m. every morning to be seen in the electronic system.
And here he went home.
Once again, he appeared at 16.00 a.m. in order to see again in the system he left.
And that's 10 years.
It was also known that all the free time of the passenger was dedicated to the design of mixtures at home.
Now, the deputy of the Valencia Legislative Meeting thinks how Mr. Recio was a direct leader who couldn't know how to work actively on his workplace.
The judges proposed to protect the Presidents
The Presidential Council on Human Rights (HIV) on the Administration of Vulumir Putin has developed proposals for strengthening the judicial independence of the authority.
The CHR proposes to limit the power of the chairmans and to introduce their choice.
For the courts of appeal and cassation, the CSD wants to introduce special circuits that will not be involved in the administrative and terrorist delegation in the FF.
His proposals under the Presidential mandate should also be submitted by the Supreme Court.
The CDS concluded the development of proposals that will enhance the independence of Russian justice.
This work was held on the mandate of the Womim Putin, on 3 January 2017, which was given by the President after the meeting with the Council.
The meeting with members of the Council of 8 December 2016 was discussed, including individual cases of the court, as well as the issue of public control in the fields of citizens ' arrest (see " . 9 December).
The total work of the GDP has been 25 proposals for the protection of the independence of the courts and the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremelean rights defenders is the limitation of the powers of the chairmans to improve the independence of the other judges.
If the applicant has successfully passed the competitor and received support to the court community, the President of the Court of Justice must, in view of the CHR, submit it to appointment, without having the right to reject how this allows the law now.
It is also suggested that the Chairman ' s right is to distribute the cases to the courts.
This may, allow experts, a specially written computer program.
The CHR also believes that the Chairman is not "determining the results of the qualification of the judges, launching its responsibilities to discipline, to decide on establishing additional material payments".
The Chairman's Council considers that it is necessary to "sele the elections of judges by judges" and to "to give them powers to a relatively unsupportable period with compulsory ruling".
Now, all judge chairmans (for the Republic of the Republics to the districts) are appointed by the President for six years to submit the President of the Supreme Court of Justice.
In order to delay the judges from the pressure of regional administrations, the COP proposes to newly organize appeal and cassure in the courts of general law.
Their structure is now linked to the administrative and terrorist delegation in the FF.
The CHR states that "the organization of individual courts of appeal and cassation should not be at the level of administrative courts in RF-subjects, but in judicial areas."
Experts are based on the practice of arbitration courts.
There is a "judicial circle" which is not the administrative delegation in the RF but guaranteed by this large independence from regional officials who are difficult to use the Telephone Law.
The World Courts of the CPs proposes to strengthen the people's meetings in order to consider some of the civil and administrative affairs.
For example, the exemption of parents ' s rights, the recovery of work, the protection of honor and dignity, the deprivation of driving rights, etc.
"It's only our proposals," explained the members of the CHR, the judge of the Constitutional Court in the departure of the Mozambique Tamara.
She also recalled that the mandate of the President was not only Aids but also to the Supreme Court (US) who had not yet discovered its proposals.
The time for the implementation of the mandate of the CP (middle of the genprocurators and the Human Rights Authority) is still available.
To add the Volmier Putin on the effectiveness of the RF of independence of justice, the Chairman of Vichela Lebedev should take place until 1 September.
Living a high life: half of the designer and swimming accommodations have transformed this small apartment in Erls Cort in space housing
Joan Li, an ex-banker involving in movement, moved from a space home to a apartment in Erls Cort in 2014.
The Quarter is on the first stage of the sympathical home in the style of the Queen Anna, and in the benefit of the new design, he said that Joan has not collected its things and did not move again.
“ I lived with my former in Natsbridge in a larger range, ” says Joan.
“ I searched for something compared to my money.
I've shown this apartment in Eres Cort, and there were the same high shoes here.
I loved her and offered a price on the same day."
Since the first vision of the apartment, the area has transferred a full reconstruction to 1000 square feet.
It was originally a apartment with a complex bed – to get to bed, it was necessary to walk through the kitchen – and Joanna wanted to add spaces to store and half avail to survive the maximum use of the pool height.
“ I wanted high clouds, large windows, a lot of light.
That was my requirements," she says.
To this end, she started Erfan Azadi from the architectural design study in Notting-Hille to use the slope at 12,5 feet higher and to build a housing that would not only be a successful project but would be Joan for life.
It was not enough to build two places over one another, so the architectural task was to build a half where it could be full of growth.
Erphane had to think about creatively to handle the bridge.
“Labour with steady construction is very complicated” he explains.
“We had to make a place so that they could be on each other, and they should not be lost.
It was not just to build a simple platform, but to shoot construction so that they were at the right height and to allow the places above and down."
This decision allowed Erfan to establish two full-scale rooms above each other in an outstanding space – and much more interesting.
From half a midst, a medium light window from "Retrouvius" is opened up a view on a shift guest down.
The golden furniture, silver accents and winner machines from Serja Muya are designed.
The use of the mirror plays a role in adding tangibleness, space and light.
A short corner is covered with a mirror so that it's longer.
The grid protector panel seems to be a window in the other room.
In the entry of the scenarios, Joan's whole ships serve.
To create a more growing space, the beauty of a guest may be rewarded when it is not used.
There's nothing new in the kitchen.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it is a swimming door up like in the garage.
“There was an engineering art”, said Ertan about the armed shields of the shield door.
"He is sanctified by the opposite, so when you throw the door upward, it is very easy to swallow."
Thanks to the wise use of space and storage location, Joan received additional 16 square meters, additional bed and improved planning.
"In the end, the gender area is what you will sell, that is, what your inmobility is evaluated," says Ertan.
“Indeed, trade agents will enter and calculate on the basis of gender area.”
Here they have been able to increase the area of gender using quality materials that provide the space of the vegetable area.
“Matrial is what we're trumpling, so they're helping to create a emotional relationship with the house,” says Erfan.
“No one is loved by electrical guides in the walls.
It is important, but is not the strikes of our hearts."
This serves to witness that, according to the good design and the increased apartment, a apartment may normally become something tragic.
Indeed, like Joan, you can decide to stay.

The Wall Street Journal reported that the growth of consumer prices in G20 has reduced at least eight years in the last eight years, with reference to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
According to the OECD estimates, inflation rates in June 2016 were 2 per cent-lower in October 2009 when the price growth index reached 1.7 per cent.
Previously, Russia reported that the consumer price index was 0.1 per cent.
The State has thus fixed the first weekly deflation in 2017.

The fighters of the fighters are constantly communicated with each other on mobile phones, and they do not know it in the stages.
The U.S.U. and Donbass and the officials have established social phone communications from their high command.
This reported on 4 August, "Strana.ua" with a reference to the military operation participants in Donbass.
According to publications, the office teams have well known the names of their colleagues with the anti-powered front and communicate every day on their phones.

The results of such discussions are a part of the transition to a certain part of the front.
Journalists were informed of the cases when the welcome of a birthday was received from the front line of their formal enemy.

IMD has delayed the locking of UNDP statements on RF Attacks
In the Russian external government, individual diplomatic representatives are displaced by the United Nations statements of the Union in the press condemned by the RF Ambassador in Syria.
This reports the Russian Middle East.
The State recalled that the Russian police territory in Damaskus, 2 August, was a third-party shooting shot by terrorist groups Haat Tahrir Ash-Sham (the former Jabhat An-Nuzra, prohibited in RF) and Philelack Ar-Rahman.
Bearing in mind that the international community in the qualification of Nizzar as a terrorism organization, and UNSB resolution called on to oppose this structure, the MID RF noted that " would say that the terrorists of Nicera should meet a comprehensive and decisive condemnation, and in evaluations against diplomatic representatives there should be no duality".
However, as noted in the diplomacy, "the third time in the month, the United States, Britain, France and Ukraine, in the United Nations Security Council, was worthy of the explanations of the tonicity, covering the absence of information, blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to adopt a standard declaration of the Security Council for pressing a terrorist attack against the Russian diplomatic capital."
The desire to demonstrate diplomatic solidarity with us remains aware of these delegations.
“Arely that the incapacity of the Security Council to condemn the acts of terrorism is to promote them to new invasions and terrorists, give them feeling impunity” said in the MID, and added that “not wants to be created in these barriers to believe that someone in the Security Council with them.”

In May, a investigation was made by the President of Russia, Boris Tito, on the order of the Ombudsman, which was found that it had actually been replaced by the immediate planned checks (for the increased 21.9 per cent in 2015 to 30.8 per cent in 2016), the prosecutors (from 16.9 per cent to 21.8 per cent), the raids (of 7,9 per cent to 13.3 per cent), as well as citizens' declaration checks (augmentation from 15 to 19.5 per cent) and administrative investigations (10.8 to 15.5 per cent).

Brothers are fighting for the immobility of more than $500 million
Two brothers are fighting for one of the largest in Victorian Empires in trade in an inmobility of more than 500 million dollars, 40 years after their Italian predecessors were based on the dinastic.
The former director of the football club Carlton and Coun de Lucis are living in the gate of Turk through three doors from his young brother Paul, who gave it to the Supreme Court for ownership and assets.
Paul wants to go out of the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court has been a terrible dispute on divorce conditions.
Nevertheless, with her mother, Anna’s brothers owned 87 more than half-millionary dollars since their family purchased a shop in Smit-strate in Collingua in 1973.
The family was based on the Westco Jeans company, which has grown into the network of 160 trade points.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
Days were introduced in movement, and the list of families of De Lucis includes the official buildings today in Brussels and Sorrento, the apartments in the Zone Area, and in Maunt-Buller and the commercial centres in rewards.
According to the agreement with the dead father of Cole, Paul, whose family De Lucis describes the "governmental power and home personality" of the family, belongs to about two thirds of the company assets, and Paul is about one third.
According to the court, it means that the property of the curnae is 316 million and Pole is 176 million.
Department of property and money became for the Paul of the Confusion Steel.
"The Razdel proposed to give him, at my view, the best part of the ownership", he wrote in his first statements in 2015.
On Thursday, after a few unsuccessful attempts of reconciliation, the first hearing was held at the Supreme Court.
Brothers are now talking about whom will control the existing business, from which Paul's views have been excluded.
Colin claims that it is not true but accused of Paul to the incompetent management of some objects.
In the indications shown by the previous process, it is hoped that conflict permission is accepted.
"My Italian roots impose me to consider the family as the top priority," he wrote.
Judicial expenditure is grown as a dark com: hundreds of pages of indicators, electronic letters and reports such as Deloite, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer; both of the most famous lawyers, including the Queen Advocate Allan Mayersa, and the best stricts.
Ms. De Lucis and her dead mate Louisi were immigrants from Italy, since the end of the 1950s they managed milk bars and gastronoms, and bought a shop in Brussels at the beginning of the 1970s.
Under financial guarantees, they purchased a market in Collingvud, where the first family shop was opened by Jins.
Colin said he started Westco when he was "the last school class, and Paul was a boy (approximately 10 years)."
Anna De Lucis said that they and Louise who died in 2012 were expected to transmit their possession to children without conflict.
"Luidy often told me that he didn't want the brothers to be judged," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are not included in the De Lucis Group; when he says that Mark received 10 million people when he was out of the business and 26 million Luke.
According to Paul, and Luke, and Mark were “unpleasantly satisfied with the financial conditions of their office.”
Colin was not a public figura, although it was an ex-member of the AFL Club Directors Board and, as published in 2015, Eddie McGir, the best friend of the TV.
Ferfax Media was connected to Colin and Paul and their lawyers.
He just answered the text message that, because the case wasn't considered in the court, "I haven't really nothing to say."
"I'm very sorry that my brother Paul decided to make me search and strike in the court name of our family," he wrote.
Colen wrote in the midday 2016 that he tried to meet the brother's requirements.
"Our father wouldn't want to see Paul and I'm going to fight in the court," he said, "they still hopes to resolve the conflict."
On Thursday, this hope seems to be divorced.
"Our case will soon be issued by the court," wrote Cole.
The new chapter of the Trampa Agency plans to limit the income of information to the President.
Others tried to do this and lose the phenomenon.
Maybe John F. Kelly's really gonna get it.
In that case, he will be first.
Political reports that the new head of the White House Avenue plans to limit the flow of information to President Trampou, including the newspapers from the media, is hoped to keep the chief in a more calm state.
That's what the reporter Josh Douzzi reports.
"In the meeting of the new head of the White House John F. Kelly with the machine leadership at his first working day, he marked the main problem in the Belarus house at President Donald Tramp, which he hopes to solve: the bad channels of information to the President. "
Kelly said to the staff that information should be through it, in a paper or in a briefing, because the President would be better to make decisions if he would get the right information.
The Diagnes Kelly is perfectly faithful, but others have already suffered the failure by trying to die to Trampa, following the income of information to him.
The relationships of President Trampa with television have been placed a few decades ago, and now, when he is at the Belarus house, his appeal to watch television is still strong.
"When Trump, being candidate, was useful to demonstrate him that he had received a fair light in the publications that could be brought to death," said in February, "Political" Sam Nanberg, former election stage adviser.
Tara Palmeri then wrote to the Politico that "as the words of six former members of the electoral stage to keep the Traampa's identity control in Twitter, it was necessary to follow that the information of him was a permanent flow of loving."
Okay.
But the idea that Trampa's appeal to write to Twitter was never under control, it's just funny.
Maybe these members of the election stage know something we don't know, for example, that if not, the Twitters would have been more invasive.
We may never know about the Twitters that Tramp has not published.
If his staff were safeguarded by distresss, though several times, their efforts were not stressed.
But no one has always been able to keep the trumpet from the shield of oil in the fire.
Some of the problems are that the Belarus house, shared in confronting fractions, has always tried to extend its agenda by the Trempous material is reliable or not, which confirms their views.
"Political" - as once to this story - wrote in May on the tendency of the advisers to continue to accompany the President of doubts.
This is one example described by the reporter Shane Goldmacher:
" The current and former Trampa staff said that Trump could react very closely to press reports, especially with dangerous information losses, and is not concerned until he finds who stands behind them.
This happened at the end of February when someone sent the President on the article with GotNews.com, the website of Charles K. Johnson's web advisor, whose head of the Catty Walsh was accused that she was "to be in the Belarus house."
It is not important that Johnson is permanently engaged in Twitter for aggressive behavior that he did not present specific facts or that in the past he had made false accusations and then rejected them.
Tramp read the article and asked the Walsh staff."
Goldmacher adds that then the head of the Rains Camp and the secretariat Robb Porter had tried to build a system to manage the tramp flow and document them.
How did that work?
Three months later, Kelly tried to do the same.
It may be more effective as a Manager than Anbous, but Trampa continues to have an impulsory nature, and his assistants are still fighting for the influence of each other.
These continuous factors make Kelly's task very difficult.

Italy is already a ton for NGO ships saving migrants.
Italy warned NGOs belonging to the Mediterranean Mediterranean that they would not be able to continue to work if they were not subject to new rules that regulate their activities.
"If NGOs are not subject to the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they can continue their activities", said the Ministers of Interview of the Tourism daily newspaper.
The warning of Minniti was on the next day after the Italian authorities confidenced a vessel belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rettet, as suspected that his equipament actually cooperates with traffickers and facilitates illegal immigration.
The civilian organization, which was working throughout the year, rejected comments on the existence of detailed accused to it against the Italian Prosecutor Ambredjo Cartocio.
"The salvation of human life is and remains the top priority, so we are very regretted that we cannot continue to work in the search and salvation zone," says the organization in the community.
"We can assess all the accused today only after we collect all the information and assess the situation."
Italian authorities follow the Jugend Rettet court from October.
His equipment suspected that the whole savings ships had taken on the board of migrants whose trafficking were directly sent to them and allowed contractors to go together with ships that they could re-use again.
As at least one of the meetings is expected, there was a total of 1,3 miles from the Libyan border, which is declared in the material of accused which the content was published in Italian media.
The Equipage is suspected in violation of the requirements of Italian coastal authorities that control saving operations in the area, above all, from humanitarian race than any other motivation.
The code of conduct provides, mainly, that the court type of the United States will have the board of the Italian police officer, which will follow their activities.
As long as only three of the nine NGOs participating in search and saving operations agreed to subscribe the Code of Saving Childs, the Malta MOAS and the Pro-Activa Exposed Training from Spain.
The latter stated on Friday that the new rules were not necessary but acceptable, provided that they do not affect any "important changes or grounds" to its saving operations.
Among those who refused to sign are and have received the Nobel Premier Organization for Disabled Drugs (MSF).
As a result, Minniti said that the slight reduction in the last weeks of migrants reached in Italy as a result of savings operations indicated that the efforts to support the liquid sea protection and cooperation with the local seamers have produced fruits.
"In the last days we started seeing light at the end of the tunnel," said Minister.
He reported on further negotiations with the Libyan Mares on economic development initiatives and Chad, Nigeria and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants left by these countries in hope to reach Europe.
"In Libya, we don't want to associate any of the conflict."
The RF authorities recently intensified their policy on liquid direction, and visits in Moscow participated in the anti-liby combating delegations.
Head of the Russian contact group on internal settlement with RF and Hosidee, Head of the Chinese Republic of Lev Daygov, said what ' s goal is to be pursued by Moscow in the region and to whom the rates are taken.
About the Libyan contact group, which you call, almost nothing knows.
Here, let's say, the Ukrainian contact group is all about it.
And here's the weight of secrets.
What are you doing, and what are your goals?
The Contact Group was established under the RDF initiative and the State thoughts.
Her activities were smoking by the Minister of Foreign Affairs Mikhail Goddan and Adam Delimano (deputy Duma from Chechnie. - " ✔ " ).
The last authorized to work in a liquid direction by the Vichela Voluntana.
The group was a detention in the Russian Dancer in Libya, the Mechanic Chabotarev (in September 2015, 11 persons were on board. - ✔).
We thought about how to help the equipage.
Then, a group of military specialists, representatives of the Hospital, has also been established to support the Chief of Channie Ramzan Kadirros.
How did you get it?
As I worked in Libya since 2008, I have called on a proposal for the group's work.
Our activities were not limited to the freedom of marine from the Cheboterarea Mechanic.
We have been able to establish contacts with representatives of all the main groups that are opposed to each other in the Libyan conflict, and from the third part of the Tripolis, where the United Nations recognized Government, head-in-law Fais Sarajem. - ō) and Tobrook (the parliament resident, which opposes the Government and supports the Haphtar Marshall, which controlled the Eastern Libya regions. - " ✔ " .
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Methyg (Vice-Premier Libya, " у"), we were able to agree quickly on the release of Russian marine.
Then it was decided to make a contact group more effectively.
Its task is analysis of circumstances, identifying key factors and players, dialogue with all the parties of the conflict.
I would like to emphasize: In Libya, we do not want to associate with any of the conflict sides, we conduct dialogue with all.
How many are in the contact group and how many of them are constantly in Libya?
The contact group now includes five people.
Among them are people who have experiences in force structures, including the Ministry of Defence.
We also want to integrate a group of experts in the region, representatives of the Instituto of the Middle East of the RAN.
There is no one in Libya until we have no need.
If there are Russian military advisers in Libya now, instructors.
And if so, who's on the side?
Russian military specialists in Libya aren't.
All conversations and publications of this are not real.
But in your contact group, the former soldiers have...
Yeah, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit the warm point.
Or closed to a certain time for us by the city, such as the Misurerate (which is based on the execution offices playing the role of the Level leader of Muammar Kadafi in 2011 and was significantly actived in the following years. - " _ " .
We came to Missouri in January this year.
We were scared, they said you were all the Islamics, terrorists.
But it was important for us to evaluate the circumstances there, to analyze the real military capacity that responds to the reason why these ears to the role of Islamics.
In the Misulate, we met all representatives of the IH destruction in Syria (in December 2016, this city was slaughtered in the Mediterranean Valley of Russia ' s banned state ' s Islamic State ' s.).
We wanted to see them, to meet these people, to check the information that they have played a decisive role in the destruction of the IH in Libya, not Kalifa Haphtar, which was attributed to them.
What outcome did you come to?
Is the Islamic State in Libya won't Haphtar?
He didn't do this.
Haphtar has performed another front in Bengasi.
And with the IH in Syria, the structures undergoing to the Government in Tripoli were fighting.
And on the other hand, we invited people to Russia to conduct this anti-terrorism operation.
And they came - visited from 19 to 23 April this year, the Little delegation adopted in the Federation Council, Douma, MIT and Russia.
You have understood that you are in all the Libyan regions and you probably represent local elites and field teams.
How do you think you can implement a war stop agreement, the elections reached at the end of July at Halifa Haphtar and Fais Saraj at the end of July?
Or how has this been once again happened in the past, will agreements be struck, war action will be renewed, and the parties will try to take the authority unilaterally?
For us, a good signal was that Sarah and Haftar agreed to a regular meeting, not so long it was impossible.
In the past recently, both leaders were extremely negatively reacted to each other.
What about Russia's position...
Many believe that Moscow is actively supported by Haphtar.
We faced this situation when we were in Misulate, and Haphtar was just on this day on the Russian aircraft board "Admiral Kuzzz".
It was a convergence.
But they did not believe in the Misulate.
We said, "You must be very brave people that have come to us today."
But our task is as to show that we are not only supporting Haphtar, we lead to dialogue with all key parties to the conflict in Libya.
You've been talking to Haphtar.
Does it facilitate understanding with Russian partners at human and emotional level that he has learned two times in the SSSS?
And, of course, do Haphtar know Russian language?
He's Russian if he knows, it's very relative.
But what he has learned is, of course, helping dialogue with him.
And among others, not only with him.
When we communicate with militarys in Tripoli and Misulate, we meet generals who have learned in Russia or still in the Council.
And here they're beautifully talking about Russians.
And they go to Russia, and somehow they're experienced by it.
Do you read the possible abolishment of the armed hamburger in relation to Libya?
Are you interested in your Little Countries for Russian weapons?
Of course, but, as I already said, we do not act in this conflict with some of the parties and would not want to weapon one another to harm others.
We would like to be closely in equal positions.
With regard to the armed embargo, the liquidists are constantly calling for Russia to make it possible.
The Constitution process is now active in Libya.
We hope that the parties will go to compromise decisions and that internal consensus will be achieved.
Then the elections should be held at Saraja and Haphtar's meeting.
If elections are held and finally elected to the legitimate authority (who there is no part of that status), the United Nations Council may ask for the removal of a weapon embargo.
To put this issue now indecisive and danger, it will only lead to the scanning of the conflict.
On the day of the media, Italy, who had faced the problem of African refugees, has felt that he was able to be able to judge EU-unions.
Can Moscow help Italian partners in this situation by using their link to liquors?
What, for example, is the option that the Haftary offices will install the border control and put the end of the business of immigrant contractors in Europe?
A very time question.
We're active about this.
Italians need to support Russia, since Moscow has conducted dialogue with Haphtar and Sarajeh and the Misulat and the Southern country at the same time.
And in this regard, the tribes play in the south of Libya, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is that what the Southern ones want to press the migration flows on further attacks?
I mean, likely, the bus were cut back, where Nigerian migrants come from?
We're trying.
But it's not simple.
Some clans and groups are interested in continued walking.
We hope that we join the South in the negotiation process between Saraja, Haphtar and the southern tribes.
But for the beginning, we would like to see the only view on this issue between Haphtar and Saraje.
The head of the Government in Tripoli Fais Saraji is considered Islamic, a stakeholder of the country ' s standards.
How radical is it?
Is that not an obstacle to Russia or West?
I will express my own view of it.
In my view, he opposed the radical Islam.
But the Islamics are in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself holds the position that Libya must be a absolute normal country - a deadly Islamic, open peace.
He is also actively fighting terrorists.
Where does he have such a reputation?
It has been established by countries that are not interested in Russia's communication with the Tripolis.
Tripoli is a capital, and there is legislative, executive and judicial authority.
There is a national oil company, a national bank and other public structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in not being used there.
And we've got all the maps to them, and we've been actively communicated with Tripoli and Tobrook.
The fruits of this work were already undertaken: Rosnife has concluded the cooperation agreement with the Libyan State oil company - NOC.
The Director of NUC Mustafa Sanal, whose head of Ronsity Ygor Sechin had a deal, was directly from the Tripolis.
And two weeks ago, the first shipping of the Rosnelft liquid oil was loaded.
What would Russia do with her?
I think it's gonna be transferred.
What other economic interests in Libya are Russia?
Reimbursement of contracts in Muammar Caddafi.
This is, in particular, about the previous contracts in the transport area (construction of iron roads), energy (electricity) and several other.
What about the liquors?
Well, they've got oil.
Does it mean, as in the case of Iran, it's about the "scale of services" scheme?
I don't know what schedule will be, so I'm not working on these matters.
Indeed, Russia's economics are not mainly in Libya.
We are, in fact, in peace-making work.
The main thing is to stop bloodproliferation, help liquids to agree with themselves, so that they have been able to establish orders and Libya has stopped being a favorable environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task to help the Libyan people and to issue terrorists from there.
Do you have data on the presence in Libya (actually or before) of Russia or other former SPDs?
One of our contact groups was the explanation of this.
I met the representative of the Libyan security committee, who said that there is no leave from Russia and other former SSSC countries there.
He said he had some 500,000 telephone talks from the representatives of Islamic and Radial Groups (in Libya) and the Russian speaking there is no sound.
What states are those fighters?
I wouldn't like to get into these details.
Then we'll make a question otherwise.
How many of the Islamic fighters in Libya's most liquors?
Libyans are not most than 5 per cent of them.
The last ones are friends.
Can Moscow conduct internal negotiations on Paris?
There are such plans.
We have conducted active negotiations with the leaders, some delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow and said that they were willing to come to Moscow or Grosk.
When can such negotiations be taken?
Now it's hard to say.
There should be a number of visits, and I hope there is a clearness about the time and the location of negotiations.

According to the suspected, the pharmaceutical pharmaceuticals were reported in the Office of Police Communication.
After that, a man went to the coffee situated nearby.

Condemnation Michel Carter for the message of Conrad Roy
The Deputy of Massachusetts sent two and a half years in charge that it had encouraged the self-assault of Conrad Roy by text communications and telephone calls.
Michelle Carter, who is now 20 years, is going to take 15 months for a decision and five years of testing.
Carter was acknowledged in June by the unforeseen murder of Conrad Roy, which ended with him on 13 July 2014.
Father Roy said to hearing on Friday, "My family was killed by a pain.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to stay free before appeal.
She threatened the maximum period for 20 years, but her lawyers said that she was, and Roy suffered psychological disorders.
Carter, covered in the red brown and a sweet blue, listened to the condemnation standing, slept his hands and left his eyes.
"He killed Conrad Roy with his actions," said the judge.
"He stopped his life to improve her.
She didn't recognize the responsibility," she said.
"He hasn't demonstrated repentance."
But the lawyer Carter said that it was "tragic case that she was very sorry."
However, judge Lawrence Monys said that it was not a significant impact on her actions.
The accused read the statement of the mother Roy Lin Roy, in which he said: "I wouldn't have been a day when I wouldn't swear the loss of my loved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I run - I'm trying to support his sister, despite all the pain that remains with us forever," says it.
The sister Roy Camdin Roy said that she was urged to overcome the thought that she could never be present at his marriage or to become his children's tea.
"Let a man who was with me always since my birth is the pain that will remain with me until the end of my life," she said.
This case seems to be legally predicted, since Massachusetts does not have a law that would be responsible for the Council of the Human Rights to make self-assault.
In 2014, when Roy found the dead symptoms of coal gas in the car, Carter was 17 years old.
This happened to the whole country when it was known that he was subjected to the self-assault of Carter.
"You may be shocking, smelling, smelling your feet, I don't know a lot of ways," she wrote in a few messages sent for two weeks before he died with his family.
In a few minutes before the suicide she wrote, "You must do this, Conrad" and "You need to enter the shooting, and you'll be free and happi."
The judge Monys said that Carter wanted to get care of Roy's death, and forbidd her to contact the press not to give her the desire.
The opinions of lawyers on this matter were separated.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Nox, who was sentenced in 2007 for murder in Italy, his British neighbourhood and was sentenced two years later.
Nox, a 30-year-old year, published his special view in "Los-Angeles Times" which stated: "Missel Carter is providing symptoms and assistance, not prisons".
The eagle Godchev said, "I left Langford as a bird of high flight."
One of the best Bactebolists of the Uniform VTB 33-year-old Kit Langford left UNICS.
The United States Protector's entry proposed the President of the United States of Godchev.
China took this decision on the family circumstances, said the Eugene Godchev.
He has a little child, a wife who didn't want to move to Kazan.
Kit wants to be closer to the house.
I decided to go to him.
Of course, I could say "No" and extend his contract, but he's got another relationship.
He played in UNICSE three seasons and showed a high level of 100 per cent in each mask.
So I left him as a bird of high flight.
We thanked him.
We live in his family life and in the carriage.

‘Audi’ is to modify to 850 000 distance vehicles
On the day before the Audio Declaration, BMW declared that it would propose to update the program assurance of more than 3500,000 cars.
The President of BMW stated that the company was considered that “ther intelligent ways are than restraints”, in the meaning of European cities, including Munchen, where BMW is available, which considered the possibility of prohibiting or restricting the use of environmental cars.
The Dymler said on Thursday that the revised three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their dioxide flow.
No company called his step to call.
European car producers actively moved the use of environmental cars in Europe and the United States in order to facilitate the compliance with the carbon gas emission rules.
But the oxygen of the ace that elects the dioxide engines is considered cancer and can be called asthma.
The level of the installation of equipment that neutralizes aircraft gases is also increased, and the support of competitive car rental prices is difficult.
While the German car producers were in a position, the Government of the Office of Angela Mercelle also accused that it touched the influenced car producers and ignored the signs of the problem.
The company is trying to not repeat the "Folxvagen" errors that cover the use of such "function devices" which could be used during testing the number of damaged gases that would comply with the rules and, in terms of ordinary injury, disabled.
In the United States, a sentence was sentenced to several "Folxvagen" leaders, the rest of the two sides of Atlantics.
Last month, Germany arrested the former chief of the Termodynamic Division in the Audio Motor Development Group.
The former manager, Zakeo Jovannie Pamio, was not protected from extradition and may be before the court in the United States.
Last year, “Audi” was under German criminal investigation with the Folxwagen's participation after the authorities accused of ‘Audi’ in the installation of the European emission rules and extended the investigation that was previously concentrated in the United States.
Inclusion of the Audios may create serious challenges for the investigation: the producer of elite cars is an unproportionally large part of the income of the Folxvagen.
Coffee visitors had been paid by false money in Asia

Astronauts found a "away" planet on which even iron can be floured.
The first study of the strategies of guiant exploding named WASP-121b, the astronomies were very surprised by the temperature that could be eliminated from iron and other metals.
The specialists pointed out that water molecules were so decreased by the light of the stars that delete inflation.
The "Habble" telescope printed the water molecule on this gas hydrate: this high temperature makes the water in the atmosphere of the planet lighting in inflation diameter.
WASP-121b refers to the so-called "great pitterns" of gas guiganta, the size and mass compared to the largest planet of the Solar system, but situated ten times near the parent star.
Since that year, only 1,3 "term" days are long, and its gas tank is nearly 2 500 degrees.
Climate change threatens the lavanda in Provance.
She became a symbol of Provans and South France, but now it is threatened by climate change.
Lavanda was worse to grow because of the soft weather and the transmission of insected diseases; this was the main pain of scientists and farmers who are trying to find decisions.
Eric Shes, an expert of the Agricultural Institute of CRIEPRAM Agricultural Research, says: "The Lavanda in Provance is really threatened, since this growth has affected the climate change in the past years: early and especially sugar has become too small.
This affects the duration of the lavanda life.
And there are still small cyclings that smell insected insecting micro bacteria; they are very sweet weatherly."
There's a lot on the map.
Lavanda is not only attractive for dissidents, but the lavanda oil is very covered in parfummelia and space.
Eric Shes says: "Instead of very long balls with a large number of large colours we have small, weakened, weakened or missing.
So we have less parts that contain epileptic oil."
The decisions that are now considered include the improvement of water distribution and the slow speed, and the switch of the plants of protected grass and waters, and the smelling of more sustainable to the sugar.

The weekly newspaper workers generally meet the media to discuss the recent violence crimes in the Sinala State related to organized crimes corrupted by officials or an unfinished war of drugs.
But today they met to talk about the security of their own tragedy.
They said they had to change their affairs.
Two elderly journalists discussed that it seems more secure: the brothers of their children in the office in which they have already left granat or left their home in 2009.
Security experts were written on the floor in the room, three words: enemies, neutral people, unions.
They requested journalists to call names for each column - the evidence is not necessary, suspicion and internal accommodations will be sufficient.
These are drug traffickers, policies, businessmen, journalists suspected that they are in the government or cards, the entire list of firms that have been hazardous of the haosing work in Mexico.
Violence is not transferred, and among the bodys that are multiplied in the country, more journalists: on the data of the Journalist Protection Committee, not less than 25 since President Enrico Peen Nieto took its position in December 2012; 589 persons after attacks and threats are under federal protection; and at least seven persons have been killed in seven states in this year.
Among their last publications and inspirers, Havier Waldes Cardens is the Riodos Collector.
“A great mistake is living in Mexico and being journalist,” wrote Waldes in one of his many books on drug violence crimes.
His absence is very delicate, even though his presence is a large photo of the Valdes, which shows the medium ball, with the description of the Riodose building; two reporters for 30 years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, have a football on which his legs, his faces in the eyes of the company, or his firm pants.
The seminar is less than two months after his death; the journalists discuss their overall trauma, their cosmetics, their unsomed and paranoia.
Although the office of the Special Federal Prosecutor was organized in 2010 for the investigation of journalist cases until two cases were investigated by the Journalist Protection Committee.
As in most cases of thousands of murders related to drugs and organized crimes each year, journalists are rarely present before the court.
The journalists Riodoos insist that they will write on violence in Singapore, although they are killed by a pain, although it is now more dangerous.
Without information on murders, without the justice of security talks at meetings, Ibarra says.
"It's very stupid to lose time on this seminar," he says.
"When we don't know why, we're suspecting everyone."
On May 15, Waldes went from the Riodos office in the capital of the state of Cuban.
He was able to walk only a couple of quartals before his red Toyot King stopped two men; he was shooted out of the car and shooted in him 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which means "Twitter River".
He went to his car and slaughtered her closer.
Waldes was 50 years old.
He remained a wife and two adult children.
The servants normally disappear to Kuliakan.
But Waldes' prayers are almost all.
Since Guzman was arrested and issued in the United States in January last year, Singala became one of the most bloody fighting fields in the country, since the conflicting fractions are fighting for the full of the training vacuum.
We will not say that every day on the Sinala streets kill one or more persons, or that the shooting is fully shocked by two stages of drugs that are more than the house of many living people.
Let's forget that the state of shocking is just when one of the carrières takes control of the premature state with important drug ports and ways leading to the United States.
Despite this, Waldes was well known about the dangers of his work, Ishmael Bochorks, the 60-year-old partner and director of Riodos, was dismissed by the sense of guilty because he did not want to protect a friend.
He thinks that the murder helped two mistakes.
First, it was published in February with Damaso Lopez, a leader of the counterparty of the card that fights with the sons of Guzman.
Publication could be disappointed by the sons; people who preferably were band members have purchased all the publications as they were brought to the kitchen.
The second error was that he did not put Valdes in charge of his own security to leave the country after a other newspaper wrote on the same story.
Waldes was legended in Mexico and outside the border, and his murder was estimated as a natural century in developing violence against journalists in Mexico.
He was so long away from the danger, his friends and colleagues thought he would always be.
He was an experienced reporter in Norwegia, and in 2003, with the five colleagues of Riodoos, sold his 50-dual-paid shares.
In Singapore, "It was impossible to work a journalist without affecting the topic of drugs," said Bochorcus.
Since the newspaper, the reputation of courageous and honest publications, sales and advertising revenues grew.
The journalists liked that they could publish rare reports, without fearing the census, but the readers pleaded that they could read that no one had no longer been able to write.
Eight years after the Ríodos founded, Maria Murs Cabo received a prestigious prize for reporting work in Latin America.
In the same year, Waldes wins the International Press Freedom for the courage to investigate drugs in Mexico wherever it was.
He clearly admitted that he was scared.
"I want to live further," he said with the CPJ premium.
The drug trafficking in Singapore is "This is the shape of life", said in October last year at the TV interview.
"You have to take the tasks that are false on you like a journalist, or you just swear the crazy."
I don't want to ask me, "What did you do when there was so many dead... why didn't you say what's going on?"
Riodose workers miss the Valdes, a shooter who slaughtered as a loader in the port, the other, a generous, and the advice, a teacher who knew how to get in the lives.
They trusted in their order.
He should always take his shooting.
He had to go to El Guyabo, bar against the office, and always sit there for the same table.
Now they ask: Did he lost love for a single order?
His death also made them aware of how to do better and remain in the lives.
"They do not like you to find out in their women, children, their legal business and underpower aircrafts for transport of drugs.
"These things were fake," said Boholics.
The results, even in the best times, were high levels of self-employment and self-reliance.
I need to believe instincts.
Stay away from what's wrong.
The problem is, it says, "Riodose" editor Andrés Villareal, that "the fear can be lie... and then happens what happened to Havier."
Old rules, said he and others, are not more operating in Singapore, such as in Tamauripas, Veracrus, Guerrero and other states, where there is a deterioration of profitable contractual ways, weak state institutions and corrupted officials.
Lanshaft's always changed.
In the room where the Riodose staff was gathered for security training, it was then banned to use hundreds of phones: for a few days before it has been known that the spy programs sold only to governments were used in Mexico for journalists and public activists.
Out of the two police officers are hidden in the dark of 104 degrees of grain (Celsian 40 degrees).
They gave the Government to protect the Riodoos Office, located in the four-year building in the Kuliakhan Quarter quarter.
Some journalists asked whether the police were not included in the 50 per cent of the orders that the Governor had said that he could not trust them.
A few months ago, journalists have been sent to a mountain place that is de facto under the band of drug traffickers.
In the closest number, Riodos was estimated to three main themes.
This is a murder in Sinala's former champion on the boss of Julio Sezar Chavez.
They also had the payment of government costs focused on the gouvernant city.
And there was a group of people in one of the most beautiful restaurants of Kulikaan, in the Quartet of the Prosecutor's office.
It was officially not declared who had been disfellowshipped or what happened, so it had to be careful when it was time to write that all in the city knew that it was the favorite restaurant of drugs and authorities at the same time.
One of their journalists learned from the open databases that the restaurant was registered on behalf of the policy of the Governing Institution and Revolutionary Party (PRI), which was dominated at all levels of the authorities in almost the past century.
Recently, a number of gouverneurs from PRI have been imposed a lot of corruption accused.
Wildreal requested journalists to write on previous incidents in the restaurant, including when El Chapo, the son of Guzman, was gone out of the area of militarys.
A few months ago, readers would search for the Valdes column with the most reliable information.
"We would have known what happened," says the 46-year-old Villareal, for its artistic body, called El Flaco.
"All channels of our sources are disrupted every year."
The Wallace Office is now used as a packaging and anti-protegic murder of journalists, since staff became the one whom they had never thought to be: actors who speaked in the name of the press.
The journalist Miriam Ramirez took several pledges and sent the next morning to demonstration in a local prosecutor dedicated to another journalist.
Salvador Adam's disappearance in the Michoacan state, west of the country, three days after the murder of Valdez.
The body was found, and the authorities said it was, on the basis of DNA tests.
In the whole country, journalists have been expressed so much, organizing protesters, and writeing "SOS Press" on the throats and the walls of houses.
In that day, Director of Bocoraks was in Washington, trying to support internationally in the matter of Valdes.
On the next day after the murder of Valdez Ramirez accused the authority that they were shocked by journalists and claimed to kill them because they say the truth.
After that, she requested not to give her more tasks for the publication of the Government, fearing that the angry was harming its objectiveness.
Valdez said many times that journalists in Mexico are "circle" organized by crime, its participants to the government and the impartial society.
He wrote in his last book that reporters do not only kill drug traffickers, but they do this on orders of policy and security in the conspiracy with organized crime.
The Committee on the Protection of Press Artic 19 believes that half of the attacks against journalists last year were made on the order of police and government officials.
"In Mexico you're dead because they want to close you," says Ramirez.
Of course, the murder is threatening people.
All remembered that Maria Elizabeth Massai six years ago in the northern border state of Tamauripas, blogger.
On her body, there was a note written by the card of Zeta: "I'm here because of my articles."
The computer keyboard and the shields were close to her cut head.
Some publications prefered to close as the El Nord newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of her representative of the Miroslav Brich in March.
Others remain as El Manjana from Novo Laredo after the murder of her leader in 2004.
In 2010, The Diario de Sudad Huas publicly called to drug cards using a draft article on the first page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists abandoned their own states or their country.
This is a painful decision.
In the escape, it is difficult to find work, and it continues to be threatened on the streets.
And sometimes they killed them as apparently with a photo of Ruben Espanzo, who was killed in 2015 with four women in the apartment in Mexico three months after flying from Veracrus.
Those who remain and continue to work are balanced daily between risked decisions.
Ibarra, who ever dreamed to be a poet, admits that he was afraid to write about drug trafficking.
"Mexican's cut into deeds, and so I became a journalist," he says.
On Thursday, when the last exhibition was ready to print, the Riodose publishers sit on the treasure next to the office and drinked a drink when their phones were soon called.
A series of shocks between the fighting bands and the security forces near the smoke city of Massatlan left, as confirmed, 19 bodies.
The war continued to discourage, as was promised in a series of letters from the cards found in the area.
Sit on the throat, they posted news on the Riodose web site via mobile phone.
The next day, the first page was to be shared.
The snakes have increased, the other shooting in the neighborhood.
Boholics had seen whether they were ready to protect their police.
If they were feared, they have not shown it.
Situation under the great portrait of the dead founder of their newspapers, whose median palm was sent to the distortion of the whole Sinala, and the Riodose Workers continued to do it.
"What can you think about closing?" said Boholics, "if the same day when Havier was killed, the practitioner asked me to send her to the street to make a report?"
Dinosaur was used to avoid the enemy
Firstly, he seems to be statues, although it is a fear.
The researchers said that the first remains of the incredible body with the noise found by the Canadian shatter remained so well that the experts called it “My Liza among the dinosaurs”.
It was so well that they were even able to determine that the color of his cheese hair was redundant and said he had, in some kind of "this past".
In the report published in the New World Biology magazine, it was described as “the one of the best dictators of dinosaur in the world”.
This is covered by a recent Nodosawru post that lives in the midst of the low period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly good condition has resulted in researchers who are called “effectively wonderful”.
This magic tireophor is the most well-conserved species in the whole history of stocks, according to the articles in National Geographic magazine.
He was found by Shon Fanko when he was working on the Millennium Company near the Fort McMurry northern Albert, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
He stressed something that seemed to be different from the environment, and decided to look more careful.
The discovery was sent to the Kingdom Paleonological Museum of Tirrel.
The following six years has been working for the discovery of the animal inside the earthquake in 2500 feet (100 kg).
Now, when all this hard work has been done, the final results can be demonstrated.
“It's only a lot of comfort, and you can actually believe he's sleeping,” said the leading author Caleb Brown, who is a scientist of the Kingdom Paleonological Museum, where the creation is demonstrated.
“He enters the history of science as one of the most beautiful and well-conserved dinosaurs – Mona Liz among the dinosaurers.”
During his study of his skin, researchers found that it was a heavy, despite the painting and remembering the skin tank, in all the visibility, was a significant danger from the meat dinosaurs.
This powerful panzer dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from the slaughter, and used a protective technologie known as a protective squirrel that also uses many animals today.
This would allow him to communicate with the environment and avoid meetings with enemy, said experts, pretending that there were more dinosaurs on him.
This exists in the age of 110 million years of age with regard to the family of Nodosaw in May, and is now on exposition to the Kingdom Palestinian Museum.
Scientists have already studied animals and gave him a name of Borealopelta Markmitchelli on the honour of the museum lab, Mark Mitchell, one of the members of the group, which has been held over 70,000 hours for his crostóle squad.
The surprising conservation of the extraterrestree allowed Dr. Mitchell and the international scientists to document the painting and shape of cheese and pancil platin on his tv.
They have found a protective shield distributed by the protection method in the kingdom of animals, which means that the top of the existing was darkly below.
Although the protective clash has been well distributed, the opening was unexpected, because the size of the Borealopelta dinosaur is significantly exceeding the size of the present living animals with the protection of the ocult.
It could be suggested that the dinosaurs had so actively seized the fleshly dinosaurs that the evolution prefered conflict mass as a way of survival.
However, most modern animals with protective oceans, for example, ovins, ovens or browns, are significantly smaller and are more accessible, which indicates that nodosaurus had to be severely fighting for survival.
“The severe threat from the massacres for a powerful, shocked panciller of the dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaurs of the Melo period,” reported Brown.
Chemical analysis of organic connections in the cheese dinosaur also indicates that his hair should be redinated and corrupt.
Scientists continue to study animals, finding information on his life, including the content of his survival trace, to find out what he eat during his last trap.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, he fell into the river and was taken into the sea where he was cut down and slow down the lion on the bottom of the ocean.
At that time, Albert was so warm as now on the south of Florida, and the rivers and the oceans, likely, were much more widely spread to the depth than now.
“ The nodozavur was indeed noted that it was fully smelled with the cheese skin, and at the same time it was fully maintained in three measurements, keeping a typical form of animal, ” said Brown.
“The animal now appears almost as it appeared at the time in the Lannn low period.
Don't need to be particularly inclined to imagine to restore it, it must be easy to smile, and you can almost believe that he is sleeping."
The low period is the time when guiant terrorists, the meat dinosaurs that standed on two feet, were broken over the earth.
Although the most wonderful one of them, the Tirannozawr Rex, lived over millions of years later than Borealopelta, a tireophore could be able to shoot some of his cruel predominants.
Its number includes acrobatory, a 38 feet (11,5 m) weight in six tons.
Scientists whose last openings are published in the Modern Biology magazine, believe that Borealopelta has been brought to the sea and has been mutatised in it.
The property was found by Shon Fanko when the Millennium shock was close to Fort McMurry, northern Albert, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
According to the museum staff, it is the most well-conserved tireofor worldwide, together with skin and pancil, and it was targeted, from the sea to the poor bones.
In the meantime, they reached about 18 feet (5 m) long and weighted up to 3000 feet (1300 kg).
Their characteristic meeting was twenty-twenty-five-five shirts, speaking from the shoe.
Researchers believe that this magician tireofor has been hardly understood by Canada until the swimming river has not brought it to the open sea.
However, the subconduct detection of the dinosaur maintained his panciller with precise precise precision to the smallest details.
The random remains of this specific plot remained so well that the skin remains still covering bugry pancil plates around the head of the dinosaur.
As Michael Greece wrote in a article for the National Geographic magazine, it is a stage of maintenance as you win in the lottery.
As far as I look at him, he seems more sensitive.
The skin skin remains still covering bugry pancils that smell the heads of the animal.
His right front feet is cut around the side, five fingers on it are turned up.
I can compare the shoes on his shoes."
Mihail Sakashvili could return to Poland without documentation
Mikhail Sakashili, formerly launched in Georgia, and then the Odess area in Ukraine, arrived in Poland.
He did so, not with documents that confirm his personality and citizenship.
Saakashvili reports the Polish Televizja Republic's publication, which has posted on his YouTube channel with his statement.
Saakashvili had been held on a 1944 anniversary of the Varshaw Resurrection against the Hitlerian armed forces.
Since the politicians did not know the Poland, although he tried to start speaking in this language, he had to speak to the English through the Poland translator.
During his speech, the policy was focused on Georgia's cooperation with Poland, as well as on Ukraine.
The Ukrainian Migration Service has lost his citizenship, the public policy has learned that it was in the United States.
How could he be able to make a transatlantic ship without documents until it was unknown.
Previously, the former Governor of the Mihail Sakashili stated that his signing to the Anket was undertaken for the citizenship of Ukraine.
Politics stressed that he didn't fill any ankets.
The duration of the events in the case of Vinzier and Olhavka extended to January
The duration of the preliminary impact on the ownership of the Ronova Group of the Employees and the heads of the T Plus, Boris Winzier, has extended to 2 January 2018.
On Thursday, 3 August, the Court of Basman considers the extension of the accused home arrest.
The representative of the CK at the meeting reported that the last time it was decided to extend the period of preliminary consequences.
The investigator stated: "The extreme complexity and long-term impact of the need for the extraction and expertise of a large number of documents, as well as for investigation on the territory of a number of RF actors," said the investigator.
He added that the suspected were regularly given by the Commission's guidelines.
They are estimated in at least a billion rubbers.
According to the results, Vinzhier, Oilhavkik, and the former SO-Commax Energy Systems, Mikhail Slobodin, who resigned to the Employment Corporation until 5 September, provided the High Officers of the Republic of the Commission for the establishment of maximum benefit rates for heat and electricity, and for the establishment of favorable conditions for business.
Weinzhier and Olhavick were detented, stood in Singapore and arrested for two months, Slobodin was hidden from the incidents and was declared in the Federal Research.
How did one aktivist learn the answer to the question “What is the street?”
On August 9, 2014, Britain Ferrell was shocked to the depth of the soul.
Only a day after the arriving to New York in a tourist journey, St. Luis sit down in a bedroom shipping through Airbnb, phone-screen flight.
She touched someone from the middle of the school.
There was said: “The police just killed a 15-year-old child, and he still stands through the street.”
He pointed out that no more of her fellowships did not cover the information provided, she closed the fax and opened the Twitter.
There were a lot of users in her legend with any @TheePharoah.
Repertoire from the Great St. Louis in a real time in Twitter, Michael Brown, a preserved black-weight-year-old teenager murdered by the police officer in Ferguson, Missouri State.
He published a photo of the unrealable Braun body, which was distributed within the street, where it would be four hours.
“ It's a disagreement, ” Ferrell thought.
But death wasn't something new for her and her circle.
She took a phone, and later night he returned to Twitters that people were gathering in Canfield.
There were photos of the signal and the crying people and people who claimed that he was the father of Brown, who cryed to say: “The police from Ferguson just killed my unarmed son!”
She looked at the direct transmission of the police officer in front of a group of protesters with the lacquering dog.
Another video of another policeman, she told her, shooted a smoke and shooted, "I'll kill you all... animals."
“ This is an unexpected situation”, said Ferrell in his own memory.
“ This isn't a murder like those we're attracted and typical.
At that time, I felt aware.
I was angry and crying."
She took a ticket on a ray and flyed home on the next day.
When she landed on the 11th night, she took her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided both of them to Ferguson on the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years, was a new documentary film “What is the street?” that will be on the 11 August screen.
This is the statement of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and duty in the face of people living in the community and in the full streets, to require answers.
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter, covered in a ball and a ball under color, they recalled the conversation that took up to this morning a few times, “to experience of black and their situations”.
She remembered: “Remember, how did I tell you how black people had to fight for what they believed?
We're going to Ferguson now because the police's killing a 18-year-old boy, and that's wrong."
“ I couldn’t take her, ” said Ferrell later.
“What is happening today is a culmination of... that happened previously.
She must know about it, see it and learn about it.
It should not only be a good idea in activeism and organization, but also understand the various levels of experience of black and their situations and what we must do to be free to be free.
Even if I can ensure her environment in which she does not share with the obvious racism, she is nothing different from any other black girl.
I feel that she would have been a bad service if she would be rewarded from that."
When they arrived in Ferguson, they first stopped at Saoth-Florisant-Rood, on the board that was located through the road from the police officer, which was a kind of palestinian camp while the activists were waiting for reports on the outcome of the officer, Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local company that prepared the packaging.
They gathered the packages and helped the protesters.
Inconsciousness, Ferrell stripped a new type of activism.
“ My activism has been completely changed after August 9,” she noted that as a student of the University of Missouri-Center-Luis, she was President of the Sanitary Association of Students, National Minorities, and had been a food justice and health inequality among the black communities.
“ I didn’t have an organizational experience.
It came to himself."
After a few weeks of the evening, Ferrell met Sabaa Folaian, one of his guests.
Folarian said that she and her principal operator Lucas Alvarado-Farerer were “the only desire to document” events.
Ferrell came to the head, “Do you want to document, or try to find the story you can play?”
This skepticism was a lot of people, often white who came to the community to benefit from his pain and sustainability.
As explained recently by the Folaian interview, “We heard that the voice of people who were born and growing in Ferguson would not be in the center of attention, and they wanted to do this another”.
Forian has already joined his co-chairman David Davis, a local artist known by his activeism on the matters convicted to death penalty.
His participation has been a sympathetic for a project in Ferrell and the six local people with whom the project “What is the street?” supported the connection during the years after the murder of Brian.
“In this documental film no one speaks for us or with us, that's what we say,” said David.
“It was the most important for me as these people will be presented, because this is how I will submit myself.”
And although the project was aimed not to focus on the experience of Ferrell – to show that the movement “is not the leader of the Safety, but the way it combined the community”, as Folaian said, it was the most open part of the film.
As a result in “What is the street?”, the personal aspects of the life of Ferrell, for example, how she loved and married her wife.
“ I feeled awesome, ” said Ferrell, smilingly telling me how I first saw the prepared product.
"But I understood that when you do such work and manage the blacks, some level of vulnerability must be."
Furthermore, the history of Ferrell again discusses and emphasizes the role of the black homosexual woman in a broader context of the movement of “The Life of Blacks has an importance”.
Two of the third movement founders are those who created #BlackLivesMatter in social networks after the murder of the black adolescent Trevo Martin in 2012 are counting themselves to homosexuals.
“The generous homosexual women in direction support all this movement,” says Ferrell. - And all because we are struggling on several fronts.
The black homosexual women must take all this burden."
The Florian agreed with that appeal, noting that the movement is in fact supported by black women and many homosexual black women.
However, she insists that “that is not a positive discrimination” and that Ferrell has not been elected to a central film because of its different features.
“It was the man who had experienced this energy,” she said.
“ On the other hand, it is not the coincidence that she was on the first plan, because when. ”
You can feel her energy through the screen."
Thus, in Ferguson, there is no cinema for a long time, but there are still complicated racial relations between the community and the police.
Ferrell will be tested for the shift during the demonstration.
It describes the social and political atmosphere, which is called the house, just "Bardak".
She still holds for the thing he learned when he went out on the Ferguson Street three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
We are nothing to lose, except our tents."
Two Salvador footballists dismissed for the course of US players

Then the semi-defender of Seren was slaughtered by the U.S. Omar Gonzalez’s protective protector.
As a result, Romano was dismissed for three shops, and Seren was six.

Decorations: Artist creates portraits using DNA, Chelsey Manning
In the centre of the Garerrey Fridman in New York, people are white, black and red, all of which is not similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by the artist Hizer Duy-harbourg from the shoes and shoes sent to her Chulsey Manning.
Manning sent a recruit from Fort Levenworth prison where the former analysis of the information is 35-year-old for the famous transfer of confidential diplomatic telegraphs on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition of 2 August is called "Origination".
The result of the two-year record between Duy-Harbourg, which combines the art of technology, information and art, and Manning, the woman-transsual and a famous dissident, which Barrak Obama had condemned the sentence all over three days before the end of his presidency.
He analyzed the DNA program from Manning and used it to create three-dimensional ports of persons that could be in such a gene, Duy-Harborg made a deep deep, even though it was difficult to improve the manifth, not only the Plastics of DNA, but also the different ways of interpretation and intellectual deterioration of these interpretations, but also the understanding of identity.
Manning, who was born with the name Bradley Edward, but since a adolescent age, said that it was open to be a woman, in 2013, 20 episodes were condemned, including six Spionage violations, computer fraud and violence.
Her photos were not available in the prison, so only one of her photos was known: a black and white village in which Manling in the platinum distance, apparently feeling slow, sits on the roll of the car; with its photo and began to associate.
In 2015, Duy-Harbourg has completed its 2012 project "Visions of Non-Chairpersons".
The artist created the portraits of unknown persons using the judicial instruments of the type of oaks and the wedding resort, giving from this DNA museum and establishing images of how these people could look.
And then she received an e-mail from Magazine.
"They took interview to Chelsey Manning in prison and wanted some portrait to illustrate the article," explained Duy-Hagberg at the premature showing a new exhibition for the press.
At that time, Chelsea could not be visited and photographed, so they were connected to her and asked whether she wanted to get a portrait created from her DNA.
Thus, the artist and her sit in the museum became friends of spectacle and exchanged a few letters over two years.
They even wrote a book of the Mixed Images, illustrated by Schoili Cannongo, which illustrated how Chase's punishment in the future would be cut and can be visited.
The fact that Obama really decided to release Manning only a few days after the release of the book to the light was welcomed after seven serious years in the military prison in Kansas.
There is something deep and strong and that the exhibition is now open when Donald Trump announces the war of people who open secret information in the Government and finds new ways to smile in Twitter.
When Duy-Harborg asked about the coincidence all over time, she said, "It's not happening."
In the statement of the artist, written on the wall of the gallery, the great sign of Manning down (and instead of “i” in her family) calls for a final "automatic separation on the basis of gender, race, sexual orientation and culture".
At the opposite side, it is its mitocondrial DNA, a long runner of the C, G and A.
Included 200 letters (or nucleotics, as a learning artist is expressed, Duy-Harborg hoped to show how we all look wonderfully, in any case in our biological structure.
"I hope to explain people that our genius is not determined what we are opening genetic data for interpretation and how substantial it is," said Duy-Harborg; its video work in 2007, also published here.
"Date data can tell us a lot of different historys, and 30 of these stories here."
The last part of the exposition in one room is the roman mentioned above in comics.
Manning, in King-Cong style, appears on the building of the U.S. Correction Catherine and the speaker in his hand.
"If they kill your speech, they will win."
"Don't shut up."
"This is a direct quote from the letter she wrote me," says a artist who welcomes us from Philadelphia.
"I've still got a skin skin when I'm talking about it."
Manning has not yet seen a personal exhibition - as it was visually pictured in comics - but when she comes, she will welcome the mask in the room centre, its own genus symbols collected, like the balls of the protesters.
It was also intended to be made, as well as all of the exhibition to the height (5"2, Manning growth), on which the career had been recorded genetic gangs.
"After I would smile them on the walls, but now I wanted them to look like a sweet people," says Duy-Harborg about portraits.
"I wanted them to be like a massive movement that was formed around Chelsea, as a movement standing up and for her freedom."

Russian Vice-Premier Mutko: "We are doing the requirements of the WADA road map in the nearest time."
The Russian Vice-Premier Vitality Mutko said that the conditions of the World Anti-Doping Agency (IADA) to restore the work of the Russian anti-doping Agency (RUSAA) will be carried out in the nearest time.
" The determinated stage of implementation was made, RUSAD had the right to plan and conduct tests together with UKAD (Antico-Prince Agency of the United Kingdom).
The UDA Road Map was respectively updated", said Mutko on Friday.
The Prime Minister has commented on the second part of the IADA road map to restore the status of the Code, which lists the conditions of renewing RUSAD and was recently published on the website of the organization.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could be difficult for Russia.
"It's been declared, everything will be done.
And the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee (MOC) and ADAD at the nearest time," he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list underscored that Russian Indian structures should be publicly recognized by the results of the UAD by the investigation of the Canadian jurisprudence Richard McLaren, which claimed that the continued in Russian sport was controlled by the State.
In response to this question, Mutko said, "We are conducting a investigation because our anti-continent system has permitted badness.
All measures were adopted.
But there was no programme, and we will not recognize what wasn't.
He repeated Vitalia Symronoa, head of the Russian independent public anti-continent committee.
On the same morning, in the Russian Rsport publication, Slimne acknowledged their previous problems in the Russian antidoping structures, but added: " We often said that the report contains certain positions and provisions.

Starmarks that help your company not to become a orthodox "World"
Aimee Errett wanted to assess the satisfaction levels among its e-commerce staff, but the surveys did not work.
The answers were often disappointed, unnecessary, or worse.
Even though she promised an anonymity, some staff did not trust in this process.
“He never was sustainable and objective,” said Errett, who managed the company of 75 "Madison Reed" in San Francisco, who operates electronic trafficking.
So she called to the third person to help.
There is now a new type of experience in work with staff that helps companies to find out how they feel.
Developing and licenceing a programme assurance which is a measurement of responsibilities of staff, they allow companies to make exams, address specific teams and demographic groups, to propose an anonymity and gorge for complaints, and, in some cases, to allow information to minimize fuel and directly addressing.
"We have yet instruments like Strava and Fitbit for Health Monitoring, and where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-operator and President of the Glint from Redwood City, whose analytical programs are used by companies to measure the involvement of staff.
Errest told that it had been a greater understanding of the thinking and feeling of its staff for three years of use of Glint.
In addition to the exams and ankets of the specified product teams, a warm card of the company is proposed and shows in a supervisional form, which are more complaints and some low approval management managers, which allows it to find out why.
The company acknowledges that they need to control the workplace, otherwise they will become a temporary "Umber " that was interrupted in the scandal when the former staff published a post in the blog in which the aggressive situation in which those who expressed frustration had been ordered.
For older people such as Glint, it is the desire to control the situation - the opportunity for a profitable business.
The Internetports estimates “Search on payment” dedicated to financial technologies, the global management industry, regulation and corresponding to 2020 may be more than 118.7 billion dollars.
The Starpaper Convercent from Denver, the State of Colombia, which helps companies to prevent and discover a bad behavior, noted the small growth of interest and activity in the Ubera's reputation in this year.
The Convercent is almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Mycrosoft and Tezla.
Recently, there appeared a switch among clients.
Like “Glint”, “Convercent”, enterprises allow to send personal view orders, gather confidential responses in the real time regime and to train the warm cards of the problems zones.
He also provides a warm line for anonymous text communications that allows staff to report on a bad behavior.
And if you're shooting the shooter, the complaints are going directly to the directive.
“The public view has overcome the authority of inspectors,” said Patrick Quinnlan, founder and President of the company Convercent.
If the company is cleared that it is wrong with staff or that it is ineettic, even if the inspector is not imposed, the company may be covered with the costly consequences of the form of customers, the displacement of staff and the judiciary, reported in Quinlan.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant network where more than 25,000 staff worked in 500 firms, used Convercent more than year to make sure that law and procedure staff workers are able to provide a simple way to go into the company’s main office.
Before, if the staff wanted to report about the problem, he or she had to search for the phone number or the main office, to give an official complaint and to hope that it would be serious.
This was often a terrible and unfair experience, reported James Vitrano, head of the Ruby Tuesday, who said that it was not a normal way to follow the complaints of staff.
But now, when the company is used by the Convercent Service, the problems that had previously been hidden from the managers in other cities or states, such as discrimination, charsing and unfair work payment, can quickly find and take them.
“I can draw close to a comprehensive, comprehensive understanding of the staff situation”, said Vitrano, leading to the 'Ruby Tuesday' network management group.
“We protect our shareholders from judiciary with staff.”
According to the Queenland, the company began seriously addressing the ethics, values and involvement of staff in 2002, after the Buhgalter Company Artur Andersen had suffered a cash due to ethnic violations resulting from Dale Enron.
But only when “social networks have received massive dissemination”, the company realized that they would not be able to keep their fat from viral distribution into the network.
“Instead of starting using ethics control technologies, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
And “Glint” and “Convercent” propose their software as a service with the company's regular payment for the use of their products.
This is a model and opportunities for the approval of venture investments supported both older.
In February, “Convercent” was funded by $10 million from companies such as “Sapphire Ventures” and “Tola Capital”, resulting in which the company’s general capital reached 47 million.
“Glint” received $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November, resulting from the general capital of $60 million.
These investments are not surprising if it is aware of the interrelated nature of companies, cultures and venture capital.
A growing study shows that today staff expected more than it was previously.
On the markets with a heavy competition, such as the Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects, are only the minimum required.
The employees want to feel that they accept and appreciate, and that they dedicate their time to a positive mission.
“When people are happy to work in the company, feel that they hear, and what they do, they are trying to make such a successful company,” says Nina Macquin, the Vice-President on global money and the satisfaction of staff in LinkedIn, where they are used as Convercent, and Glint.
Investors receive income when businesses from their portfolio go well; businesses are good when the staff are dedicated and involved.
If the third party analytical instruments promise to increase loyalty and integrity of staff, it is unseen that they have support.
As cultural specialists expressed on workplaces, it is important to provide data on the participation of staff.
But data are not useful until the suppliers do not take steps.
Indeed, if the company requests back-related staff, it may make the impression that changes are changed.
And if the changes do not get enough, or not all, it may be disappointed, and the staff lose interest.
“If you would ask for 4000 proposals, you should be ready to conduct 4000 meetings,” says Russell Rat, President of the Advisory Company Kotter International, who had to see how the company did a mistake, too much confidence in the collection of data.
“ Because if you don’t go to the end, the staff will ask: ‘ Have you heard me the truth?
Isn't you all right?
And if you are equal to me, why should I not be the same?
According to Errett, the Madison Reed company that is now conducting monthly staff surveys is able to take steps on the same day when someone reports about the problem with Glint.
And, after the recovery of contacts from staff, unnecessary speed of decision-making and communication, it has been able to reorganize a number of teams within the corporation borders and to introduce communication training to address problems.
The Ruby Tuesday company receives new knowledge of its staff and hopes that, in a long-term perspective, these knowledge will help her to keep staff in the area known as high-equity career.
“If you don't try to create a culture of transparency, you'll lose people” said Vitrano.
If you lose people, you're losing customers.
And if you lose customers, you're losing the company.
In Barnabas, the new asfalt is on the Crusnoarmean perspective
In Barnaole, cardiac measures were taken to eliminate the cause of asfalt losses at the Crusnoarmea perspective.
The place where the shoes had been held on a recently shocked part (reviewing with the Youth Street), was decided to “closure”.
Remember, a small part of the roads near the tramway has occurred because the land is located in the area of an unexploied network.
According to the words of the Vice-President of the Cities ' s Road Committee, the well-being, the transport and connection of Ivan Harmat, a detailed investigation and elimination of the proposed crimes will be conducted in detail.
Depending on its results, necessary measures will be taken.
It is suggested that the rebuilding of uncommon communications and their betonization is needed.
This is reported on the official site of the outer capital.
The Broin's team should be further carried out because the National Sport Association has cancelled training two times a day
The time is near to the 11th evening; the thickness of footballists from the University of California in Los Angeles is delayed in order to deal with the new training fields of the camps.
Some of them cut off their footballs, finding shoes from the potato after the first pressing day of the sporting camp.
For many team players, these minutes are a break in the middle of the day.
The games registered at the summer occupation, after three-time training, are returned to the communities to prepare final reviews, and the next morning return to the Vassierman ' s football centre at 6:30.
Shortly before the Monday turned to Monday, the team trainer of Bruinz Jim Mora said: “The three days next, these men wait for the sea.”
That the National Sport Association has rejected the training of two times a day, which was planned to reduce the burden for players, in fact their working day – at least before the end of the reviews on Thursday.
As a result, the first three training team of the University of California was appointed at Los Angeles at 7:15 nights to be placed in and without that fleshly schedule of players.
The result of the lack of two trains a day has been more than a day with one training, and Bruinz has started a camp nearly a week compared to the last year and trained during the summer school for the first six seasons in the Westwide.
According to the schedule, they should take 18 trains to 20 August, incl. before starting official training for the first game in the sezon against the team of the Texas University A and M in September.
Mora said that it supported the change of the rules by the National Sport Association, despite that there was another point in the fleshly schedule of players.
“In three or four days, we give them this great burden, that is a serious test,” said Mara.
“ And they just overcome him, they're working, they're wonderful.
I think when we live up to Saturday and we'll have more time, it'll be really healthy."
When the camp ends, the California University in Los Angeles will train closed; it is a slight task, since its field is in a direct visibility with a relaxing park and from the neighbourhood of Laskin Center, a cheap hotel that has already been a bomb of football meats that have been protected by the doors.
Bruin's games should be employed with these weekends, but Mora allows that when rooms are free during the season, there may be a problem.
“We will be safe,” said Mara.
“ This is a serious problem, and I do not overcome the danger, predicting that someone can get out of the room, sit there and record a video training.
If you have a training video, it's very serious.
But we're gonna be safe there and we'll be safe at the park number 8.
We'll do everything we can do with what we have.
I'm not gonna be too worried about this.
We have a plan."
All victims of therapy in Petersburg are described from the hospital
All the victims suffered during the therapist at Sancto Petersburg metro in April are deleted from the hospital.
This was reported in the press office of Anna Miyan.
On the end of July, three people remained in the stations, transmitted the TV Centre.

Facebook enhances facts and expectations to fight factual news
Facebook will send more information that suspicious texts to an independent expert and show their arrests under the original posts, stated on the fourth largest social world network that is trying to fight such factual news.
In the statement on its website, the company stated that it began to use improved machine training algorithms to recognise possible artifications, send them to verification, and may show the results of the expectation in the original post.
Facebook was criticized as one of the main ways to disseminate such factual news, which many believed that the presidential elections in the United States were influenced by the presidential elections in 2016.
This issue is also actively discussed in Europe after French elections were made wrong before the Presidential elections in May, and in Germany, before the September elections, the support of the plan to trace social networks if they would not be operatively removed by the disadvantaged posts.
On Thursday, in a single German declaration, Facebook reported on the testing of the new fact-expected algorithm in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"Only to see what messages are opposed by independent checkers, people want to have a broader context to make reasonable condemnations that they read and share," wrote in their Facebook blog Sarah Suu, a Facebook news manager.
She adds that Facebook will continue to test the function of "associated articles" and work on other changes in the newsletter to address the problem of factual news.
Create a Roman-Comics: one lock in English history
In the past 40th century, Scotney was cut into a musical "Squeeze", and in the 1970s and 80s, Margaret Tatcher had been inseparable.
But 700 years old from his swimming place in the river of Buil, in Kent's graph, he watched a burning history around, and now inspired Jamie Rods, a copy hair and a squirrel to historic documents in Roman Comics.
"I think it's so beautiful - look at a man who died 300 years ago," he said with encouraging.
"You're feeling that personally when you hold this letter into your hand."
The "Zack in England" covers the period from the mid-earth century to the Evardiaan era and tells about the families living in Scotty; each history illustrated one of the young British artists - Izek Lenkewit, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book of Rods based on archives: in 2014 he wrote "Dead Man and Other History" - a collectioner on the materials of the British Library; the project was unexpectedly cut it into the depth of the soul.
"My man could cut a simple print on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent who worked on the knobs," said he.
"This is the impression of his finger."
And the letters will always shoot, because in that time, the fire was burned.
And 300 years later, in the future, you think you're there too.
Oh, like I love the archives."
For a man who was covered by such an old shock, receive support from the National Fund and the English Arts Council and to live in the shell of four months "Verily, I have a little fun there" seems too good to be true.
The Rod's whole days studied a "new" victorian shelter, walked through the archives and considered a number of counts of name and old things, for example, the heads of the shoes or bottles that were in the wheel.
He walked on the park and on the distance of the old rock, talked to forests, gardens, and sometimes with artists who worked over the illustrations of his book.
Then the night he said, "He sweared the whiskey and sit down to write."
Scotney's stories have not been understood because the National Fund had been fully accessed to it only in 2006 when the last heritage, Elizabeth Hassy.
When Rods came there for ten years, the officers just started to find a archive that he describes "what the aristocratics cast out for centuries."
Thursdays in the British Imperial, maps showing what he had to say: "You think that land disputes are missing, says Rods, but there are two families over this beach.
That's right, guys."
In some stories, the shell collection is a broader point for broader research in the English history: for example, in the Rabotnik, the hero is only one of the building shells to join the Krysian Revolution in 1381.
"Thes have information about the burn in the castle in 1380, in the book called Kent and Saxes," says Rods.
"Christ resurrection began in these places, and I thought that the bunt was an appropriate start.
Maybe they were linked?"
Other surprises are strongly linked with the stories, for example, the "Peace of the Priest" in which the Darrell family has seven years hidden himself during the English Reformation.
Or “Contrabandist” on the 19th century's contrabandist Arthur Darrell, who, as they believe, smiles his own horns, shocked stones (this was discovered for a few years).
Darrela is the loved family of Rods from all those who lived in Scotty: "My men seemed to have been perfectly sweet, they used forever in debts and lost money for what they couldn't allow.
In various generations, Darrela had solved their problems with debts, marrying rich older women, - I represent them as a company of sympathy men that can be able to be able to be paid for the heritage of large states."
After the end of the work in the Rods store, others are looking for a unique writer experience.
He lived two weeks in the Finnish smell, where he wrote a graphic novel about Elmániaki, a place where he was satanator at the beginning of the XX century, and then he grew again in the forest.
But Scotty remains a special place for him.
"I was worried to go," he said.
"I felt like that, shit, I have to go back to real life."
Fiftieth larger banks choose Russia.
The Conflict in the Russian Bank Association (ARB) is developed: following Sberbank, WTB, VTB-24, Alfa-Bank, Gazprombank, Russian Husk, Benbank and FCC, still seven credit organizations are going to leave this public organization.
Thus, at least 80 per cent of the market will be higher than the ARB organizations.
However, this is not just the outcome of all banks claiming to break up with the ARB, leading to negotiations with another public organization which combines credit institutions, the Association of Regional Banks " Russia " , which is known by Anatolia, Chairman of the Financial Market Committee, acknowledged, as a result of the last session and the most effective leader of the thinking committee and the deputy for the early preparated legislative projects.
The conflict was started within the ARB during the debate at the Federation Council, when the Interregional Bank Council considered new legislation projects, in particular providing a new classification of banks depending on the size of the capital.
The President of the ARB then stated that the draft legislation was adopted in favour of larger banks, which thus tried to limit the possibilities of small and medium-sized banks in the regions by encouraging their customers.
Among the other claims, it sounded and criticized in the address of the Centre, which, in the sense of Tossane, has not always been justified to call licences into some banks, so that, in fact, the representative of the CBI was reflected: many leaders of the overtracked banks, in particular the ARB, had entered into the guidelines of the ARB.
It seems that this exchange of inter-exclusing views in a very sensible relationship with the main banking environment and became visible in order to make the 15 larger banks declared inconvenience with the ARB policy, began preparing to enter the Russian Association that “the effectiveness of the work of the ARB is at low level and the constructive dialogue within the bank community is not actually undergoing”.
The instructors will be better.
What's going on?
Let us immediately respond to the main question that occurs with a small deal or a conflict in the banking area or closer to it: there will not be any threatening for the banking system to increase the reliability of the banking system.
It refers to Anatolia Axako, who is known for its attractiveness in all the interests of banks and customers, professional high-level that is high-quality in the Centre: almost all CBI guidelines are present at annual associations activities, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator are through the expert evaluation of the "regions".
In the career-organization plan, it is apparently not possible that special triumphs have been expected.
Indeed, the ARB is in an unfair financial and administrative situation after the remaining of such powerful and influential participants with their contributions and lobbyist opportunities.
However, in this older, in 1991, the organization of the banking community, in order to continue to enhance bank legislation and the area of monetary and medium-sized treatment in general.
It is not possible to say that Russia's association with dictatorships are ready to take at any conditions of new members, judged on the reaction of her leader, Aksa, Anatolia, "also much wishes"), which still on 21 July in the press of the parliamentary press, stated that, in the next day, the representatives of the BCNs asked me to consider the possibility of building our Russian Association.
Their proposals are to increase the vote of bankers in the Association Council, and more attention to new bank technology.
The negotiation process is now under review of the proposals for both parties is prepared for an external association agenda that will take place in Sozie in the midst of September within the international banking forum.
That's where we'll be.
Anatolius Axacks also stressed that the " sniper is not holding", called the possible new leader of the updated Russian Association, Georgia Luttonski, who would leave a post by the Vice-President of Centerbonka, high-hargaging its business and human quality.
On August 18, Anatoly Aksacks, who is now displaced in the Cloma, plans to stop the vacation and arrive in Moscow at the foreign meeting of the Russian Association Council, which is urged to consider the agenda of the " Russian intern entry".
Introduction of benzine engines in Russia's large cities will not be limited
The Vice-President, Nicola Assaul, said that, instead of media communications, the entry of a benzine engine in Russia's large cities would not be limited.
It's a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept, which must be slowly improved in the environment.
And there's a concept to move immediately to nucleus emissions.
I think we're not ready for this.
More questions: From what year?
It's the same level at the frame lozzing level -- let's just bann it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
The whole city is closed?
"20 years old - I don't know, maybe it's going to happen", brings the word of the Minister.
Previously, the Yezware newspaper reported that at 17 August, the Vice-Premier Arcadia Dvorokouk was mandated to study the possible options of the management of electric transport presented by the PAO Camaz Sergeem Kugogi.
Among the proposals, newspaper information, the use of DSS machines in large cities and cigarettes.
Washington changes the rules of receipt of grencards.

The demonstration of sex-roads is real, and that should be worried about us.
We did not think that 2017 could not be worse, and a new report on technological success was issued in the production of sex-fabrics.
Md.
Sex robots are now in the centre of attention.
The Fund has recently issued a report dedicated to sexual development in the nearest 5 to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharky, a professor of workshops and the artistic intellectual of Shephill University and FRR, we should be able to deal with their exhibition.
Users can select colours of works, box forms, and leg type.
"Their chemistry are in this regard, but the companies are already sent them to consumers, and we will soon see them much more", said Sharke, presenting the new report.
Current sex clouds have evolving from their sweet assemblies in work with a heat-warm hair, and almost human snakes that are in the art intellect.
Users can also "set" their works on their own sculptures by choosing all the colors of the eye and shapes of the work to the form and the footsteps.
But the fact that many works have "life" compared with which the Stepford Gene would be very progressive, is more worried.
Current sex cucles have become workers of the silicon hair.
For example, the RealBotix Roboter company allows users to emphasize quality works that they find, for example, attractiveness.
There are still sex works of Roxxxy Gold, developed by "True Companion", which are designed with the already programed individuality, for example, "World Farra" produces a fantastic impression, and "Dia Wendy" has a "mood" character.
"The Roxxy Gold has a character that is beautiful to you," says the True Companion website.
So she loves what you love, does not love what you don't love, and so on.
It changes the vision during the day like the real man!
She may want to sleep or smell, or she can "be in order".
There are many concerns for sex workers, not in the last time because they replace real relationships, but are worried more about the substantial image of women, association with the violence of the Cold (lease the opposite) Farao.
The True Companion website Roxxy compares the elector only for men.
"If a woman (sic!) may be elector, why cann't a man have Roxxy?" says the website.
But these sex robots are not just fetiches or just new sex games.
Their appearance and all the increasing complexity indicates something more dark and deep in our culture, as a disappearance of gender equality towards the desire of sex with the submission of an optional addition.
Of course, most men will not purchase sex robbers, and even though FRR notes their growing population, they remain on the peripheral of the consumer culture.
But what happens to us from the peripheral may be very learning about the meanings of the epoch in which we live.
And many people are not stupid and are not aggressive until the free market will give them an opportunity.
This is not a convergence - that these complicated sex-roots appeared just when women ' s rights were threatened in the world when the Belarus house is the President, who rejoices what had to come to women.
The most terribest in the television "Service Press" is not graphic images, cuts and eye eyes, namely how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Galaad is an overwhelming, but now it doesn't seem to be so big.
The goal of the sex-working industry is to achieve such physical likeness to real women (e.g. pornographic proportions) which allows technologies.
Their creators want to be shocked by people to copy the movement of the human body.
But, in fact, their "harrakers" work is not like real women.
They can't leave with their partners or leave them.
They have no life or biography - nothing that could indicate independence or anything else that could destroy the illusion of full dependence.
Otherwise, they are beautiful slaves.
Or, as it says in 2017, the officers.
The born of Los Angeles Yunjin (Puh) Jeter, who has been speaking for the collection of Ukraine since 2013, does not help our national team at the Basquetball Championship of Europe, whose final part starts 31 August.
In the portal interview, BeBasket reported the General Manager Andrey Lebedev.
We tried to agree with Jeter, but, unfortunately, he will not come in the family circumstances.
We're going to Euboasket without a natural player, because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This will give opportunities to our youth players," he said.
Remember: In the direct participation of Jeter, the Ukrainian collected a sixth place in Euroacket-2013 and first came to the Bacteball Champion, which was not able to overcome the group stage, and the U.S. birth took a medium game of 15.4 o'clocks, tried a kitchen and led 5 fees.
Jeter stopped speaking for the collection of Ukraine from the end of our national team, Michael Frathello, who left the post in 2015.
The Euborasket-2017 will take place at the same time in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian group tournament team will take place on the earth that has been promised.
In the support of the Murgin Group B, there will be five units: with Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Greece (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
In the course of the training for the tourism, our husband’s collection held two control units in which the Netherlands and the Belarus entered.
The great trampa ship?
It seems very wise to imagine the Mita Romney.
In the general era, the fact that the political disputes polluted by the American elderly were a micro-electronic disappearance of some families.
Among the Thanksgiving Day and Birthday, the American newspapers regretted the colonies about how to address the horrible parents that voted for Trampa.
It seems that we're all pressing soon.
It is less about the ability to connect the family to Trampa.
I'm going to write this because my cousin, the left poeses of Chicago, who was on the foot of the Republicans in his family, came to New York for this week.
She recalled me that the association to combat the common enemy could have a strong effect.
At the Trumpe House, all whom she knows, including a Republican brother with whom she discussed the policy of decades, were immediately and strangely found on one side.
It is, of course, well, on the dinner, but I can't think that in a broader context it may be pretty dangerous.
The trumpet has leaked the strength into the left flank, but the deforming effect of his government can all slow up to the right.
When we talk about Trampe and "Normalization" we mean that the uncertainty of the possibility that one time we'll stop to struggle his leaves.
There are, however, more doubtful scenarios in which the Trump "Normalizes" of the best right republicans, which are unexpectedly shown in the background of his standards.
I realized that I was very lacking today by the oldest desire of Mitt Romney, with a machine sweet dog and a 14 per cent tax (but at least we knew how it looks like his tax statement) compared to the Trump and the other seems very small.
When Tramp goes, the next Republic-Chairman will be enough to be in his own way to see a great step forward in it.
When my cousin went to the center, we went with the kids to the carsel in the Central Park, the largest carsel in the New York Park Department, and the best way in the city to lose $3 if you don't need coffee.
The shoes and smells, pictures of the sleeves on the central slaughter, are sweet clouds and animals that are shocking in the shock of the shock, and the smell of the music, as it's strange, brings a shock.
Such a lot of known things in this city are discovered: the species of sky clouds are slow, the building forces have come too much to cause trips, and the reality of the city does not succeed in the dreams.
Twentyty-five years ago, and I still worried that day when I learned that the area of Suisse Cottage is not actually a Swiss shoe (Ye Olde Swis Cottage), but a large circle crossing in North London.
And Carlosel in the Central Park is still an unfair, magnificent place in which two years of age, a child of 11 years and two women in fourty may have a good time.
If I could put the evaluation cursues, I would put five, but, happily, no one asked me about it.
And in university this week, I was asked to take a terminal card, to evaluate my "experience" purchase from one to five stars.
In the coffee around my street, the same more option to make a 15 per cent evaluation is the order for the slaughter.
As a result, it is not only the neutrality of interaction, but also the personal attitude to the situation that does not provide.
The poor soldier in the university was confusionally smiling until I was able to evaluate my experience with her credit card in five stars.
Oscar Pistorious translated from the prison to the hospital because of the pain in the wound.
Pistorus leaves a prison because of the visit to the doctor on the second time.
Last year, he was transferred to the hospital to treatment of shocks that, as a result of the arrestation, he received a fall in the camera.
Pistorus was sentenced for the murder after the appeal of the prosecution to the original sentence for an inadvertising murder.
He killed Stefan Camp early morning of the Valentin Day in 2013, shooted in it several times through the door of a toilet room in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorus said he took his friend for the nighttime night that was hidden in the toilet.
The Prosecutor stated that it was intended to make another protest, at this time against the six-year term of Pretoriaus, which, according to her words, was too milk.
The General Prosecutor stated that the appeal of the Supreme Court of South Africa and appeal would be considered in that year.
Pretoria may increase 15 years of age if the prosecution has been successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.

MIT Russia accused the United States Vice-President during the "Fruit War"
Declarations made during the European Tour, Michael Penns, US Vice-President, were criticized by the Russian Middle East.
"True, it is regrettable that Washington is still more deeply covered by the predominant ideologicalized stamps during the "friendly war", says the Russian external state.
Thus, the MIT reacted to the words Pens on Russian threats and attempts to resolve a violent crossing of borders that they were referred to in the Sub-Green.
The Russian Middle East has indicated the destructiveness of the election, or the Western or Russia, and the inevitableness of the thesis on the possibility of the inevitable entry of the whole South-East Europe into the NATO.
The Russian diplomates also recalled that the United States had violated international law, applying the force to defeat Kosovo from Serbia and thus set up another consideration of tension.
"Bringing American colleagues to stop Russia's slandering and its external policy line, which is unlikely based on respect for partners and the preparation for joint constructive work, on the mutual basis of interests," states the Russian Middle East.

" At the place of the event, law enforcements and doctors who operate the child into the medical institution, " reported in the National Police Head of Odes.
Medicines determined that the child was born for a few hours before his discovery, which proved to be a population.
During the initial operational and investigative events, a local residence of 36 years of age has been established.
Women also have three young children.
As noted in the chapter, the family observers had not previously occurred and had not been particularly taken into account.
The police are currently set up on the circumstances and reasons that women have taken into this event after the processing decision was taken.
The girl is under the guard of the doctors now.
As previously reported, a 21-year-old woman from Nicolave dismissed her infant child in the museum.
Gregory Leps: "I'm riding in the battle, but 55 is not 30."
One of the most persistent artists of the Russian estrade Gregory Leps in the nearest Sunday, reverses his 55-year-old.
Before the shop, the slaughter told the shooter of the shooting.
I remember your "potiner".
The Special Chair in the Luxury, Gloria Gaynor's shirt for a named, powerful slaughter over the Moscow River.
You'd like to take your next fifth.
Have the purposes happened?
If we talked about professionals, it was a lucky period.
I worked a lot, three times I passed with the guests of the whole country, giving up to 120-130 percent per year.
I put two bad albums.
Of course, I'm not the one I'm saying 20 years ago.
Biological times do not lie.
Get as I smell in my 30s, it's all weak.
However, I'm riding in the battle, but I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, I think I'm a different level.
You and the new album, first in three years.
Yeah, it's working on him now.
Indeed, we're all recorded in my study and now we're going to send it to Los Angeles.
It's called "What are you serious?" on a song that was written together with Timothy.
She's not completely ready, so we haven't planned her for anywhere.
We'll do this later when we'll call on her.
And we're presenting the album in November to the series of my jewelry concerts in the Moscow Crocus Steve Holle.
Your new platinum has put the hands of a beautiful American slaughter Chris Colman.
You think you wanted to join him in your stroke composition?
In my view, the Colman is one of the world's most excited slaughterers today.
He came to me to the studio, recorded his party.
I invited him to enter into my group, and Jeremy Colson (known browser participating in various projects. - " News") proposed.
But for a long work in Russia, they moved, slowly, excessively.
I'm talking about gonorrs from €35,000 to €45,000 per month.
Then I thought that in the post-commerce space I'm looking for pleasant musicians.
And I found Max Malesheva's beautiful slaughter.
Indeed, it is better to smell them.
Sometimes, I want to take some of them to be shocked, not for what.
For example, the guitarists of the Fodour Dosom are highly covered at the international level.
It writes western musical magazines, and it is invited to various hysterical festivals.
Steve Way, listening to his game, said "the new generation of guitarians, with another executive technology."
Your album is in Los Angeles, the American musicians work with you, but you still can't come in the United States?
Are you trying to remove this ban?
Now, honestly, I don't do anything.
There's a number of lawyers that do this.
As a musicer, I'm really sorry that I can't come in America.
I didn't tell you I know there.
Better than contact with the real professionals, it is more useful.
We're not hunting them, but we don't have such experience, schools.
Before the artists of our popular music for 70 years, they have not completely taken the tasks that American musicians have always solved.
They tried to make the maximum quality sound.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now why and Britain refused me to go for ten years.
But I'm going to give a visa documentation every year in the British Society so I'll be allowed to travel there and the main thing is to work there.
The last Europe is a favorable matter for me.
And you're planning a concert in Monaco, not commanded, but athic, right?
Yeah, there's a good Sporting room in Monte-Carlo, I've spoken there once.
Now they were invited again, and as I know, all the tickets on the gate are already sold.
You're going to go to "Rayma Wakele" starting on July 20, July?
She invited me, and I certainly called.
Lyma is a wonderful beach and a beautiful woman that can give himself and a beautiful ball and even a shoe.
After the guests and the jewels, as I know, you'd like to turn back to the Virgin High's creature.
Two albums with his songs are already in your discograph.
When's the third out?
Maybe in the next year.
But he'll be completely different.
I want to write a 80-90 piece of higher song in the same way as he did.
Just a voice and a guitare.
There's no other warning.
Acompanying me will be our famous musicer Timur Vederers.
I intend to participate in the album and Alexander Jacoblevich Disenbaum.
I talked about this topic, we have a good relationship, but he's busy, so let's see how it's going to be.
You and the songs of Boris Gingerskick slowly entered your repertoire.
Maybe you write his album?
Boris Borisovic is a beautiful man and a beautiful musician.
I sneaked with him several times and asked, can I sleep that song or otherwise?
He answered, "Grigory, I'll write songs to be done."
Please try, come on.
It's probably interesting to write this album.
Until I have no such task, but in the future, a two-year-old, if Boris Borisovic will not be reflected, I may have done that project.
If you don't concentrate fully on your production center.
I think, until you've done his capacity, did you not sign contracts with all artists that you're interested?
There's a whole range of executives I would have dreamed to have under my ship, but they are self-destined.
Do you mean Sergey Lazarev?
I invited him.
I can't agree with his repertoire, but he also has its development strategy.
And in my center, there's Alexander Panyots that I'm in Holos.
We concluded the treaty and worked with him.
In our pop music, these skins are rare.
It will be very regretted if he does not reach the heights that he has deserved.
I'm trying to draw him a repertoire, I'll take the slips.
I hope it's good.
I'm also trying to move on other artists of my center: buy them songs, smiling poets, sometimes their tracks cut into tele and radio anals.
If they are not reaching large heights, I will still bring our cooperation to the logical conclusion.
They'll get the album, a few clips.
And further, if they want, they can go on my way, and I'm not going to wait for them to return money into them.
Although I'd be glad if some of them get commercial success and pay for me the percentage we agreed in the contract.
But if this doesn't happen, I'm not going to make anybody up of oxygen.
Let everyone work, kill, prove how I've ever shown.
If you're supposed to make a guest tour to Ukraine tomorrow and make sure that you're coming to the country, you're going?
I'm still invited.
It is mainly about closed events.
And what's about a big tour...
I am a man of my country, a Russian, who believed that I fly in Syria on the same plane that then disappeared.
If tomorrow you'll tell me that you're going to fly to some other point in the interest of the State, I'll fly.
And I'm thinking about the bloggers and other critics about me.
I'm so sorry that this situation has reached us with Ukraine.
Because I believe that we are one people and must be together.
I regret that it would not be done at least in the nearest time.
I gave you a year in Ukraine for 40-50 concerts.
We met anywhere.
It's very grateful.
And with several Ukrainian artists, Ana Lorak, the World of Lobod, Artem Loak...
In Ukraine, the mass of the gifted people and sincerely regret that they cannot now be fully able to use their talents to a large Russian audience.
Musicals must combine and develop people.
I would be pleased to invite some classic Ukrainian executive in Russia, such as Slava Vacarchuk, and made a joint concert with it.
But I think it's unlikely at this moment...
Andrey O'Hookock moved with a spaciole
As it was known, the technical director of the Eastern Space Andrey Ojokock began working in the State of Space and Production Center (CHNPC) named Cronchev.
He was previously employed by the Middle East space, but because of the diversity of the management of the Headquarters of Land and Space Infrastructure (CANKY) was transferred to the Employment in Moscow Fields where the production coordination was taken.
The channel of Mr. Ohokoki will not be: the post of the technical director, likely to be disrupted and the functionality is disrupted by the CANKI units.
The technical director of the Eastern and Vice-Chairman of the CANKI on Technology Development, Andrew Ohjokock, moved to work in the GCNPSC named Cronchev, said a number of spatial industry companies, as well as the Government Apartment.
"He's working for a new post for a few weeks," said the partners in the hotel.
The operational comments of CANKY were unable on Friday, and Mr. Ojokocks did not have a comment.
However, information has been officially confirmed in the CRC.
He decided to move to the Director of Production Coordination, as he said to the company. — Andrey Ojokock, which was put before him, has completely fulfilled a start minimum for the first start of Eastern space.
Mr. Ojokock went to work in the CANKY in 2013, with the duty of space armies, in particular in Baikonoure, and in Plezeki, the first Coast Vice-President of the Commander.
In 2009, Andrew Ojokocks became a criminal act.
It was condemned by his responsibilities: regional commerciants were obtained for derogation of the claims but did not comply with the obligations taken for the purchasing of separate missile parts in the Archangean area and the Republic of the Commission.
In 2012, the court acknowledged it innocent.
The technological development responsibilities were distributed to various projects, but most of them were the strike of space in the Forest.
The Federal Space Agency of Oleg Ostapenko in the Interview said directly that the situation in Eastern " had been critical already in October 2013."
The case was a strategic error in the planning: the completion of the structure and the completion of the first time of the Union-2.1 reporter was planned at the same time at the end of 2015.
To end up until the end of the year, the strike decided for a half years ago and the deadlines were delayed from December to July 2015.
In order to accelerate the process, the CIA specialists began to spend a parallel mount of technological equipment on unbuilding objects.
The main part of this idea was Andrey Ohokocks.
In spite of the existing risks and all the results of the transfer (the Union only fled 28 April 2016), the idea was justified, said the source of the code: "Only we would still have done no start from the East and would work a structure."
Vice-Premier Dmitri Rhozin, who was smoking for the creation of the space, called Andrey Ohokok his "space Susunnial", but he almost always requested information about the stroke period.
He recalled Mr. Ohlocks and the direct: For example, in the interview, he proposed to stop the Federal Agency for the Special Construction (Spestry) status of the only Eastern and direct executive to work with sub-Special operators: "Why do we all have to constitute the eggs in one corner of the Spicester?"
This idea has been supported by the Government.
Since 2017, the CENKY has taken its duty to complete Building and Technology Compilation planned in the fourth quarter.
According to the data of Mr. Ohjoki to the new workplace, there was a difference with the CENKI leadership on the way to complete the structure of space and complexs, as well as the methods of work with sub-organized organizations.
"That's going to be better for all," said one of the mine-members who participated in the Eastern Review.
The Government Agence Officer, on the other hand, calls out a strange decision: "He was one of the best specialists, finding him a equal replacement will not be easy."
According to the data " . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
There is a two-specific education program in music schools
In the future, students of children's music schools will be able to receive two specialities simultaneously.
According to the director of the Department of Science and Education of the Hollowstors, it is possible to re-educate the disciplinary disciplines and the issue of the payment of other jobs in second speciality to decide with special grades, transmits "Ria News".
"The Ministry of Culture has taken this issue to control, and we are together with the experts community to develop a mechanism that allows two specialities to learn, but will not at the same time contrary to the effective education legislation", said Goubanko.
In the past Friday, Wolfmier Putin, a student of the Child Center, Maria Andreev, reported that he had to pay the second special objects of the second speciality in the Moscow Conservation.
The girl told her that it was learned by the script and forthepiano class and had the profits of competitors in both directions.
The head of the State acknowledged its issue very active and promised help.
The 17-year-old Russian wall in Mexico is detained in 17-year-old Russian
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian Kirill N., who is on the wall of the high building, reports the port El Universal.
The university occurred in the capital of Mexico.
A young man with two unknown men passed through a three-milh-milh board in the territory of Nestle's office buildings, and he was shocked on one of his bathrooms.
He did not use any special insurance, insurance and credibility.
The young man has been detained on the shooting.
The Department of Public Security officers left him on the ground on the helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Migration Institute.
It explains whether the youth is legally on the territory of the country.
A video with a young man who was higher, was popular at the Internet.
Users called a young "Home Pope".
The media writes that such experiments are the hobby for it.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate can help to facilitate GDP.
Red meat and chocolate are accepted to be a shock for your drinking trace.
However, recent studies relate to the reverse: The dieth, rich with milk whites and milk products, can help those who suffer a fever disease.
This is an inexcellent disease that causes approximately 1,3 million people in the United States and 3000,000 in Britain, leads to skins and abuses of animals, chronic or bloody food, weight loss and extreme weight.
Normally, the symptoms are advised to avoid meat and milk products, but researchers from the University of Washington have established that the main triptophan mixture of white triptophan has contributed to the production of immune cells that increase the tolerance of the skin.
Dr. Marco Collonna, a feed researcher, explained that immune cells in the kitchen would be monitored that the medium micros are not in the body.
Cells that can be able to launch the breast process are equivalent to cells that increase tolerance, protecting the body and do not cause sensitive tissue.
If the equality is too strongly violated by the disappointment, it may lead to smoke diseases of the kitchen.
Experiences showed that the mouse with a certain bacteria in the kitchen appears to increase the tolerance of cells.
And this bacteria needs a triptophan, one of the white building elements, to start the appearance of these cells.
Professor Collonna said, "We have established a connection between one kind of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuter, which is part of the normal microbiology of the kitchen, and the development of the population of cells that increase to tolerance.
More triptophan was in the museum food, more of these immune cells had."
He suggested that the same will be working in people: the combination of L. Reuter and the rich triptophene of the dieth could contribute to more tolerant and less circumcision in the kitchen.
Dr. Louis Servantez-Barragánwas, studying the diversity of immuno cells, found that one group of these cells had experienced muscles, and another group that belonged to the same line but had not individually contained them.
She suggested that the difference could be called by a microbic muscle -- bacteria communities, virus and skins, which are usually living in a iron and skin trace.
The cell of the mouse was seen, and six types of bacteria were found in the mouse with immune cells, but without the mouse.
The muscles generated in a stell environment that did not have a good microbiom and which did not develop this kind of immune cells have received L. Reuters and immune cells appeared.
To understand how bacteria influences the immune system, researchers increased L. reuters in the iron environment and then transferred small portion of iron without bacteria to the unexpected immune cells from the mouse.
Immuno cells have become more tolerant cells.
When the active component was separated from iron, it was a bleeding product of triptotan processing known as a 3-mole oxygen.
When researchers doubled the number of triptophans in the museum, the number of cells increased by about 50 per cent, but when the triptophan level has been decreased, the number of cells also slowed to two times.
Dr. Servantez-Barragán explains that people have the same increased tolerance of cells as the mouse, and most of us have L. Reuters in their sweet and sweet tract.
Inconsistent, whether triptophane products in L. reuter development of cells have been found in the same way as the mouse, but people suffering from smoke diseases have found defects in genes related to triptophine.
She says: "That may be the development of these cells to us and must be strengthened, since these cells depend on the revolving processes on the internal surface of the bones.
The high level of triptotan at L. Reuters can potentially lead to the expansion of their population."
According to Joseph Mourinua, Manchester Yuntead was a 'ganie' in the face of Nigeria Matich
“Manchester Yunetted” put “gania” in the face of Nemania Match, he believed that George Mourin, after the defenseman was in the massage against the Sampдорia on the midday night.
The game acquired for 40 million feet in the Chelsea began with the profit of 2-1 in Dublin at the last presidential shop of the University, before the WEFA supercub mask against the Real Madrid, and was impressed in the role of the semi-defender, while the games in Pogby and Andréa Transior were pleasing first when they were grateful.
However, as Mattichi did not participate in the presidential Chalsey Tour in Asia, he was seriously uncomfortable to playing, and he was only 45 minutes out of that, as it said, Mourinia requires a processing before the first-leading season.
“He needs time, but his experience, mind, gentleness in how he thinks – he thinks as a football,” said Mourin.
"We will help him prepare as soon as later."
Like Matty, his new friends, Victor Lindelèf and Romell Luke, started playing at the Aviation Stadium when Mourinia began to form its main component at the beginning of the next session.
The Independent newspaper reported on this week that Mourini would like to take three other players, but underlined that the club had already got fantastic results, taking three of the four games he would like to first play.
“I thank the club for the winning of three of four,” he added.
“I like more if they get me four of four, but they have already been very hard for me.”
Lithuania's former social-democratic leaders agree to remain in the right coalition
An ex-president of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, Algerds Butkawits and Geminins Kirkilas, as well as the former seed-shaped social-democratics from the Chaсловas Ursinas, called for one-party to remain in the rule of coalition.
As reported by the Parlamentary Journal, the Union of Crescents and Greens, the Social-Democratic Party has initiated a debate on whether it should remain in the legal coalition.
And here, three elderly partners were called to one party with an open letter, which states: "It is understood the disappointment of the committees on the outcome of the elections, but the coalition with the "Christs" has created us a low and not very easy, but the conditions for further implementation in the goals of social justice, which are prescribed under our initiative in the Government's programme, and to maintain the political domination of the Left Centre on Rights."
According to the former party leaders, in the debate, "the opinion was based on emotions without specific arguments".
The authors are afraid that the unplanned action of their party may bring Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
Anton Mamaev’s invasion was appointed by a slaughter
Mosgourth was sentenced by Anton Mamaev, a colonial disabled person, from the four and half years of the death of freedom to the slaughter, to 200 000 rubs.
Previously, the convict was released from the AIDS.
In that regard, Mosgour Court confirmed that the accused was a criminal because he organized a slaughter in an ex-special battle.
The Moscow decided to strike the punishment of Antonio Mamaev up to 200 thousand rub.
"Mamaev is a organizer of disgrace, which also forms a crime, and, accordingly, a person should be engaged in criminal responsibility," explained the "e.g. the secretary of Mosgourta Uran Sokov.
In this case, the court had been taught on the health of Mamaeva, the real circumstances of the case that had not been imposed.
Furthermore, the Court applies to p. 64 A.R.R.R.RF, which would be attributed to the punishment below.
With regard to Mamaev Vasilia of Serostano, the court had not established circumstances that would have become the basis for changeing the level of conviction and change.
Anton Mamaev himself stated that it remained unpleasant by the Moscow decision.
I am disappointed by the court.
The only legal decision would be justified, and it would continue to fight for justice.
His lawyer Andrey Orlow did not exclude the complaints of the sentence in Moskow Court and the Supreme Court.
"We will use all markets to affect the European Court of Human Rights," he stated "RiA News".
Remember, the 28-year-old Moscow, Anton Mamae, who suffers a permanent museum astrophy, has become a criminal case on Thursday last year.
Individual claims that he purchased a motor driver in acquaintances for 1600,000 rubs to sell then.
However, the owners of the motorcycle, among which the former specialist, claimed that disability and his assistant of the Serostana had chosen their property, threatening to adopt violence.
On June 30, the district court of the Timurun, Moscow, condemned Vasilia Serostano to three colony years, and Antonio Mamaev, four and half years of punishment, with a punishment in the colony of the general regime (s. 2 p. 162 CFR).
After the disabled disability was placed in the AIDS, the Joint Hall, the Prosecutor of Human Rights Assigned to President Tatiana Moscolka, was linked to the case.
As a result, in the midst of July, Anton Mamaev was released from the SIDA by the same decision of the Timurish Court.
The protection was, on the other hand, condemned the decision of the first instance in Moskow.

The Reception for the White House was charged to payers in thousands of dollars
According to the reports of the TIME magazine, the White House decided to heat the Southern Sea Sea in the United States Industrial Production event in the last month was $24,000 payers.
The White-Green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Mariine One and the ship, was a central element of the United States construction programs held in Belarus on 17 July.
President Donald Traamp, Vice-President Mike Penns and the senior officials of the White House have examined technology products from all fifty-first States.
The shipping in Connective was sent close to a fleet from Man State, a fire car from Visbourg and a Mississippi car driver.
According to the first episode of marine helicopters (HMX-1), the Heavy Heaven Office responsible for the Heavy Management, the White House Army Office was equipped with the presence of the helicopters in a private order, or “FRAGO” only 36 hours before the helicopter was landed in the Southern Heaven on the case of a “negative” event.
“I just wanted you to make sure that you know, because it is an uncommonly widely widely in the press,” wrote the commander HMX-1 in an electronic letter to your chief, the first Vice-President of the Sea-Chair Corporation, which was referred to in the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would come to the Southern Meeting about 7 a.m. on 17 July to participate in the event designated at 3 p.m. and remains there before the gas will be released between 6 and 9 at the same night.
The letter adds that if the shipment is delayed from the White House, the second escape is required for the return of the police in accordance with the limitations of work time.
The first equipage conquered the helicopter during the event, and the security officers remained close to the aircraft until it was on the ground.
From the records received by the TIME magazine, it remained unexpected whether the second escape was needed.
The Hatcha Act prohibites the use of public property for political purposes by federal servants.
According to the records, HMX-1 has clarified whether the event was not contrary.
“Any otherwise we asked whether it was a violation of the Hatcha law, and they answered us that no,” wrote the commander.
“ It seems to be a place where you are, ” answered the Vice-President.
The activities “Overed in America” were declared by the White House as an official event, and the Hatcha law was not distributed.
But even official events have political notes.
During the event, the President made efforts to promote the reform of health reform, which was formerly developed in the senate, and encouraging the attempts to regulate Government decisions.
Use of aircraft named “Marine One” and “Air Force One” for political purposes is not a new revelation.
The Chairpersons are required to use them for travels.
But to ask them only for photos.
Tramp was the subject of the discussion in February when the President's aircraft was on the back plan during his first predicted train in Melbourne, Florida State, and his accommodation in Twitter was incarcerated by the complaints of his President's shipping plane.
“The white house in the resort from the ‘Feated in America, ’ which has been presented products from 50 American workers from American materials,” said Vice-Secretary Press of the White House Lindsey Walters.
The HMX-1 Equipages are often trained around the Washington Aglomeration and the Southern Sea in order to make the President of the United States in the White House precisely up to Duyma.
When Trump was at the G-20 Summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 conducted 58 train stations in the White House.
According to one of the officials, the equipment carried out for the event “Only done in America” was recorded on the basis of the necessary training fields per month.
In that day, the units also had 11 additional hours under “non-president support tasks”.
According to the White House, the taxpayers did not allow any other expenses for events.
The representative of the Sikorsky company reported that the company did not participate in the demonstration organization in the South Sea.
HMX-1 does not take into account the budget for the Presidential positions and determine the precise amount of events difficult.
However, according to the time rates of the Ministry of Defence for 2017, the return rate of the Ministry of Defence for VH-3D is $24,380 per hour.
The office record stated that the air aircraft was 30 minutes per minute with its aeroplane based on the Kuanticco marine flight in Virginia.
The White House claims that the real value of the use is very much below the rate.
“Reasoning the value for payers, based on an example of reimbursement rate, perfectly wrong,” says Walters.
“These examples include personal composition, services and many other unreasonable costs, including annual allocations”.
According to the research carried out by the RTD Corporation in 2015, reimbursement rates do not include the value of personal composition, but, indeed, take into account the value of the hot, services and expenditure specified in the treaty.
At that time, the former secretary of the White House, Shon Spaceer, was expressed in the protection of the hepatitis use for events.
“ The idea to demonstrate the things made in America this week” said Spaceer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the Connectics company are very proud of the fact that they contribute to national security, and that they exist, I think, hundreds of people, if not thousands of people who are working more depending on this.
And I think, as the majority of the Americans, that we're all proud of this is a heavy and another military technician, whose creation has been instantly worked so much Americans.
Surely, it is appropriate to take care of this."
It was unreasonable if Trump interacted with a helicopter, obsessing the South Sea during the event, but he was exactly located on a driving place in the fire car.
In the White House, Traamp returned to the representatives of the Sikorsky company, searching for a print on his own company product fleet.
"I'm good to know Sikorsky," said the President. - I have three of them."
