Food debt to European inflation
The main basis for the increase in inflation measured in the euro zone is the higher food price.
In the 13 countries of the euro area, the growth was higher than expected in November, after the 2.6% in October a annual inflation rate of 3.1% was registered, as reported by the EU Statistics Office in Luxembourg.
Official prognoses have been out of only 3 percent, reported Bloomberg.
On the contrary to the American, British and Canadian Notice Bank, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not deal with the Leitsins, and the interest rate would benefit from the increased raw material prices and the decrease of unemployment in the decline of inflation spirit.
The ECB is intended to keep the inflation rate below two percent, or at least right at the second-percentage market.
According to a analyst, the ECB is in the Moon Moon: the inflation should be "reconciliated" to exclude the need for later action.
In November, inflation rates reached a 12-year record in Germany; in Spain the rate of 3,6 to 4,1 per cent.
The increased food and energy prices are responsible for the growth of inflation in the euro area.
The MATIF switch notation was 88 per cent, and the course for soja bombs also reached a recording since 1973.
In 2007, there was a significant dilution in food oil and milk products.
In this year, the world market price for raw oil increased to 52 per cent - in the last month the price per fase of the black gold nearly $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will increase from 2,1 to 2,5 per cent in 2008, but 2009 is estimated by a decline of 1.9 per cent.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts are derived from a 3-percent inflation rate, but the average average rate of the year is 2.1 per cent.
For 2008, experts accept the ECB that the interests of the ECB will be doubled.
Gallup oriented government crisis
After long-term stagnises, the number of Fidesz Sympathisists has grown significantly up to the beginning of December. The party has the largest base stocks, while the approval of socialists has reached a 13% of the depth point.
In the participating elections, the difference thanks to the high determination of the opposition candidates is clear: more than two thirds (71%) are a fifth (20%) approval against the MSZP.
MDF and SZDSZ are under the parliamentary increase: they are in the total population to two percent.
The number of parties chosen has grown by a percentage in two camps.
As compared to the last point, the overall economic estimation has continued to deteriorate - not yet was the share of those who judge the economy of the country as a "severly bad" as so high (41%), while further 46 percent of them are "secularly bad".
After hopeful perspectives in spring and summer, families will see the change of their financial situation again be pessimist.
For the next year, the majority of the population is calculated with another deterioration of the situation; only one ten is a decline.
A Gallup investigation conducted in December showed that 71% of the complaints - a historical high - were judged the work of the Prime Minister as "before bad than right".
Twenty percent of the claimants have great confidence or confidence in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while the share of the claimers for Victor Orbán 38%.
round 54% do not trust the government head, compared to 27% of mis confidence against the Fidesce Chief.
One of the indicators of political stimulation is the number of whom I think that inadequateness with the President can also be obtained without a government exchange.
After the disappointment in the last October 35% for the remaining of the government and government heads, this share today is only 20%, while relative majority (33%) looks for the solution only in new choice.
After their interest in the people's vote, 60% responded that they would participate "with security" and more than 20% would "possibly" their vote.
For comparison: Parliament's choices would take place at this Sunday would be only 55% to the urine, and 15% to keep their participation "probably", and in view of these tendencies the result of the vote would be decreased.
74% would be against the study costs, 79% against the practical expenditure, and 84% against the hospital day.
In the group of "security" participating in the people's vote, the shares of the opposites of research, practice and hospital budgets would even contain 81, 84, or 89%.
The first, Tesco, also increases nearly one fifth
Hypermarkets in the Budator Trade Area have also maintained the average price increase of 16% from the last year, with the difference that this year did not increase the increased value tax.
Articles from Napi Gazdaság
In the Budator Trade Trick, the cost of the normal Christmas Core of Napi also increased 16 percent this year, however, in all hyper-market price increases of over 1.000 HUF were registered.
After the prices in the food markets in the past December "davongalopied" are, it is not a percentage of drastic disappearance, compared to the higher, previous start level.
However, it is decreasing that this year is not even available for 10,000 HUF for the last year.
The price of the "Napi" carb exceeds the magic 10,000 HUF range at least 91 HUF in the markets investigated.
The highest price was 10.5753 HUF.
(In 6800 was the price at 6.800 HUF.)
The prices for unit and living fish remained nearly at the previous level, however, strongly increased prices for puttenbrustfilets, nuts and munchs.
Prices for meal and bread discussed the data of the Central Statistics Office of Hungary, but there was also 1 kg of breadweight for 139 fornt.
There was no competitive price rate in the product at less than 200 forint.
At the same time, the price of two liters of coca-Cola phandflasche was under 200 forrents, so the drink costed only 257 HUF.
However, the average of this year in the "Napi" market carbs comparison also depends on the most precious, and Cora is the most favourable.
Our calculations have shown that Cora's prices in the "Napi" cart against Christmas prices in the past 15 years, while Tesco and also increased by 18 percent.
The difference between the most suitable goods core of the previous year and the most cost of this year was 12%, while the increase between the latest price of the last year and the price of 21% of the current year.
The average price increase was 1.480.00 HUF.
The average price increase in the previous year was still at 1 1 1 6 00 forrent, but the increase in the tax increase was noted in the prices at last Christmas.
Indeed, the trade has taken arg: the good homes seemed to have not been so right to decide what price levels they should apply to the individual articles, as the impact of price increased on the consumption behavior was unlikely.
(When the handler plants badly the driving speed of a product, it may fall from significant profits in the price level that leads to the cost intensity).
In the past year, the decline of the "Napi" goods core was rarely decreased that the priceest corb exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 fornt, in spite of the price difference in the most suitable corb only 844 fornt.
In this year, such extremes were not observed, since the most precious corb was 1.6.30.00 forint more cost than in the previous year, and even at the latest, there was a price increase of 1.284.00 forrent.
In comparison with the last two Christmas meetings, a catastrophic price increase was increased, the price of the daily consumption items in the hypermarkets has increased in less than 20 months by more than 30%.
(This again does not confirm the data of the Central Statistics Office of Hungary: In some basic foods, the Statistical Office has established more than 30 per cent in the period of 12 months.
So in about meal with eggs.)
However, in the "Napi" carb, it seems to be nearly impossible because the price level of the product already tears in the past year is in the worst case of little more than 10%.
Obviously, the meals providers are in a higher position than the egg suppliers - however, they could decline the drastic price increase.
In the golden trade trip the hypermarkets do not contain; it will be reported by good years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three households no longer look at the prices.
It is purchased from large quantities, sustainable food goes into palettes over the ladentic.
Wednesday afternoon, there were unfinished skins in all three homes at the Kassa, when the number of customers were immediately explosed.
However, the country is reported to a smaller Customer Frequency, so that many of the researchers could not even reach the planned transfer, not only for food, but also for sustainable consumers.
Many places are separated to desinfects
Today, more than thousand infections were registered in hospitals that were to return to an inadequate interference with antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in hospitals, the overload of beds, the overload of staff - all factors that are not just perceived to the delay of infections, so the leading doctor of the National epidemiology Centre.
Many places are shared in desinfects.
In the Yanos Hospital Department of Traumatology, a MRSA infection was diagnosed in a short time.
The antibiotic resistant bacterium was found in a man-doing patients in the hospital after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year there was already a similar infection.
However, the loss of a serious car accident was deleted from the hospital, but little later the man had to return with a MRSA infection, and an important operation could still not be performed because of the bacteria, which is still in the body of the patient.
By 10 December this year, from hospitals 1094, multiresident infections were reported to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, so the leading doctor of the National Epidemiology Center, Karolina Böröcz.
So many, resident infections have been registered in the hospitals with security, but the dark figures should be higher.
About two thirds of infections (683 cases) were dissolved by MRSA, resistant staphylococcus areus against Methicillin-Oxacillin.
Staphylococcus areus (SA) bacterium causes some third of the people in their nest without caused disease.
SA-conditioned infections (such as hallucination, skin disorders, skin disorders or wounds) mostly react well on antibiotics, they are well healable.
However, if the resources are too high or indirectly used, they are from the good responding antibiotic resistant bacteria, which are rapidly extended in hospital hospital conditions.
In particular, in patients who have a deteriorated or sustained immune system, but also in older or smaller body weight, these bacteria can cause severe infections such as wound infection or blood infection, such as sepsis.
According to Yanos Hospital Director, MRSA infection is nothing special, such events belong to the Hospital Hospital Day.
The infection should not be changed with the epidemic, skin Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA is not where it is not searched.
Antibiotics
"Solf patients are isolated, the fleet personal takes gummi hands and masks in the supply, and we have the antibiotics necessary for treatment" - so Tibor Nyulasi.
The patients are studied at MRSA, but infection cannot always be avoided.
Rare samples
However, the majority of infected infections solved by MRSA would be prevented in hospitals, but the current conditions and circumstances are unfavourable for the recovery of the decline or expansion of the multiresident injuries, says Carolina Böröcz.
After this infection is predominantly present in hospitals and age houses, the spectacles should investigate the patients presented and isolate MRSA infected immediately.
However, in the Hungarian hospitals the microbiological sample is not so often practiced.
Not lastly because there is no aid to this investigation from the public hospital.
Therefore, most of the cases are only after day light when the patient has a significant MRSA infection, so the medical leader of the epidemiological centre.
From the European Union, there are strict recommendations on the application of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are in Hungary Directives for the treatment of certain infections and disease images.
Antibiotic therapys should be targeted, which means microbiological studies are necessary so that no resistance to the resources can be formed, but this directive will not always be maintained.
Among the ambulants, or in the basic supply, microbiological results are even more rare, says Carolina Böröcz.
Separate is used in desinfects
Scientific evidence show that MRSA is transferred from one patients to the other most frequently from the individual.
Thus, there is a great importance to handwave, or the path of hands and masks, but there are also significant skins in the hospitals.
MRSA is transferred by infection or contact, but it is not always possible to isolate the infected patients.
The rooms are often overcome, the beds are close to each other, although there should be a distance of at least 1,5 meters from epidemiological view.
As Carolina Böröcz continues to observe, it is unfortunately noted in the financially less well-being hospitals that are separated in desinfects, there are few workers, many patients - all factors that make up infections.
Such infections are obviously less often, in relation to the further dissemination of the inhibitor where these protection measures are maintained, says Carolina Böröcz.
Government programme against MRSA
MRSA infections to be obtained in the griff causes the illness insurance costs, therefore they will be fighted overall.
For example, in England, MRSA ' s prevention, or its inclusion in the government programme was held.
After first signs, the program has been successful - as the data published, the tendency of the MRSA infections is slow.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has declared the prevention of the development of multiresidents (including MRSA), and the prevention of infections in hospital hospitals to one of its priorities.
The mortality officer was not cut
In the case of an accident caused by the police head of the 21.I. Districts, the official advisory is now presented.
Attila Morvai, who killed a footnote on Tuesday at an auto accident, was not alcoholized or under drug impact, said on Friday, the president of the Budapest Supreme State Authority on Friday, after the official guest was presented.
The guest confirmed the results of the first investigation, according to which the police head had not consumed alcohol before he was put on tax.
The former police chief entered the Cossuth Lajos Street with his own Pkw in the XXII. He traveled to a 55-year-old man who surrounded the street to an unsigned place.
(But this is not a mild condition - the lenker has, even though footballers do not cross the road to the Zebra stretch.)
The footballer has been given his injuries after his income to the hospital.
According to the police reports, the Lenker tried a shock, and then returned his functions and asked for pension.
The Budapest State Authority has carried out its investigations to the incident.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police head had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
More EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Minister of Finance Yanos Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) have signed three credit agreements on Friday in Budapest in the total value of 400 million EUR. The money is intended to flow in education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) has granted a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental protection projects, which are undertaken by the Cohesion Fund, which has already been signed by the credit contract of EUR 200 million previously.
The amount of EUR 150 million will also be applied to the budgetary financing of education projects.
The EIB has granted a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary; the use of the remaining 150 million EUR will be decided later in the framework of the expansion of the credit contract.
In the field of innovation, the contract partners have signed an agreement over 50 million EUR, which will be previously entered into research and development programmes at the university Debrecen.
At the meeting, the U-Bankline 4 also came to language.
It was agreed that, when Hungarian has declared the details of U-Bank Financing with the EU, the original treaty and possible amendments will be again discussed again.
According to Yanos Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary with EUR 8.4 billion.
The credit rates are connected to EURIBOR, which is provided by the EIB with an amount of eight years, free of provision.
Bulgaria, the EU's real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - all Europe takes attention to the previously rare Balkan state.
What, where, and who will buy the EU's most suitable market, but who will be more struggle?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is now the most popular plant for real estate purchase in Eastern Europe, with favourable ski apartments and houses on the sea.
Between the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most popular in the sea, Albena, the "Gold coast", the "Son Coast", and the historical city of Sozopol and Nesseble, however, the real estate are also more demanding about Kavarna and Balcik.
According to the estimates of Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the countryside is also locked early or later investors, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, and the extensive area of Russia also represents more buyers.
The main town of Sofia also offers locked offers - trade and offices offer higher rates.
Bulgaria is to become one of the most attractive European golf paradise, and also to lock tourists next to the summer and winter season in the other two years.
As a result, predicting investmentrs are already buying largely, for example around Bansko.
Analysts seek to acquire real estate in Bulgaria also a change in their life change.
Most buyers are English, but they are also interested from France, Belgium, Spain, and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also presented, while there are largely Russian buyers at the black sea and in the ski regions.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to be denied purchased or revitalized real estate up to 50-100,000 euros, or discarded houses up to 5-15,000 euros, which then they renew themselves.
Good connection and accessibility and communication opportunities are largely written, but also close to a large city, business and doctors are crucial for the buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a Ferendo Kital (Bulgaria was entered under the Top Ten holiday objectives of the Germans in December).
The third group makes business roles to invest with the objective of a medium-term-term increase.
Real estate in the capital city will be rounded torers, constituted by the continuous growing demand.
Although the real estate prices in Bulgaria are the lower, in the past five years there was a price increase of 21 per cent annually.
The reducing of the real estate prices exceeds the increment of the store.
Fodor and the six per cent of Hungary
As Minister of Environment, Gábor Fodor was known, the experts ended on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 continues to be opened by the ministers on midday after official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries have consulted Bali's driving plan, where emission reduction measures are set for the period after 2012, so that after the Kyoto Protocol is completed.
Today it is a strong debate between industrial and developing countries.
The United States have already reported that they do not want to negotiate concrete numbers, however, they would be ready to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gas in comparison with 1990 to 25 to 40 per cent.
The other major issue of the conference is whether industrial countries are ready to support both the developing countries as well as technologically.
It has also been achieved an agreement on support of developing countries.
The Kyoto Protocol's adjustment Fund is to be managed by a 16-powered Council, expected to be read by the UNO Global Environment Facility (FNU), as read in the "Piac e's Profit".
Hungary 6%
On behalf of Hungary, Minister of Environment Gabor Fodor supports the EU's endeavour to maintain its primary roles in global climate protection measures, and to achieve a new international agreement until 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU will reduce the emissions of greenhouse gas to 20% until 2020 (in addition to the 1990 values), independent of the success of the Agreement after 2012, or not, and the Union would even be willing to make a 30% reduction, provided that other major industrial countries in the world, or developing countries are also willing to comply with their commitments under force and responsibility.
Gabor Fodor stressed that the goal of the States involved in the Kyoto Protocol was only 5,2% reduction, whereby the EU had already bound to a minimum of 8% with its 15 Member States at the time.
The proposal for Hungarian is 6% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the 1985-87 years - a prescription that will be fulfilled by the country, as it is to read in the press Department's communication.
The use is high on Bali - however, the long-term international climate policy agreement should be completed within two years, at least it would enter into force only after 2012. In this case, the projects of reduction set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow the international emission reduction system, which is also the importance of the IPCC, which has also highlighted the UNO's scientific committee for peace prices, with the international, with the precise peace price.
This would delay the emission reduction, and the increase in the average temperature of the earth would be more than 2°C inevitably, which, according to scientists, would be very serious and irreparable consequences.
British army spends on YouTube
The United States of the British Army has published a popularity increase in the videoportal of Iraq and Afghan.
The BBC reports that the British Airwave (RAF) YouTube for its own discovery: Setting special units in Afghanistan since March 2006, videos have been loaded on the network of operations against the Taliban.
The shifted miniatur cameras on Helmen are controlled at the air baseline in Kandahar and then sent to London where they are placed on the Internet.
Political message is inevitable
Air weapons soldiers have already undertaken 139 such incentives, and their "canal" was seen over 75,000 times.
The British Defence Minister was registered in spring 2007 to publish videos on Iraqi and Afghanese operations, but also the British Minister (Commonwealth Office) and the international peace instruments stationed in Iraq have their own YouTube canal.
Use in Afghan
The air weapons have originally published the videos with the aim of restructuring soldiers, and, as the Ministry of Defence says, the contributions will also serve to inform the population about the actual objectives of the foreigners.
This kind of propaganda published is closely free in comparison with coherent televisions, so defence experts Gordon Mackenzie to BBC, but these videos always make a certain measure of political message in itself, as they confirm the right of military measures decided by the Government.
Americans spend with game
But the army must fight against amateur receptions, which are carefully processed, also create in the network - such as those who show the death of the soldiers: In some heuchlerical, "official" propaganda films, the highest losses, however, are not shown by the blue sides of the war.
From the war view sites in Iraq and Afghan, there were many videos loaded on the platform, but this "topic" has recently discovered the Britishs.
The Americans are on the other way, namely with the free downloadable shooting "American Army", where the player can swim into the skin of the soldiers in the context of a more or less reliable simulation.
Christmas feasts with Tombola and Pogatsche in the Ministers
Instead of a Christmas feast, Minister Monika Lamperth is no way: it will organize a working conference in which its employees can exclude the year 2007 with coffee and pogatsche.
Some ministers are celebrating with Live music, other zealous Christmas consent with Tombola or attacks in the officers.
Festival, Christmas consent, concerts and buffet - so the power celebrates.
The Christmas Field has already taken the officers.
The largest Christmas feast of a mission will be held in the defence resort, but it is not expected to be the employees of the Ministry.
In the Christmas Festival, children are decreased by soldiers, and the "Mission Festival" members of the family are currently stationed soldiers, but there is also a receipt for the press.
The resort provides about 25 million for holidays.
In comparison with other resorts, the National Development Agency (NFP) and the Ministry of Economy and Traffic Traffics are employed.
The 4.32 million Forint tear Christmas feast of the Ministry of Economy will be held in the future house, which will be expected for about 350 of 600 employees.
The slight point of celebrations is on Christmas, but it will also give Live-acts and a Tombola disruption.
The National Development Agency (NFU) has maintained its 4.7 million Forint nine-day Christmas at the home of the National Justice Council (OIT) with concerts and a festival.
The salmyte was 1 Mio Forint, the rest was issued for more than 400 loaded guests.
According to our information, a NFV department is also invited at another Christmas feast, which is registered by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt).
The building of the lust game theaters ("Vígszinház") was measured for the party.
The MAG Zrt has not confirmed these information because we have not reached the competents.
What's the arriving?
The OIT building was not only open to the guests of the NFU, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held on 7 December the Lucia Balle instead of Christmas feasts.
They did not have to pay money to the OIT for the use of the regions.
round 500 visitors came to the ball.
The holidays were opened with a conversation of the Minister, after dinner, there was a Live music to dance.
On the request of [origo], it was shared with: it did not rule in the ball, no ball clothing or accession obligation.
The Ministry of Health, Labour, and self-administration are prepared at the puritan festivals everywhere.
The Ministry of Health organizes the feast for employees in their own four walls for about 400,000 fornt.
Minister Monika Lamperth officially invites its employees to a Christmas feast, but to the conference for the year end.
It is calculated with about 180 guests that - so the press department - are used only with coffee and pogatsche, so the party is exhibited with 350,000 forrents.
The Minister of self-administration Gordon Byanai is only intact with his colleagues in the aula of the Ministry.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) celebrates a Christmas feast in its own festival, expected to be 436 employees.
The expenditure was measured by 2.500 forint per head - for this money there is a buffet receipt with succeeding.
From the beginning of Yanos Veres, the workers of the PM are celebrating this way each year.
However, there will be no right party position - not only because of the official speech of the Minister, but also because the party was set for afternoon.
The Agricultural Ministry takes place on 20 years to a new year-receiving, the Christmasday of the Ministry is now exempted.
The centuries of guests are requested to close the Vajdahunyad in the city park ("Városliget"); according to the resort, the expenditure of 1.000 forint per guest will be measured.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple step up to which only are loaded for foreign diplomas accredited in Hungary.
The receipts that are registered each year start traditionally with a short discussion of the Ministry and are exempted with sustained shoes.
As reporting the relevant press sites to [origo] request, it will not be given a Christmas feast at the outdoor or at the Ministry of Education.
On the basis of the costs of Christmas feasts, the Department of Environment could not be given.
In any case, more than 400 guests were loaded to celebrate in the Art Competition Museum.
More forces mobilize for Riesen Strike
The Liga Associations and the Hungary Association Federation form their coordinating committee on Friday for the end of the Monday.
On Saturday, a Protest Meeting will be held on Monday - on the day of the People's vote on the hospital insurance law - begins the labour deployment.
It is calculated with strict, significant transport disadvantages, since rail traffic is closely established, and the budapests of public transport (BKV) also strike up to 13 hours.
Detail on the strike on Monday will be announced together on Friday by the Liga Associations and the Working Federation.
It is also founded by a LIGA - MOSZ Streik Committee responsible for the coordination of the actions on Monday.
On Saturday, a Protest Meeting will hold, and from Monday all organizations who have joined the strike, the work for uncertain time, if no agreement is achieved with the Government.
In other words, the end of Parliament's vote on the hospital insurance law was not defined.
If the National Council does not adopt the hospital insurance law, the authorities shall immediately return the call to the strike.
However, if the law is adopted, the Strategic Committees shall be together in order to consult further measures.
On the basis of the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even likely that it comes only in the afternoon, or even on midnight, to vote on the hospital insurance law.
The strike starting at Monday is required to recognise significant transport disorders: the rail trains are lowing their work for an uncertain time, the majority of the public transport and more than half of the voluntary companies remain.
At the same time, there will be many locations in a direction.
The call to the strike has been followed by numerous associations and civil organizations - the list of participants will be updated on the Liga website.
Some organizations proclaimed strikes at an uncertain time, others plan a long-term labour relief.
By Thursday, the Hungarian Railways MÁV and the Free Training of Eisenbahs VDSZSZ could not be achieved in agreement on sufficient performances, although just through Christmas feasts are still more people with the train.
Following the previous reports, the BKV of operating starts up to 13 hours, the Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 p.m. which LIGA workers for electricity and heat energy makes the work low for four hours, and the teachers worked up to 2 to 8 p.m.
The Hungarian Medical Association has a country’s age at various times, the EDDS, the Democratic Association of Employees in Health and Social Affairs, a sub-organisation of the SZEF, the Forum for Cooperation of Employees, has a second warning stretch.
The most important of the four points requested by the Liga is that the government returns the draft for the reform of hospital insurance and has a new concept of social disorder.
The second requirement relates to the introduction of the new pension calculation model that will be taken from the next year.
Requirement No 3 states that the authorised professional groups of access to early pension systems are already allowed before 2010.
The fourth point is that VDSZS, which belongs to links, has not accepted the offers submitted by the Ministry of Transport and now calls for a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungary garden increases the state risk
According to the Political Capital Office of risk analysis (Risk Analysising Division) the activities of the Hungarian garden, founded in August, have increased the risk of Hungarian and the region in several respects.
In the "Risico Warning Report" of the Institute, there is, inter alia, the highest political risk for Hungarian gardens is the "reforcing the existing ethnical expenditure between the citizens and non-environmental population in Hungary, which may even lead to violent ethnic interferences".
This is the main reason for the strategy of the Hungarian garden, which probably goes towards promoting such a coherence, as the research Institute.
As reported, this is considered as a disagreement of the politically responsibleers: "The debate of the Roman Framework representatives have left the debate of radical political groups, which have now established their political strategy to the Rome-Ungarn goal".
It is convincing that this would enhance the problem that is impossible to make awareness of the dialog, and increase the probability of violent interferences.
The research Institute also believes that the activities of the Hungary garden had not recently affected by the huge attention of the home and foreign media "the image of Hungary has been significantly damaged, especially in terms of trust in stability and democracy."
We remember: Since spring 2006, the reorganization of radical and extreme rights groups in Hungary has been continuously reorganized, so many organizations called "national self-defence agreements" have been established since summer 2007.
"These groups are commonly defined as civil organization, while they are opening to prepare defence missions (catastrophes, country defence, orders), under the vocational vocationalness of the police, the army, in relation to the State itself," said.
And further: everything happens in accordance with the methods that try to give different, based on the political and partial threat of the population, political efforts as a civil initiative.
The stress of the civil character and the agreement are therefore not only the circle of legal wardens that could be able to take place in the court's submission – it is also a political strategy.
As the analysis has to be taken, the activities of the Hungary garden are also an increased factor for neighbouring countries.
"In the last months, the Hungary garden was seen in several neighbouring countries as potential risk sources, so some ultranationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries see the confirmation of its own anti- Hungary policy in the development of the Hungary garden.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region," said it.
In view of the research institution, the establishment of the Hungary garden is no individual phenoms in Central and Eastern Europe, thus the political risk for the whole region is growing.
As reported, the activities of the Hungary garden with which the Bulgarian National Garden is comparable to which the foundation was established in August 2007 by the extreme legal Bulgaria National Union (UNB).
In the context of the development of the Bulgarian garden, the Roma-Masc expansions, which took place in a town village of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The UNB has taken the events equally to the establishment of the National Garden, arguing that the objective of the organization of "national protection" is.
Indeed, in the past 17 years, the State remained unfair and unfair, so political capital.
Furthermore, the initiative had been a strong debate in the Bulgarian public.
As stated, the increased risk for ethnic interferences is also indicated by the fact that some Bulgarian Rome organizations have announced to establish their own garden in resistance.
Since the activities of the Hungarian garden shown many differences with the Bulgarian National Garden, it is not excluding that the Hungarian Rome also reacts to their own protection to the threats, it is in the Political Capital report of the Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, Director of Political Capital, said on request of the News Office: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the research Institute.
Annual risk analysis reports would be published and risk changed trends should be recognised, the public opinion will be informed as in the case by the issue of the risk warning report.
Festivals are not all
In Hungary, the holidays are legally regulated, so that the practice of redisponibility of the working day has been rounded around a medium-sized feast, but the next year is less than that.
Also, in the EU and in America, something else is under "Feedday".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes state feasts and working days.
Labour days are most church feasts, or are related to significant historical events.
For example, we also celebrate a new year: even the last day of the old, as well as the first day of the new year are free days of work - the latter only can be able to make the Silvester feasts.
We have a total of fourty feasts throughout the year.
The State Festival is the 15 March, who reminds the revolution of 1848, and on 23 October, the Revolution Day of 1956.
On August 20, the establishment of the State, celebrated on 1 May, will be reminded of our dead.
Furthermore, there are two holidays in Eastern, Peninsula, and Christmas.
Since our State, national or religious holidays rarely falls on a weekend, the practice of the "working day" movement has been guaranteed in cases where we would work before or after the holiday only one day.
However, the price of the extended weekend is that we have to work very well at the seats before, or must go to schools.
When this day, which is before or after the birthday, is finally to be processed, the Minister shall have been established in a own Regulation for many years.
The rules of law apply to all employees and employees, public employees and officials of the public service.
Except only firms and institutions in which the exploitation is continued without interruption, including at the feasts.
Today, the work rule is only through the celebration at the end of the year: from December 24, the life remains formally in this country, since most of the days between Christmas and Silvester's time compensation, or their own holidays are deleted.
In the next year, more holidays fall in the weekend, or at the end of the week, so that it will be given less redistributions at working days than this year.
The calendar will first be around the day of work "played on the head", so that people can stay at home just four days.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day so that the Friday, May 2, may be a breakfast.
The second redistribution is shared with the celebration on October 23, together: on Saturday, October 18th, you will have to end on Friday 24 October.
However, the end of the year will still be in the sign of the celebration after 24 December everything stands and remains, even though Silvester falls on a midnight.
Six disadvantaged shortnesses in order to fail to work college
E-mails that we can forget, Language messages that we never receive - harmless lies that do not get us anymore: you'll bring "color" in the daily place on the workplace.
The question is only whether you are dealing with these small inutilities, or make it better for the challenge and try to conscious these misconscious, for other dangerous situations.
Tipps.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone called by the Marketing Division," says a college.
What's that you've been cutting a meeting?
On the other hand, you would have forgotten it and try to do it again by calling at the Marketing Division, and forgoing you to forget the message (which is the less common method).
Mostly, it's been done with an apology.
Before you disappointed in punishment, you should be able to realize that your colleagues can really prepare an unfortunate moment and try to avoid consciousness of these situations.
What's going on?
There's nothing more nervous than if you're on a document, office access, or the phone, but it's not there.
Last night the heft device was still on the desktop - is it gone?
Or will the lost ball writer discover about the desktop of a colleague discovery?
Without questions, you should not take anything from the colleagues, because they will be rightly worried when they find that something has gone.
So, no cups or post-it from the office to the table, because there could be oneself: no more where you need urgently.
Getratsche about the private life of colleagues?
There is no effective means to stop a trace that has already been placed in the world.
Who with who, what did he do?
Where and why?
The information (or confusions) on the private life of colleagues should not be binding everybody to the nase!
And if someone opens and brings us his secret within, we should not misuse this trust!
Instead, you're like a grabe, instead of putting out the present, even if others know the problems of the colleague.
Without reason, you're not reported about sickness?
If you call at the office to report sickly head pain, because you're just feeling unpleasant, or just want to smile, you should be about one in the clearness: your own work, unreasonable experiences, projects with fixed terms, must now be completed by colleagues instead of yourself.
So you don't have a bad joke with your colleagues!
If you already know that the next day you will not be created in the office, or that something could come here for you to stay home, you should be informed at the time that the colleagues, nor the chief will be unexpectedly faced with the inconsistence.
Sums, kitchen, phones
You have been depressed in your work, but will you soon be cut off from the sight of the colleagues?
Should you hear a phone conversation that you shouldn't have heard?
The colleagues should not be held with sums, songs, conversations (which leads to their heads), tramps, nervouss or nervouss.
All of this can be very angry, even though they are not just depressed in a task (write, plans, organizations).
Does the other guilt always?
If a project is not completed, you have to forget a important letter or important news, you should not search for the debt of your own sexuality to others!
If possible, you should not be experiencing the chaos in the office or colleagues!
In the best way, you're taking his mistakes and apologize if others were involved in it!
The question of how to re-administer the error, or how to repeat the abuse, is only to take up!
In the office - a feeling like home?
Training shoes and beds: Better for home, but nothing has lost in the office!
You shouldn't even be as army clothes if it would actually leave the workplace!
Not to be ridicule - you should both your colleagues and respect yourself so much that you may be clothed accordingly in the office - if you wish, also sweet and elegant!
It wants everyone to do the right - or how it will be uninteressant for others
Stop and go-to-lear, the car was midnight in the all-time stage.
From the radio, a strange melodie consists: the ring of a gentle, paid with electronic effects.
I turn the volume higher.
The time changes to the previous kitchen comes to the bass, and as a real swimming shore, a woman's chor.
It's the song "Wings of Love" of Zagar, which spends on mr2.
The country's music scenes haven't just shooted us in a long time with a qualitative electropop.
But now you see the stau different when you hear the new album of Zagar.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so some new and exciting production from the country's digital underground scenes slowly contributes to a change in the total image, and even if the garagenrock with its guitar kitchen is "in", the home electropop is a new one under the sun.
Balaz Zságer started in Pecs, Muzised himself in the Yonderboi band, before he - perhaps because a swimming house wasn't inflicted - starting his own way.
The interruption with his project (Zagar) and his music, the elements of Jazz, Electronic, and Pop, but he created only when you were able to compose the sound track to a movie (e.g.
"Sezon" of Ferenc Török.
The training, which was initially in smaller clubs, was known to the largest public when the Magazine "wan2" renewed its first album from 2002 under the top 50 home alben and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, was nearly the only one, also in the Western marketable trend.
Nevertheless, Zagar and his band "trendy" were interested, but it was not interested that they would like to take this brand too.
The band has reacted to how it should be: with a new, even better album.
The new album appearing now with the title "Cannot Walk Fly Instead" could open them new ways, but the title already presss the desire for continuity with the Peczer years.
In fact, the expression was time when Balaz's Zsahger was still on the way.
The pleasant, flying playing would be well, however, next to the Asian Characters of the music, the - to the timegeist and the trends corresponding - sweet guitarrs, the influences of the Rock'n'roll.
With these songs, the songs who lived in England and worked with the band "The Puzzle" György Ligeti at the Premier in Millenari.
A song of the album has even done to the radio-speaker - the mr2 Petæfi, which has been sent from early to late popsic, has then set the earners with the number "Wings of Love", which was included in six home songs ("Durch of Divas").
It's okay too. (?).
The hvg.hu asked at Balaz's Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new heat is on the question: How much is your music to keep a certain shock?
Balazs Zságer: The term "Schachmusic" means not me just much.
I think there are two boxes in the popsic, not Mainstream and Underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial goals and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music may be easier and unreasonable, but it can also be produced only for sales that make it to commercial music.
A good pop number can also come from a honest motivation.
The preparation of the hearer also works independence on this principle, of languages and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the opening of the Hungary and foreign public against your music?
For example, in the foreign, especially west, the popuse has a greater tradition.
There are not only adolescents or Twens on concerts, but also the older public.
They follow the trends in the popsics, which happen closely to them, much more attention, because they also hold them for a part of the temporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role is the public in your work?
Is it important, who, where, how many of your music?
Example: Of course, it's a good feeling to see that it's always more to our concerts.
But we never composed for the market.
Our music is not designed to serve a purpose but because of a certain reason.
The role of the public is mostly sensitive to the concerts where there is already a mutual effect on interchange, but it is only in the unreasonable changes of the moment.
But I'm not going to do it all right, you're not interesting anymore.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He's walking as a solist and built his carriage in the west.
B.C.: We're not really going to be his way, even though we're always trying to interpretate this in our music.
We see ourselves more than team players that trust in the musical presence of the other and let them disappear.
At first, our work was uncertainly compared with Yonderboi, since several of us came from his band and made another way.
hvg.hu: In the charts of mr2 Petæfi, "Wings of Love" is first place.
Many have heard the name of Zagar in connection with this number.
Was opening with a little more popular style in direction of a broader public?
For example: We did not have a plan to write a heat that should then be able to keep a trap for the album.
There's more in this song.
It was considered the final of the album, with which we wanted to solve the clangorgy and the some more difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six songs?
Why was she just what the guideline was?
B.C.: The basic thanks was to make a good Gospel chor.
Then the idea was to compile the chor from the home musicists.
Thus the six-powered chor - So, Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikō Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - which we then got baptized later "Underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Would you like to have the song exactly, or have the girls reported it?
For example, the number was already in the toolal version, but when the material was completed for the album, we thought that this number still needed "does something."
The acordenation has been formally requested after a vote.
I put the melodie in the same night, later they learned the girls.
It was practically all on anfieb and horrible spontaneous.
I can remember that I was very electricized at that time, but it also needed the "Divas".
With my voice alone, the song would never become so strong.
hvg.hu: both on the plate, and at the concert, there was the impression that the girls were in the background.
There is no Solo-Part (other than the short Solo of Judy Jay), they do not have their own role, sing perfectly together and are not less laugh than music, so they will not only be accompanied by music.
They also standed down on the board.
Is it a hope?
For example, what they have been standing behind, it was because of clean technical problems.
However, we did not want to make them aware of the solitary roles.
The number also means that you should forget your ego a little, forget who comes and where it is walking, let us simply allow these certain fleets to encourage the fleet of love.
I would like to feel that others feel this euphorical condition we have seen than the song has occurred.
hvg.hu: What was the most important song?
For example, no musical creature work, it has given more difficult tasks at mixing.
For example, in "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", where I play on a concert clavier, or with "Rock'n Goes to The Girls," where the Groove did not want to work longer, but after and afterwards, everything was composed as a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite number of the new album?
For example, this changes with the concerts and also now where I have the album "lost".
Today it is "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape from the Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Employees risked by milliards of feelings of minority
Unfavourable supplier
Thus his former employee Jerome Kerviel of the French bankenriese Société Genrale, owner of the fascinated trade banka.
Indeed, she came up for almost five billion euros.
But it seems more like Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to do the same thing to his colleagues, and it was not certainly impossible.
On the contrary to all large bank households, he acknowledged the crisis at the American Hypotheks market at the time.
"He is psychologically weaker," he was to hear from the mouth of his proposed who showed him at the police.
However, as noted in Kerviels, which published the French media, for example, the daytime Le Monde, he was a man who had achieved the end of the last year with its business of EUR 1.6 billion.
Crisis not only in America
"It was all I wanted to pay money for my bank," he said in his statement.
In the summer he was able to win a half billion euros at the American crisis.
Indeed, the opportunity was that he had already been shocked at the beginning of the year.
In February there was already the first news about the fact that, as they were called Sub-Prime hypotheks, they would have been given in difficulty with income-free customers or those who had previously paid problems.
However, the impact on the whole economy should not have the crisis.
Many did not believe that and had the right.
At the end of the year, he was slaughtered up to 1.6 billion euros.
"When I had paid the first half billion, I didn't know how I should explain it," says Kerville, and says that he's definitely nothing to keep himself.
During the whole hearing, he gives it that he's false documentation so that he's not going to be on the pigs.
It even began to lead his chiefs behind light, even though the Eurex burdens were interested in his business.
Risk Profit
He was afraid to flee?
I don't know.
"I thought she was satisfied with the bad fact that I paid 1,6 billion for the bank."
Where did he get the courage to risk so much?
He had to develop his position slowly.
In the General Society, he entered his study immediately after his study at Lyon University in 2000.
His annual content was $51,000.
After two years, he was already an assistant of a Macler, and in 2005 he became self-employed machinery with an annual content of $90,000.
However, he knew that he would never get so much as others.
"After my first meeting in 2005, I knew that you were watching me.
For my training and for my professional and personal development," Kerviel explained the research officials.
But soon after his arrival, the first great success came.
With the Allianz's shares, he granted a lot of currency losses at the London bombs, a half billion euros.
And that's the departure -- now he wanted more.
As long as you win, let's let you
"This is like a snakeball," he said the police.
But the chiefs knew of all, relatively, it was.
"When I get money, I closed the eyes."
But then, at the beginning of this year, the great crowd came.
One day he lost a billion euro.
At a weekend in the middle of January he wanted to evacuate this.
When he came to work on Monday, he wasn't anymore as a bank lawyer.
And a few days later, the bank announced that she lost $5 billion because of it.
And how did they get him on the shoes?
Successfully he made himself a vacation.
"I just took four days from the previous year.
A Macler who does not take a vacation is one who doesn't want to look at him in the cards," Kerviel concluded.
Czech has the opportunity to come to 365 billion
The Czech Minister and representatives of the European Commission signed in the whole of nine development programmes, which can be reached by the Republic of Czech for 14 billion euros in the coming years.
It is about half of the sum that Czechs can be obtained from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion chrones are from seven regional development programmes.
Czech firms will be able to be shared from the "Enterprise and innovation" programme.
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will fly in the construction of transport.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and is up to 22% of the funds that the Czechs can receive from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the State transport infrastructure fund, which will have over 90.8 billion in the next year.
The "Enterprise and innovation" programme is intended to provide entrepreneurs and enterprises to win funds for innovative enterprises.
The companys should thus win financing for the introduction of new technologies, for business research, but also for the introduction of effective organization methods.
In the previous EU Fund acquisition, the Czech Republic belongs to the least successful countries of the new accession countries.
Nicaraguanic Court confirms twenty-year-old prison penalty for experiencing
On Thursday, a professional court in Nicaragua confirmed the twenty-year prison penalty for the former President Arnold Alemán, in which 2003 he was sentenced for financial abuse of $1,8 billion.
But later he was left from the prison and lived under his home prison at the Nicaraguc Metropolis.
Whether the former Head of State (1997 to 2002) returns to this Middle American State, according to the reporting Agency AP is now unexpected.
The President of the Professional Court, Ileana Pérez, will now depart from the defence officers whether Alemán may be able to stay home or whether he must be in prison.
A court said four years ago that Germany had regularly moved the government's money to the accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictified and the accounts actually belonged to their relatives and most closest attendants.
Some of this money finally entered into a fund that Germany had established for the financing of its election campaign in 2001.
Budget is by
Yes, it's done.
The State budget is approved.
What about this household is special?
It is the first budget designed by this government, which has been adopted without support of the opposition by the coalition master.
The following year was yet approved by support of the SSD (Social Democratics) because he had presented him Minister Sobotka (of this party) and the SSD could therefore not allow it to stop it.
On the contrary to the vibrant debate before the vote on the question of mis confidence against the government, there is no dramatic matter at this time.
The Deputy adopted this traditionally little, however, the most important law in all peace.
It's a certain paradox.
All governments start and end with the individual chapters and posts of the budget, whether one likes or not.
Budget is an important part of the policy, but it will be declared by the government's power campaign and opposition.
This is a more grateful topic for the media, and therefore they give him more attention.
A struggle among politicians is much more interesting for publicity than the needs.
The State budgets were among the past social democratic governments under three weaknesses which could not be removed by the budget for 2008:
The first is the high part of expenditure responsibilities by law, which is not only for pensions, but also for social expenditure that has decided the "reducing" coalition of ŠSSD and KSṣṭM (Communists) in the last year before the elections.
The second is the deficiency of budgetary policy as a result of the first weakness point.
The third restriction is the deficiency of public finances, i.e. the budget deficiency of the communities.
However, the largest risk is not the public budget deficit.
This budget is public and somewhat controlled.
A real time bomb is the budget deficit of the communities.
Many citizens were given to exclude income from taxes, taxes and bank credits to additional sources for investments, often untranslated debt appropriations, by which they debt their homes in overall.
In recent years, these debts have been paid by a massive sale of shares of energy and other supplies that they had received in the course of the privacy of the State.
Now this source is already moved.
As far as we only keep us on official and testable facts, we make sure that:
Our economy has been over a few years, like the rest of the world, a growth phase, whose smuggled the slaughter without underlying.
This represented a unique opportunity for its governments to arrange public finances.
However, these governments still debt the State.
Other countries, in spite of some exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have made much more sensitive than our Republic.
This is a variety of changes to write to the previous governments.
We are part of the countries who, at the global level, are at least threatened to poverty.
It is why no massive social programmes are needed that, unfortunately, have been able to be overwhelmed in a geographical scale over the past few years.
Even if it has been able to strive a part of the unfair popularist expenditure that has been adopted this year before the elections, it is clear that if it is not coming to a change of the pension year and to a pension reform, then practically any policy in this country, and, as well as those who are in the power, there will be nothing to be a clean manager.
It is only easy to overcome when it is said that then, from dominant political officials, the majority of tax revenues mechanically shared on pension and social expenditure.
Therefore, this year budget may not be revolution, but only the reducing of normal expenditure can be provided by obligation expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion chrones for 2008 would be overwhelming if previous governments had not been issued in the last ten years, just what happened.
If we do not really want to be pure administrative officials from dominant politicians, then we must be patient and that nonetheless strong coalition government, which is aware of the fact that the State is only able to expenditure as much as it is possible to take taxes and taxes, want to be peaceful in preparing further reforms.
Only these allows a gradually implementation of a balanced State budget.

Banks want to control the crisis
The American Federal Reserves, the European Central Bank and the British Central Banks, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis on the financial markets.
So more than 100 billion dollars will be delivered by audience to the monetary markets.
In these cases, banks will increase the interest rates they are willing to pay mutual money.
For example, the US Fed sends $40 billion to auction, and the European and Swiss Central Bank is locker.
The first time after the 11th September, the central banks of the individual States are towards such a coordinated action to decrease the consequences of a financial crisis.
"This step is to eliminate the greatest difficulties of the economy, such as the growing lack of a free capital available that the banks can give", wrote in a report for its customers Bernard Bau Mohl by the Advisory Economic Group.
"The coordinated action of the Central Bank has reduced the probability of recession in the United States of 65% to about 50%," added in its report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion because of non-service credits, especially in the United States.
Analyticers are expecting more billion losses.
"The central banks have really had fear of what can happen, as they decided to this action," said the chief of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
"It seems like that the situation is really bad," said he continues.
The central banks are afraid that if the banks themselves have difficult access to provide, their credit customers will also be paid.
This would reduce the consumption and deteriorate the American economy in a reception, which may be affected by economic growth in the whole world.
The Central Banks have decided that after they were not able to decline the LIBOR, the London inter-bank rate which is used in the currency between banks.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid to reverse their money, although the Central Banks of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom had cut their interests several times during the summer.
"This will have the same effect as another decline of interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting of Agency Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this step of the Central Banks is involved in the eradication of the crisis because it does not solve the basic problem, as well as the case of the real estate market in the United States.
Claus: The debates of the ecologs are incredible
Global climate changes are mostly damaged by developing countries.
President Václav Klaus reaffirmed the problem of global warming.
The criticism now focused on the UNO international conference on climate change on Bali at the end.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A blue, no green planet", he expressed that the debates of the ecologs were incredible.
According to Claus, it is not only the structure of the conference that forms a rare mixing of government partners and such non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the Rhetoric which they join and the reality.
"The debate is unstructured there, it is a word fire work that is only replaced for a real solution to present problems," said Klaus.
The Czech President emphasized the idea of his book that it is very important for him and that he was so engaged.
He also expressed his satisfaction about the appearance of his book in German translation, because "I'm often taking care of my views."
So now interested people could read their position uncertainly.
Klaus recalled that he was not an air-continent, but he has his view of sufficient conditions to write such a book.
He is finally academic to understand and to assess ability, special negotiations, has experience with statistics and also a people's economics.
He said that the climate was constantly changed and that its changes were normally that it was not a coherent opinion among the scientists that the consequences of the current changes were not too large and serious and, therefore, no threat, and that the efforts to influence the development of the climate would be able to influence, overflow, unimpact and inacceptable.
He also thought that he had experiences with totality systems to spend on unreasonable, unproofable views, seeing it as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
On the issues of the presents he repeated that he was not against "a conscious environmental protection, but against military eco-active activists who do not take account of the relationship between shipping and contract".
On the same subject, Klaus had spoken in Wien two months ago in the Hayek Institute.
600000 people couldn't change their leadership
600000 drivers blew the time to turn their old driver, which is valid at the end of the year.
Today, the last day is where you can be invited to make the authorities a new leadership up to the end of the year.
However, the Ministry does not fear that, after the new year, hundreds of thousands of drivers are attributed to the roads.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not want to go through their leadership.
While small places report a strong disappearance of the interest in the flight appearance, the headquarters of the city will be protected with applications, and the interest on the shift still falled this week.
The city management ends around 2000 customers daily.
You have to get about a half hours.
In Praga, about 140000 drivers have not yet turned their driver appearance.
The exhibition of a new leadership is 20 days.
But it is possible to invite the exhibition with a short period of five days.
In this case the driver must pay 500 krones.
Car drivers who do not create the changes required until the end of the year and without valid guiders threaten a money punishment from January.
The wicked pays maximum 2000 chrones.
However, the police can also be used with an investigation when transgression.
In case of transmission, the punishment can increase on 2500 krones.
After previous information, the community may also receive a punishment that is not running.
He could, so he called a punishment of even 30000 krones.
The Ministry has already called for the offices to leave milk gardens and, at least, to place a punishment of 1000 chronics.
The speaker of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, threatened by no one to a thousand chronic punishment.
The leadership appears to be a document where each one can decide whether he wants or not.
It doesn't matter about a personal proof that everyone, but one valid, must have.
People who don't want to walk, they should leave their leadership.
It is necessary to bring him to the competent community office or to send him by registration there.
By the end of the year, leaderships are invalid, which were issued between 1964 and 1993.
The drivers, however, have to change other types of driver appearances.
People with leaderships from 1994 to 2000 have three years of time for the change.
The validity of leaders issued by 2001 to 2004 ends December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are some 2,6 million other leaderships.
Judge sent penalties for detectives who were sent to Berdych
The former police Josef Opava and Petr Kośaśík, who are accused of having done a common business with David Berdych, received 13 years of prison for a period of 10 years.
In a legal sentence, the Supreme Prayer decided to reduce their punishment for two years.
Originally, the detections of the "Feat for Combating the Organized Crime" 14 were threatened for 12 years.
There is no professional possibility against the present judgment, only the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych himself is also accused of this matter, but first it is before him.
However, in other processes he had already been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
He can't be condemned.
In January 19, a district court, particularly because of the participation of slaughter accidents, the Supreme Court has negotiated the profession of 16 of them today.
The majority of the detainees have been depressed from the beginning to the complaint with the foundation, it is a case built.
According to the Mediterranean District Court, the police members in discussion, including Berdych Prosecutors, information from the sources of the police, captured various shooting accidents and helped members of the band to defeat the criminal persecution.
The bands were transferred to Opava and Kośaśík 30% of the beats.
The complaint has been sentenced by the bands from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, for drought accidents whose victims often suffer serious violations, but also for official position and unlawful weapons.
In the home surveys, the police found illegal pistons, munition with steelkers, a laser target raw and a machine.
The band has resulted in a number of millions of chronics, according to the accused of their slaughter accidents.
Besides 20 men in this procedure, the Courts Berdych and a number of other persons because of any other injury transactions were imposed.
Other men from Berdychs around need to be responsible in another process, other cases have not been held before the court.
The main negotiations of Tomáš Pöta and Maroš Šulej, which were in the left prison and waited for the final decision on the delivery of their punishment in the Czech Republic.
Kids disappeared - account: 12 million
The lawyer of the damaged parents, Igor Veleba, wants to demand 12 million chronics damage more court costs.
For each mother, three million, for the parents, two million and for the children a million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each pair.
Hence, Ondśej Dostal, the legal adviser of the Hospital House is completely and does not agree with the Velebas proposal.
"Any of this proposal we deal with, he is too high of a variety of times", said Dostal after the today's negotiation.
"But in order to make a view on this proposal, we need the view that made the contrary side.
We will find whether it's real value.
But we consider that this should be together in hundreds of thousands of areas," said Dostal.
The amount should be moved between 100000 and 200000 krones for each of the four parents.
At the beginning, the family from Jablośov wanted to take a million chrones for each month she had not put her biological daughter.
For Veleba, a favorite was based on punishment negotiations which had developed for him the University of Hospital House in Prague Motol.
Parents experienced psychological and psychological damage and stress symptoms in different strengths and deep hearts.
The men have better destroyed the stress situation, even if they saw abortions against them, they could have prevented the transmission of the newborns.
Women reiterate with the effects of the experienced trauma, as well as with what is now experiencing, the content of Veleba.
Veronika and Nikola were disappointed on 9 December last year by the hospitals of the Connection clinic in Täebæ.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the rhetorics in Pśibyslavice, and Veronika to Libor Broś and Jaroslava Trojanov to Jablośov.
The Böhmisch-Merry District Chauptman of Vysočina (Both-Marin height) overlook the end of October, each family was 100000 krones as a replacement for expenditure that had been found by the error of the hospital in Töbequi, which was supported by the district.
All hospitals in Czechy are insured by laws for obligation.
In doubt, they must take into a reserve fund, only soon they can request assistance to the rail.
The courts have reached comparedly low amounts of damage, the amounts were determined by tables and moved in the field of hundreds of thousands, closely from millions.
Polívka came to his Kingdom Walachi
Bolek Polívka lost the war about the "Kenigreich Walachi".
According to the director of the district Court in Ostrava, he first used the term "Walachian King", but the project had built a team for Tomáš Harabiš in a long-year work, in collaboration with the player.
Polívka did not participate today in the negotiation.
According to his lawyer, the matter is probably not completed, and his mandate will probably be invoked.
"The war is that Mr. Harabiš and his team will want to participate in the Bolek Polívkas Popularity," said the lawyer Polyvkas after the negotiation.
Everyone had the word "Walachic Kingdom" just before this player and comics.
The same view is also Harabiš.
"We have a ten-year job behind us.
The financing of money and concepts of the activities," he said.
According to him, the war is for money.
"After years, they argued that the project has been successful and that they could have something.
They want to win parasitant to our work," he continued.
Lucrative business
According to the court, Polívka used the title "Walachian King" for the first time in one of his television amendments.
1993, he grew up the shooter Radoslav Brzobohatī.
However, this was not the purpose of justifying a rational Kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came to the thought of turning out the warach.
From an originally slow action, a business and a entrepreneurship was deleted to the Harabiš establishment of the Wallic Kingdom company.
1997 Polívka had the right to use his name and signing in the places and cut his owners even slow up when visiting his farm and its theatre ideas.
Who'll sit on the throne?
The judges also found that Harabiš used only the simple idea that Polívka had made public in the "Manege" sending for his entrepreneurs.
"The Popularity Polívkas has helped the project of the Walach Kingdom", said the Judge.
However, she added that the souls of the project Harabiš and its team, who had been intensified to him.
The cooperation of today-destructed parties has continued until 2000, as Harabiš for Polívka was organized by the official clamping in Vsetín.
However, since then, between Polívka and Harabiš began to build the stricts, which were assembled in the "Kenig Boleslavs I. selected until the Sankt Nimmerleins Day".
The leading role then took the call for Harabiš's Jamila Šulákova as a king-in-law.
Then, in 2002, Polívka was bound to Harabiš and his company to put the complaint that the court was decreased today.
Clarity in the struggle could bring the wedding fight prepared by Harabiš to the throne and a half princess.
This would be a new king.
Detail and a term he did not want to betrayed.
"We don't want to overcome anything.
It should be something like the king summer in the Walachi.
The king should be selected for a certain time.
Mr Polívka can also log in quietly," added Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VT: predominant weakness
To tell the truth, I never was a special fan of the Peugeot 206.
His driving properties were not much valuable, and the quality of gangs maintenance, slowing and also processing could be described more averagely.
But now is his follower, the Peugeot 207, on the market, and it's much better.
The combination with the name SW is still one part, and I'm still only to revise my opinion.
When I had tested the classic hatchback of 207, I had, for example, had to bear in mind the too low head liberty on the front seats.
These committees have no longer been complaints, because the carosseries of the combi are so trained that they will not even suffer two meters of moon.
Quickly continue
I'm just going to go short to not repeat me too much.
It's a rightly achieved design, where I just have shocks because of the careful medium tunnel.
I would welcome something more designerical, where the car makes otherwise an elegant impression.
The seats are awesome, and over the time, where we may have assessed us over too short seats or head supports.
The page content has also improved significantly against 206.
With regard to the Rauman order, there can also be the increased measurements of the carosseries.
In the combi, the lack of head liberty has also been eliminated.
Coffee in the copper room
The main case on this car is the lading room.
I have to call it (e.g. because of the cutting window) as a very sweet and swimming.
The heat rooms are equipped with grains representing an ideal compromise.
They are not disappointed, let each other go and hold more serious objects.
But let's hold us on the lade volume.
It involves table 428 litres, which is a higher average value compared to competition.
However, in comparison with the most selling vehicles in Czech, this class, the škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we find that the Peugeot remains 52 litres clearly spurable.
For a foreign vacation or when a child car is invited, this value is already critical.
But to highlight the positive, I still have to consider the entirely slow swimming swimming space after the backside, or even the very low swimming swimming.
120 PS in four lines
Our test car was equipped with a four-cylinder benzin motor with Hubraum 1.6 liters and a performance of 88 kWp.
And honestly, it should look like a 1600 cubic motor that takes a family hatchback.
He's empty, has a low consumption and it's good to go away.
If I compare him with his copper at škoda, who sometimes acts like his shock was hidden with a laptop, then I can only be shocked by him.
The price list speaks of baths
The price of this car is not just popular.
But we need to remember that we have tested a good equipped car with a spacious internal and a very good engine.
The base price of the car with the 1400 benzin motor in height of 329900 krones is still reached.
With our engine it costs 410900 krones, which is quite much.
The premium of the test car will be used again with 80000 krones additionally to buche.
However, we had head-air bags, automatic air condition, automatic swimming solution, electric windows down and...
So the whole car costs 531900 chrones.
This is a lot, but once you recognise the additional supply of a fabian and you will be present at a very similar amount.
So there is only the decision you want to choose.
Integration of Slowakian students in British schools does not begin
In British schools, the number of children from Eastern European countries takes place, which reflects the further development of local schools.
The integration of the Eastern Europeans has to be reduced by a number of obstacles.
British schools even find cases where conflicts between immigrants and children of the original inhabitants are increasing to violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe in British schools is illustrated in the case of North Kent, where the interferences between residential and Slovakia migrants are increasing.
Streitways, skins and swifts among students have been brought to the relationship between parents.
The situation has been so wide that the police in Chatham found a Slovenian woman who had struck a ten-year-old boy with a iron station.
The accused defended that the boy had policyed her with racial convictions.
The police also had to attack two minor girls on a Slovakian immigrant.
The girls had made racist observations against the man and cut him with stones.
"When we went home, a boy slaughtered on a bus chair and spotted on us.
When I told him he had to stop, he was shocking us with cups and birds and then disrupted his shock," a mother of Slowakian student in the Times newspaper described another unprecedented event.
The complaints come from both sides.
One of the inhabited people called the war with the migrants from Eastern Europe even as a survival fight.
The cases indicated that the stimulation of income and immigrants to British schools is increasingly enhanced.
In Britain, 70000 Slowakians have been reported here.
About 30000 Slovakia students visit the British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors it's really a island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, this will be filled if you only choose the right.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea, which is quiet as a tea.
Palms and All Inclusives with Kellners offering on the beach Pizza, Eis and disrupting cocktails.
Kitesurfing, Golf and Roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean, you can find this in an overwhelming measure.
Only on a island you can find much more, and this island is Cuba, the greatest and beautifulest of the largest Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Kuba was the basis for the United States’ reception.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place you saw a human eye.
Havanna was one day to a camp or passenger of estimates that the Spanishs had built in America and then moved to Europe.
And then the American era came.
The National Hotel was located at the end of the 20th century.
Construction was one of the chiefs of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, because all the crimes in the United States (especially during the Prohibition) were gladly seen and supported on Cuba - drugs, luck games, prostitution.
U.S. under his guests.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havanna, higher households, over the wide boulevards passed cars that were counted to the cultural symbols of the past fifty-first years of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway purchased an accommodation in San Francisco de Paula, near Havannas, and in Cojímar he had been his jacket.
At the walls of Bodeguita del Medio, stars of the show bus and politicians left their signatures from the whole United States.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita of Havanna, you can also leave your autogram.
At the Bar in the National Hotel, you are totally mixing cocktails for you.
And the cultures of the fifty people walk to Havanna until today, because the first imported shoglis and fiats in the salt and slight air have already been disappeared for a long time.
Mag Havanna, especially his older part, has been strongly discovered, nor finds it in the circle of so many wonderful colonial visions as just here.
Other places are just taken out, for example Trinidad.
With regard to the need for urgent money, there was green light for this development.
In the past fifty years, new hotels were not only in Havanna, but also in Varadero, the coast of the province of Holguín and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Kuba also offers a Marotte that is unique in the world and is especially about rail lovers.
The sugar rore of disappeared plants led to the sugar manufacturers.
Their flight park has not been renewed over decades, and so you're seeing sweet and full-functioning locotics whose age partners are in the museum for a long time.
Exploitant objectives
The most important places do not allow the majority of Cuba visitors.
Thus you do not need to write about Varadero or Havanna.
Remember that in the already mentioned place of Hemingways, there should be a museum that should not be allowed to visit the one whose writer may.
The Viñales Tal in the west of the island is one of the most Malean winkels of Kuba.
The smooth vegetation increases on calk grounds.
The mogotas, calf legs and legs, shaped parts of the floor, in their hole rooms, gathered fruitful grounds, also covered by confusioned rock areas of deep consumption.
This Tal is where the best Cuban tabak may be built.
In his final form, you can visit him when you visit one of Havanna's Zigarre Fabrics.
Some may seem interesting that there was the chilean consequences of the "Major Zeman" television series.
Trinity
A urgency city was founded short after the Spanishs had colonized the island.
Ruth and richness brought her the trade with slaves and sugar.
The riches in the sweet beauty of the small town.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has not changed for four hundred years.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray garden, is a so distant place that there was no road that had been linked to the rest of the country in the past centuries.
This isolation helped it to remain uncertain.
Nothing was built there, but there was nothing, everyone was happy that he had a roof over the head.
If you have more than one afternoon for Trinidad, it's fun to see interesting places in the area, such as the beach Playa Ancon or the "Tal of the sugar manufacturers".
Tonight, you should go to the Casa de la music, which live after darkness, and where music is not slow until morning.
Baracoa
This city is totally located in the eastern Kuba some of the most beautiful islands.
Indeed, this view is also influenced by the way it is.
Both roads that lead to it by Guantánamo must overcome high and circumcised mountains and pass through a landscape that is unlikely affected by human attacks.
These Eastern Cubans took the UNESCO thanks to the unrelated nature in their world Heritage directory.
There will be the best chocolate in the church showing the Cross of Columbus (in fact, it was about hundred years after the driving of Kolumbus), and from the hill where the former Burg, the present hotel El Castillo, is to see several tables from which El Y même is the most known.
About the coffee, the Roman, the Zigarren, the Sierra Maestra assembly, the island of Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cablett, the sanctuary of the Cuban Patron Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, a African religion, which recognizes the seeds of slaves, over all that can be written.
But, as you say, look better with your own eyes.
The associates in Afghan are passive, the Americans.
A few soldiers and the lack of useful equipment affect the United States according to the launch of the mission in Afghanistan.
The NATO should develop a concrete plan for the next years, according to the words of Minister of Defence, Robert Gates.
The mission in Afghan did not conclude in their opinions, but in the Scotiaan Edinburgh, the representatives of the countries have been united in the south of the country.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban side, the eight participating States also discuss further coordination plans among the partners.
While the United States, by their Defence Minister, Robert Gates, offers the NATO units more activities, the United Kingdom is priority to strengthen the authority of the Afghan Government and to intensify development aid.
"In Afghan, an early development can be seen, but military forces can only be a part of the solution.
Another part of this is to allow the people to start a continuous development of the economy and security", says the British Defence Minister of Bronthe of BBC.
Nine percent
The activity of the Afghan surrounding has reached the highest stand for five years, according to the reports of the American Army.
In comparison with the previous year, the number of violence has increased to 27%, even in the southern province of Helmand by sixty percent.
The NATO countries have stationed about 40000 soldiers in Afghan, and about one fourth in the Southern Territory.
As a result of the United States, however, the associations are cut into an absolute border with regard to the organization and equipment of the units.
Concretely, they call for further guests, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
"We're seriously going to think about the concrete goals for the next time and how we can achieve them," said Gates.
Similarly, today, the Secretary-General of the NATO, Jaap de Hoop.
"I am not pleased of what we have available in Afghan to countries and the air.
We have about nine percent of soldiers and equipment that we need, and that's too little," said De Hoop of the Agent Reuters to complete three-day discussions with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In the last few months, all of the partners in Afghan have been able to give their best.
For passiveness, for example, Germany was criticized.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum violence and the fighting requirements for them are not so high as for us in the South and Eastern part of the country," said Gates.
The British Boulevard Zeitung "Sun" this week called German soldiers as faul.
"Afghanic non-Studies detach: Germans make games while fighting our kids," the "Sun" wrote in a contribution that was added by photos German soldiers, playing the tissue.
The German school period went over and printed a picture of a British unit at a Rugby Wednesday fight in the southern Afghan part of the Afghan.
State debts will be higher in 2009 to a million
On each Czech, a State debt of 84000 chrones is debt.
The total debt increased until the end of September at 842.7 billion chrones.
The government had planned to spend this year with 159.2 billion cannes.
However, at the beginning of December the Ministry reduced the plan by the improved development of the State budget at 152.8 billion.
The State debt of the Czech Republic remained until the end of September at 842.7 billion chronicles.
Within the first nine months of this year, they succeeded at 40.2 billion.
However, from June to June, they bought about 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance confirmed that its information on the State debts from the beginning of October.
On each Czech, a debt of 84000 krones is covered.
Over the whole of the year, the State debt over 111 billion chrones.
"Together it seems that we may be overriding the borders of a million chrone by the lowest deficit for the next year.
The debts should be moved between 900 billion and a million chrones," said David Marek, Analyticer of Patria Finance, the server iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Vladimír Pikora, Analyticer of the Next Finance, looks like: "To overcome a billion, we could come over 2009.
When exactly, we do not know the next household.
If the situation was changed on the political array and the politicians should be ready to deploy more, it could continue until 2010.
But I don't get out of such a change," he noted.
Increased Debts
The State debt is due to the debts of the State government, especially from the increase of deficiencies of the State budget.
State debt is financed by debt statements, public claims, direct loans or for example by the European Investment Bank.
Inland debt increased by 719.4 billion chronicles this year.
The external debts of the State were estimated by an average of 1.7 billion chrones to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable State debt reached the end of September 803,3 billion chrones and grew from June to 13,7 billion.
The average case of State debt increased by 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased over the year from the first to the third quarter to 13 percent, which is really much in view of how good the economy is.
It is interesting that adults are mainly in debt records where growth is 20%.
It is bad that the debts increase, but otherwise this shows that you can do something before the pension reform comes", commented Pikora's data.
Better than expected
The 2007 financing strategy and the processing of State debt shows that the government had planned to include 159.2 billion chrones for this year.
However, at the beginning of December the Ministry reduced the plan by the improved development of the State budget at 152.8 billion chronicles.
This amount is mainly due to the public budget deficit that will clearly reach 76 billion chronics instead of the attacked 91.3 billion.
Furthermore, this is the maximum fund for the consolidation agency of 13.3 billion chrones, a ten-millionary reserve for payment of pensions, the financing of State debt claims for 43 billion, and the rates for allocations in the European Investment Bank of 1.8 billion.
In order to give a name to a Teddyberer, she was presented today a court in Khartum.
On Thursday night, a court in Khartum was sentenced to 15 days of detention in Sudan, the British teacher who was sentenced for the infringement of the Islamic Islam.
The British was accused to have allowed six-year-old students to give a teddyberer the name Mahomet, although any exhibition of the Islamic prophets is understood.
She would have paid it to be extracted.
After parents of students had been estimated in the Southern Cultural Ministry, the 54-year-old primary student who was at the High School of Khartum was accompanied at home on Sunday and accused of the infringement of the Islamic Criminal Act in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudan Criminal Law.
In fact, this matter takes its start in September when the teachers request their six-year-old students to visit a name for the classiteddy.
The children shoot eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, reported Leader Robert Boules.
Finally, when the class agrees, choose 20 of 23 children Mohammed as the most favorite names.
Of course, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but especially a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have created a book for the class, with the photo of the bird up and the image sign My name is Mohammed .
The beer himself didn't have a shield with this name, but the problem is very simple that the presentation of the Islamic prophets will be viewed as a condemnation of the Islamic.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbon, who taught at the same school in Sudan, explained that he knew her well, and she had never had done anything to bring her close to a religious faith, I regret only that she had requested the children to vote for a name, his view is only about an innocent error.
A view that share many teachers of the teachers who are very attentioned to their students and as a person who never speaks in the class about religion.
Remember that the pre-name Mohammed is also the second name in England, the second most commonly given, for which 14 different writings exist in English.
This mostly chosen name of muslim families applies to the prophets (this is often given to the first born of a family).
But how did the rules relate to the use of this pre-name?
Can I give him a game?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
Wednesday, the last negotiation meeting in Vienna had no agreement on the future status of the province.
At the end of the lack
The Serbens and Albanians from Kosovo have finished a sixth and last discussion meeting on midnight in Baden, Austria, without being able to overcome their conflicts on the future status of the separatistic province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not agree on the status, explained the European Commissary Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
With the emphasis on the fact that peace in the region was on the game, the American opposition Frank Wilsner Belgrade and Pristina requested to comply with its commitments towards peacekeeping, and also to continue the discussions on the end of the negotiations.
There will be no violence in the immediate future, but we are at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added and said that there are significant challenges.
End of communications on 10 December
The Communicators of Troika, who join the European Union, the United States and Russia, will take place on Monday once in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province of Albanian speech could be clearer when Ishinger, Wilsner and the Russian Commissariat Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko reached their report to the UN Security Council until 10 December.
The meetings of Baden, close to Vienna, formed the sixth and last negotiation meeting since the Troika last August, UNO received the task to a new communication.
Americans and Europeans shall notify that their communication agreement will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who had already blocked the approval of the independence of Kosovo to the Security Council, are beyond a continued negotiations on this end date.
Russia was and continued to speak with a negotiated solution, a unique solution, said Botsane-Khartchenko.
A single declaration of independence?
After eight years under UNO’s management, the Western countries shall hold the independence by the EU for the only solution with the future.
Pristina is willing to announce this one if the Security Council should not decide on its benefits.
Belgrade has more autonomy
Unfortunately, the President of the autonomy authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, was known in the hotel in Baden, where these negotiations were conducted since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovar Rebellion and the future Prime Minister of province shared their regrets.
However , he added that the proposed plan on the autonomy of a past which led to murder and deportation .
Domino Effect
The Serbian President Boris Tradic was, on the other hand, the view that a compromise was always to work, and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo before the consequences of a single declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade means that it is particularly a "domino effect" in a region that has still been deceived by the independence wars of the 1990s.
For Serbia, it does not mean that a compromise could be impossible, he said.
On Thursday, the Serbian delegation found that each decision would be taken alone and only in the Security Council where the Russian associators had a veto law.
The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word.
Only one decision from the series of Security Council is acceptable for Serbia, explained the Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostuni.
These negotiations have last two years.
They must end as they have started: in the Security Council.
The journalists answered Fatmir Sejdiu that the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status, and added that each single declaration of independence of the Albanian population will be delayed in vote with the Western countries.
Bush discovers an agreement between Israel and Palestinians
In the opening of the international peace conference, which was gathered in Annapolis, Maryland, on Thursday, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed to a common statement.
He further explained that the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had joined themselves immediately with negotiations to find a final rule of the 60 years of old conflict between their two peoples.
In the two men, Bush promised that he will do everything to help them to conclude a peace agreement before the end of 2008.
The Palestinians must destroy the terrorist infrastructure and Israel must set up its colonization work, explained Bush, remembering their obligations towards the peace plan that this 2003 had agreed.
The Chief of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian validity would, at the end of the last abbas, aimed at a peace agreement which should be made to clarify all open issues without exception, including the central issues .
This designation includes the three serious problems to turn into the conflict between Israelites and Palestinians mainly: the future borders of Palestinian, the status of Jerusalem and the slope of Arab refugees, which have been discharged in 1948 from their homes today in the State of Israel.
After the American President Abbas took the word and found that the next negotiations will be conducted comprehensively and green and provide a rule for all points, including Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water and security.
When Olmert accepted the word, he obliged himself to carry out the future weapons negotiations directly and without interruption and to endeavour to enable them to be completed before the end of 2008.
Bush has established the deadline for the implementation of his vision of two States, a Palestinian and a Israeli, which are together, at the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has opened that it has received a assurance from Bush in this sense of Bush before it decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has leaded one of all Arab countries to the way offering the peace, in exchange of all Arab areas that have been placed during the 1967 war, including Ostjerusalems.
Annapolis represents a different way in the history of the Middle East, especially because it is inclined to the roots of the conflict and its central faces, means the Saudi Arab prince in his interview with the urgency of Arab language financed by saudi money.
The police are not responsible for the complainant.

Although the IGPN remains very careful, it would also exclude any serious errors.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the findings that are needed for further research, and in which you need to be careful.
Liberation has taken a witness of these little moments shortly after the accident.

It was expected that he would depart his military runition until 15 November, date to which his first office ends as President.

Not yet is planned more than a third of pregnancies
This calculation takes into account the unwanted weaknesses (24%), as well as the bad planned or unpredicted farmers.
Even today, 40 years after accepting the newness seat that allowed the receipt prevention in France, one of three pregnancy (36%) is not planned, as shows a study of the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Inded).
This calculation takes into account the unwanted weaknesses (24%), as well as the bad planned or unpredicted farmers.
The Ined estimates that the different methods of receipt prevention such as pills or spirals are still a share of 5-6%.
According to the Institute, which determines that the percentage of pill users between 20 and 40 years that use the pills has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalization of receiving prevention has yet been a better control of fruitability.
In any case, eight of ten buildings were carefully planned today.
In one of five pairs even calculate exactly on the month, and, if possible, the yeartime in which it seems to be the most appropriate to get a child.
Spectacular repair at the room station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his cameras are used to place the International Space Station (ISS) for more than seven hours in the world in order to perform the spectacular reparation of a defected sun collection that is unacceptable to continue scientific work on the station.
A heavy increase, due to his duration, the removal of resident modules, the speed that he has been organized, and the instruments built by the astronauts to perform the repair, have achieved several recursions.
The problem was at midnight when the astronauts had downloaded the Harmony module from the spacious Discovery, a large part of the cylinderförmide that should immediately take the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a type of landscape bridges for the Module Lab.
But you have to be able to get her with electricity.
The second task of the disposal, therefore, was to implement a 17.5 tonnes of serious module for the production of electricity through sun colletctors that were already on the ISS to bring it into its final position.
After it was slaughtered, the restructuring of the suncollectors of the module with a span wide range of 76 meters.
And it happened that one of the collectors that let themselves fall like accordeone was damaged by a cut cable on a length of approximately one meter.
The restructuring was stopped to do no longer to damage the collector.
The astronauts, which originally abandon the space discovery and then another suncollector whose rotation system was missing, should have been obliged to reparse the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to spend closely at the end of the 30 meters away controlled arms of the space ship that was taken at the station to perform the repair.
He is one of the best spacewalkers of NASA.
Great, resistable, very sent, he has a goodly developed super body and long arms.
The 46-year-old physician has therefore been selected to operate the lost sun collectioner.
After he had precisely observed the damage, he crossed the fatal cable and confirmed a kind of shoes on the damaged place.
He was supported by a second spacewalker, who remained near the slope, and, inside, by the other astronauts, among them, Peggy Whitson, commanders of the placement.
The tool that he used to develop a mini-hockey blue, developed with isolator, to make the sun colletctors that generate several hundreds of flights to prevent an electrical shock, had thought and baptized the astronauts on the board of the station.
When the action was finished, Scott Parazynski waited, until the collector was completely dispatched before he dropped his tools and returned to the station.
Last afternoon the astronauts had a half day dispatch before today seven astronautes returned to the space of Discovery, so that the return to the earth was expected afternoon.
The title EADS sanctioned at the Börse
After announcing the Airflow and Defence Group that it must be evacuated between 1.1 and 1.4 billion euros in order to affect the residues of the A400M, the EADS Action presents a significant decrease in the Paris Burse.
EADS is currently losing 4% to 21.96 euros at the Paris Burse.
The group was forced to review its business prognosis for 2007 again to refer to the residues caused by the only slowly advanced development of the engine of the A400M that delay the flight of the flight.
The costs announced in October to compare the delay in the delivery of their military transportation flights are between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, which was more than a billion for airbus, announced the mother centers of the European manufacturer EADS.
On the basis of these costs, EADS will be able to announce new operational goals (EBIT) for 2007, without further details.
The group also argued that the evaluation of the new costs corresponds to the six-month decline.
Remember that EADS' business benefits have been 86% in 2006, in fact due to the delay of another programme, the costs associated with the very large refrigerator A380.
Originally, the group had prepared a first delivery of the A400M to the French army for October 2009.
The selection of the Status Quo
On Sunday, it will not be relaxable when the urins are discussed: the Russian mass will decide for President Putins party, the Russian United Nations.
After a very shocked campaign, she confirms its efforts by stability, even by authority.
Three days before the Parliament's election, the Russian President Wladimir Putin offers a message to the electioners whose content will be secreted on the public senders.
He does this in his property as a special candidate of the Russian United Nations, the Pro-Creml Party, for which he announces an overwhelming victory.
Last night, the President has not seen anything when he accepted the foreign advertising, and was satisfied to deliver a new point of attack against the Western forces accused of the infringement - his favorite topic during the election campaign.
We know the price of a true democracy and we hope honest elections, extremely careful and open, without fraud, he added.
In view of the opposition, they've been declined.
It's planning an election campaign by underpression.
The Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that it would never have given such smiling choices, never even in the time of Eltsin.
Following the demonstrations in the last weekend, the former Master Garry Kasparovder was sentenced for unlawful demonstrations for five days, he continued to visit the lawyer.
The Russians have maintained the mentality of the Homo Soviet
Once this Parliament's choice without enthusiasm, there are two many further questions:
Who will take Putin's follow-up as President?
Last night, the office has announced the date of the first election of the presidency election, on 2 March 2008, and the candidates have been known until 23 December.
Since he chose 2000 and was re-selected in 2004, Wladimir Putin may not occur for a third mandate.
And now there is no follower.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Is the President of Parliament's masterity and the Alliance of the Russian Party, the Government and the President?
Whatever it will be, the parliamentary or the election of the Presidency will triumphate the previous power.
It's tradition.
The Russians have saved the mentality of the Homo Soviet Homo, they are not the Lord of their Schicksals, meaning the sociolog Lev Goudkov, Director of the Independent Centre Levada.
The historical Nikolai Kopossov from the National University of Sankt Petersburg continues to continue: the civil society has been developed in this country, which has been Christianized for five centuries to Europe, only very slowly developed; the famous community's spirit has delayed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin reiterates the model of a patrialist State, which was completely accepted by the population, so much more, since no terrorism followed this new paternalism, but a certain economic well-being, Mary Lipman is the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians reject the personal responsibility that they have recently posted after the crash of the UDSSR.
For what time?
These phenomena relate to all social affairs, including the business world.
And the administrative site is understood to maintain the status Quo: 65 Governance (of 85 Russian regional Chairmans) brings the local election lists of the Russian United Nations.
The new freedoms coming from the West are often equal to Chaos, as in the 1990s.
The generality promotes stability.
In this sense, Russians will not vote for the extremist parties.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: How long do you get to?
Those who are in the power are not so bad, why do they resolve?
A Severe Anden
After they were treated with confidence over 60 years, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which are documenting the 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now free.
The 47 million documents of the Archive, which have been undertaken at a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, could not be viewed until now, except with an humanitarian perspective, individually and namely, or on the question of a former sacrifice or its members.
The 11 with its administrative official States, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed to make them available for researchers and historians in May 2006.
After the ratification process has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Heicule information
The access of historics to Bad Arolsen will be able to conduct research, especially on the deportation of prisoners, the infringements of the concentrations and the health status of the pregnant workers , explains Reto Meister, leader of this architect, managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, were also available to these named documents for publicity because of the heavy character of certain information.
For example, the perceived homosexuality or the spiritual prevention of some deportation victims.
The lists of concentration stocks or detention commands issued by the Gestapo were collected in a practical basis: the civilians who were deported or the pregnant work had been understood, and eventually provide them a proof of their detention to evacuate their way to their deprivation.
Still today, editing ten thousands of personal requests in Bad Arolsen more than 300 festivals.
However, a part of the scientific community is only a limited interest in access to bad arolsen.
There should be no fundamental news in these documents, Mr. Wolfgang Benz, head of the Centre for Antisemitism of the Technical University of Berlin, in 2006.
The EU and India want to achieve a free trade agreement in 2008.
Currently reached the mutual trade between India and Europe at the 60 billion euros in the year.
The EU is the main business partner of India and is 18% of its external trade.
The European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath, acknowledged that the European Union and India hoped to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU's Foreign Ministers had given the European Commission last April green light to open negotiations in order to sign free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of South-South-South Nations (Asia) and reached the mutual trade between India and Europe already reached the 60 billion euros in year.
The EU is the first trade partner in India and is 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but, according to the European Commission's numbers, India is only the nine trade partner of the EU.
A free trade package will enhance the two economic spaces, and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million European employees, confirmed Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first and second market for the ten most frequent exported products from India, and has continued to declare the European Commission's Commission. The Asian and European Gigants have not been cut up annual goods of 47 billion euros and services in value of 10 billion euros, this week, Danielele Smadja, President of the European Commission in New Delhi, and regret that the mutual trade has not yet been equipped with its potential.

The Bank of England takes note of the emergency and offers 10 billion pounds of pounds for five weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England was concerned about the re-established emergency of the credit conditions and announced a offer of ten billion pounds with a substantial rate of 5,75% for five weeks, a offer with an incompatible duration period.
In order to defeat the fears that the financial market will be particularly hard in the end of the year and to give the banks a greater consciousness of how they should organize their liquidity positions in this time, the Bank has intended to provide a significant part of its spatial plants during the maintenance phase of 6 December, in form of an open market operation for five weeks, in a communication.
The bank continues that, on 6 December, 10 billion dollars (14 billion euros) will be rounded to the basic tax rate and only 10 January.
This seems to be the first time that the BoE in a Open Market Operation Liquidities for five weeks.
This normally happens for one week.
In its communication, the EEA adds that it is willing to take further measures to receive the different interest rates of inter-departmental allocations by day to day.
The different interest rate from day to day was at midnight at 5,829%.
The three-month scene has been depending on 6,6%, something higher since September 18.
From the beginning of the financial crisis in the sums of the Bank of England have been linked to penalties that the banks had stopped to take them into account.
According to certain values, strengthened by the development of the euro currency, there are many suggestions to sign the sums that have been developed by the European Central Bank, to be more favourable interest rates and to safely discretion.
UMP and NC are deemed to review the proposals of the PS to purchase power
On Thursday, the UMP and New Zealand groups refused to discuss the articles of the Socialist Law proposed to purchase the power of purchase, which is equal to a rejection of the text.
The text of the Socialist Nice (session on the initiative of a parliamentary grouping) adopted about ten measures adopted at the mid-day of the National Committee of the PS, which was 50% of the majority of the job allocation, the re-introduction of the TIP, a transport check or the limitation of the average.
After the UMP and NC voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes against 115), the meeting was resolved after the main discussion, which was a partly heavy interchange between majority and opposition, a few hours prior to the television amount of Nicolas Sarkozy on the purchase force.
The director of the PS Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group will propose the totality of its proposals as an amendment to the draft legislation for the correction of the financials, which was examined by the assembly week.
A new festival is born
As a result, numerous views regarding the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the Promotor/Produce the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the British Festival Republic of Melvin Benn.
It is a honor for our company to work together with a person who, not less than the example of the current festival movement in America, shared Charlie Jones from C3 on Bilboard.com with.
C3 celebrates the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer target for camping holidays.
The festival will be held from 8-10 August at a 500-acre large private color about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The leader of Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known under Mean Fiddler, is one of the most famous festivals of the world.
In 1989, he took the leadership of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which locks up to 80,000 people annually.
Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival in 1999, and then, 2006, Festival Republic created the Festival Latitude Festival in Henham Park.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has also been owner of its property to care for the production of licensing concepts and organizational tasks of Glastonbury Festival, which can take up to 177.500 people.
Charlie Jones from C3 describes Glastonbury as the most inspiring event in which he has ever been in there, says that his company and Melvin Benn's company are parallel to work together to offer a festival event in the European style.
We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and work with the Fairmont Park Commission to create a festival in the city centre of Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We conducted negotiations from the city and the Commission was motivated and encouraging to this project.
Unfortunately, we have remained at the police debates on the current management, and Charlie Jones continues.
"Happyly we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and to create a great celebration of preparations on a extraordinary place that will finally benefit from the population."
C3 Presents, the Lollapalooza - Festival 2005 in the Grand Park Chicago, returned to life after 2002, together with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in the world of the Festival Profile.
The two events can be achieved by $9,8 million and $11,8 million in brutal tax rates in 2007.
These two festivals are found in urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, instead of which we are most in the urban green surfaces," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is to put these two concepts together in order to simultaneously communicate the impression of a rural festival to the European and urbanly in the American way."
Vienna is nearly halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Community of Vienna, including the Citizensman, takes the last event with joy," says Charlie Jones.
The last caller refuses to give the conditions of the Agreement to price, but he confirms "they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to celebrate a festival that hopely will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the acquiring capacity of the Festival is very big, in accordance with the 80,000 people at Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations were sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vienna is offered a smiling rock, but music will be very varied, in hope to lock all kinds of observers," says Charlie Jones.
His partner from C3, who received the Top Independent Promotor price of the last Bollett Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal is on the terminal.
It's not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood films to Montreal if no ringers are more than the terminal.
These checks are among the delegated tasks.
A political "heikles Mandat", because the Governeur of California, Arnold Black Zeager, is the "runnaway Productions".
Is it difficult to negotiate the Gouvernator?
"They must be careful, because it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions are good in Montreal, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those who are looking for the best", he says.
The run on the festivals.
However, for Denis Turcotte, there is a priority for the cinema's main priority at the moment.
The jagd after the Oscars started.
On all festivals at the west coast, even though Sundance, which is from Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, is going to present the movies from Quebec, to evaluate them and to ensure that producers give interviews.
The dark age had a progressed idea on the 30.000 Valley Film Festival for a few weeks.
He is presented in January on the Palm Springs International Festival.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the place in Santa Monica and is presented on the 30th star Denver Film Festival in November.
This month also presented four long and four short films on the American Film Institute Festival.
Is the Burse a final year-really? Unity with experts because of the US hypotheke crisis
With nearly five weeks to the year end at the Burse, investors have already turned their hands towards the coming end year-Rally.
However, experts cannot create safe prognoses in this regard.
Banif believes that it is statistically considered that the month of the month at the Burse is normally with a positive market development
Indeed, it is not ratifying to create prognoses short-term and only on the basis of statistics, especially not when seriously engaged in determining the current market events.
Although other experts do not have such a strong increase in the last weeks of the year, they noted that the burden currency is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market shareholders. These investments are mainly affected by the lack of safe share funds in pension funds, which are significantly affected by the estimated trend of a valuable assets.
As a result, these experts believed that the Burse is a higher-scale rate of market changes, especially because we are not able to evaluate the levels of the possible decline of the US Note Bank, a insecurity which is insecurity, especially on the increased price of raw oil and the risk of increased inflation rates.
Javier Barrio, Chairman of the Selling Division at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a time to announce a predecessor market Rally.
The chances are not very good, safeguards the experts.
The Spanish share index Ibex has already lost a value of 4 % since its maximum brand on 8 November of 15.945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, analyst at Intermoney, Ibex 35 could conclude with the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional funds, each year for this time the pension case, the year successfully completed with nearly 16.000 points.
However, the expert has found that this year could develop something different, especially because of the second night of December, and then directly after the bridge day of the Constitution, the end-year-Rally happens.
The analyst considers that price changes would not affect market trends.
According to the evaluation of Federico Olucha, analysis at the Bank Investis, the previous market assessments are at a closely technical level, which could lead to a decrease of the index values which decrease the consequences of the US hypothetic market crisis.
The analyst believes that this is positive.
The analysts agree with the selection of the values that the Ibex should take to new maximums.
Solana of Intermoney confirms that this year the large values are on the line.
The expert would contain the two large banks and some real estate companies, as the electrical sector will be more cost-time.
During the period, Federico Olucha assured the bank Inversis that the entities will be associated with the bank and industry sector.
If the Rally is actually suitable, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
The ACP has been on the reception course in the last months and we hope that other real estate companies, such as Ferrovial and FCC, take the same way, so the experts.
With regard to the increased consumption during Christmas, the market event is determined during the last half of the periodic consumption.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also be achieved by positive overall results, even if they are only in low numbers of Spanish markets.
Five times in seven years
In the past seven years, the December was only in two cases of course.
At the end of 2003, the technologie switch led the bars out of their crisis and launched the last real year's end.
This year, in which Ibex 35 was 28.17 percent points, the December increased to 6.68%.
Whether 2008 the fifth winning year will be followed (the Ibex increases from January to 8,36%) and can also present an end-year period.
Popular will open its 200 credit institutions from mounts to Friday 12 hours on day.
Popular has decided to modernize a large part of his branches.
In the most economic regions of Spain, the total of 200 of these have been accompanied.
For the Institute operating under the Markenname Popular Max, these shoes means a large milk stone.
But also for the remaining Spanish institutes, since the Popular is the first banking group, it is urging to extend the opening time of his filial on Wednesday to 20.30 p.m. and to apply at the afternoon from 10 a.m. to 20.30 p.m.
The BBVA banking group, which also repeatedly reads the extension of its opening time in the delays, has not yet considered a definitive conclusion.
The current negotiations of the bank with the workshops seem to have an agreement, with the 75% of all branches will be closed afternoon and opened for a weekday afternoon, even if not for the customer.
Whether other banks of the new initiative adapting to the opening time of business will be accompanied by the experience values of the public bank.
And just just this is the hope that the people follow with their project.
It is aimed to extend the opening time of the branches that can be accompanied by their own, small and medium-sized customers, as well as by large buyers.
The bank wants to open the new 200 shipments during the next 18 months, as it is not a new, but a changed opening time.
For this purpose, the bank will convert the spaces of those delays that are already in business areas and compare with the individual customer profile of the various zones.
So the expansion of opening times will be connected to a new space of the branches, which is represented by a more modern, frozen design.
The competent banker Angel Rivera ensures that restructuring does not require greater investment but agreed with an increased staff institution, as a branch now was not six, but eight or nine.
Non-financing products will be sold even with additional spaces for KMUs.
A positive experience for the group
People have already tried his concept of nine branches in Madrid.
And the values of experience were positive, so Angel Rivero.
The delays of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Dunell and the Gran Vía are selected for what seemed to be a quiet solution.
Popular has some 2500 dischargements at the moment.
And more than 60 operating under the name Mundocredit. They are specialized on immigrants and also enlarged opening times, even at sun and holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax, the model of BBVA is not used, as most of them are offered a wide selection of non-financing services to sell.
We don't want to make competition for our customers, explains Rivero.
With telephoneica, they have come to the agreement to sell external bank-personal mobile phones.
The Spanish private telecinco first doubles its bars and then removes its rivals Antena 3.
We did it.
With this sentence, the director of Telecinco, Paul Vasile, reported his satisfaction at the end of Börsen. He has increased his value in the two times of his rival Antena 3.
But one aspect of his joy: This is exactly what I am hurt; not that we have a higher growth, but that we had less losses, he set up.
He stressed that, despite the weak market, they have not yet been deeply collapsed.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with a plus of 2,54%.
This wine is less than 15.66% of his losses this year.
The company value now reached 4.488.88 million euros, with the main share of the capital (52%), and Vocento is only involved in 13%.
The Rivale Antena 3 lost 1,52 percent points since January and has registered a loss of total 40.5%, so its market value is 2.193.46 million to half.
In the case of Sogecable 3,531 million, in Prisa (exhibitors of the Cinco Días) at 2.518.53 million and in Vocento at 1.779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 may be denied by the fact that it is about two similar companies, so Vasile.
Indeed, there is still the question in which way we can actually operate boursetechnologically, what price and how we can build it on customer levels.
Telecinco declared his project this year to be the first television visitor with more than 1,000 million breeding wins from advertising income. This assured Guiseppe Tringali, the director of Telecinco and Publicspana, the public company of the group.
If the project should be implemented, the sender would increase its public events compared to 965.4 million from the previous year to 3,6%.
In the case of Antena 3, the net rate increased up to 1,6% in the first nine months (to up to 734.4 million), while net income from television business could only increase 0.7% (630.4 million).
The main factor for the improved telecinco Börsen process see the analysts at the high Payout Ratio, which could show the company up to this time: 2006, Alejandro Echevarria was a 100%-face-in-law expense.
Vasile, however, ensures that the ratio can still vary after purchase 33% of the shares of finished milk, with mediaset as mother society, even if it is too early for an official advertising.
We are obliged to pay at least 50% of the share, even if we have always given more significantly.
I hope that we can satisfy our shareholders this year whose share values we could already increase by purchasing 33% of the final milk.
According to the analysts, the market presents certain losses.
Lehmann Brothers recently reduced its professional calculation at Telecinco for this year to 4% and for 2009 to 7%.
This is the result of the increase in the expected growth rate, which will reduce from 10.5% to 8,4% and 2009 from 5,5% to 5,1%.
This also reduced the expected profit calculation of Antena 3 for 2008 by 4,5% and 7,5% for 2009.
3 Options.
1.
Ibersecurities: place on its high effects-free power and sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: missing Telecinco (acquire) as a result of the numerous encouragement and the prosperous market, a more advantageous position of Antena 3 (keeping).
3.
JPMorgan: recommends to reverse the expectations in both cases in view of similar threats (profit market and worse economic climate)
The Congress agrees to the Directive on MIFID, which entered into force on 1 November.
The Government has published the provisions of the new legislation to enable both arrangements to enter into force until the end of the year.
The representatives of the various enterprises unilaterally congratulated the efforts of the Congress and Senate Members who had followed their negotiations and votes to establish the best possible arrangements to ensure the security of investors and regulate individual entrepreneurs' activities in order to ensure a general efficiency of the market.
The MIFID, which newly sets the value payment regulation, follows in addition to the modernization of the financial markets, will improve investment protection, increase the control right of the Spanish VAT (CNMV) Commission and the promotion of cooperation between the various control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive allows it to provide specialized enterprises as well as to natural or legal persons financial consultations and also contributes to the establishment of new financial service companies (ESIS) to the consultations which are assembled with the installation and communication companies of value papers.
It further expands the number of systems for the implementation of financial transactions, so that the regulated cycle markets will be added to the multilateral systems of effective business and the systems for internationalization of trade contracts which would eventually be competitive with the current economic operators.
The law obliges investing undertakings to report the main points of their business profile, the confrontation and the forms of transaction with risks on the market and to register all the projects carried out in order to facilitate the CNMV's conduct of control.
The Committee on Economics of the Congress has further amended, with the decision that the debt description of the titles must now apply because of their high risk levels for the investor as complex financial resources confirmed by the US hypothesis and banking crisis. (US hypotheks crisis)
Furthermore, the Directive was used for the legal limitation of the work of diplomated economic scientists; 30 years after 1977, the Regulation which restricted the working areas reserved for the economic sciences was adopted.
On the other hand, the Senate identified new positions in the financial sector, such as the economic mediator who works on foreign accounts, does not require authorisation from the CNMV and can provide its services for commercialization of products and customer benefits at the same time for several investment enterprises.
The harmonised consumer price index (VPI) is increased to five decades in November and is now at 4.1%.
The Eurostat, which serves to assess the inflation rate within the European Union, provides the average price development in November in Spain.
His publication corresponds to the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) which aim to compare local and quality products by the notification of the data.
Prognoses for the indicator can be created prematurely by applying the same method as the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time, different statistical modelling methods can be used to evaluate the information that is not available at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish statistics camp (INE) suggested that the previously identified indicator should not agree with the final result announced on 14 December.
The consumer price index (VPI) will continue to remain at relatively high levels
According to the event of the Government's heads and the Minister of Economic and Finance, Peter Solbes, the increase of the VPI in November was more temporaryly developed; it also assured that the price index would continue to remain at relatively high level in the coming months.
However, Solbes noted that even if the present number is not good, the inflation difference in Spain to the other members of the monetary Union in the last few years remained more or less equal.
In addition, he stated that there were less surprises in November than the last month in which the government did not calculate with such a high increase.
We expected a value of around 4% , which was known by the Minister of Economic and Finance for the present prognosis.
Virgin is calculated with Northern Rock Income from more than 42 billion euros in the coming three years
The value resources of Northern Rock are cut over half, after the Bank Mid September of the last year's crisis, the British Note Bank had requested an emergency credit, and only 12,000 million pounds (which corresponds to 16,800 million euro).
At this time the ownerships of the bank are $25,000 million, a sum that has been significantly cut by the loss of confidence of the customers and also in spite of the 100% guarantee of the government that the money is safe until the crisis ends.
The firm Virgin, which would lead the group after the market names Virgin Money, must take about a fourth of the income of the British banks that will be collected from the plants of the next three years to purchase the exact 18 billion pounds that still need to achieve their objectives of 30 billion.

The Citizensman of Totana was arrested because of an accused condemnation to participate in urban construction corruption
In the morning, the Spanish police has arrested the current citizensman of the Totano (Partido Popular) locality belonging to the municipality of Murcia (Partido Popular), due to the urgent suspicion of the development of the urban corruption found this week.
Furthermore, one of the secretariats of the Council of Communities and the Chief of the Communities Policei was arrested.
José Martínez Andreo was last May the office of Juan Morales, the current deputy of the Popular Party and at the time of the Common Council of Totana, and could be the original chairman of the Complot.
The officers do not continue to investigate the business documents of the Community and the Ministry of Cities Planning and complete further arrests within the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales was accused of the principal suspect in the case of urban corruption found at the beginning of this week.
According to Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular, and therefore the privileged deputy Juan Morales, when his mandate leaves the residence officer, was arrested because of important documents to be linked to the Complete.
In addition, other sources of information from the contract payments of Morales to a gallery manufacturing undertakings that are the end of a urban construction contract where the construction of a 200 hectares has been decided.
At present, eight people are in investigation.
Bono agreed to accept the candidature of the PSOE in Toledo, and, if an election seat, to take place at the Congress.
The former Defence Minister José Bono has adopted the offer of the Government President and Secretary-General of Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, and he will, according to the list of PSOE candidates in Toledo, take the list of the next general elections in Toledo and, in the case of a seat of socialists, the office of the Congress President.
So José Blanco, the organization secretariat of the PSOE, and Bono had announced a meeting with Zapatero at the press conference today.
The government head believes that the offer is justified to the former minister, since it is important in policy to be able to count the best and Bono is among the best.
Furthermore, the politicians from Mancha would claim to be chaired as Chairman of the Congress for the Party in the event of a victory for socialists in the future elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as Presidents of the Congress, and it had been announced on 15 November last not to come to the next general election to end his careers in the public policy and to put themselves in the university area for climate protection.
The former minister had to realize that the President of the Government had continued to return to political events since his return was two years ago.
In addition, he pointed out that the Party, as in the name of the Vice-President for Economics, did not want citizens to preserve who would take the posts of the Chairman of the Conference and called it as an act of transparency .
If he really should take the office, he hopes to turn the room into a house of respect and not to be angry or grief to allow the citizens to seem more similar.
Unfortunately, from time to time the impression of whether the only place where you can't speak in Madrid is quiet and left is the conference; so the president of the government has been interrupted at Senate once 26 times.
At the same time, he loving the current President Manuel Martín and his good work and said that he wouldn't like to have the office already, as otherwise his political matchers would call it arrogance.
Climate Proposal
Since the climate debates both the climate change skeptics and those who are subject to a social and political debate in this regard are a critical crisis, the movement must be a very strong coherence.
In particular, if it is a leader of the movement, which, as in the case of President Zapatero, the fight against climate change is more important than the fighting of Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
However, this proposal makes it in a statement on the trade or not on its Government, which has decisively contributed to the fact that Spain is within the EU, which have at least complied with the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol.
Those who are responsible for the non-compliance of the requirements on which sectors are to be recovered, and why his Government, who proposed the Treaty with the Planet, did not stop this development.
In addition, it is now able to present the Spanish citizens the measures provided by him against climate change without circumstances.
What companies will be affected to change the behavior of citizens, what individual and collective spheres should be carried out and what economic consequences they have.
Exactly said who needs to be sacrificed and will be paid for the saving of the planet.
However, it has and will not give such statements in the future.
It's because it's about the sacrifice and the payment.
Because the measures that can be implemented really against climate change are unpleasant.
They are free, unacceptable and threatenable for the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even the PSOE-proposed benzin census, Zapatero has seen a dangerous strategy that he has seen itself able to return the proposal.
This is now a way to save the planets with nothing, so with pure propaganda and empty speech without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, Commissions, committees, protocols and new employees.
With its contracts with the planet, the other political politicians must not speak, nor approximate, nor request, nor demand, but take the appropriate expenditure, shock the meetings, and advise others with his sanctification and goods.
However, this can only happen if the treaty does not disappear from its pure virtual nature and then does not require that the driving route will be for the future to the only continued movement or we can only be able to spend with one of the cases.
The Chief Citizens and the police chief of Totana are due to an incredible development in a urban cultured corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the Citizensminister of Totana, the popular politician José Martinez Andreo. In addition, the local police chief, the secretariat of the Citizenship and a hotel employee because of the murder of the murder of the city's cultural offences, he said today, from investigation crystals.

Furthermore, two other persons were not sentenced directly, but a procedure of investigation was undertaken by the First Court of First Totonas.

A college is informed of the registration of illegal Internetdownloads in the Criminal Lawbook:

But if you turn back to a music business under a value of 400 euros, this only applies to it as a simple disappearance (Article 623.1).
B. If you cut the business up to a value of 1000 euros, then the slaughter will be sentenced as a penalty, but the punishment is lower than at the download (Article 234 of the Criminal Law).
C. If you close a car and get back forty hours later, the punishment is still lower than at a download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less difficult to participate in a wheel than in a music data exchange.

My home doctor gives me one of his long, strange research items with the title: money leads to active certain brain areas, especially if others get more of it.
Thus, the feelings depending on the content of colleagues resulting from the monthly payment.
The study was produced by a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the last issue of the Science Journal.
According to Bernd Webers, author of the study and director of the Bonner Survey Center Life & Brain, the activement was the most stronger when the participants gave correct answers and raised his players.
The researchers could recognise that the brain invasion is always very moderate when both participants were right with their reply and then seeing the same content; but if one of them received the double, it also became a greater cerebral activity.
I am not really sure if there are so many scientific approaches to achieve such results.
The Ombudsman of the Balkan
Carla del Ponte has been inevitable for eight years after the offenders of the Balkan wars. Your office is located in the State Court of Criminal Court of Ancient Yugoslavia, in La Haya.
Your mandate will be out of the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a smiling and laugh eye, as the chief responsibilities of the massaker of Srebrenica - on the eighth thousand bosnic muslims have continued to live - the former general Ratko Mladic and the former Serbo-Bossian leader Radovan Karadzic are on the free foot.

What insurance is best for me?
The KFZ insurance, which covers a potential damage caused by the driver, includes a high cost reverse, which reverses the height of various factors, such as age, gender, time of the creation of the driver, family status, type of the safe cars and its use, etc.
A car to possesse is only the beginning.
Because it is even more difficult to find the appropriate KFZ insurance than the correct vehicle model.
First, we have to be a clear one of the things we have to do here.
An insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurance insurance.
This agreement shall be established in writing by a insurance contract which determines that the company receives the insurance premium and is obliged to present the corresponding amounts of insurance in a case of damage.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance composed by several factors, e.g. age, sex, time of the creation of the leadership, family status, type of the vehicle to ensure or its use.
Insurance companies shall determine their prices in accordance with the statistics, so that higher contributions will be paid in a higher accident survey.
For this reason, both over 25 years and women have to pay less contributions, as statistics show that these groups are a lower accident rate thanks to their attention.
Similarly, it applies to married persons, as they are based on statistical values and, after convincing the companies, to less accidents than only.
The use of the vehicle affects the frequency of the driving and thus the probability of an accident.
More often the use, so more likely of the damage.
In order to establish the premium, the insurance must take into consideration a number of points.
This is why the driver must also study the situation in order to choose the right insurance that is mostly covered by its personal needs.
We now listen to this place to the most important points that should be taken into consideration in the selection of insurance in order to meet not only a performance, but also a premised choice.
The 25-year-old persons shall take place in the choice of a price-favourable insurance on numerous obstacles, such as the low-driving practice and the young driver's appearance.
Even if it would be the best for an ideal insurance protection to complete a full-case-case insurance, there are more precious alternatives.
The careful drivers can choose a full box with self-participation, so that the performance of full-case insurance is covered, but they are offered to a low price.
This type of contract includes that the customer must pay a part of the amount incurred by the damage.
The amount shall be fixed before the contract and on the basis of the amount of the insurance premium, which is higher than the amount to be paid, explains Luis Noguera, the main President of Spain at the First Europe, a communication company for online insurances.
Another option is the extensive insurance that assurances the customers against external accidents, but not against the damage caused by the car.
Furthermore, this type of insurance would cover the steel, burning and vehicle loss.
Here's a advice.
If you are under 25 years of age, it is in your hand to reduce the insurance costs; so your deposit will increase by trying to run carefully and avoid accidents.
A deposit is a decrease of the baseline to the corresponding insurance society.
On the contrary, a punishment includes an adjustment rate.
The amount of payments and penalties depends on the company and their income.
If the company has a huge year behind himself, it may be allowed to increase the Bonus statements , explains Noguera.
Once the 25-year market exceeds, it is simpler to conclude a contract for the driver. For this reason, it is the fact that the accident rates are raised with increased bicycle practice.
It is therefore the most sensitive to decide on a full-case-case insurance with self-employment.
Normally, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the case of accident and at the time of the driving, explains the Spanish chief of the European company and adds that the majority of accidents have occurred in the second practice year after the fear of the applicant.
However, it is only if it allows the financial situation of the person concerned.
The page of the assurancers shall apply to marriages with children as clients with the lower accident rate, and, in this regard, low down their contribution payments.
In this case, an insurance insurance with self-employment (in a amount of EUR 300) would be the best option. In the case of a high-payment, an increased insurance is recommended to be used for the first third vehicle year.
They are in total more slower and have a larger purchase power that allows them to make a higher contribution, Luis Noguera determines.
It is intended to conclude a full cash insurance with self-employment (in an amount to 150 euros) or a extended insurance, which is only in place for a sufficient higher deposit.
Finally, it must be observed that self-assurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver against possible accidental damages, but also because it applies high costs that requires to take a green selection that corresponds to our personal situation.
The Celtic Glasgow hopes in Mayland on the point for the acetelfinal
The FC Milan and the Celtic Glasgow will be struggled at San Siro on Friday to fight the point that is lacking them to achieve their objectives even before the end of the Champions League front. The Italians need to reach the point in order to reach the spots of their group, while they decide on their participation in the shoes.
The Italian body has already five points and has already confirmed its participation in the fifth round with an indecision in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow still needs a further need for nine points to make sure that the FC Shakhtar does not receive the Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two games of the D group will be held a week before the end of the sixth game round, since the FC Mayland has to come to the FIFA World Club mastership in Japan, where he will be struggled first into the end of the 13th half-final for the first time to struggle in the end of the 16th.
So this group will be closed before all others and the unresolved results in the Guiseppe Meazza Stadion on the other hand, even though both teams will be tried to win. The Italians are not going to show the Keltic Glasgow that they would be able to have a better starting position in the acetel final.
Gordon Strachan could even be able to qualify himself at a sleep of the FC Shakhtar. However, he should not always be very trusted in such circumstances, because at nine points the Ukrainians are being involved; those who had lost almost the last week in Glasgow (2-1), but could win (2-0) at the second game.
Thus, the mail countries will try to shoot the night. They hope to reach the shooting final of the converted champion league after they were shocked in the pre-session in exactly the same round by a gate of caka in the posttime (1-0) and by a slightly null inconsistence on the game.
While the FC Shakhtar waits on the victory of the Rossoneri, the manity must concentrate on the own game, as both the achievement of the acetilfinal and its membership in the EUFA by its victory and a slaughter of the Celtic Glasgow.
The Benfica Lisbon could, despite its lower table position and without the prospect of continued to participate in the largest European mastership, reduce the third place and therefore join the EUFA.
20,000 visits in Vancouver the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour.
The Spice Girls gave the first tour in the Canadian Vancouver before the eye of 20,000 viewers of the starting committee for their first tour after resolving the band in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) explained shortly before the beginning of their concerts at the GM Place de Vancouver Stadium that the stimming in the re-combined band was excellent.
To survive the 200,000 people, the concert was shown in the sales stadium, where a video on the band history, the end of the ninety-years for Furore, was shown.
The reconnection and the world tours overcome the publication of a new album, which includes their largest hits and two new songs, headlines and Voodoo, and that appears under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls were on the bridges of golden arms that had given them the husband of Posh Spice, the English football David Beckham.
The sporter was among the fanmas in the public, which brought the GM Palace to swimming, although the nerves of his wife Victoria had forbidden it in the past days.
During the preparations for Schow, Victoria Beckham believed that the British Star has not been the only time to face our garden, and so I'm already shocking what he's going to bear.
Sporty Spice, whose exhibition from the group in 1998 resulted in internal opinions, two years later, the resolution of the group, expressed her nervousity two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw the situation of publicity changed that the feelings were changed to the Spice Girls.
And so I thought why not, so I am glad to have taken this decision, Chisholm expressed himself on the separation of the band which she had left for nine years ago.
The songman also believed that the strictnesses were removed and that, however, all were very pleased.
However, many things have changed since the last common event of Spice Girls in 1998.
First, the group, according to the TV CTV report, came into a special machine of the Virgin Airlines in Vancouver.
When she arrived at the airport, the band of a soldier was received from children's girls.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will be held next in California, San José (4 December) and in Los Angeles (5th and 7th December).
In Madrid on 23 December, they will join the shoes.
New fears about the earthquake trail between Russia and Ukraine
A new price stretch between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the risk that Russian exports from fuel to Western Europe are affected.
The largest part of Russian land gas exports into the European Union (EU) is conducted by Ukraine and every conflict between the two nations is very precisely observed.
Kiew has warned that if Moscow had to pay the price that it must pay for the gas, it will take account of higher transit costs from Russia.
A previous conflict between the two States has reduced delivery to the EU States last year.
The recent conflict between Kiew and Moscow is at a time, at which the Ukrainian government and the Russian, stated Gazprom Gazprom try to reach an agreement on how much the Ukraine must pay for Russian earthquake in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine must be calculated more, since the concerts have agreed to pay up to 50% additionally for gas from the nearby Turkmenistans.
Analysts say that this might mean that Ukraine should pay 40% more for the imports of gasprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit States in conversation," said the Ukrainian Economic Minister Anatoli Kinakh of the News Agency Reuters.
"The changed earth gas prices should certainly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit expenditure [in Western Europe]."
In the latest large gas stretch between Moscow and Kiew, in January 2006, Gazprom delivery in Ukraine.
This resulted in a case of exports to Western Europe, which drasticly led the prices to the height.
Russian gas is a fourth part of the supply of the European Union.
Russia has developed the world's largest gas preventions, but many of them have remained developed.
The result is that Gazprom adds its own equipment with gas from Turkey and other central Asian countries.
NHS "controlling foreign workers"
The Skotish State Health Service must improve the control of the criminal registers for workers outside Europe, said a member of the control body.
The recommendation of the head-financer Robert Black, after a foreign doctor in Scotland, was taken together with the attack on Glasgow's airport in June.
Black also reminded that the Scotia State Health Service has no specific ideas regarding the number of its foreign workers.
But his report pointed out that other important controls were correctly performed in a sample of five health authorities.
The main financial supervisor investigated staff restructured outside the European Economic Area foreign countries, resulting from the attack on Glasgow's airports.
Bilal Abdullah, a 28th Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Passley, was arrested at the airport after a swimming car was passed through the doors of the main flight terminal.
He was one of the three doctors who appeared in the Old Bailey in a video transmission in October, and was shocked in connection with the smooth autobomber attack in Britain.
It is expected that the public health services are carried out in order to monitor foreign workers to ensure that they have the necessary qualifications, experiences and authorisations to work in the United Kingdom.
While the health authorities use Scotland to review prevailing records, the Agency does not have the authority to receive these information outside the UK.
In addition to other recommendations, the report of the main investigator now indicates that the Leader of the Criminal Registration Guidelines helps workers in control in different countries.
"Only we have found in certain personal documents indications on these controls, these were not routinely implemented."
Black said the Scotia health authorities would follow their research guidelines before the establishment, but added: "The report shows areas in which the system can be improved to ensure that exact information is available on the number of foreign health workers".
BMA Skotland President Dr. Peter Terry said that it is "extremely uncertain," that research would be identification of potential NHS employees who could be in future terrorist action.
"The report states that the current prevision test of NHS Scotland works well and it is not clear to which more value the recommendations will be delivered", said he.
The Scotia health authorities say they are now foreign workers who have overwhelming the majority of the doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number probably was higher, and therefore because the circumstances had problems to identify those employees who were uncertainly permitted at a time.
The survey continued to be observed that the therapeutic control procedures of NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampin, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian are mainly observed.
These include passing, work permits, and qualification controls.
the Swedish Government currently reviews its policy and guidelines for controlling the starts of establishment for foreign personnel in the NHS.
The Secretariat for Health Nicola Sturgeon said, "It was a concern to carry out this work in view of the terrorism attack on the airport of Glasgow."
It furthered that, in connection with the health authorities, the Scotia Government would take into account and ensure that the best practices in updated guidelines on the control surveys for all employees, including those from the foreign, are planned in the next month.

208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a Terror attack
Last night, Saudi Arabia found that it was 208 billion because of its residence in cells that had planned a premature attack on an oil plant, as well as the spirit and security forces.
The public television of the world's largest terrestrial exporters said that one of the cells had planned to smoke rats.
Sympathists of Al-Qaida have started a campaign against the monarchies since 2003, as a result of the invasion in Iraq.
A cell of eight militarys, designated by a foreign citizen, planned an attack on oil position in the Eastern Province, after the television report.
Saudi Arabia has established a 3,55,000 strong involvement troop to protect a misunderstanding Al Quaida attack on the world's largest terrestrial processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to an internal ministerial statement, states that 18 of the prisoners belonged to a cell leading to a "raket experts" which was illegally inmigred into the country.
He reports that the military plans were to smoke eight projects in the Kingdom.
In addition to 22 prisoners, the report had been proposed to carry out clergy and security forces.
The government has warned more to stop Saudis to join Al Qaida Military, who wants to fight the allied forces and the US supported shytic musulman government, which the Hardliners are seen as ketzerical under the Sunnitic Saudi.
Al Qaida Milizen considers many clergy in Saudi Arabia in cooperation with the authorities in supporting the policy of the Kingdom family dominated by the government.
The Milizen, accompanied by Osama bin Laden, who was born in Saudi Arab Al Qaida's leaders to go to the Prominent Saudi Government - have seen it on foreign residences, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a very great effort to security forces over the last five months," a speaker of the Ministry of Internal Affairs shared the public television.
The arrests also faced a "media cell" of 16 from Medina, which aimed at purchasing the "Takfiri thoughts" - the idea of the radical muslims of Sunnitic Muslims, who supported violence against muslims, which will be burned as unbelieving and abstinent markets.
Among the prisons, there were also 32 persons who were accused of providing financial support to the Military.
The climate on Venus could detect the future of the earth.
The Venus may have been a place for life at once, scientists said yesterday.
Data of a European space ship that is on a round trail shows that the planet is still equal to a swimming trail of the earth as it was already conscious.
The Venus is the nearest planetary neighbor of the earth.
The two worlds have almost the same size and have similar planet trains, but the Venus of the sun is something closer.
Milliars of years ago, on Venus' conditions that were very similar to those on earth and could even be habitable, scientists today.
But because of the most incredible carbon dioxide effects, the erosion of the atmosphere through suncutting and a slower rotation time, the Venus entered a whole different course of development.
Today it is the planet of water and has a surface temperature that is sufficiently hot to swim and is discovered by hurrican-star winds and swimming walls.
The knowledge of the European Railway Aviation Institute of Venus Express, which has studied the plants for a year, offers an overwhelming view of how the earth could develop in view of the catastrophic climate changes.
Professor Fred Taylor from the Physic Department at the Oxford University, one of the leaders of Venus Express Mission, said, "It will be clear why the climate on Venus is so different from the earth, while the planets are very similar. "
"In our new data it allows to build a scenario in which the Venus has started for billions of years as the earth has started, possibly with a habitable environment."
"Ambigued Uran" by the police
A kilo-active radioactive material, reported Uran, was sent last night by the Slovakian and Hungary police.
A police speaker said that three persons were arrested and that the material was tested.
He did not confirm whether it was a rich uran, but said that it could be sold for a million dollars (480,000 pounds).
Everything open
Among Romey said he didn't think it was a presidency candidate to be asked by a sneeman.
However, the Republican candidate was finally prepared to prepare a debate on YouTube, to take and engage normal election questions on video to send them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on midday 28 November were so sweet as the Sneemann, the Democratics on global warming at the YouTube debate of the other party.
But the questions and the answers reflected this time precisely the state of the Republican party which is engaged in elections in the next year.
It is not known as CNN producers who supported the debates that chose YouTube Clips to show the starting candidates.
However, in the first half hour of the debate, which was the most long-term of a individual theme, the immigration was in the middle of the debate.
The theme is one of the most strict topics for the Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of unresolved elections to serve a wheel when they heard things that were pleasing to them: the television statue observed the approval as the candidates strictly speaked over the borders.
The most intense and longest exchange of the night was between Rudy Giuliani, the National President, and Romney, who moved forward in the crucial investigations in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani tried to defeat the call that he had been indeed in respect of illegal immigration when he was New York's Chief Citizen.
He attacked Romany in which he accused the former governance of Massachusetts to set illegal immigrants in his home.
The two were particularly deeply asked as questionnaires whether one of the candidates would support an "amnesty" (the illicits would give a regular status and the possibility to citizenship).
Unfavourable candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian Congress Chairman, and Tom Tancredo, a Congress Member of Colorado, began to discuss this topic.
None of the two men have serious opportunities in the namement, but both remain in the rain, perhaps because they have shocked before and worse than others to the immigration pauke.
At least in the area of immigration, candidates share the same views: slight borders, intolerance against illegal migrants.
This theme, together with concerns about gifting games from China or other concerns over the rest of the world, helps the Republicns to forget or minimise the differences between liberal and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly addressed as other topics.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he supported weapons restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated drinks should be considered for torture.
One questionnaire asked whether the candidates believe each word of the Bible.
This resulted in that Giuliani’s position, although the Bible was his favorite book, he may not believe in the story of Jonah and Wal.
Another questionnaire asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now all the expectations on the first place in a recent investigation in Iowa thanks to his long-existed Christian conservativeism - said that death penalty was painful, but it was necessary.
When he was struggled if Jesus would for them, he was smiling about it and told him that he was intelligent for a political office.
The rail remains extremely open.
Huckabees increased in Iowa together with Ron Paul's most recent cost results and his counterparty tours in the debate of midnight.
These two are shooted out of nothing, because the two floors of the party have not yet been able to reach one of the most famous and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate has joined the party from the beginning and convincingly with a victory message on the size of America and a twin to two floors of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is not clear with no one.
Stress of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered a further shoe to the accident; his way out of this is remaining the same.
For British scandale, this is not particularly cold.
None of the hotel stories seems to be sold, no politicians Pariser hotel accounts are paid to be no extraordinary dents.
But the finding that a rich businessman costs for the British ruling Labour Party over more than 650,000 pounds (1.3 million dollars) over four years under the name of other people, and that the party has disappointed to report this, is something that would be good without the fighting Gordon Brown.
When two months ago the President had decided to make a choice, the intellectuality of the United Kingdom was politically, noting that the opinions of this decision would not have affected, it was hoped that it would offer a robust and efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, who has expressed a growing delegation chairman of the Liberal Democrats, has developed the last feared brown of Stalin to Mr Bean.
The unexpected salvation of Northern Rock, a bank, showed regulatory weaknesses and bad judgment funds under census.
The bad proposals on the amendment of tax laws have introduced enterprises against the government.
The tax loss of personal data of 25 million people showed unpredictable administrative shuttles.
A trio of generics in peace began a standing in the Supreme House of Protest against the expenditure of military expenditure: the minister of the Forces, as they said, was a part-time job.
There are now the variety of costs of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary-General of Labours (and her former execution leader) have already come back.
Nothing means that Brown is inevitablely declining.
However, governments can reach a point of shift after they are impossible to register it.
They can not be trusted by human policies, but they normally keep their skepsis back when a new troop takes the office.
If it is clear that it is unforeseen that a Prime Minister improves the situation, and it is no longer necessary to be there, the public service is starting to be easier; the ministers of Cabinet start to enjoy, the press is looking for bad news, and the government will be defensive and strict.
In one way, the position of Brown is particularly difficult because it is not able to claim to be another political leaders to be a new one.
So he liked to lie Tony Blair, he was his super-relator.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax responsibilities document, for example, faced decisions which were the director of the Ministry of Finance.
And even if it was not directly involved in Blair's misconduct - as in the long "Geld for Adelstitel" research of political party finance - the elections may seem to be that he was.
Nevertheless, Brown's situation is not very bad as she seems
The errors are not horrible as the conservatives describe them.
Like Mr. Bean, nobody died or was shocked.
And the opposite, painful as it may be, is to give what Browns naturally has always promised stalinistic tendencies: a reliable, solid and easier brutal government.
The new drink on political costs is a good example.
The Garboesque Abraham, who compares his payments with his common gifts, would not want to say public recognition for his welfare.
It may be such, but the decision was not to do it.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributions are clear and exist for a clear reason: publicity has a right to know who can buy access to those who register the country.
Watt, who said he had known by Abraham's agreement, but not that she is illegal, will, of course, have to ask some questions, just as John Mendlesohn, Labour's main finance operator, who was told about the other costs in October.
But until now, Brown is not involved: there is nothing that indicates that he knew from these confusions, although the majority of the payments was made after his official transfer in June.
The Prime Minister has completed half of the work.
He quickly condemned the infringement of the laws by his party, but he resolved this decision by the grief after a known instrument, a research committee - to complete the measure, by a bishop in peace and a judge.
In this case, the "doctrines to take place" are not very complicated.
If the law was broken, it's a matter for the police.
In spite of this, there are other things that Mr Brown must do, how to find a permanent chairman for the independent Committee on Standards in the public life, which has been not implemented for six months, and to be forwarded with a long-term reform of political parties.
This would require to cooperate with the conservators by the hardlines of the workers and, if possible, to give the special financial relationship with the workshops - more painful pillars for a party as Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some partial facts.
The conservatives now have a clear leadership in the opinions; he has two years to return to elections; and the only way he can achieve a victory is through unfair justice and solid competence.
Kartenhaie
Does the U.S. credit card market?
If blood is in the water, it is just obviously that backfloods are incredible.
Now where the American real estate market is equipped, the raubers have the country's credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts recall that credit card losses could be reached by 99 billion dollars if the counter-financiated credit expenditure is extended to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of slowing are clearly visible.
There are assessments both in the reserves and in the sample rates measured by the share of the credits, which are not inadequate or exceeding 30 days.
The HSBC has announced in the last month that it had taken $1,4 billion from its American consumer financing, partially because of the deficiency of credit cards.
But it's too early to fall in panic.
Losses and rooms are still low.
According to the Rating Agency Moody, the thirdquarters rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage point under the historical average.
The degradation of rates may, in part, be declared by technical factors.
An amendment in the United States Privacy Insolvency Acts in 2005 led to a decreased case of competitive notifications that reverse a large part of the card losses; the number of registrations (and so summary costs) would increase whether the general conditions for creditors are decreased or not.
The industry also reports about solid payment rates that shows how many of its debts are paying consumers each month
and confidence in credit card-based value papers is very strong, despite the standing rate in other parts of the structured financing.
Dennis Moroney from TowerGroup, a research company, calculates that the expenditure amounts for 2007 will eventually be 25% higher than last year.
Direct infection channels between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market are certain: it is probably more likely that consumers take credit card debts, now extract their own cards.
The card exhibitors, however, look at the flow of money instead of capital values, therefore the household prices are not necessarily a change in the creditability of the creditor.
You may even be advantageous for the card exhibitors.
Consumers’ encouragement to continue paying hypotheke rates is reduced if the realities are less value than the value of the loan; as a result, card debts will be more important under the repayment priorities.
Card exhibitors can also react more quickly and more flexible than creditor to the more stirming conditions by changeing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of a rapid re-evaluation of the property values.
"We will not wake up a day and fully recognize the loans," says the principal reporter Gary Perlin, Capital Ones.
Even if a slow-detection crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable disappearance are significantly more real.
If a lower household price and a decrease in the recession of America, the industry will certainly be before a blower future.
Continue to look after these hair flights.
British bankers are condemned in the case Enron
Three British bankers, who should be sentenced for their role in the sworn system with the former head of Enron, Andrew Fastow, had to be sentenced in the midday, changed their search.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had originally been for seven cases of fraud using telecommunications for the appropriate conspirator with fastow in a secret financial burden in 2000, in order to spend on costs of their employee.
The procedure was implemented on January.
But during a hearing before the Court of Justice before the United States district Ewing Werlein Junior, each of them was responsible for a case of fraud in use of telecommunications.
The three former leadership forces of Greenwich NatWest, one of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, were known in Britain during the period of delivery procedures that duration two years.
In the United States, its case is a lost end of an investigation initiated after Enron's Summit in 2001.
The originally condemned accused in 2002, Fastow pointed out that he was the goal of investigating the government in relation to Enron's Decline.
The accused of the bankers - called the "NatWest Drei" - said they came to Houston in 2000 to shoot a betrayful complot with Fastow and his former top consultant Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of Enron's partnership, controlled by Fastow, which was the architecture of numerous enron machines that had contributed to spend the company in the competition structure.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank estimated the value of its participation to the daughter society to zero, but the three British men knew that they had a real value.
A company under Coppers Control has obtained the share of the bank to the daughter company for $1 million.
The bankers paid $250,000 for a participation in this company.
According to the accused, Fastow was fairly confronted with Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares to the daughter society.
But in fact the $20 million went to the British bankers, fastows and others.
The bankers received 7.3 million dollars, while fastow, copper and other $12.3 million, according to the accused.
In January 2004, Fastow was accused of condemnation for his role in the Enrons Pleite.
The British Trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow has a six-year-old prison penalty in the Federal prison of Louisiana.
Kopper has a three-year punishment and one month in a establishment in Texizara.
Each of the three men was on free foot on the basis of a million dollars cupment, which was necessary to live in the United States in expectation of the court proceedings.
In December 2001, when the seventh largest company of the country, Enron blew in the competition in December 2001, after years of registrative tricks, the milliarity debts could not be profitable or deteriorated.
The convergence destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market values and more than two billion dollars of pension plans.
The Enron-Green Keneth Lay and the former President Jeffrey Skills were sentenced last year for their roles in connection with Enron Summit.
Skilling has been sentenced for more than 24 years.
Decrees for conspiration, fraud and other accused points were uncomfortable after the last year he died because of heart disease.
Not all below in Moscow
The price of a flight of the Marke Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce motor and enough rent to fly from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least 54 million dollars.
But this is a small payment for some of the rich Russians.
"It offers place for up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But no one of you asks for so many sites, because it is for a private family or a company president."
Firewall was at the Gulfstream last Friday at the Millennium Exhibition, a four-day orgic consumption that was organized in a disappeared exhibition center on the capital of the city.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxus offerers were built to interest in new money-related Russians, from Mahagoni-building gardens to diamant-over-scale autogrips that would be appropriate for 50 cents.
Fire takes carefully a brilliant porsche on the next measurement in the vision.
"This is a beautiful car, but it's a small payment compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private flights."
The Russian capital seems to be overcome with money as Dallas to its greenhouses.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s when some Americans came to gigantic riches and went to Europe, where they were seen materialisticly," said Marshall Goldman, a researcher at the Davids Centre for Russian and Eurasian studies at the Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arab transferers of the 1970s and Japanites in the 1990s, Russians are the most visible free-free exhibitors in the world.
The most exclusive Luxus brands are looking for their share in the golden raw.
Otherwise, in Moscow this week, a conference of the Luxus industry Donatella Verseace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, Chairman of LVMH, has taken place in Moscow, to discuss ideas about how to sell high price goods on markets such as Russia.
(The Conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, which belongs to the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billion people who have a total of $282 billion, according to the Force list of the richest people.
Furthermore, 103.000 Russian billion to the second class, which is valued together $670 billion, are written in a study on the development of private powers in the former Soviet Union, which has been written by economic experts of the Centre for Economic and Finance Research, a expert body here.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8 per cent of the Russians lived under the minimum of existing.)
"There are hundreds of billions in Moscow - so we are all here", said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London juvenile.
She had first visited the messe with the Russian handler of the Marke, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"Women's are all loaded, and the men are all a owner."
While she spends in night by the halls, two real estate machines, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, itself and their customers as a million.
"I took the cars, and I tried to decide between the Infiniti, Mercedes and the Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who led the design clothes that she had, as a red-teppich veteran with Joan Rivers.
The Mess seemed to be able to go to the new riches of the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be ready to visit a few hours in the stage to visit a strict house of Cadillac Escalade, a tascher from Platin, Mövenpick Eiskrem, shocked Billiardtics, Apartments in Dubai and Gund Teddyballers.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros (44,57).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most precious and best", said Mr. Gijrath, who is patrioticly at a measurement of the Dutch Porcellan manufacturer Royal Delft before a large imitate of a rembrandt image from handful, blue mosaic stones.
"The Russians are more interested in climper climate."
In fact, the handlers say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years of age have already been after Russian standards) have moved from great purchase logos to the type of nice marks with limited part numbers that would not be marketed in a trade show.
Nevertheless, several thousands of people, Millionary, Millionary Senders, or just tourists every day through the halls.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show on Sunday last, Roman Ershov, the general manager of King Koil Betten here, he had sold two $70,000 matrazine seats, prepared from seide, cachemir and tree wool, with e-coated gold fabrics.
At the same time in the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a salesmanager for A1 Moto, a company provides high-end autos with high-end-allarm systems that his company has sold the green Dutch porche for $170,000 to a Russian million.
To Sunday, Andrei Karapian, President of L.A. Connection, a company who adapts the luxus car to customers, had sold three car shopping grills for a Rolls-Royce Phantom, which is equal to Connected with each other for $55,000.
He showed a reporter an auto-track developed for a Russian casino owner, with speeches that he had overlooked with fabric Swarovski Cristals, so that it was like a roulette rade.
The costs: $22,000 for a fourth loan.
"The Russian millionary, the straw leaders or a image of the face of his wife from Cuban circumcision, will not be driving on these roofs", said Mr Karapetian.
"He will save it in his 30-hour or 40-hour garage."
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr Karapetian said that the phrase "Russiche Millionary" would now not express a lot of exclusiveness, in view of the increased real estate prices.
"When you have purchased a apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they're probably a million, at least on the paper, if not yet in bargeld," he said.
" There are more than you believe."
Those who weren't a million could have done at least if they were rich at a position operated by the Alliance Continental, a Russian ownership company.
The company had set four red telephone cells in British examples, which were full-toped with mountains of false millions of dollars.
Azad Karryev, the marketing director of the company, said his employees had expressed 500,000 false bank notes for the millionary measure.
Passengers agreed to discover the money purchase, mobile phone photos, while they turn back in the midst of the replacement, to let friends snipped, or simply switch a few million.
"See, everyone in Moscow can feel like a million," said Mr. Karriev.
Decreased operation in death cases in New Jersey
It was before the Ronald Livingston Festival by the large glass window of the just a Little Healthier restaurants and looked like a hospital car at the white Cape Cod two doors below the West Scott Avenue.
Shortly there was a police car.
And then there was another.
"And I saw the castle car of the medical observer," said Livingston, a supervisor of the restaurant, at midnight.
"This was the point when I knew that someone died."
The officers learned that all Mrs Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant of the Director of the National Police Department.
Now the investigators try to find whether they died because of a procedure which was carried out by a non-allowed cosmetic surgery that was not identified by the police, and that worked at the West Scott Avenue 212 in the house.
The authorities have not yet found what Ms Arroyo's death has caused, and they are hopefully hoped that toxicological research, which could not be available for weeks, will be helped to explain a mysterious death that has sent a tragic tragic by the National Police's headquarters.
Mrs Arroyo has been an assistant of the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was known in the Division.
"He was loyal, hard worked and hard", said Mr. McCarthy about Ms Arroyo in a telephone interview at midnight.
"He was my pitbull.
She protected me."
McCarthy said that Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, an ex-anniversary police officer, who works for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she left two sons, 14 and 11, and a second-widester.
Eileen Walsh, a speaker for the lawyer of the Union of the County, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the investigators would try to determine whether Arroyo was a result of an unlawful surgery.
"This is one of the possibilities", said Mrs. Walsh.
"It's a starting investigation."
The authorities said they had arrived at the house at about 3 p.m. afternoon in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared in the place for death.
More than one week ago and the authorities have noted a few of their investigation or the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh did not want to say whether Mrs. Castro was asked by the authorities.
The investigators try to determine whether a part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On midnight nobody opened the door to Mrs. Castros House, where a rose strand is located in the slightly preserved garden and a dalmatin behind the house.
A blue fass described with "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a replacement for Vanille in foods and parfums - sat in the park area next to a door that led to the underground.
Two mountain bikes away from Haken on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark after 25 years with the police department of New York, Mrs. Arroyo was an inestimate value and helped him in the provincial and hard political culture in his new city.
"He said, 'You must hold on this or those," he said.
"He was always here when I came here and she was always here when I went.
It was painful."
Hope that the Central Bank will decline the interests to increase the world share markets
The shares were on both sides of the Atlantic after the market hopes that the Central Bank will try to calm the credit markets by further interest rates, by advancing comments by the Vice-President of the United States of Central Bank.
The share markets took place in London, New York and in Europe after Donald Kahn, number 2 of Ben Bernanke, President of the Central Bank, said that the policy should react to the continuing pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear effort to relaxe a tremendous market, in view of the signs of encouraging credit expansion, Kohn said that the recent turbulences had been "recently overcome some of the improvements of the market functions from the late September and October".
If the increased turbulence remains, it would increase the possibility of further strengthening the financial conditions for consumers and enterprises.
The comments were found by investors as a signal that the Central Bank is ready to slow and stabilize the credit conditions in the US markets and other possible interest rates.
The executions also helped to calm the Wall Street, in view of other bad news from the United States, now as the sales of US immobilia has reached a new recording in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulences were underlined by the announcement of Bear Stearns, the Investment Bank, that they will remove 650 jobs or 4% of their world employees in a measure to reduce cost losses in order to compare serious losses of their losses in the US hypothesis sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these places will be lost in London where the bank is employed by 1.500 employees.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industry index was 331 points, or 2,55% to close 13.289.40, while the larger S&P 500 index increased to 2.65%.
In London the FTSE 100 index increased to 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent to close at 6.306.2, which added more than 39 billion pounds to the value of British standards.
Germany's Index Dax increased by 2,6% and France's CAC40 increased by 2,3%.
Previously, the re-implication of credit pressure was undertaken on the markets after a strong demand on a hearing of Trimonats Garanties from the European Central Bank, granted to the European Trade Banks, was 4.7 per cent, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England, the United States Central Bank and the European Central Bank and check out other capital markets in London increased when the credit expenditure rates were increased from 21 November at 6,59% to its maximum since the late September, following a continuing increase in the period of 21 November.
England faces the words of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
There are two dilemmas, every one of them is almost so hard as the other.
Who's going to be number 6 for England in Candy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, not less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should take the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the election Chairman, at least under this special title, is here to help the Chief Peter Moores and the Captain Michael Vaughan to decide it, and because the table of High Morries, the English director, is fully filled with applications for national electors, if not even for any part-time.
Those who do not always receive the sixth position will be unfortunately, but life is often unjust and the sport is uncertain.
It's never easy to fix exactly what a man allows to reach the spots of his professionals, while someone else never gets out of the lowest ring, sometimes from lack of chance.
It is not only in the cryket where the choice is difficult, where judgments are necessary, always subjective at the end.
Is it the right time to take Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah if he does it?
This may also be asked in a further area, for example, whether John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both intelligent young leadership forces should be transported with good decisions that the business knows well.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricket player, except if it is given to him the opportunity to smile or undermine.
Of course, digits have a great impact on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
In the outside of a team, a cricket player must take the eyes of the captain at the right time when he can take a wheel and a shooter has to get regular opportunity on the order when he wants to print as an unfair cricket player.
The eyes of the choicer to spend is more complex.
There were many who were better in the last season than, for example, as James Anderson, who seems to be playing in the first test, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy for himself and how the wind came into the network.
Anderson took 32 first-class wheels with 33 runs to win a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 with the same spectacular average, but both had their green points and hope still more.
If Shah or Bopara plays in the Asgiria Stadium, it can only be a question of view.
The choice could decide the career of both men, or maybe it makes a little different.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each test and was successful in the first, with five wheels and 40 useful runs, but Paul Collingwood was still struggling to set up to create the break of a significant test cricket player and that, although he had a double hundred against Australians in the Australien point, it may still be assessed.
It is probably that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after another discussion on the current network session in the Asgiria Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and building feelings for Shahs more experience over Boparas's youth enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah speaks its funkelous and valuable 88 test debutting innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is more young with 22 years of age, and an excellent balance against rounded balls.
But Shah only made only ten runs in his two innings in May against West India in the test in Lord, his homematrina as a player from Middlesex, and this, as soon as his immediate refusal of the electioners, was healthy to return his position to the next game, seems to have taken the weight out of his shoes that still had been openly in Bombay.
On the contrary, all the rats of Essex have evidently a rejoicing of life.
He hasn't been impressed by nothing on a cricket place and his standing was taken on the point when he recently carried out a vehicle with four rail drive in an exhibition for England's Sponsor Volkswagen.
He experiences smaller injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to get his Vodaphones (usually also back) and to call his team colleague Alastair Cookie, who had watched this from the television, and to say with enthusiasm, "Have you seen this?".
Bopara is a much better field player, he spends his medium-time with some effects here on the game fields, which seems to be suitable to him and shoots with trust and sending.
Select the right man is one thing to choose the right time another.
Maybe it's the actual art of selection.
I'm going to give Bopara his chance now, which does not mean that Shah may not be good if, as the teeping of Ceylon suggests, he is the one who will play here this weekend.
Bus brings refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Quaida
Last night the first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Bagdad, with a electricity of distributors whose money or visa were out, and others hoped that the city returns to normality.
Some were even returned to fight the rebels that they had gone out of their homes.
On Busbahnhof Mansour, before the arrival of 800 people from Damaskus in an official government convoi of a duty bus, the terminal was employed with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned to private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after she killed many doctors in Bagdad," said Sabah Al-Qubasi, a Sunnitic doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw at the television and what I read in the newspaper about what happened in Bagdad, and how it would be sure now."
They say that the Mahdi Army has stopped killing people," he said about the miliars of the military classist Moqtada Al-Sadr, who ordered to return his forces to the present time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Swiss teacher from the overwhelming sunnitic part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he couldn't renew his Syrian visa and because the Iraqi regime was not allowed to work.
His sister neighbors in Amariyaah called him to tell him that a local military, supported by the United States, had joined him to leave Al-Qaida from their base in the west of the capital city, and urged him to return.
One of the new Kings from Jordan was the leader of a Sunnitic and Skitic stage, which was carried out from his house in Sleikh in the north of Bagdad, by attacking handgranates after he asked his companions to fight Al-Qaidas.
He was back to fight.
"Four two days I called some of my friends and told me that they started one of the anti-Al-Qaida militers in Sleikh, and they needed my support and my kids.
That's why I'm back today", said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many reported that they were closed through the growing peace in the capital since the United States increased and the growth of local "related citizens", which were armed and defended their citys in cooperation with the United States military.
But more were talking about to be able to be home by means of visum problems and shift money in Damaskus, where more than 1,3 million Iraqi were fled over the past years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old father, expressed the general condemnation among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the religious minister of the Syrian government, had requested to interfere with visum restrictions for refugees to force people to return.
More than two million people have probably fled from the seatric mortality weapons in the country.
"We visited Syrians well, and the government tried to give the Iraqi people no longer visa to drive them back to Iraq," said the Sunnitic Rentner.
"I can't believe a government that supports the crimes that burned my house after I leave."
A part of the reason for the decline of violence is that sunnites from smitic residences and circumvention have been distributed, which leaded to the creation of many places where they have left shocks.
There are fears that a sudden stroke of refugees will be back to seventh-sectional disappointments and will come to conflicts.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal country is leading to professional training and even to the international orientation of its high schools.
Only in a education field, the Saarlands press the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I've declared on the 50th time of a non-sail country that we're not French." - this slogan places the smallest federal state of self-ironic birthday to its 50th birthday.
This plays a major role in the Saarland education system, which is in the education monitor of the German Economy Institute of Köln (IW).
This is how high schools work closely with the neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbridges was founded by the Frenchs in 1948.
To this day, students can complete their study with a double or even trifach diploma.
Indeed, the share of foreign students is 15.6 per cent.
However, the country children also bring the Saarland into a average number of high schools - many of them without a conclusion of the Gymnasium.
"Im Saarland uses the training system", says Axel Plunnecke, education experts at IW.
More than every five-year-old youth has the right to study at a professional school, so the Saarland is more than seven percentage points over the federal average.
The combinations of vocational and academic training can also be significantly developed.
Against the number of people, the supply with two studies is the secondest in Germany.
In spite of practical training and increased demand, however, the number of engineer decisions have been reduced by a third party in the past years.
As a result, the Saarlandian Education Ministry has undertaken high schools to a marketing campaign for technicians.
"In the general educational schools we struck some reforms after the first pisa study," said a speaker of the Ministry of Education.
The government thus conducted a country-wide comparison test.
In order to learn the children early, the last year free is - a model that copies the other federal countries in this area.
If the performance of the students is continuously improved, future comparison studies will be shown.
In Pisa 2003, the share of risk students was 29 to 20 percent.
However, the Saarland was not as strong as other federal countries.
The Bayerns get better.
And for the distraction of the Saarlands, foreign languages in Pisa are not measured - in this area, you could be able to point out otherwise.
Because the language of neighbors is obligation to Gymnasia - even though the Saarlands aren't French.
Chávez turns the clocks
In Venezuela the clocks are first different than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez lets the Time Meteorology back to half an hour in South America.
In Spain, Chavez is going to be the witzfigur.
As the Venezuelan Official Journal reported, a new law will be placed at least four and a half hours in the world's time.
This means that the South America State receives a time zone that does not exist in any other country of the world.
The United States Feinly Chávez founded his decision, among other things, that the United States had made full hours of distribution in time zones.
Furthermore, Chavez announced the decrease of relations with the neighborhood of Colombia on midnight (oriented time).
The link nationalist said, as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe President of Colombia remains, he will not hold a relationship with the Head of State or the Colombian government.
"I can't already do this because of my gratitude," said Chavez, who provides a constitutional reform that must vote on the oil citizens on Sunday in a referencedum.
With the reform, he would develop its power in the country clearly.
The excluder of the war was the decision of Uribes to issue the mandate for negotiations with marxist rebels in Colombia, where it was about the release of geisels.
Uribe, with his decision, "shooted in the face", had Chavez criticized on Sunday.
Chavez is also in Spain in all mouths.
A new phone club in the country for Furore: "Why not to call" (for you don't hold the mouth) calls the script that has already downloaded more than a million people from the Internet.
He spoke of his King John Carlos, King of Spain, who had been the most recent Ibero-American Committee of the permanent call of the link-based people, and it was through the mouth.
German Drot 2007 Lohnminus
In spite of the strong conjuncture, German employees have threatened a real loss of losses this year.
Experts called a whole range of reasons for their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation of the Hans Böckler Foundation, the employees could actually receive less on the content account than in the previous year.
"In the obligation there are the specific loan development, the increased tax increase and price debt in food and energy", said Gustav Horn, the Institute for Macroeconomia and Conjuncture Research.
New burdens could also be taken to employee unemployment insurance.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück said the "New Osnabpresser Journal" that the planned decrease of unemployment insurance is 3.3% for year change in the situation.
However, the Federal Working Agency should not be insufficient to ask credit or subsidiary when the law is bound, the SPD policyers was referred to.
On Thursday, the price explosion in food and mineral oil products was known at the highest level for 13 years.
The prices were totally 3,0 per cent in the year compared.
Venus is the top of the earth
In spite of its life-feining atmosphere of the earth, the Venus is more likely than ever thought: The European Space Sond "Venus Express" has discovered blows in the atmosphere and wind flows on the Poland as it appears in the winter.
Since about three decades, scientists condemned it on Venus.
Now the European son of "Venus Express" has shown the evidence - she spotted electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere: The lits on the Venus shoot in a height of about 56 km from Wolke to Wolke, reported by Christopher Russia from the University of California in Los Angeles in Scientific Magazine "Natura".
According to the famous "Ursuppen theorie", the slights have led the life on the earth: the ocean should have reacted in the ocean that leaded to the education of amino acids, the building stones of life.
Not so on Venus: "If there was a life there, it must have been in the very early history," Sean Solomon states from the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Today it should be a little living thing on the surface of Venus: The atmosphere is around hundred times distance than on the earth, ruling it under temperatures of 500 degrees.
"The venus may be the devil willing of the earth, but she is a slill", said Russian.
Why the Venus, which is so similar to the earth in mass and size, has struck such a further development as so precisely, is the question of the Esa mission.
The start of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus' research, since the beginning of the ninth years there were no sounds to investigate this planet.
The recent research results currently presented in several "natural" items are not only underlined by researchers in view of the uniqueness of Venus within the sun system.
"They also show that the communities of our neighbor planets are larger with the earth than first adopted," the Esa shares.
Thus, the researchers found a wave structure in the southern pool, which turns to significantly more faster, next to the already known Webel wind in North Pole.
The phenomenon reminds the air streams on the Territory Wintermisphere, writes a research on Giuseppe Piccioni from the Italian Institute of Astrophysica Spacial and Cosmic Physical.
The second-third planet of the sun system has almost the same mass as the earth and is with a diameter of 12.100 kilometres nearly as much.
The planet also called as morning or evening is created in about 225 days around the sun.
But he turns a lot more slower to himself: a venture takes 243 earthquakes.
Although the venus with surface temperatures of 460 °C and a 92 bar pressure unlikely remembers the earth, the scientists believe that both planets have been in full similar conditions.
The water that remained on the earth in the oceans, on the Venus was lost in the world space.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on the earth in carbonat stones, it is the majority of the atmospheres on the venus.
Cohler defends Merkels meetings with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Kohler requests an end of the Party Chair for receipt of Dalai Lama in the Office of Leramt.
Indirectly he criticized the SPD because of their attacks on the officers after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Kohler is concerned about the view of Germany and has requested the great coalition to end the war to receive Dalai Lama.
"We should not present the foreign world in this question a separate nation," said the Cohler to the Trade Blatt.
Also, the Cohler understanding for the receipt of the Dalai Lama by Federal Countries Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity for me, even if I respect the diversity of cultures," he said Cohler.
Everyone knew that Germany had to be real sensible balances in the external policy, emphasized the Federal President, but took a mark of protection before the project, which is a new Chinese policy.
"The Federal Officers did not take a distance from the traditional Chinese policy.
That knows also China," Kohler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had been indirectly identified indirectly on the receipt of Dalai Lama and was therefore attacked by several Unions.
Steel Meyer, among other things, has declared the Union's "Supply Main Policy" in the external policy.
After receiving Dalai Lamas in the Canzleramt, there were strong irritations in the German-Chine relationship.
Thus, the Chinese leadership has not only downloaded the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministers of both countries.
Chinese government chief Wen Jiabao has now requested the federal candidate Angela Merkel to be receiving Dalai Lamas as an error.
China rejects it when European politicians receive the religious leaders of the Tibetans in official function, Jiabao confirmed the Chinese position.
The facts and words of Dalai Lamas showed that he tried to depart from China from Tibet and the other Tibeth region, which also include other provinces today.
Shortly warns before claws like in France
Road shoes with the police, shoes, brushing cars: Wolfgang Schauble warns for claws like in France.
It should be done to ensure that social inadequacy in Germany is not in violence on the road, the Federal Minister called for.
Barricad burned, Randalier shooted with shoot fleet on the police: After the serious young people in France, Federal Minister Wolfgang Schauble (CDU) fears similar development in Germany.
"We need to take care of the fact that we do not build social pollutant with us and depend on violence.
We need to take it seriously," he said the "new press in Hannover".
Not every young man comes to the rapid change of social reality.
Bounds, countries and communities have already worked with emphasis on reducing problems, said shauble.
This is not only the integration of migrants.
"Towards the integration gap until the Islamic Conference shows the first success."
However, for warning it is too early.
It also pointed out that it does not have urban and social problems, such as in France, in German cities.
In the northern fronts of Paris, young people had severe streets with the police last night.
In Toulouse, also burned cars and public buildings.
Best integration efforts of the Federal Government requested the President of the Turkey Community in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the clawle in France, the Colate warned "the effects of shocking".
However, the situation in Germany is not so grateful as in France.
But it is best for action.
Colat said that unemployment rates in young people with migrations under 25 years were "intermediately".
It should, in particular, be provided for more training places.
Kolat emphasized: "We must give the youth a prospect."
However, the President of the Turkish Community added that in Germany there is more than a social control in the family.
Many young people with migrations did not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat said, "But yet, we have to watch."
Youth should "accepte rapidly the opportunity to participate in work and training".
Instead, it remained quiet in the Paris term Villiers-le-Bel in the night.
Hundreds of the police were used, a shooter overlooked the area with shooters.
The competent authorities reported three prisons, as well as a few slaughterers and cars.
Since the Sunday, a destiny of about 1000 security forces will be assured.
The police will take as long as it is necessary, Mr Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit in the city.
The night on Tuesday, at Krawalls in Villiers-le-Bel, about 80 police officers were injured.
In the next eighth, the disappointed ones were overlooked in Cœdès.
The Krawalle smiled at a traffic accident in which two young people lived on Sunday.
Following the first recognition of the State Authority, the police does not make a duty for the death of the youth.
In the Kingdom of Angela Wolke
The reality of the Chairmans documents that the coalition is content at the end - and that it itself is nothing to expect.
In which country these federal candidates are actually living?
After their conviction in the federal debate, which was wise and enduring, you must say: not here - not in the country that will finally be registered by her.
The provision that they are too much focused on the external policy, Angela Merkel reacted with a strict scope.
This is provincial, she said and showed that she did not want to understand what the critics are.
In the Federal Day, it has documented all recognisable as regards their provision.
There was no concrete interest or feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke was presented: a decreased politician who runs to the foreign policy and remains in danger.
For example, climate protection: Because it is inevitable for the decisions of the sanctuary, it does not say how climate objectives should be achieved here.
On the other hand, self-love - so much inconsciousness had the CDU Chief had been slowed two years ago.
Now she's aware of the fleet that the resurrection is coming to people.
Thus she damages her image as a pragmatic who solve the problems instead of beauty the world.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke, internal political problems are a border appearance.
Children's braveness and the concerns of the pregnant servants?
A few sides have to be left for it.
It's noted how often she's promising when it comes to the kids attack.
Three flights need a feature in order to get out of a halfway slightly.
It's like on a foreign terrain when it becomes concrete.
Attack Section
In the YouTube debate of the Republicn Presidency candidates, the two favorite Rudy Giuliani and Middle Romney are a hard slagabtausch, and they must now be afraid of a foreign candidate.
The enlargement of the candidates is already decisive in the first issue.
He made New York to a "refugee place for illegal immigrants", Romney proposes his opposite Rudy Giuliani.
This calls on the one hand with severe forecasts: "I would say that his own house was a port for illegale," said Giuliani and offers the former governance of Massachusetts, private immigrants without papers.
The candidates blame to attack: because the Republican Basis has no clear preferences, the eight presidents use the debate on CNN, especially to discrete their opposers.
The autorouted 30 seconds videos, which have sent Internet users via YouTube, are little more than switchers.
"In this kind of isolation, we have left Hitler to come to power," John McCain proposes his opposite Ron Paul, who calls for an immediate departure from Iraq as the only one in the round.
Romney also received the Levites strongly read from Vietnam when he refuses to condemn the so-called "watterboarding", a method of hearing that is simulated in the earthquake.
However, that the important topics of the campaign in the area of Iraq's wars and post-debates show the responses of the Sale publisher in St. Petersburg in Florida.
Whenever conservative values are dismissed and future tax increases are declined, the audit will be launched in case.
This shows more than one of the weaknesses of the two favorites.
"I've missed me at that time," Romney explained, "which was the base and the television publication that he was still belonging to the departure officers in 1994.
However, Giuliani comes to the students when he is asked to explain the Bible in his opinion.
Musharraf first registered in Zivil
One day after his return as the army chief, the Pakistani Machaber Musharraf was condemned as President.
Thus, eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf has been dedicated to another five-year office on Thursday.
The Pakistani television has lived in the presidency of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf urged to observe the Constitution and act to the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had sent his office as the army chief to his confidence Ashfaq Kiyani, and was taking an international pressure in particular from the United States.
Eight years after his masterity in an unclean military push, the former General is now the first time as civil head of State.
With his retreat as the head of the forces of the forces, Musharraf had complied with a nuclear requirement for the opposition and Western.
Another central demand is a end of the exception that Musharraf had been linked to the Musharraf on 3 November.
Soon after his defence, Musharraf will, according to the general lawyer Malik Muhammad Qayum, decrease the exceptional condition and thus comply with another demand of the West.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the country, the Musharraf posted after the exemption of the exemption at the beginning of November with him, dismissed in the past week all the claims against the distorted re-electment of the Head of State on 6 October.
Instead, five soldiers were killed in the northern stage of the North-Waziristan in a attack on a military convoi, and four more injured.
According to an armed speaker, the bomb explosed on a street near the borders to Afghanistan.
The parents of the crowd back
Germany's Super Group of Seventyrs renews: the three band members of Harmonia reacted their console at a concert in Berlin.
Revival appears a average of its great time "Leve 1974".
Soon they were significantly famous in the island.
The recommended sensation will then be accompanied in Geestalt three gentlemen at the evening table.
Everyone has his chest before himself, his cable and especially his heads.
Dieter Moses threw in the swimming crowd with 63 years in the midst.
Links flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years old and in possession of laptop and guitarre.
The right, regarded by the auditionary, is concentrated on the console by Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73.
Everyone takes kitchens, including a beat.
And sometimes it's incredible to a typical piece of music.
This seems to be not to defeat the ladies itself.
What the band Harmonia re-musics has been made with Krautrock's favorites for some receptions.
There is no reason for enthusiasming: targeted demands that the name, even through collective pop memory, was slight, but no way so sustained to deteriorate this band for 32 years.
But why should the German also not celebrate his lively legends from the seventy-years?
At the time, the unreductive Krautrock, in England and America, remains more than in its own country.
When the music industry lost the survivors of the Kölner Group Can 2003 the Echo Prize for Life Works, in the hall, it was seen by German pop viewers.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers in Laudatio was also grateful at the bands La Düsseldorf and New!, the surprise did not know any borders.
With concerts, Michael Rother was later on the Red Hot Chili Peppers on the bridge as a old partner.
The problem of the home ignorance and the declaration in the foreign is one.
The memory was therefore overcome with Harmonia, because the trio was only two years and in this time also a lower effect force was differed from the other.
Moses and Roedelius had the artist Conrad Schnitzler foremost musicized under the very promised name Cluster.
First, we were playing in the helmet under the Berlin shoes.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons for a plate-label maintained by the church.
Rother had helped the engine work shortly and then became a guitarrist at New!, who might play a call at the rootest German group.
In 1973, however, Rother followed the cluster musicians to the exil to the forest in Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as frozen communities.
More ideologically than in the Common I, where Roedelius was still as children.
Before in a spitway artistic designer.
At first in the sperrmull, there was also a name for the Harmonia Ottenstein and for the art.
Some have taken the Harmonia.
The first album was called "Music of Harmonia" and the following "De Luxe".
Because so leave and discreet music too, the band lied material emergency.
The trip collection did not serve alone in self-defect.
The now appeared CD "Live 1974" was communicated at a concert in Greece, before a 50-popular record class, as someone believes to dismiss.
From Rother at that time the desire to strengthen harmonia and spend time.
For Roedelius and Moebius, an unfair requirement.
The band explained its separation 1975.
Rother landed in the Estoteric-Spherics and secured his existence with alben as "flamming hearts".
Cluster was reliable in the eighth and is more successful than Harmonia was.
The Greek Livealbum is to thank Herbert Gronemeyer.
The Grönland's plate company has aimed to make the Krautrock as a urgente German contribution to life music.
New! was already buried like Roedelius Solowork.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia is located in the Berlin House of the cultures of the world.
Publicly subsidied, within the Woldtronic Festival.
Julian Cope is there, the British, Altpointk and the publishers of the book "Krautrock Sampler".
There's also the Loveparade Researcher Dr. Motte.
The entire band width of the effects of the Krautrock would be around the following popsic.
From Harmonia is filled with the leisure of the supergroup.
The sentence of Brian Eno spends with the most separate sound in the room: "The only true music, you belong to the future."
There are pictures showing the producers with Harmonia in the farming stage.
The legend training is designed for other black-foot photos from wet-cached devices.
That's why the three veterinarys are backed with improving.
Not anymore, by closing microphones to the orgel and the shooting device, to discover the instruments that have been built over itself.
Today the electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in technically developed twitters.
Daran doesn't change the home's chor.
Under the Barbara morningsters, it is sweet and shocked under sound wools, and on a beautiful place with Emphase "Ayaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never about Rock.
The roots were searched less in the blue than in music schools (Can), technologies (Craftwork) or on the refugee against artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
Who calls "'68" has not completely injustice, and Harmonia does not allow it to take out of peace now.
Anything of the self-respect, it is naturally overwhelmed on the shoes.
Where's music starting and when does it open?
This can make the nervous or flight moments great luck.
Richard Gere isn't just zynical enough
With "The Hunting Party" and "Promoting Peace" two films are re-established with the Balkan war.
But both are not convinced.
Or the concepts place too much on action and ballers, or they are too touchable.
There can't help Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party".
The good news first: since the war offenders Karadzic and Mladic are still hidden in the mountains of the Balkans, but there, in the dark frontland of the Bosnian Krie, the player Richard Gere is now recovered.
We had recently lost the most beautiful man of the huge years, because there are too many clear-free roles in the welfare films for women and too many press conferences on the topic Buddhism.
Now, Richard Gere is the most important argument, "The Hunting Party - If the jagers will be shocked" (Why the film titles today must always be as long as the local leaderial contracts?) may be to see.
He provides a wonderful exhibition: On the basis of his war reporter Simon Hunt, his war was taken, what could be from the gere if the switch salt and the film industry weren't so good: a man who has his best time behind himself, but he himself has saved as a ruinable thinking of his decline even more important remains of the unique charm.
But in spite of this trumpet, "The Hunting Party", together with the German "Promotoral Peace", which also begins this week, only continues the unfinished series of Balkan war films.
With the "Protectional Peace" you can make a short process: the film is acting of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), which save a Serbin before cosovaric heavy protections, whereas the one still loves it.
Although it is welcome that the Serves are not even represented here as the only race of all the evils, the foreign film is too fast in ballers and action.
It remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without buses for war.
However, "The Hunting Party" can just investigate why it has never given a good balkan film.
The story of three US crystal reporters, who were struggling to see the Serbian Supreme War Defenders "the Fuchs", could be able to be a new "Apocalypse Now" at a time.
Because the stories are shocking: Both times they go small teams into the forest to fill something that the militarys can't and both times it will be a travel in the skin.
One of the reasons for the disaster of "The Hunting Party" is that Simon Hunt is not simply allowed to be the deceased cyniker with heart when he will be presented at the beginning.
No, this script must be obedient to him more a romantic business with a Muslim bosnier killed later.
Finally, "The Hunting Party" goes down the bach when the reporters gets out within the last five minutes of the time-based process, what Nato, CIA and all the head-offs in the world haven't done in five years: the war offenders were slaughtered and the Muslim bossers left to slaughter.
This is so bad that we want to call the International Court of Justice in Den Hague for crimes against the cineological.
The movie has an extremely human concern.
He wants to insist that Karadzic and Mladic are still free, and he suspicions the Americans and the Frenchs (for example they should be very closely) that the persecution is not to be intensified because of secret political negotiations.
But the good assembly and the wicked are sometimes so similar that one comes in the sense of a famous righteousness.
That says about the wood mask of a Asian demon on the work of the dent: "I'm feeling to see the shooted snakes, unlikely: how strict it is to be wicked."
Films like "The Hunting Party" have precisely such swimming heads, but sweet how exciting it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the gene of the Balkan war film.
The newspaper reported that all the Iraqi films Hollywoods were great fleps.
You can add: it has never given a good film in South Africa.
It is always applicable: if a star is on the world's heritage or mining fields, then something comes out like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "All the borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Perhaps all conflicts may be too close to time.
It had to go for decades before Hollywood was able to turn a good film over the holocaust.
Some films are probably still rief - the Vietnam's "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Fulll Metal Jackett" now are no way to celebrate as master works.
But maybe we know today where every mass murder in real time comes home to the same two screens, even too much over the conflicts of the world.
And this shoes the drickbookers the uncertainty that it needs to tell good stories.
"See or no" or "The great dictator" have finally become so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not know how bad the nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you don't want to be good if you want to make good movies.
Maybe you have to have the serialized artist view of the Romancist Lawrence Norfolk.
When the parallel between his historical Roman "Lemprières Worder book" and the Balkan War was asked, he said, "This is just that some things never changed.
The large cities will always be terrible, people will always be killed in a graceful way and will rule war in Yugoslavia."
Detailed Critics for Olympia absage
The cutting of the citizensman by the Hamburg application for Olympic summer games has been struck on a strong criticism in policy and economy.
Many want to continue to fight on the water games.
However, the realism is able to be assessed the opportunities.
The main business leader of the Hamburg Trade Chamber, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, called a "no good for the economic stand".
No other project has recently developed so many motivations in the city as the Olympiaides.
" Without this goal, the sport policy cannot be maintained in the same way."
Schmidt Trinity requested the Senate to not raise the project, but to find a new long-term approach to "it is out of a changed time rail".
Citizen Ole von Beust remained at the mid-day afternoon at previous talks, where the Olympia ambitions of Hamburg were at least unrealistic until 2028.
"Not Hamburg decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sport bund," said Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sport Competing for Munchens for Winter Games at the beginning of December 2018.
"This preference means that we have no realistic opportunity in the period that we have so far thought from 2028."
However, if the dream wasn't dreamed for all the time, he said by Beust.
The Hamburger Sport Connect (HSB) regretted the statements of beuts.
This is the impression that Hamburg does not want to demand for Olympic games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to build an opportunity by having the plans already played at this time", said the Chairman of the HSB on midnight.
An infringement to the complaint has also been in contravention to the sentence of the Senate Heads on a receipt for the full Assembly of the German High School Association.
There has been the claim of Hamburg for the university 2015 "not as a replacement" for Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The High School Sport Association had just been appointed as a candidate city in Hamburg last week.
The SPD Citizenship Group proposed to have not used a valuable time for housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the small Grasbrook has been delayed by the Senate for the years because he set on the map of Olympia and declared the building of the apartment", said the SPD, Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for the small Grasbrook has always requested an integrated planning for Olympia and a later residence use, the CDU has set on the "Event Factor".
The demand for the Olympic summer games in 2012 had risen a great deal in Hamburg at the time.
However, Hamburg was a Leipzig failure.
It's not warhol's kitchen.
Who connects the terms of Swedish and wood wood, thinks of Ikea, but not of Andy Warhol.
Or?
Today, in Swedish, manufactured wood wood shoes are dark shadows on Warhol's work directory.
A majority of the ninety-year-old Brillo boxes from the "Type Stockholm" are false.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" just a few months ago doubts about the reality of Andy Warhols Brillos Boxes of 1968, internal research in the modern museum in Stockholm now comes to a remarkable result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which is the former museum director Pontus Hultén to the modern museo 1995, are copies - and probably most of the hundreds of other Brillo Boxes of the "Typ Stockholm", which are on the international market.
The history is deceived, a confused packing of artistic and curatorical productions.
In 1964, Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes", wood cities that are based on the red blue design of the "Brillo".
A exhibition of his work in the modern museot 1968 - with Warhols understanding - was provided by hundreds of Brillo arts from Pape: These (from cost reasons) not by Warhol but were provided directly from the Brillo Carton Fabric.
It was not artificial works, but about their illustrators, for simple exhibitions.
At the same time, Warhol probably granted the permission to make some little brillo hole knife in Sweden which, however, were not issued in the modern museum.
Periods now speak of about fifty kids, which are now authorized as original andy wall boxes with the title "Type Stockholm" right into the history of art and auction.
Some of them have reached more than $1000,000 at auctions.
The problem is now that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén has later noted that it has been produced and issued for hundreds of wood clergy in Sweden, which then left warhol.
In fact, Hulténs 105 cats were produced in Malmö in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that time Warhol was dead for three years.
Lars Byström, Chief Conservator at the modern museum, has also studied three of Swedish private possessions, two of which were prepared in Stockholm in 1968: your presss pants were just based and shooted, then white oil colored with a paint.
However, the structure of copy from 1990 is that the colour with a dark roll was covered directly on the press panel - and it is not oil, but a acryl color.
"They were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhols Brillo Boxes", says the director of the modern museum Lars Nittve, "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to another conclusion, the modern museum will classify the six customers in its collection as copies/exposition material."
Soon in July, the Authentication Board has announced freely to follow the "share accused" which will be raised in matters of the seven powder kitchen.
However, there is a help in unforgettable sweets.
Rebelliant soldiers in Manila
On the Philippines, rebellious soldiers who were in a hotel in Manila and requested President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He couldn't respond to blood injuries, said the director Antonio Trillanes, who offered President Corruption and Electoral Response, reporters in the hotel.
Government troops were formerly designed by the hotel under the raw gas use.
The twenty-five soldiers have been distant in the building for hours.
The half of them were in court on Thursday because of a deceived slaughter in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He used the negotiation to immediately delay 30 sympathismen.
The military police, which should actually watch him, were apparently overlooked to him and closed to his mastership.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and requested the slaughter of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyale government struggles out of the front hotel.
The President held an urgent meeting of the Security Chamber.
The national security advisor Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of soldiers.
"The people have enough," said Trillanes.
"We call people to connect us."
General Danilo Lim, who formerly commanded the Elite Unit of Scout Rangers, said that other armed units wanted to join the march.
The Government's critics were calling for great demonstrations towards the President for freeday.
Your government has been overwhelmed for months of corruption.
Manilas Financial District was already 2003 the main view of the attempted meurtries of around 200 militaryians against Arroyo.
The resurrection claimed only 24 hours after the refusal of the army to connect.
Since 1986, at the Philippines, at least seven pounds of democratic governments were held.
