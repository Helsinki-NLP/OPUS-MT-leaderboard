In Kenya and in the area, two men have ended their life of self-mortality
One of the employees has already tried to suicide.
On October 30, about 1-00, in the village of Lugová, on his place of residence, 1947, the birth of self-ownedness was conducted by order.
It's known that he's already undertaken the suicide attempt.
What did a man like this step not known.
On October 31, at 11 to 50, a lived man, who was 41-year-old, ended at the residence.
The names of violent death have not been found, reports the Kinish Press.
You got a black box in your car?
While the American projects are trying to find money for the repair of the shocking road system, many start to see a decision in a small black box that has been fully equipped at your car board panel.
These devices monitoring each passenger car hire and transfering the information to the officials are in the centre of the opposite attempt to modernize the slow financing system of American car hire funds taken by Washington and State bodies.
Normally, an unexpected automobile planning area was unexpectedly generated intensive debates and colonial aliens.
The Liberians joined the environmental groups in the provision of the Government ' s right to use small sheets for monitoring the numbers of your traveling miles and, perhaps, even where you are going to them, and then use this information when collecting tax accounts.
Cheese movement in shock.
The American Civil Freedom Union is also deeply concerned and has a number of issues of privacy.
And although the convention is unable to agree, continue or not, several States are not expected.
They think about how the drivers can go through the next decade to the system where they pay for each mile to which they go.
Thousands of motor vehicles have already tested these black tanks, parts of which have the function of satellite shipping.
This is really necessary for our country.
“ This is not the issue we may have the right to elect,” said Hasan Ihret, Executive Director of the Government Association of South California, who prepares plans for the start of monitoring the authorities of the state miles passed by each califor automobilist, until 2025.
It will be changed in the way we pay these taxes.
Technology for this is already available.
The need for this is to increase the absence of funds in the Government's Building Fund, funded for taxes that Americans pay for cars.
Americans haven't bought so much benzine as ever.
Automobiles walk more than a mile to a gallery.
The federal tax, 18.4 cents per galon, has not been increased for 20 years.
Politicals do not want to increase taxes even to one center at high prices of benzine.
“ The benzine tax is simply impossible,” said Le Manich, a transport policy experts at the University of Minescotts.
His State has recently established 500 monitoring devices for testing the wrong payment system.
“ This will be the best alternative in a long - term perspective, ” he said.
It's called the wrong user payment.
It is unexpected that the idea of urban Liberals is attractive, since taxes can change the nature of travel to reduce the polluted road and gas emissions, for example.
Planning bodies in California are emphasized to this system in developing strategies for the achievement of the ambitious objectives set by the State to combat global temperature.
However, a member of the Palestinian representatives of Bill Schulster (Republic, Pennsylvania), Chairman of the House's transport committee, said that he also considered the system as a long-term alternative.
The volunteers of the Reason fund also strive to make the drivers pay for each miles.
“ This is not just a tax that will be in the black dark, ” said Edward Mur, vice-president on political affairs Reason.
People pay for their receipt.
This movement is also supported by the two former United States Transport Ministers, which called for the conventions to move towards a wrong payment in 2011.
The United States Senate has approved a pilot project of $90 million in which about $10,000 would participate.
However, representative leaders rejected this proposal because of the threats of rural lawyers representing elections, which often have been traveling a lot of miles to get to work or to the city.
Many states and cities, however, walk on this way.
The largest enthusiasm is shown in the state of Oregon, where 5000 drivers are affected to participate in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the state for a mile walk instead of the benzine tax.
The pilot project in Nevad is closed.
He's in New York.
Eliness tries it on a limited basis with the participation of shipping cars.
And coalition I-95, which includes the transport departments of 17 states of the Eastern Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), studys how they will be able to make these changes.
This concept has not been acknowledged.
In Nevada, where some 50 volunteers' cars had recently been covered by these devices, drivers were concerned that the Government could follow each step.
“Abusiveness about the big brother and such things represents a great problem,” said Alauddin Khan, who conducts strategies and effective management in the Nevad State Transport Department.
That wasn't what people wanted.
When testing was complete, the Office of the United States Citizens of the Nevad State warned on its website: “It will not be difficult to convert these devices into the full-scale devices”.
There is no need to create a huge, sound technological infrastructure that will be inevitablely expanded to store records on daily movements of individual citizens.
There is one of the several states where difficult searching for an incursive technologie, which would allow state authorities to take into account the cars passed, but without information about the location and time.
If you can do this, Han said, the society will feel more calm.
Search for this technology has brought some state agencies to a small young company in California named True Mileage.
This company had not been helping the State tax collection.
She tried to get out of the development of the type of car traffic, where drivers were paid on the basis of the shock.
But the device that it tests is attached to road designers because they do not use GPS and provide a limited number of information that is periodically downloaded by modem.
“They will be more strict to do this if you don't follow their speed and do their position,” said Ryan Morrison, executive director True Mileage.
There were a number of major mistakes in some of these pilot programmes.
There is a lot of less costs and less encouraging ways to do so.
The projects are experiencing with the delivery of various options to drivers.
They can select a device from or without GPS.
Or they can be dismissed from the device, instead of decided to pay a fixed collection based on the average number of miles passed over all the inhabitants of the State.
In other places, they hope to sell an idea of careful public, putting the device to do more than less.
In New York, transportation officials are trying to develop a funded device that will also take payment for parking accounts, to provide "payments as a traveling" insurance and to collect a pool on the speed of real time from other drivers that could be used to avoid sketchs.
“Automobilists will join the benefits offered by them,” states the planning project.
Some transport system projects, however, consider whether it is not all false payment discussions that are just a great reliable factor.
In the City Transport Commission, the employees of San Francisco said that the conventions could be very simple to overcome the banking of the trusting Fund for the construction of the Swedish roads, taking up benzine taxes.
A supplementary or annual tax could be able to spend from hybride cars and other persons whose vehicles do not use a lot of benzine to pay their fair share.
“ There is no need to be a radical surgery when everything you need to do is to take the aspirin,” said Randy Rentshler, Director of Legislation and Public Relations Commission.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their private life and many other things.
EU will prepare measures to support Ukraine for Russia's economic pressure
The European Union has a reserve plan for Ukraine of gas and, as a result of the agreement with the IIF on extreme credit, if Russia takes any measures in response to the possible signing of the EU-Ukrainian Association Agreement in the Vienna.
The FMI has conducted negotiations on stand-by credit, and another EU official who is directly participating in the negotiations has added that their aim was to conclude agreements in the nearest time.
In addition to the potential credit by the Ukrainian IFM, 610 million euros can be obtained from the EU itself.
The analysis requested by Reyter doubts that Ukraine and the FMI are able to overcome long-term differences in the financing conditions.
It does not believe that reforms needed to receive assistance, and the international Railway Agency of the Ukrainian Sovereign Railway to one step - to "V" from "V".
However, the representatives of the EU say that IIF could demonstrate flexibility in credit conditions, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the EU ' s financial support plan, there is a reserve option to ensure Ukraine ' s gas, which is now a part of the delivery from Russia.
It may be a gas from the Green River or a reverse from Slovenia.
Lastly, according to the officials, it is the most possible and acceptable way if Russia is "isolated" of Ukraine.
Analytics believe that such a reverse delivery in Ukraine can only be used for a few weeks and may lead to lower delivery in other regions.
"The small countries of the EU and the Ukraine are negotiations on the way to create favourable conditions to enable Ukraine to import gas from other sources, not from Russia, or from the same source, but on other routes," added the source of Rhether.
Russia outside the fight against the pollution of cars
The attempt to solve large cities had been observed in the majority of the world's megapolis from the second half of the XX century.
Normally, the switch has been on their restructuring and expansion, or attempts to reduce the demand of car travel, number of cars and time of use.
The example of Singapore, where a heavy quantity of the growth of private cars has been introduced, and the right to purchase is purchased.
His price may exceed the price of its auto two-third times.
The European cities, including London, have paid payment for the entry into the centre of the city.
In Germany, such green zones, such as Hamburg and Stuttgarte, are introduced where the entry is permitted only by vehicles with a certain ecoclass that also use high quality (including biopolycarbons or electronics).
The Peking Environment Protection Agency, for example, approved the "five-year air plan" over 250 billion dollars in 2012.
The Director of the Employment Inquisition Inquirements Office of the Peenna Lee Kunsing Environment, the main objective of five-year-old air pollutants, reduced by 20-35 per cent to 2017, increased number of private cars to the level of 6 million (hereinafter 5,2 million) and increased by more than 5 per cent of the use of fuel in a single vehicle.
According to the Agency, there is now 22.5 per cent of the air pollution in Beijing.
The main steps of the programme are the limitation of the use of car transport, and the introduction of additional taxes for vehicles.
Moreover, the urban " green-five" measures include rapidly compared with the rest country of the fuel stations, the introduction of local vehicles and branding systems and vehicles, the restriction of the entrance to the city's central part, the prohibition of the use of installed vehicles (e.g. the establishment of the promotional financial programs for the replacement of old vehicles to Hybrid or electronic vehicles), the development of electronic transport (including public and service), the public transport development (including high growth).
Peking's car innovation is also prohibited for all private cars on the borders of the Fifth Transport Round (together in the KNR 6), one day a week (complianced information contains the number of vehicle marks), as well as the issue of registration of passengers based on a lottery (e.g., 2011, the first year of lote, the total number of authorisations for private vehicles in Beijing was only a third time in 2010).
According to the active Goal for Environment for 2012-2020, the number of cities with high and very high air pollution must be reduced to 128 (in 2012 were 138).
According to the Minoproductors, in 2011, 41 per cent of the emissions of pollutant substances in the urban atmosphere were exposed to the “transition sources”.
In Moscow, for example, the emissions from cars are 10 times higher industrial, and in San Petersburgh nine times.
The RF is only starting to consider the possibilities of restriction of cars on the streets.
The Director of the Institute for Transport and Transport Policy, WSE Mihail Blinkin, believes that administrative and physical measures aimed at redistribution of car travels, are noted that the company can only be adopted in accordance with the fullest universality.
In the case of Moscow, a unique problem related to the structure of its car, where two classes are lowly sensitive to any regulatory effects - service and personal cars, and have the "accepted" users, with a total amount of at least 200 000. (e.g. 5 per cent of the total number of Moscow cars).
During the day of the ECOM Center in San Petersburgh, urbanists have prepared a study analyzing the balance of the urban territory between the housing plant, the scope of road control and the number of cars.
The main conclusions of researchers: the city centre is two times less required and most of the cars that live in the center are not using cars every day, leaveing them on parking or just on the streets.
It is therefore proposed to build a park not a park, but not expanding the car, but to reduce the road (to make the streets more friendly) and to limit the use and location of personal transport in the borders of the historical centre (which is about 3212 g, which covers a number of central areas of the city).
Strategy for unlawful legal trade in Wологd will grow at times
In view of the urban authorities, the increase in the shock size helps to spend in Uganda and free the streets from natural pallets and lots.
Most commercialists do not pay taxes that they perform often do not have a conscious sanitary control.
And that means that health is threatened.
Similarly, the lower limit for citizens for an unlawful trade with November increases six times from 500 rubbers to 3000 rubbers, reports the U.S. Administration.
Goldman Sachs warned the risks for the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned the growing risks for the main driver of the smooth economic growth in Russia - consumption.
This is mainly the crisis of insufficient consumer credits and the mass reductions of employees.
Our main concern now is not what the growth has been delaying, but the structure of this growth.
Last time he was fully satisfied by the consumption that is almost not covered by trafficking,” said the main economist Goldman Sachs on Russia Clemens Grafe, representing the fourth report on Russian economy.
Now the nominal growth in Russia is around 10 per cent.
In inflation by 6 per cent, it is possible to ensure the future consumer demand at the current level, expected at Goldman Sachs.
However, Russian company's rentability is slow, so they may probably be able to optimize staff expenditure.
Today, we see a significant increase in GDP payments: if payments increased by 10 per cent, the GDP is only 2 per cent, Mr. Grafe explained.
The company was confronted with the reduction of rentability.
If it does not grow, it may lead to the exemption and growth of unemployed people.
The main economist Barclays Capital for Russia and the SNG Vladimir Pantoshin cannot be paid.
Employees near the historical minimums, high competition for workers.
In order to move staff from the part or keep the current staff, the employees must take up the payment.
Russia ' s needs are being supported and a very rapid growth in consumption.
Mr. Grafe believes that this type of credit does not provide for the extremely high rates of consumer use-effection on the economy.
" We have not seen the benefits of the economy from the growth of the consumption, we have not seen money from the economy, but return to the same banks as the same percentage payment," said the economicist.
But the problem is in the Goldman Sachs is expected to increase in insufficient credit losses.
They are in the main part of the citizens whom there is nothing to provide.
The percentage of such jobs is high.
As a result, they're not often returning," said Mr. Grafe.
The second threat to the growth of the economy in Russia is, therefore, the possible crisis of uncertainty credits.
The Director of the Bank Institute of the WSE Vasilie Sorocks is now seeing the signs of a bank crisis.
Small credit organizations, with no access to deficiencies available in the gusbans, were obliged to allocate population resources under high percentage.
The economists continued to respond to the war troop and began to reduce credit rates.
Small credit organizations may not be allocated to the same percentage, otherwise they will have a negative rate.
If the guests aren't dismissed from the deponge, Russia threatens the full-valued bank crisis, it trusts in the Vasilia Slocks.
The elimination of a number of bank licences in the last weeks of the economicist is a predicter of the mass.
The head of the institute warns that “asset insurance system has not been initially calculated at a system crisis”.
However, the growth of the consumption is delayed and without the crisis, they believe in the investment bank, due to refusal of the indexing of the payment of guests and soldiers set out in the current version of the budget.
Partial consumption shock will be decreased by natural monopolies (and, as a result, reducing inflation).
But only partly, if investments aren't increased (which do not see help), the growth of the consumption is still late, certain in Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantoshin from Barclays Capital has not seen the presupport for the implementation of pessimistic scenarios.
"The major risk is still a decline of oil prices," he says.
According to its assessment, the Russian economy will begin to reduce the cost of oil below $90.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the CB had not yet been able to reduce economic rates.
The paradoxical image is observed: inflation has decreased, and the banks began to upload rates.
This may mean that they did not believe the CIA, announcing an inflation targetization,” said Clemens Grafe.
The percentage policy on market rates does not affect only interbank credit rates.
"It's all the hopes for the CB," said Clemens Grafe.
Banks are used not for economic credit, but for the management of their liquidity
When the rate is reduced, the currency is immediately changed, it means that the means are trying to go to the speculation against the rubber.
"The CB is understood that this strategy does not work", said Mr. Grafe and recalled that it was planned to run the "free payment" by the State until the end of 2015.
But it should be necessary to do it before or to upload the key rate of the CB (5.5%).
According to his assessment, the rouble rate now is up to 10 per cent.
I'm driving only one way - weakening, expert out.
But if the CIA imposes some shadows of doubt that the elimination of the currency rail is not part of the rule deficiency policy, it may be a very stronger part of the rule.

Snowden is ready to “cooperate” with Germany on the issue of U.S. information
Edward Snowden, the U.S. Intelligence Discover, said he was ready to go to Berlin to give a German parliament if the United States National Security Agency and his Director of Kit Alexandre could not respond to his activities.
The German Deputy Hans-Cristian Stribell was meeting Mr. Snowden in Russia, where he was provided for assurance to discuss his statements in Germany.
In a letter from Mr. Snowden, who presented the media in Berlin on Friday, said: “The results of my efforts were clearly positive, my Government continues to address an anchor as a change and is trying to criminalize the political statements of criminal accused that no protection has been given.”
However, the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed that the support of the international community could convince the United States ' s government to reject criminal accusements against him.
The accused of the Ministry of Justice of the United States includes the spy and the rule of public property.
Hans-Peter Fridrich, the Minister of Internal Affairs of Germany, reported Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak with German officials, we will find ways to do this.”
The relationship between the United States and Germany has been stressed after the approval that ANB had heard the phone of the Officer Angela Merckel.
Thomas Opperman, a parliamentary group to smoke, said that if there is a possibility to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness, “not making it a danger and not destroying the relationship with the United States”, it should be used.
Mr. Streebel, a parliamentary from the Green German Party, published his photo with Mr. Snowden in his Twitter.
During the visit, two German journalists were sent to Russia.
Mr. Stribel said that, according to the lawyer of the former ANB, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he was gone.
If Mr. Snowden had shown in Germany, he would need to ensure that he would be “safely”, said the deputy.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he was confronted with the “small and constant” campaign of persecution that imposed him to leave his house.
However, he said he was encouraged by the world’s response to “the political expressions”.
Citizens throughout the world, and high-speaked officials, including in the United States, believed that the deployment of an uncontrolled system of integration is useful for society.
The letter contains proposals to cooperate with the German authorities, “forever the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be resolved.”
Frontier Airlines will spend the payment for the handboard
Frontier Airlines plans to get the passengers to $100 for they're taking a handle board on the board of their rent.
Frontier Airlines plans to get up to $100 for the handle and $2 for the coffee or the gas, although their statement in the middle said that passengers would be able to leave the whole bank.
The new payment is distributed in top bag residues, so small tubes situated under the seat will remain free.
Frontier said that it would be $25 if the collection was paid before, and $100 if the travellers would be paid only when they were in charge.
The representative of Frontier Kate O'Melly said that the $100 payment should make passengers care for the payment.
“ We don’t want to get the payment for that, ” she said.
The Abia Corporation began to pay for the first and second payment paid in the bag in 2008.
The passengers who try to avoid these collections kill as much as they can, in the hands placed on the top of the bag residues, because they are often missing.
Congregations are one of the ways to put passengers less on board.
O'Melly said that this new collection was not actually for money.
The case is that the most faithful clients of Frontier claim that the location in the top bag retreats is increasingly difficult.
The passengers who buy tickets on the airline should not be paid.
This means that one passenger in the frontier sending can get a taxpayer free, while the next passenger may pay $100 for the same tube.
O'Melly said that the change of the website procedures and the Frontier registers were intended to ensure that passengers will know about the collection before they go to the seat.
The new collection of Frontier on the handle will not begin to reach the flight, although the date is not yet established.
The passors often complain for payment for bags and other collections, but the aircraft is swearing them.
They say that the bag process is money, and passengers who need this service must pay for it.
Many of the Wall Street consider the addition of bagage collections to know that airlines have enough money to cover aircraft costs after a few years of loss.
However, most of them did not relate to collections for handle.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first collection for a handle three years ago, and another Discussioner Alligiant Air later took its example.
The only other aircraft company with such a collection is the venerian Wizz Air, said a aircraft adviser to Jay Sorensen, which is carefully monitoring additional collections.
According to his evaluation in the report from December 2011, the collection of a handle provides $50 million per year.
Sorensen, an ex-minister Midwest Airlines, recently flyed by Spirit, and was interesting that he would find out the seat out when passengers were packed with an uncomfortable Spirit's shipping.
“The ships were the most crazy of what I saw for my carriage in the aircraft,” he said.
I've been waiting to see the dentist and the dragon in the shipping.
Samolet was a pool, and he said: “The floor was sweet. ”
The Frontier should also be paid for the $2 for the coffee, the tea, the gas or the sock.
Frontier said that passengers receiving gas or sock may leave the whole bank and that the amount of coffee would be provided free.
She will still be free to pay water.
The US Airways had long tried to pay for drinks in 2008, but it was rejected by seven months after passengers began to complain and no other large aircraft had followed its example.
Frontier's initiative on payment for a handle when passengers do not buy tickets directly to the aircraft, it is her last measure for shopping customers on their website.
The aviation pays online sales tickets, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each sale ticket.
This encouraging all aircrafts to encourage passengers to purchase tickets directly in them, not to go to the tourism online agency.
However, Frontier continued all in this area.
In September, she began to give twice less than a bonus miles to a flight passenger who purchased tickets through the online tourism agency.
In the midst, it was 25 per cent of the trip.
Yeah, a travel from Frontier, a travel from the online tourism agency, would be allowed to get 250 miles away.
Moreover, passengers can be selected only if they buy tickets directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has the base of loyal customers in her family town in Denver, but its business is decreased and lost.
The expenditure was decreased to 9 per cent, and the annual possibilities were almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to the financial results published in the Middle Airways Holding Company.
The Republic is trying to correct the financing of Frontier under the sale of aviation.
ANB is injury to the internal error, not the hackers in the stop of the website
The Occupied Secret Agency of National Security stated on Friday night that the stop of their website has been made for a few hours technical failure, not hackers, as has been stated in the network.
“NSA.gov was not incompatible during a few hours tonight because of the internal error that occurred during the planning update” reported the informing agency in an official electronic letter.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Declaration that the discharge of the work was issued by a type of “service” attack [DDOS] is invalid.
Last night, the server monitoring system registered that the ANB site had not worked at least six hours, and the website is still not available for some users.
The previous representative of ANB reported ABC News that the internal secret network of the non-related Agency was cut off.
No secret information is in danger, reported by the representative.
At least one online hacker-active group stated that it was responsible for the outcome of the ANB site using DDOS attacks.
DDOS attacks are developed so that the target traffic site is closed until the servers are not reloaded and the site is not out of the building.
The hacker tactics are relatively simple and the attacks are not designed to detect the internal target system.
The previous super-secretary ANB, which was ever received by the “No Agency”, was in the centre of public attention and a bad criticism after the explanation of its broad-scale and internal programs, all of the reactions to secret files slaughtered by the ANB and published by the former ANB Edward Snowden.
The growing field around the Agency pointed out that today the incident was the result of the Hugger targeted action.
Bombardier's profit is reduced by the fall of the delivery and the number of aircraft orders
Bombardier, Canadian flight manufacturer and train company, reported on the reducing of income of 15 per cent under the reduced number of orders and shipments in the third quarter and contract problems in its liquid unit.
The Bombardier company also has not published any data on the annual tests of its new CSeries flight and provided new information on whether the aviation plans would be implemented in the commercial exploitation of its new CSeries, September.
After the first flight of an experienced aircraft, about half months ago, he flyed only three times, which causes questions about whether a graphic test stage is.
The results did not justify forecasts and brought action to the Toronto Fund by more than 8 per cent.
Cameron Doerxen, an analysis of the National Financial Bank, slowed its evaluation from the “medior market” to the “medior market” because of the conviction that the growth of actions is limited to the nearest quarter or two.
“The reduction of aircraft delivery was generally predicted,” said Doerxen in the review of the fund market.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders to CSeries on the continuation of the annual test programme.
However, if the new orders are not announced in the next months, we suggest that the market will be more skeptically treated with the programme.
Bombardier's company hopes that the CSeries flight family allows her to sell a place in the lower price segment of the market where Boeing and Airbus are now dominated.
The first experience of the aircraft was presented in March, and first flight was made in September after a few months of delay.
However, firm orders for CSeries have not been too much than 177, since potential purchasers are expected to see the results of the yearly tests to check the company's approval of fuel efficiency and potential economicity of the new ray.
There are now 403 orders and arrangements with 15 customers and operators.
The principal executive director Peter Boduan was convinced that Bombardier would reach its goal at 300 fixed orders at the time that the first flight was undertaken in the commercial exploitation.
The leaders also assured analytics and media that the program was forwarded to the plan.
“ The tenth flight model remained more than expected on the ground, ” said Bodohan during the telephone conference, adding that a simple aircraft was planned for air tests and program updates.
All producers plan to test.
We decided to take the first flight and stop up, so we did.
That will happen throughout the annual test programme.
The second of five tests must be made a flight in the nearest weeks, and all the other will soon follow it as the company reported.
However, skeptical analysis relates to the statement that the first customer could start to exploitation of CSeries flight 12 months after his first flight.
The Bombardier company stated that it would evaluate the period of exploitation and provide new information within the next few months.
“ This is the lengest time of years tests, all of the visibility, and corresponds to the internal Bombardier graph - supports our point of view that the introduction will be transferred to the first quarter of 2015,” said Doerxen.
In the third quarter, on 30 September, Bombardier clean income reduced to $147 million, or $8,172 million, or $9,000 for action in the last year.
The corrected income for action remained at 9 targets.
The total income has decreased significantly, from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
Analytics expected to reach $4.56 billion and $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth world’s aircraft manufacturer reported that he had set 45 aircrafts for quarel, less than a year ago - 57.
The overall number of orders decreased from 83 to 26 flights.
The port of the Aviation Orders has been $32.9 billion for September 30, not changed since 31 December.
“The results in the aviation sector were in line with our goals, but small numbers of orders and general market conditions became unpleasant,” said Boduan.
The voluntary income in the airspace was 13 per cent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the largest travel producer in the world, reported that the currency income in this sector was almost 11 per cent to $2.1 billion.
The port of orders in the transport unit was $32.6 billion for September 30, which was a little above 31 December.
The income of the transportation unit was negatively addressed with a number of major contracts.
The Director stated that the fourth Quartal would present a new development plan.
Bombardier company, who also declared that the head of the Google Financial Director, Patrick Pittat, is in the Board of Directors, was 8.5 per cent to $4.83 at the mid-fourth market.
The Brazilian Emmbraer SA company, the third world on the largest market manufacturer and the nearest Bombardier competitor, reported on the reduction of the quarter income in 10 per cent on Thursday.
Sony calculates the lowest annual income
The Japanese electronic producer, Sony, has completed the last quarter of the clean loss of $19.3 billion, or $197 million, reduced the prognosis of arrival in the current financial year.
Sony results from July to September 2013 were more encouraging than expected that television, videocameras and personal computers of the Japanese company were falling.
Sony’s Television business in the II quarter of the first three-year operational income of 5,2 billion yen, again in the reporting period, was 9.3 billion of operational losses.
The Japanese consumer electronic market has a serious time, especially due to the reduction of television demand.
While the competitors are trying to find out of a complex situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of the main partners of Sony, Panasonic, has recently increased focuss on industrial complexs: the company's sales will grow by high levels, especially through car systems and environmentally clean technologies.
As a result of the end of the financial year, which will be concluded in March 2014, Sony calculates obtaining 179 billion an operational arrival against expected 230 billion yen.
According to the Thomson Reuters Agency, analysis suggested that the data would be significantly above and up to 221 billion yen.

Hen has been the stimulator of the symptoms education
Scientists from the University of John Hopkins and the Medical School of Maunt-Sinae have found whites, through which Foxp2 works, stimulating the education of new relationships between neurons.
The study is published in Science, and you can read its short contents on the website.
Hen Foxp2 is the first known gene whose function is directly linked to the speaker.
The role of it was made in 2001 through the discovery of a few people who could not correctly speak and sometimes have not yet understanded each other.
Scientists found that the work of the family Foxp2 was violated, but how he performed its function was not known.
In the new study, biological studies showed that at least part of their Foxp2 functions were the stimulator of new syntax in the brain-related forming.
He performs this through another gene, SRPX2.
The latter has been discovered as a result of finding factors that encourage symptoms education.
SRPX2 was one of the 10 similar genes found by the authors, with only its activeness, Foxp2.
What SRPX2 really affects vaccination, the scientists have confirmed the test on museums.
When the genital activity was artically decreased, they cried less at the separation of the mother.
If gene activity was restored, restored, and the frequency of the sounds published.
Previous links were also shown in the mouse with Foxp2 vaccination.
Lifes introduced human copy of the genes eat more active and lower than normal mouse.
However, scientists do not know whether Foxp2's work is related and, respectively, managed by SRPX2 with the "mechanical" properties of sound education or more accurate processes.
The lawyer of cocaine dependence, who was assigned to the head of a police investigation group, was in prison
The 42-year-old Basharat, child, provided information on the criminal authority of Nila Scarboro
The lawyer was afraid that his secret dependance would be discovered
It was sentenced to three years of prison by the Royal Court of Liberia.
The prestigious lawyer, who told the drugs about the big police investigation, was in prison for three years.
The 42-year-old Bashart Death transmitted the criminal authority of Nila Scarboro secret information on investigation of his illegal drug trafficking activities after threatening its cocaine dependence.
The lawyer who received the call of Bash and a great lawyer was arrested in his home in 2011 after the police surrounding Scarboro, which he had previously represented in the court of drugs.
The officers noted that the 32-year-old Scarboro left three packages with cocaine at a lawyer in the city of Bleekburn Lankashi, as it was at the dinner association with colleagues.
As a result, the child “regulated” drugs of class A, after testing showed the results of cocaine in his hair, on his paper and on credit cards.
In the course of the eight months from January to August 2011, he tried to receive illegal information on arrests of two persons on Scarboro, as well as one of his reporters.
All four suspected were at that time under the supervision of the police under a broad investigation of the crime organization for heroin and cocaine in Lankashire, Cambry, Mercyde, Berlin and Western Yorkshire.
They were also 32 persons later in prison after the police was issued during a series of heroin and cocaine raids for $1.5 million and more than 200 million.
The 42-year-old child transmitted information to criminals because of the fear that his cocaine dependence would be opened.
Today, in the Real Court of Liberia, the Chief, who works in the legal company of Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, has been struggled after the recognition of his responsibilities in two cases of the prevention of the implementation of the trial court in the Liberal Court.
He acknowledged cocaine at one of the previous judicial meetings.
The department of the lawyer occurred after the police, which investigated Scarboro, explained that he had regularly spoken with the child on the phone from February 2011.
Two detectives were investigated and found how he came to the child in Blackburn and placed the drugs of 60 per cent cleaning in a black gorfa under the sweets of the lawyer.
Shortly after Scarboro was transferred, it was often contacted with the child, who was at the dinner at the football station, Jude Park's Bradberg Robers team.
The lawyer returned to home for drugs, and there were nine conversations among them.
The court learned that the child “regularly used” cocaine, after testing were found in his hair, cup and credit cards.
The child was later arrested, but he refused the use of cocaine, said he had spoken to the suspected diplom because he was his customer and insisted that their community was a ‘advocate secret’.
During his detention, David took his paper and tried to get several credit cards, but all of them were confiscated, and he was also taken a hair.
At the police investigation he said that he had a home office and the customers came home for legal affairs.
However, the court was known that after the important arrests, he called the largest parties to the illicit trafficking of drugs, which he previously represented in the court to tell them that they knew the detectives.
Ann Wright said, “If anyone knows that it should not violate the law, it is a lawyer for criminal affairs.”
Mr. Batteth is accused of abuse by his lawyer on criminal affairs because he has entered into a too close relationship with certain customers.
The contact we're talking isn't just a drug trafficker, but a drug traffick that uses drugs from his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations are obviously lawful because he was their lawyer.
However, this has significantly crossed the borders of the general relationships of the lawyer and customer.
He prevented the police investigation as strong as possible to allow those to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Daddy didn't have his profession, but shocked her.
He was too close to some customers, in particular Scarbour, and enabled to consciouse in his irrelevantness.
The child did not admit the guilt and said, “If I would have been corrupted by a lawyer that I am not, and I would like to transmit information to Mr. Scarboro, I wouldn't wait for 15 hours, I would do it immediately.”
But after the meeting, the senior officer Lee Holstead from the Lankashire police said: “Mr. child has become a criminal lawyer for criminal crime, just as he began to get drugs into organized crime representatives.”
His attraction to cocaine was unreasonable and vulnerable for the purposes of the main criminal group parties, which were able to obtain valuable information on the police investigations.
The lawyers should follow the higher standards of professional ethics and enhance the confidence and confidence of society.
Mr. Batteth has given this confidence and tried to shut up his professionals.
A study on the case was made by Mr. Chief Lankashih's Unit on a particularly dangerous organized crime, which has already been sentenced on three cases of cocaine conservation, and still now in the prevention of justice, demonstrating our efforts to obtain a fair punishment for criminals.
Let this case be warned for criminals that no one is outside the fulfilment of the law.
We'll find you and join you to the judiciary.
Scarboro was sentenced for 14 years after the recognition of his guilt in order to deliver heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
More 35 persons in the maquination were sentenced to 153 years of drug crime.
On his website, the child organized a conversation in the form of questions and answers in which he said that his dream work is a lawyer who represents the guests of the death condemned in America, a perfect company for him for dinner — Mohammed Ali, and the motivation in the work is inequality.

In Moscow, the construction of the TSOs will lead to
With each year, the capital authorities have promised to be more controlled by transportation (TVT).
By 2020, it is planned to introduce 255 MTs.
What the project is being discussed, we found our correspondent.
A few months ago, there was a building board in the Smolenian metro.
The sign stated that it was the management of the transportation and transit throat.
It was very strange because there was no land transport close to the Smolenian, and it was therefore impossible to move.
To reach the nearest tropical stop on the Saddle corner, it is necessary to overcome 130 meters (130 m), including the land transit through the Carmagna Pass.
Now the Smolenian is almost all finished.
The shock of a color lare, demonized for a newspaper, and the asfalt changed the brown before the entry.
That's the whole vehicle.
Transport and transport skys are slightly and capital, and they explain in the press service of the capital transport Department.
Capital SMEs aren't yet.
The spots offer park construction, trade instruments, passenger movement, small architecture and well-being.
In general, non-trafficking TSOs are even employed by transporters, but professional budgets from the capital department of the city of Moscow.
Transport strike is not necessarily complex, explains the director of the Institute for Transport and Transport Policy of Mihail Blinkinn's High Economic School.
Sometimes it is enough to shut over the head and the tables that report the time of the transport.
This is, for example, a fully valuable swimming area was recently opened in the Jacques Metro.
Don't be wear, but with swimming parks and maps that indicate when the bus comes.
But in the flight of the number of officials, all of them have been recorded in the TPI.
In 2011, Mary planned to build all 151 stones, with 59 capital buildings.
The plans are now at the time until 2020, up to 255 IDPs.
Some of them are promised to make it again in this year.
Although there is a TSO development programme in the city, no quality criteria is referred to, Alexandre Moroso, co-chairman of the World and Transport Organization.
The number of objects are calculated, but the quality of the shipment is often worse.
The criteria of the expert should be two: first is a reduction in the time of transfer, secondly a goodness.
Before the possibility to change the kind of transport, not out of rain.
In Moscow it is timely restrainted when the TSI is slightly shocked.
A clear example of the VNH metro.
Previously, bus buses with the Yaroslavian Shos were in the skull prior to the main entry to the UNHCR.
Their stops have now been transferred to the opposite side of Yaroslava on the street of Cosmonat.
More than metro, a significantly higher than the monarch, closer to the living houses.
Because the people did not completely want to swallow under the windows and to shoot all possible instances.
In Moscow, Capital SMEs have not been undertaken immediately.
The first one of them began to build five years ago in the Metro Planner.
The draft was intended to be a figure.
And it was really obtained as the transfer to the investors was converted into the banana trade center.
No, there's a swimming snake for bus, sweet to go from swimming swimming pool, and three stages of car.
Indeed, the chemical trolley No.202 and No.203 in Moscow S.T.A. did not beginly.
As foreigners, they moved away from the metro.
There's been more trade places.
Only one of the 32 store clothes, and there is almost everything from the zoometers to the bus.
Really, who of the passengers have to buy a new car on the road?
We've got a capital TV, why it's always got a commercial center.
The situation recently reached its logical conclusion when part of the automobilists decided to give the market.
Now, the third stage of the "Planner" TIR is a parking fight.
Injuries, sperms, Chinese jinns, non-Russian speechs and guards, wickedly viewing our photo.
The slope is finally transformed into the basement.
It's what the Metro Planner had a market, but they took it.
And in the prefecture of the traders, they were shocked and dwelled on a overwhelming park of a swimming steel.
It's always empty because of high prices there.
It's the most funny thing that the market was shocked to build its place... a new swimming aircraft.
That's a year.
At the Metro Kaluja Metro, a 50 meters away from the road to the bus, says Alexandre Moross.
After the construction of the Trade Centre, such as TPIs, the distance increased up to 170 meters.
In order to access the bus, it is necessary to walk through the whole commercial center.
After 22 hours when he closed, it must be covered under an open sky.
Otherwise, the buildings on the Planner and the Kalujian will soon be shown with flowers.
In the midst of September, the Mari Law Commission adopted planning decisions for the first eight capital systems.
Four of them will be 25, not considered by two-third subterranees.
The main monster will grow to the Tushino metro, 418.7.000 cubits of the surface.
Representatives of RJD hydrocarbon vacuums, which are responsible for the construction of TSOs in metro, have already reported to journalists: shops, guests and apartments are available in the future.
The officials believe that multi-agency parks take up from the third to the half of the area.
Let's take an example of the natural garages.
As a result, there is an area of 8015 meters of 258 cars that have recently been built on the International Street.
This means, for the parking, 2,6,000 cars in the Petrosco-Razzomic.
It's less than third of the machine that they're going to build there.
Let the two stages go to every bus.
It remains at least 1500,000 km of commercial inmobility.
And that's a minute, almost two GM.
If the swimming swallowing swallows in stations and inhospitals, the rest of the areas will be swallowed by the metropolitans.
They also promised that there would be many " functional items", including guests, offices and even sports.
In the department of the city of Moscow, they recently conducted journalists that have developed a draft decision, with a view to which investors will be able to obtain TIRs directly.
Without any competitors.
So prayer that the transport questions for the city are priority.
The perfect tv is, for example, the Harvard Station in Boston or Scene in Toronto, surely Alexander Moross.
There are trolley and traumas under the ground at the metro level and the distance of the approach from the vagon metro to the trauma is only 50 meters away from the road.
There is no relief of trade around the world.
But the Moscow officials are extreme.
We will not build anything, or we'll have 25 stages with offices and apartments.
Esther proposes to compare to the extremism of the distress of patriotic feelings
In order to protect legislative patriotic feelings of citizens against Russia's prosecution and distortions, the Honour of Russia proposes to compare the distortion of patriotic feelings to extremist activities and to punish for five years of prison.
As reported by the Icevery newspaper, such amendments in legislation prepared by the Olympic Energy Committee are already aimed at receiving a sentence in the Supreme Court and the Government.
Under the patriotic sense of the citizens of the amendment, the author proposes to understand the emotional relationship with a country whose citizen is characterized by the love of this country, responsible for its court, respect for his history and culture.
As stated in Mihew, there are sanctions for abuse of formal signs of the State authority, flag and herb.
For this reason, Parliament's view of the protection of Russians, whose feelings can be deceived and distorted by state symbols, and other statements of non-respect to our country, are insufficient in Russian legislation.
As an example, it brings the devastating annually in the Canon of the Day of Discussion, when some medical persons are enabled to make themselves doubtless of the heroic support of the U.S.S. people in the fight against the fascists.
The capital of the National Festival, the Summit Day, on May 9, is a real vaccine developed annually.
Introduction in the astronomy and the "alternative view" in history, some publishers have been discussed that, as unfortunately, the cultural Germans have not been acquired by the Wild Soviet Union!
I read that absolutely invalid in the country where the pride of history remains the main "power" nation, Oлег Miheev is deceived.
Moreover, Mihewa says that patrioticly established people in Russia are much more than religious, but the law calls for the distortion of the feelings of believers, and the elimination of the patriotic feelings can be practically unnecessary.
According to the people ' s election, it is necessary to compare the distortion of patriotic feelings to extremist activities and to write in article 282 of the Criminal Code on the Punishment.
The draft law provides punishment for the distortion of patriotic feelings: from 100-month trace to 5-year-old prison.

United Nations announces new goals to overcome poverty
The United Nations should immediately continue to work on the new integration to replace the Millennium Development Goals that have been formed 12 years ago to overcome poverty in the world.
Australian diplomates have played a key role in promoting the “sufficient development goals” for the change of the CCT, which is the time for which the UN Summit on Sustainable Development began at Rio-de-Janiro at the night.
They were included in the final option of a document signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard during the summit.
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Pan Guy Mun, said, on the evening, to the participants of the Sumite that it had now been time to “more above national interests”.
“I am glad that the United Nations Member States agreed to start and control the process of establishment of universal aims for sustainable development,” he said.
These UNDPs will be opposed to our progress in the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and will become an integral part of the concept of development for the period after 2015.
I will make all efforts to use the powers provided by Member States to integrate our vision of sustainable development goals that are opposed to successful implementation of the DGT.
Safety Peace in Mozambique is a result of the conflict of influential people
Under this statue, Samory Mashela, President of Mozambique, have gathered thousands of people in the centre of Maputo to scann the world on one of the rare manifestations here.
“We want to return peace; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Susa, Executive Director of Investment Company.
In fear of the future of her country, she changed the business cost to a football loaded by the description “We require security” in Portugal, and joined the Tower to the Tower of Independence on Thursday.
During two weeks, almost daily communications were made between the government forces and Renamo, one of the most cruelly shocks since the death of more than 20 years ago.
Renamos had ever been known for a re-established movement, which was first supported by the white authorities of Rodesia and then by the Government of South Africa for the efforts to destabilize the independent Government of the country.
After the death of 1992, it became a opposition party.
Analytics believe that the country is not recovered again to a full-scale conflict, but recent events have emphasized foreign investors and local people.
The high rates for the rapid economics, since the opening of large gas and western western western western western west stocks may be more than $50 billion as investments in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
The right party of Frilem, who has led the political force since 1975, and the Renamo party accused each other of the tension established.
The Renamo Party argued that the Government was a shutch of the last clamps, attacking its members in the province of Sofala, the traditional Renamo Army, on October 17.
The Financial Times Fernando Mazang, representative of Renamo, reported the Financial Times Fernando Mazang, government attacked the bases of Renamo and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakamu, a group leader.
The Government accusates Renamo in the initiative of complaints, accusing the party to attack soldiers.
The President of Armandu Geboz tried to develop fears of instability.
He declared AFP, the French Information Agency, in the medium that Mr. Dhlakama felt that he wanted to use “all that remained from his power to prove that he could put up his own decisions to the Government”.
Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, fears increased after reporting that Mazanga claimed that Renamo was rejected by the peace agreement in 1992.
He reported the Financial Times that was not to be observed by the Freemo Party Agreement.
“ Our goal is back to negotiations, but with all the seriousness, ” said Mazanga.
The previous negotiations between the parties have not been made to decline the tension that increased the series of cuttings in this year.
“ These are two influentious men (Gebuza and Dhlakama), cut into the legs), ” said Joseph Hanlon, director of the University of Open and expert on Mozambique.
No one is a good negotiator and no one is ready to go to the necessary departure.
The Renamo Party, who is trying to achieve election reforms, has already stated that it would be boicotified by the municipal elections designated for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for the next year.
Some comments interpreted this pressure as a attempt to achieve debole movements and financial funds from the Government.
The portion of votes for Renamo is decreased since 1992, while the new party is the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which is based on the former member of Renamo, as it is expected, will improve its indicators in these elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Gaboz, who is going to leave from the next year when its second time ends, wants to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn't want a multipartite democracy, he does not want transparent elections, no peace, because he doesn't want to leave the president” said Mazanga.
There is no clear possibility of Renamo, but it has already performed destructive and voluntary attacks against the police offices and cars on a key engineer from the north to the south.
The majority of the slaughter was in Sofala province, which is hundreds of miles north of Maputo, but includes Bair, the port of the swimming company, including Rio Tinto and Vale, to export an edge.
In June, Rio stopped the use of iron roads for about a week after Renamo threatened the attack on the iron road.
Mazanga was adorned when he asked whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
The Renamo Party wanted to “advertise the international community that the cases in Mozambique are not very good,” said Mazanga.
The instability has increased by the Government, and many are also concerned about the corruption, the late level of development and the recent defence of people, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent Mediacoop Medical Corporation.
“Their people believe that the responsibility for the future country is to be made by the Government and the President who must find out these problems,” he said.
Omar Sultuan, a demonstration participant, said that people just want stability.
“No one worry about Renamo or Frilimo, they just want to restore peace, they want free access to the roads,” he said.

Childs should study Miph and Legends as “models of life” said by the author.
The statements about Tore could show that “the wicked power cannot win the throat, ” and the legends of King Arthur show the importance of having a dream.
As many mifs say, "scandale, too skilled, and in some cases too unacceptable to provide schools", Crossly-Holland speaks for the "this selection" of the text age.
“I think it is wonderful that in America the mif and the folklor are already part of education,” he said.
I spoke for introducing them in the training programme for twenty years.
He added that “extreme morality” of the authors and providers “estimated interest” in children, and the main ideas were“displayed” in the attractive history.
Crossley-Holland, which translated Beevulf with English and Saxony language, wrote the Norveish Meeting Committee for the publications of Penuin and the British People's Words, said, “You may, of course, have an intention, but you better keep them with you.”
A great difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an adult author who writes for children is the need to feel a certain hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or bring to a happy end, but it is necessary to be a birthful understanding of good and evil.
And that must be overcome; opened through history, not clearly formatted.
Old principle: Show, not telling.

There should be no vegan in Siberia: the warm point does not replace the spouse
Why the vegetation does not go to life in Siberia, explaining the R.A. News Correspondent.
People who are fully rejected from animal origin should not live in Siberia.
There they do not move the winter without loss of health, and no warm measuring measuring of them is not compensated, considering the requested Wegen Day of New Siria dioxics and physicians.
Get Litra Oil
Strange vegetation, not only from meat and fish, but also from milk, meat, and ice, becomes a modest life.
However, the physicians are convinced that in New Sibirk and other towns of Siberia, there is no use for health.
Full rejection of animals is harmful.
The animals contain unlimited minosules, which are very difficult to compensate vegetables.
It must be included in a ratio even if milk or egg," is a certain dioxist of Marina of God.
It provides for example a fish containing a smaller oxygen of Omega-3.
The most rich of them is lunar oil.
"Why do you need him in the numbers of humans, you need a litra to drink?" says a diox.
Medicines are convinced that the people of Siberia have to be a particular attention to the ratio to winter.
In this season, the vegetarianity is particularly doubtful.
In the conditions of our reality, high demands for food are made.
In order to not exceed, there is a higher calibracy need.
"If man limits himself on animal products, therefore it is unlikely," said a specialist.
This agrees with Dr. Olga Poski.
She adds that the fruits and fruits are not out.
Humans are better feeding products which are produced in the residence region or where he was born.
The genetic code is designed to improve and reverse these products.
And the winter people do not want to shoot a shooter, but a shooter or something else,” explains the doctor's position.
It says that there may be vegans, which are actually useful for various balls, craps, bombs, local fruits, balls remaining in the winter of nuclears.
However, this is not enough for full food.
According to Claudi Arifulina's physician, Vitamin levels are sufficient from the middle of August in the middle of September.
A full swimming swimming swimming in our crush natural conditions, when temperatures can change to 30 degrees and sneeze in May are insects.
The body for life needs energy, and, above all, grain," constitutes medicine.
The doctors noted that the pregnancy is particularly dangerous for children and pregnants.
Childs grow, they need a building material, including a mixture.
We shall give them unprecedented, while we keep the vegetarians.
Time also requires higher white, vitamins and microelements in the menu.
"They's not incompatible," is God's certainty.
Ariphulin says that the adult man will choose everything he wants to play in the games that he wants.
He has already formed organs, skelets, organs.
However, children must be fully demanded.
If parents lost him any microelements or a mynoxistic, chooseing for him what he will be, it is just a violation of the rights of the child.
"The inadequacy of those or other substances for the development of the brain, the face, the bones are no longer rebuilt tomorrow," says she.
All requested medicators are in the view of an insufficient winter and the carriage of fruit and fruit.
What they bring to us and produced in warming contains less than the necessary microelements we need in the open board.
"The quantity of products isn't that," said God.
Ariphulin also notes that the customs and warm fruits and fruits are far from perfect standards.
The desire of producers to gather larger wealth causes the damage of quality.
"The blocks are not rooted on the floor, the swimming swimming and slaughtered, the powders are unclean and inaromatic," adds examples of medicine, and adds that they may probably be shocked by a limited number of appeals.
And they are producers, not vitamins, but cells.
This does not depend on the laboratory of the Siberian Physical and Technology Institute of Agricultural Problems, the agriculture candidates Ver Peter.
It says that, in the right approach and compliance with all standards and conditions in warming, it is possible to increase the full value of fruit.
If they are trying to escape more than a square metro, it will, of course, become more and more, and raising the growth of mineral approximations.
For example, when too many azotic additives grow rapidly, they are large, but skilled and uncomfortable," she explains, adds that quality matter, first-term, depends on the conscience of the manufacturer.

In August, New York decided to stop the names and addresses of persons whose cases were stopped after the police check.
The cities appeal debate should be held after 14 March 2014.
The tactics “stop and search” were criticized by many civil rights lawyers.
A few decades have been practitioned in a form of a few, but the number of documented stops has been significantly increased in the administration of the independent Mrs. Michael Blumberg, reached the absolute recursion in 2011 in 684 330 people, most of which black and Latin Americans.
In 2004, four people, all of the representatives of national minorities, received a collective search in the court.
The changers in the programme " stop and search" in New York police department say that these changes will end up of unexpected practice, form a more reliable and effective police service and can affect the way other police departments have implemented this practice.
Opponents argued that the changes of the fighting spirit of police, not the crime level, will lead to unnecessary money costs and not to address a more global complicated problem in the police due to the reduction of the number of officials in the last decade.
The judge noted that it was not stopping the practice of the "halting and searching", which corresponds to the Constitution, but changes the way the New York police stops people.
The third gallery has opened a heat area
In Moscow there was a new swimming area.
It is located in the third gallery area and takes a park in two kilometers from the Northern Metro station to the Boloth Area.
For all the time, there are strikes, flowers, stones, torres and toilets, swimming pools and illicit advertising.
Besides the Climate and Labourvian Travellers, the five streets closed the Ordenian Tupick, the Great and Small Tolmachew, the Cadachua Beach and the Boloth area.
The Maurice and Peter’s transport movement is not limited.
In the Fiveday Street, the New York Station was established to the Climate Transition Conditions for Peaches, without removing the movement and cutting of the past parts, transfers newsmsk.com.
The third garden, the priest of the Pope of the Roman, the museums, the libraries, the memorandums and other accessions, was in the interior peak area.

The large Distrik, where a swimming zone was opened at the beginning of September, was decided to close for weekly and feast cars.
Coulson came to the filling phone to check the confidential message.
The former editor of News of the World Andy Coldson suggested that he uses the "extraordinary phone, rise and contradiction" in trying to confirm the false information about Charles Clarke, who was at the time of the Minister of Internal Affairs.
The accused, the Queen Advocate Andre Edis reported to the Court of Old-Bay that in May 2005, the newspaper News of the World had received an uncertain news that Clark meets his “Applausing Advisory Advisor” Hanna Polby.
The newspaper ordered a private detective Glenn Mulkeyr to cut Polby's voice email and guard her home to take an interview, but he also called her and left the voice message, and he heard the court.
“The fact is that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not a man who will stand around any house, hopes to get somebody disappointed, he who likes to propose the history of people to see what they will say,” said Mr. Edis.
He said that the newspapers of the World used three ways of research on historic phones, phones, clips and opposition.
Personal editors are inverted in the third.
Obviously, he knows the second, he's just got to be.
What about the first?
Does he know about the phones?
He said, "No, we say, oh, oh!
Roman Clark's first comment on the editions News of the World, when a source of sex interested by Mrs. Polby said: “It's no time, she and Charles.”
A vote message received at least three times from her phone was issued from the Mulkeyr house in August 2006.
The followers also found a record on a private detection computer where Miss Polby and her sister were fixed as the Projects.
During the period, when she was under the side, grandmother and grandmother, Mrs. Paulby received anonymous calls on requests to provide information on her, Mr. Edis said.
At that time, the former principal reporter Neville Turlbeck and the former reporter James Watersape controlled the movement of Mrs. Polby.
On 18 June 2005, he said: “I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow and that I would like to very much to discuss with Charles.”
Mr. Edis said that the participation of Coulson in this story was the same scenario as with other influential people, such as the former minister of Internal Affairs David Brandet.
The judges heard on Thursday that Koulson had entered the conflict with Mr. Blankett on a Romanian marriage while he himself met Rebecca Brooks, who was at the time of the marriage.
Coulson and Brooks refused to enter into conspiration with other people in order to filling phones from 3 October 2000 to 9 August 2006.
Mulkeyr, Turlbeck, and Waterap were acknowledged in phones.

The United States increases the food supply for poor people
Food individuals of four persons are reduced to $36 per month
From Thursday in the United States, the financial guarantee of products known as "Fudstemps" is reduced since the operation of the relevant State programme is completed.
The family of four persons will now be allocated to $36 per month less than previously.
That's about 47 million Americans.
On the information of the Reater Agency, in 2012, the allocation for one person was a average of $133 per month.
The food assistance costs in the United States increased up to $80 billion per year because of the growth of unemployed people and the food prices.
About 14 per cent of the Americans are trusted in free food assistance issued by Foudstempam, which contains such a name in previous times when they had the form of paper kitchens.
When the current economic crisis began, the programme was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
However, the Republicns in the Congress require further reductions in the programme, claiming that it should be encouraged to help those who need more.
Food shops throughout America are concerned that the reduction of consumer costs would be reduced.
The United States Congress continued to discuss how more government financing can be reduced.
Blizzard has freely issued a 19-year-old platform
The Blizzard study has freely issued his Blackhorne platform on the PC in 1994.
This reports WoW Insider.
According to his data, the game was available in Battle.net section Blizzard classic games.
However, some heakers noted that it can currently be scanned only the users who are related to the American service part.
For Russian users, games are not available.
Like the media, Blizzard's version now released on the PC does not vary from the original game option.
Saundreck to Blackthorne was also unlikely.
The Blackthorne Platformer, who Blizzard had released 19 years ago, originally came to the SNES console.
His events were disappeared on the Tuul planet, whose populations were separated on the dark and light kings.
One day, the Dark Goal of Sarac decided to kill the light king of Vlaрос and become a unique ruler of the planet.
The main hero of the game is the son of Vlarus Kyle, who saved from death, sent to the earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Tuul to fight with Saracs and protect the people of the planet.
The original Blackthorne became the first game that the study issued after its name in Blizzard Entertainment.
She was called Silicon & Synapse.
Blackthorne was Interplay company.
New automates appear in the Moscow Metropolitan.
But to sell passenger tickets, they're not for money, but for meetings.
One trip of the cost at 30 sections is a potential passenger at 30 meetings.
The number of meetings will be recorded by a special device using modern technologies, reports ITAR-TASS with reference to the press service of the Russian Olympic Committee.
The first device will be established on the "State" station on 8 November 2013.
In the presentation of new bicycle sports, President of the Russian Olympic Committee Alexandre Jacques and the Olympic chimpanzees of Alex Nemom and Elena Zamelochica will receive President.
The recognition of the National Security Agency increases the paraoid corporations in respect of the public trading
The day at the end of August, Germany’s police helicopter passed lowly over the U.S. console in Francoforte, the financial capital of Germany.
According to the Federal Constitutional Protection Service (BfV), internal research services of Germany, his task was to photograph the building box of the United States representatives, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Boundasban.
German media said that BfV had hoped to find the anciens of listening devices, and these actions were involved in negotiations between the United States and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clepper, Director of the National Intelligence of the United States, reaffirmed in September that the United States did not use external information for “to defeat the trade secrets of foreign companies in the interests of the United States to enhance their international competitiveness or to increase their gain”.
But since Edward Snowden, a contract servant, began to publish his backup secrets of the United States, the European Governments and the leaders of the company, are no longer sure if you can believe the director.
The report that the United States National Security Agency has followed the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and has received access to data scheduled in the U.S. district services providers, including Google and Yahoo, to upload a para-company company of the State area to new heights.
The last chapter was reported that the phone of the Officer Angela Merckel may have been listening to some ten years.
If the most influential person of Europe can be a museum, there is, of course, potential channels are also the leaders of business.
Snowden made clearly intensive cooperation between the United States Intelligence Services and the Companies.
I think that these data may be used with mutual benefit.
“Germany must wake up,” says Oliver Green, President of the BITMI Association, representing the small and medium-sized IT Corporation of Germany.
German companies are convinced that the United States now are almost the same risk as China, in the field of industrial specimens and the detection of data, according to the research published in July by the EC Consulting Agency.
Nevertheless, in all documents revealed by Mr. Snowden, the U.S. has not yet been evidenced that the trade secrets of foreign companies have been transferred to their own companies.
Politicals expressed concern that the EU had no need for certain information technologies and the Internet, and expressed the view that it should try to reduce its dependence from the United States.
Budgets are skeptically related to this.
Someone in the German Parliament says that we have to create a German Google.
I can just close the eyes and slowly open them again...
“It's not a choice,” says Gasso Plattner, President of Germany's software provider for SAP business.
If there is a strong European IT industry need, it was not necessary to allow her to die over 20 years.
All are subsidied in Germany: carbon from cars to farmers.
All except the IT industry.
However, there was a shock for some companies who had previously thought that the largest risk of closer risk represents China.
The greatest encouraging is in areas technologies where European companies have better understanded that the data scheduled in the United States are in the same jurisprudence and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to the research carried out by the Cloud Security Association, some 10 per cent of its non-American participants refused to use services in the U.S. area provider after the shipping of the American intellectual analysis of Prism.
Jim Sneeb, one of the SAP executive directors, said: "We see the consumers take a new question that has not occurred a year ago, namely: where my data are stored and can you ensure that they are physically staying in this law."
Many German leaders claim that the latest communications are only a confirmion of what they have already known: the powerful States want to steal their most precious secrets, and therefore these data should be protected by any value.
What happens to an economic spionship is unexpectedly.
He always had a place.
“ This was the subject of the discussion of many years and not significantly changed in the current field,” says Kurt Block, head of the BASF Chemical Company.
Americans are spotting for us at the commercial and industrial level, and we are also spy for them, because this includes our national interests to protect our commercial undertakings.
The leaders of corporations usually do not like to respect the subjects of their responsible measures, as it may provide the advantage of the opposite.
In major companies, there has been many reasons that to take a free fleet for the expense or leave a taxi without awaiting the hotel number, at least unrespectably.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Director of the Audi Automobile Company, said that this standard practice has been to collect mobile phones before the government meetings so that they could not be used as a listening device for many years.
The Federal Constitutional Protection Service recommends that company leaders consider the use of simple mobile phones during the travels in the road because of the vulnerability of phones.
Subsequently, the mobile phones are elected.
However, there are fears that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable for explosions and trails.
In Germany, many of these companies are world market leaders in their specific low.
The BfV report warns: “The small and medium-sized enterprises often have no experience, staff and financial resources to protect effectively the corporate secrets from an unauthorised access.”
U.S. warn their own economic spy companies from other countries.
The United States National Intelligence Insurance In February, France, together with Russia and Israel, was in the second series of offenders who are chairmanship for economic intelligence after China, argued The Washington Post.
The member of the Board of Directors of the prestigious German company confirmed that when it was talking about the economic spy, “Francis is worse to all”.
Bernard Scarsiny, former director of the French Internal Intelligence Agency, stated in DCRI in this month: “The services are well known that all countries, even when they cooperate in combating terrorism, are spotted for their associators.”
Parents from Georgia who died in “unfortunate case” believe that their son was killed
Mothers of Georgia, whose body was found in the sporting mood in the middle of his school, believed that their son was killed, claimed the lawyers of the family on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from the city of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on 11 January in a vertical standing mother behind the courts in his medium school room.
The following sheriffs in Loundez were concluded that Johnson died in tragic cases, but the family of 17-year-old adolescent adolescents stopped it.
“ They are absolutely sure that their sons were killed, ” said FoxNews.com Benjamin Cramp, lawyer representing Kennet and Jacqlin Johnson.
They never believed he died as sheriff says.
“ They believe that this is contrary to logic, physical laws, and well-being,” said Kramp.
They believe that it is the cover for the protection of humans or persons responsible for the death of their son.
“ They sent her son to school with a school bag, and they returned to the body, ” he said.
The American lawyer Michael Mur said on Friday that he conducted a official investigation of Johnson's death, noted that a number of key issues remained without answer.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death resulted in crime?
Mur made a statement to the press conference on Friday.
I'm going to study all the facts where they're brought.
My goal is to know the truth.
“I hold the view that there are sufficient foundations” for official investigation, said he.
Mur told the reporters that the primary hiding showed that Johnson died as a result of the “position asylum”.
However, the second hidden, according to Mura, showed another cause of death.
“ There are some questions that should be allowed or detailed,” he said.
Mur added that if he finds enough authority to require a criminal or civilian investigation of Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the Sheriff Circle Loundez was not available for comments when he was requested on Friday.
The Court of South Georgia in the midst requested the authorities to publish all video records of monitoring cameras that were monitored by the investigators.
Youth parents said they hope that video records have a key to think about how he died.

Diseases control and prevention centres have made recommendations for schools relating to child alergia
The list of recommendations for the control of food allergics in schools has been published in the Mediterranean Control and Protection Centres.
This is the first list of recommendations issued by the United States, while the number of children of school age suffering from food allergies grows.
Now one of the 20 children in the United States has food allergy.
The monitoring and prevention centres revealed that the dissemination of food allergy among children has increased from 1997 to 2007 by 18 per cent.
The Directorate-General provides information on how to improve the knowledge of the providers and providers of food allergies in children and how to assist in allergy reactions.
It also recommends that schools keep adrenaline stocks — mostly for injections are used to provide an automatical EpiPen physics for potentially death analysis.
Legislative authorities have recently changed in the regulation to enable schools to make customs with less difficulties.
Notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children with allergical reactions.
Children may say: "That feelings like something you're in my language", "I have a hair in my language" or "shirt slipper".
Intersectoral children parents may choose “indefinite gender”
Germany became the first European country, who recognized the third part of children born by interim sex bodies.
The newborn will not be required to accept a man or woman's gender.
The new law does not require parents to call any of these children, allowing parents to specify as “indefinite” or “uninstalled” in their birth testimony.
The goal of the law was to remove pressures from parents that could take slow decisions on the transmission of the newborn gender, and to oppose discrimination against intersectional people.
A intersectional man, according to BBC, said many years later, "I'm not a man and not a woman."
I'm still a doctor with blue and shoes.
Often one of the two thousand children who are birthing annually is not a boy or a girl.
They have intersectionality, one of about 60 pathological situations that are under the diagnosis “Defects of Gender Development” — a collective term for people with typical chromosomes, gonades (sheets or seminars) or unexpectedly developed by armed sex organs.
Wellis Simpson may have been an intersectional.
Generic identification is still insufficient, but most experts in the United States say that, if the age cannot be determined, better use of all information and bring it up than waiting and monitoring psychological and physical development of the child before operations.
The New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Drecher, who specializes gender identification issues, said that the new German law “is a good idea.”
Inter-Sexual children are creating the ethical dilemma.
“ Some have threatening life of violations that require operational involvement, but most of them are not, ” he said.
You can switch off without operation and then see how the personality is developed.
The teaching of a child ' s gender identity is not too accurate.
Nobody can answer the questions why this happens.
It's like a note of why people are homosexual.
The report sent to the European Commission in 2011 describes intersectional persons as different from trans-Sexual or Transgenders, since their status is not relative to the genital, but to their biological construction, which is not exclusively a man or a woman's gender, and typically not for both the same time or for one of them.
These features may be shown in secondary geographical signs such as muscle mass, shaped hair, grain and bodying; primary sex signs such as reproductive organs and genitality, or the structure of chromosome and hormones.
The report also provides a general presentation of discrimination with intersectional and trans-general persons in the field of employment, as well as on the level of prejudiciary, cruelness and crimes.
The boys with gender abuse now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adults to make a man, woman or third gender in their official documents.
In June, the 52-year-old resident of Australia, Norrie May-Walby, became the first person in the world acknowledged “bespot”, was the right to maintain the “indefinite” police status throughout the life.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, German passports will be used the third marking in addition to M and F to X, namely intersectional.
In the neighbouring of France, gender issues still have an opposition in accordance with the newsletter of France 24.
In 2011, decades of French lawyers, which were expressed by the Catholic country, signed the complaint of the “general theorie” from school students.
The American Catholic Online website also expressed an inconvenience with the German law, wrote that “the situation in which the world is involved in the new situation where the object of the election is, and the sexual activity is not, we have another two pillars of civilization”.
A mother of the newborn child from Maryland also reported the baby zone website that she would like to be installed at birthday.
“Beating a child is sufficiently hard and without additional limitations, especially if you don't know about your child,” she said the website for parents.
Children need stability and confidence.
The historical children born with men and women’s gender bodies called hermafrodotes, named the beautiful Greek god that had the signs of both genders.
And only ten years ago, the medical community has received Gender as a letter to which it can stand, and then write again.
But now many have the ethical basis for surgery, known that gender identity is complicated, and the doctor sometimes does a wrong choice, not knowing how a child will take her dedicated gender when he grows.
“In the midst of the XX century, it was called “unnecessary psychiatric case”,” said Dresher.
When they were born, you didn’t call a psychiater — you called surgery.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with interim genetics was proposed by Dr. John Many from the University of Johns Hopkins, who thought that the genitor was easy to change.
He introduced the term “general identity” and argued that the environment signals, including social, as parents grow children, are interacting with the genes and hormones of the child, determined whether a person would be considered a man or a woman.
But in one case, in 1966, his theory was questioned.
He recommended that the boy whose penis was damaged during the unburned circle, completely covered the child, removed his bones, and growed as a girl.
“ Mayi presented cases as a successful example of transition, but it was not true, ” said Dresher.
When a boy was about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married to a woman.
But in 38 years, he made self-domicide.
Drecher said that some doctors are still “applicating this model. ”
However, in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, people who survived these gender changes declared themselves “unpleasant results”.
This was also the case of Jim Bruce, 36-year-old writer of Montana, who was born with male XY, but a genetic type of interim.
The doctor could not exactly determine whether he had a great clitori or a small penis, and were convinced that he could never be able to live in a man 'complete life'.
Thus, soon after his birth, in 1976, the external gender and the bronze of Bruce were deleted, and he was raised as a girl.
He began to give women’s hormones aged 12.
“I knew I was not a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unfortunately, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
He was appointed in 18 years of vaginoplastics.
But it was depressed and understood that something was wrong, he needed medical documentation.
What he learned was horrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and nobody told me about this.
Bruce was born in violation of gender development, which did not allow him to produce sufficient testing for normal development.
When he learned the truth, he became a man again, receiving the skin of the testisteron and removed his snake.
Operation made him unbelievable.
Today, he speaks to protect others from the Interface Project, trying to make people intersectional.
However, Ann Tamar-Matetis, Executive Director of the Califore Legal Association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law “assums the smuggle and the smells”.
" Many activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to make a decision to make a child a decision slowly, and to give a child a “indefinite gender”," she said.
We're afraid that he's going to help involvement.
We think it's better to get a man or a woman's fellow, and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law would be understood, so what we can do is building the proposals.
Tamar-Matetis said that its organization supports Australian law because “there allows adults to make choices for third-party”.
“ adults should have the opportunity to take their own decisions on formal sex,” she says.
The German law underscored its dedication at birth.
This is a conviction in which small children should not take place at this stage.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions on their own body.
But Dr. Arlin Baratz, a mother-rentgenologist from Pittsburgh, who has daughters with sexual violations and who helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that the German law “submits” both parents and children.
The daughter of Baraz, Katy, was born with husbands' chromosomes, but she has a violation of sexual development, named “the syndrome of full inconsciousness to androgen”.
As her advertising receptors are incorrectly working, Katie has developed women ' s signs.
She has authority, but there's no legs and birds.
Now, a 29-year-old, Katy is married and is a child psychiatrist at the Pennsylvania University.
Despite the unfaithfulness of it, she hopes to be a parents by introducing or to be a heavy sweet material.
“Zakon gives time to parents to not take a successful decision itself, ” said Baraz.
It gives them time to make any analysis and to consider in the situation, as well as the interim time before they write “wives” or “wives”.
In that case, you are fine — growing a child, loved by a child.
You have a wonderful child, and you feel joyful.
We don't need to do a operation that is unexpected.
“ This allows children to participate in decisions and to eliminate the concern that moves their parents because they do not feel right, ” she says.
At the end of the time, a child decides to be more comfortable with her or her — and it is wonderful.
This allows children to make decisions self-determined.
"Chicago" calls Nichola Habibulin: He understands the need to play better.
According to the 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work on training.
At the last two meetings, Habbibulin left six chairs from Tampa-Bay, and then four of the Ottawa, which was replaced in the second game after the fourth shirt.
We have to play well, and in the last two games, I couldn't get it -- brings the CSNChicago words Habbibulin.
- I need to find a reliability in training, probably to go to them as a game, and to try to get the best result.
You have to study your last games and work on the shortcomings that were.
There's a few small components that I have to improve, but at the training I feel very good.
But for some reason, after a few heads, it's all turning into a dark coma.
Maybe I need a little relax.
I don't think that I'm just one - always trying to make a perfect game.
If I lose four, five, six, I'm not in a shock.
I don't care what happens before my doors.
I'm still working on myself to not miss such a shirt.
Goodly, my colleagues support, but in principle, it's just that I have to play better.
Two games are not the whole season, but I wanted to make them better.
But what happened.
I have to put it on the side.
I'll just try to play the next shop better.

Medvej estimates that SSJ-100 aircraft will be placed in Europe
Russia considers that, after the late America and Asia markets, Superject 100 planes will also be placed in Europe.
"We consider that, in the general complexity, we will receive such agreements more than 170 aircraft exemplary", means "Interfax" of Russian Prime Minister, Dmitri Medveveveva, which was discussed at the press conference with the President of France Jean-Marko Eiro.
The head of the Russian Government noted that with French colleagues a serious cooperation was made, since it was a joint project.
We have discussed some financial issues related to insurance today, but we hope that after this aircraft will strengthen the markets of Latin America and Asian and the Pacific region, he will also set our partners in Europe.
"I hope he will ever be put in France," emphasized the Russian prince.
SSJ-100 is a flight built by the Suhjo Civil Aircraft company in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
The rayer is developed on the basis of modern technologies and proposes high quality standards and comfort for 100 passenger places.
The Day Professional Energy began a unique rescue program...
In the elderly to reach the hall of the astrology, the villages on a high table set a route from the television, and the heavy nest standed well on it.
Such special oppositions have not already been seen for a long time, so the assists have loved the electronic lines of warning, and the flows of winds are shocked on the direction, with which the assist dragon is reliable.
The grandmother Anja, whose house is in the town of the Petrick area, has been twenty - twenty years ago, has noted how the nest is sit, despite all the efforts of his people.
The birds have a new wheel over the top, and the lower shield is slow, and it's moving.
Of course, the painful family of actors who were sneaking every year in the shore was shocked and sentenced by three-four birds, but they did not want to remain without light.
Only the birds in the warm land, the grandmother Annie called at the King’s REX, who belongs to the opposition.
And I didn't even hope that there was so fast reacting.
When our specialists came to Ivanaki, they surprised that the nest was still holding, - told the technical director of the DTEC "Dneproproliferergo" Sergey Belizeki.
In fact, the driving in the nest, 150 to 200 kilometres, began corrosion.
At any time, birds could die from electricity.
Indeed, local people were risked to stay without light because of the damage.
Thus, line monsters have started a nest saving operation that has not been the first time in our practice.
We have helped scientists from the Dnepropetro National University who have developed a nest transfer scheme.
They trained the district network staff.
The famous day ornithologist Alexander Pomaarrenko consulted energy at all stages of the nest reconstruction.
For the beginning, it was noted that there were more than 50 asylums in the situation of accident.
For their reconstruction, special metal platforms were covered for the throne.
It was basically shooted with glass, and then they moved the old nest there.
According to the findings, it is enough to put old flowers as a basis for the birds to learn the nest and return to it.
The assists have already built their apartment.
The first nest was rebuilt in the village of New York City for a month ago.
A new iron - heavy column was placed with an electropod and was placed on it with a older, already habituated nest.
The whole operation was covered by energy in nine thousand grivens.

How did the Russian Marsh-2012 pass?
In 2012, the nationalists took a seed from the Yakiman Beach to the Headquarter of the Arts House, where the Mitting was held.
The organizations estimated the number of participants in 20 thousands.
Message: Obama's predicted headquarter considered the exception of Bayden for Hillary Clinton
The New York Times reported that the next advisers of President Barack Obama had considered the possibility of the replacement of Vice-President Joe Bayden's candidate by Hilary Clinton in the 2012 election list.
This opening is the most clear senation of all the books expected by Mark Galperin and John Hayleman on the 2012 campaign "States were doubled: the game has changed in 2012".
The Times issued an exemplary prepared for the exit and reported on Tuesday nights that the closest assistants of the President had conducted “the mass research in the focus groups and the surveys of the public opinion at the end of 2011” to assess whether the Baiden could help to re-elect the hopes of Obama's re-electing.
According to the report of the political advisor The Times Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed description of the attempt of high-employed officers of the predicted stage and the White House, namely the former head of the White House Administration Bill Dale, to evaluate the effects of the appointment of an ex-president of Clinton.
The possible replacement was a secret, carefully protected in the Chicag Prevention Headquarters and in the Official Office.
Only six closest advisers of the President, including Daley, former head of the Ombudsman ' s predicted stage of Obama Jim Messina and the former bigger advisers of the White House David Axelrod and David Pluff, knew that the replacement was considered.
The "Stavki" book claims that Daley was an initiative to replace Bayden, despite their "persistent personal relationships", but finally rejected the step when their data showed that the addition of Clinton to the election list would not be "reasonable to the Obama's possibilities".
In the interview with Martin Daley, the Administration realized the possibility of the replacement of Bayden Clinton.
“ I expressed actively the consideration of many things, and it was one of them, ” said the newspaper.
You should remember that at that time the President was in a terrible form, so we thought, "God, what are we doing?"
Although Daley was able to investigate as a “needful check”, Martin told the representative of CNN Anderson Cooper that the predicted stage was sufficient to investigate whether this stage would lead to the vote.
“Medium-selected offices do not cost such amounts for research and focusing groups if they do not consider anything,” said Martin in the AC 360 programme.
But it was not clear that Obama knew that his team had studied the replacement opportunities.
Martin told the CNN that he asked Daley whether he knew his boss about the possible transfer.
Although Daley said he did not think that the President “is in knowledge” could be replaced, the former head of the Administration acknowledged that Obama knew.
Martin added that “Stavkeys are double” did not provide a clear answer to the question whether the results of the political census to the Obama table had been achieved.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously believed that Obama did not know about the possibility of deleting Bayden from the election list.
“ Maybe, ” said Martin.
Do you want a lighter in the darkness of the sea?
The British entrepreneur created the world's first light in the dark marine with the media.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent features of the sea animal to develop light food.
He came to this idea, read a scientific article on media, and convinced the scientists in China to restore the light whites.
The skin is in response to the language of the man who eats it, increased the pH level in the skin and makes it light.
Chris says that since the marine begins to light when it reacts to warm route, it means that more you're lighting, so it becomes soft.
Charlie, the founder of the marine production company "Lisin' me, I'm sweet," says, "This is an incredible thing, but still in the first stage, if you're talking about the production, so you'll get about 2 g of the substance."
The Belock we use in the marine is reacting with your language at the neutral pH.
So when your mouth smells whites, it increases the pH level and the marine starts to light.
We tested him in the past few months, and it seemed to be perfectly present to Hellon, because it creates such a wonderful effect.
This may be the most precious marine of what I did, because the admination of the meau is four times the gold road.
So every shirt's like me for about 140 £.
It's so nice to smile.
The experimental company of Charlie, located in Bristol, was represented by its non-profit shoes, including bird, sweet, sweat, and sweat of sodium gold.
But his next creation should be more ambitious.
He said, "I want to develop an invisible marine."
This is impossible to define because of the cutting of ice crystals, from which it is marine, but I think we're gonna find a way to do it.

It's very good.
Did these errors have been taught in preparing the game today?
We're with the guys, we're talking closely after the game, preparing for a new counterparty.
The main thing is to do the installation.
Everyone saw the first time of the match against the Metallurga.
The game mission was performed, and the account was 2:0.

Russian forces do not know anything about the 'Brat Circle' group - New Publications
This writes INTERFAX.RU with the reference to the information source in the law enforcement bodies.
" As the media reported about the introduction of the United States Finance Ministry of Leps in the control lists of suspicion in belonging to the European British Criminal Syndicate, we have considered all the databases but did not find such groups, " said the Countries of the Agency.
It believes that the dissemination of this information would contribute to the support of the Russian mafia, which is likely to operate in the runway.
As previously written, the United States Finance Ministry has published on the list of members of the "Brat Circle" members on their website.
Among them were called the Russian slaughter of Gregory Leps.
He's fixing into the list as "Grisha" and put it on the channel.

Besides Leps, there's another five men mentioned.
Two Russians, Israelian citizens, Usbekistan citizens and another exile from the former USSR whose citizenship has not been indicated.

He came to help, and we confirmed the doctor's speed.
Then he switched two of them and flyed to the field.
He fled from the edge of the East and South Court to the edge of the Eastern and Northern Court.
He passed through the whole field.
This answers the storms.
Before the introduction of the Sport Act, this area of the sports action - the police may not be involved in the field.

And at that time the disorder was started at the Eastern Tribunal and on the flights," said the head of the CDC.

Fire teams were called for the saving of the lost shooting shooting, which stripped 50 feet above the earth to a dangerous invasion in the carriage
Cocker-Spanel Ruby escaped after a small DTD
After three days she was in the carriage, he noticed the man who runs a dog.
Fire fires were cut down on a shift circle to save a dog from the unminished loss
There was still an effort to save after the fire teams were called to put it up and put it in a safe place after he was somewhat shocked up at 50 feet (50 feet) to a dangerous circle.
The twenty-eighth-spain of Ruby fled after the car accident on Sunday, and took three days alone before the carriage was saved.
Her 25-year-old, Scott Alderson, and her 20-year-old friend Becky Hol, in the carrière of Fleepped in Denholm, west of New York, to join Ruby, and thank the rescue service of the Western Yorkshire.
They were freely searching for their lost dog and placed treatment on social network sites after she fled to the carriage after a small accident.
About 14:15 in the midst of the stroke dog, Ruby noted that the carriage was 50 feet (50 feet) higher.
The technical saving room with the fire station of Clexito has speeded up the location of the event, dropped down the legs to save Ruby, and used the transfer to upstair it upstairs.
The officer of the Savior Office Andy Clayton said, "He was in dangerous situation."
She was right in the middle of a circle — 50 feet (50 feet) to the top and to the earth.
She didn't move, nor moved muscles during saving, she was completely slow.
But now she's fine.
Then she was eating a peasant.
It was a very uncomfortable call.
The fact that the dog has noticed is unbelievable.
Peter Lau's Savior Officer said, "Robby was very happy that they saved her."
It was likely that she could get a very serious tragedy or worse.
Ruby was brought to the veterinary to review, and it was established that it was all right, except for insufficiency and rescue.
Mrs. Holl from Galilea, West New Yorkshire, said: “The savings were scared.”
I couldn't believe she was there.
It was wonderful when she was back in our hands.
Veterinary said that if she'd worry and lost conscience, she would probably lose.
The fires were great.
It was very courageous — what they did.
We are so grateful, and every one of them was absolutely grateful.
Mr. Alderson from China added: “We feared that she could get away, but she remained there”.
The fires were shocked.
I can't just believe she's there.
Mick Jagger said he didn't win with Kate Perry when she was 18 years old.
During an interview in the Australian Radioshop on this week, the post-star stated that it was a bipocalist for Jagger 2004 Old habits the hard.
Perry said he dinnered with a roerovener, and noted: “He spent with me when I was 18 years old.”
She added: "This was a long time, and he was very good."
In the statement on the fourth representative of the seventy-year-old Jager said that the “categoryly rejected that he had ever condemned Kate Perry”.
The representative added: "It may be that she travels with someone else."
Perry was among the artists who appeared as guests in the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new Prism album was on the first place this week.
George Kerevan: The breakdown of Europe gives the Skotlands a choice
Another day, another fear of independence.
This time we warn that the independent Skotland must join the general European free movement area as conditions for membership in the EU.
The passport control stories in Berbik and the border of the Adrian Way on the board.
Indeed, the Strathclyde newspaper indicated the possible economic benefits of more free movements in the rest of Europe, although, as we predict, it was not in the titles.
Nobody also indicated that the EU Member States have spent a lot of time to highlight their formal rules as they were appropriate.
As Skotland is now not in the Shanghai Zone, the continuation of non-observation requirements will be a delay for Brussels to replace what he really wanted from the Skotlands.
So it's not a delicate attention to the story.
And the old man that she turned into a channel: first I heard the "tonight" that "independence means passport control", at least 40 years ago.
However, there is a interesting moment lost when the old word was told.
Why should the independent Skotland perform the commandments of Europe?
Why to change London's ice to Brussels, especially now?
This is the European news: the great subsequent plan to join Europe has finally been implemented.
With the Eurocrisis project Europe, it is officially dead.
Among the European Union, the parties who speak against the EU or for the elimination of the euro as a single currency will take force.
Even in Germany, the Alternance for Germany, which was based only in this year, appeared from nearly five million votes from the Federal Elections of September, thus exhibited the Free Democracy (anony of our Liberal Democratics) from Budapest.
There was always an internal opposition to the Federal Europe Plan.
However, the current economic crisis has become unfair.
Measures of the Great Economy introduced by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and wages in national economies through the maintenance of a single currency have led to many people to think that the project “Europe” was too far.
The euro crisis was little related to the work of the national governments with excessive budget deficiencies, which was justified only for Greece.
Indeed, the Eurostat blocked its members at the common rates for German exporters, that German policies and desire to keep them.
Without the possibility of the national currency of South Europe, there is an unexpected condition of production in comparison with Germany.
The only savings are to reduce payments and public costs that are actively supported by Berlin.
The current budget and currency issues are the more deep problem of Europe's production capacity.
As a result of the integration of measures on green energy in Brussels, a crypt of which means subsidy of French and German energy companies by consumers, the European industry is twice more than electricity and four times more than in the United States than in the United States.
This is a paralysising worthy conditions, as we have seen in Grenjmuth.
None of the wages in the world will stop a devastating victory of the U.S. disadvantaged gas over the European oil industry.
This results from the burnt, especially in France, the most slightly EU side.
After the war, the French political elite considered the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris at one level with Washington.
But Berlin is no longer necessary for political legitimacy in Paris and has already linked its own economic policy in Europe, left the devastated economy of France in a poor situation.
The result is the right against the EU party of Marin Le Penn National Fund just winning additional elections by shutting the rule of socialists on the third place.
The “Front” is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the votes — the timely warning of the British Leachers that it is not possible to get out of the provision that is automatically discovered among the left.
What does Le Penn do with his newly open popularity among the French white work class?
It wants to use elections in the EU in the next year to establish a block in the European Parliament against the EU and against a single currency.
If, and that is very likely, the EU party will receive support for these elections, this block can first take the household position in the European Parliament.
This is my view: the rapid growth of the EU and the single currency in Europe are in a way to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but again will be a kind of “Europe (sovereign nations)” that liked General de Goll.
Germany and a few dependants from it may keep the euro, but France and South Europe will restore their own currencies.
I pretend that Britain is distanced from this project, hope to draw close to the United States.
However, the growing interest of Washington to the Pacific shows the possibility that Britain remains without attention to the Atlantic cold.
What situation does it leave Skotland?
We can choose to be a region (in fact) of small England.
Or we can protect our own economic interests, which means, besides otherwise, send Berlin and Brussels to the fucks.
I suspect that Skotland can be undertaken in the context of a more free European treaty, provided that we keep our currency.
Cooperation with other one-industrial countries will be more simpler in the informal Europe.
On the other hand, we should consider the possibility of repeating the experience of Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The Government of the Skotland National Party is, as a strange, the most successful political movement in Europe aimed at combating a heavy economy-measures in 2011 by reflecting the reduction of the costs proposed (and realized) by the Leiblist Chamber of Alister Darling and the impact of the coalition of the Tor and Liberal Democracy.
Skotland would now be able to vote on the independence only to take steps to the green economy involved in Berlin and Brussels.
Previous sex: Learning before
African and Latin American girls have generally reached a genuine strike before their white neighbors showed a study.
Physical changes do not mean that sexual abuse is close
No evidence that hormones or other chemicals are condemned
Experts believe that the epidemia of fermentation may be one of the early gender launching mechanisms
The tendence to the early seed is not expressed in the boys
An ex-president CNN Pat Etheridge is a journalist specialized on child health and family issues.
Should the mother be afraid if her daughter begins to form the start of milk iron and to increase the hair for 7 or 8 years?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatria on this week in Orlando, Florida, the child endocrinologist, Dr. Paul Caplavitts, explained that these early physical changes were very distributed among the American girls and represented a new standard.
“ I take a lot of time that my parents are calm, ” said Capevitz.
Evident development signs such as growing breasts, skins and smells of the body and smells are previously appeared in girls.
However, only a small change in the age of menarhee (first mention) was over the past four decades.
The average age in the United States was 12.5 years and was decreased in comparison with 12.75 in 1970.
“ As the grain begins to develop, at least two-third years before the menarhee,” said the author of the book The Recent Sexual Conspiration in the girls: how to address this broad problem.
The time is the most accurate verification of the progress of sexual suspicion.
The debate is that it is a real invasion of gender, but it is considered to be “immediate” when the increasement of the grain is significantly increased by growth to eight years.
In most cases, the process is delayed or stopped is that the pediator may monitor carefully.
More rapid progress can be a basis for analysis in endocrinologs to eliminate serious problems such as shocks or kits.
There are procedures to keep early mention and prevent another consequence: the premature age of bones that may eventually lead to a delay of growth and low growth in the age.
Recommendations on therapy are based on age of children, development levels, growth rates and emotiveness.
The psycho-social aspects are also important.
The publisher is concerned with the medicines but recognizes that “even to be able to reduce conductive problems and feelings of girls that are different from the birthday”.
Another big problem is that parents simply don't want to remember their very young daughters.
“ They are worried about the risk of pregnancy or even how they do with the hygien matters,” said Caplavitz.
“ That was a shock, ” remembers one woman whose daughter’s menstruction began in 10 years.
Although signs were and we spoke of mention, she was not emotively ready.
She came home from the school of fearful and distressed that she was the first among her friends.
There are many degraded theories about the causes of early sexual abuse.
Nevertheless, there is no evidence that hormones in milk or other food products, chemicals in the environment or sexual shipments in mass information.
The boys, as well as girls, have previously come to sexual condemnation.
The Chief claims that the preference that has the weight is the epidemia of fertilizing.
In 2001, he helped a study of girls from 6 to 9 years of age, which links the number of grains in the body to the deadlines of sex.
Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other factors.
In that country, African and Latin American girls are generally reaching gender race before their white neighbors.
There are various explanations.
In the whole world, the premature sexual conspiration, in the whole sense, affects everything: from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Another note: Although the child’s hair appears in a younger age, tendency to full early sex is not expressed as girls.
Other doctors who participated in the AAP Conference have confirmed the complexity of this topic.
The demonstration of smell and smell hair is seen in even young people and children of a clear age.
“ We must be careful about how we determine the true invasion of gender rabbit, ” said Dr. Lourens Silverman, child endocrinologist in the Holivet Hospital in the state of New Jersey.
Parents should not be able to receive instructions from the pediator about how to speak with their child.
“ This may mean more early than it was expected, ” explained Capevitz.
If you keep calm, your child usually reacts well.
The girls who grow early must be confirmed that even when this happens before, this process is a normal part of life.
Readered in the United States Boeing is ready to get out
The aircraft carried out under the Open Neighbour Treaty on Russia's Territory, which was in the medium of the unplanned aircraft in Chita, on Friday, 1 November, at 8:30 to the Moscow time, will leave the air guest of the city.
The airport’s conduct has been authorized by the ship ships, receiving the shipment for the fuel.
As noted in the airport, the flight is going to Ulan Wood.
On the other hand, he's going to the United States.
As reported, the flight flight in Ulan-Udde was landed in the Zabaykal area because of the tsunami.
It was not issued from Chita's airport because of the unpauted accounts.
30 persons, including equipage, two nights passed on the airport, reports ITAR-TASS.
As noted in the Middle East, under the conditions of the open sky Treaty, the aircraft ships have no right to go outside the Chita Airport, they may be able to control the border only in two Russian airports in Cuba and the Ulan Woode.
The open heaven contract was signed in 1992, 34 States participated in it.
The monitoring flows are carried out on the territorys of Russia, the United States, Canada, and Europe.

Reactive aircraft producers affect the seat width when large orders
Among the aircraft manufacturers, a devastate controverse of the width of the tourist class on further rays was launched by a ton to a terrible conflict on the Dubai aircraft in that month.
The shift is around the wide range of seats provided on further magic passengers of the class, whose interests are not always in the aircraft's attention centre, while the amount chosen for the space plays a key role in approving the effectiveness of recent aircrafts proposed by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
The airbus in this week called for the introduction of a sector standard that would provide the width of at least 18 dpi (46 cm) in the economic class halls, but its main American competition Boeing said that this should be resolved by the aviation competitor.
The difference is when aircraft producers are in the sales even more larger versions of their two motor vehicles and potential recursion orders are expected at the events of 17 to 21 November.
The company of the back of the aircraft, especially if 9 or 10 persons are sit in a series of statements on the economic efficiency of new “mini-aebouties” projects.
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will be 406 persons, from the economic classe of more than 17 dpi in the width of 10 in each series.
Airbus said that its competitive version A350 will be transported to the Economy of 350 persons on the seats of a width of 18 dpi, which is 9 in a series.
Only self-related guigans are often exchanged by technical attacks using the press advertising.
Now, Airbus is direct to the public before the aircraft in Dubai, where 777X will be leader of more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated how to start a new advertising war, showing the financists of the slaid that pictured three people in the restaurant who wanted each other to be called “Do you agree with this?”
“Boeing offers further magic fleet on seats more closer than regional carbovine flights,” said the director of Airbus John Liki.
With the rational change of food, people take weight, but the airlines have not been cardinally changed.
Between the beginning of the 1970s, the broadfood Boeing 747 has led to modern further trip standards, and the average American men's weight in the age of 40 to 49 years increased by 10 per cent, according to the United States Health Department.
The median American men in the 21th century is 39.7 dg, with statistical data for the United States health services.
Airbus claims that its competitor is holding the concept of the 1950s, when the median funding of those recently called “reactive publishing” was already.
Airbus said that the study showed that the additional thin in the seat is increased by 53 per cent of the sleep.
Boeing opposes airbus digits on seat size and says that producers should not be involved in decisioning how aircraft balances are found between taxes and goods.
In its words, the study shows that the goodness of the salon is not only depending on the seat width.
“Indeed, the aircrafts are providing to the election competitors and to do what they have to do in order to achieve success,” said the specialist Boeing on Canton Craver's sloves.
They don't want us to decide for them to bring them the profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
The question for passengers is to increase the space on the side, but it is often a factor that could affect the profits for the suppliers.
The controversial constraints of aircraft estimated at least $7,00 billion per catalogue price in the nearest decade are sufficient to change the percentage of American and European export.
As the first reported in July, the seat position is that the struggle between the new reactory aircrafts is undergone to the struggle of struggle.
The Airbus and Boeing declare that the 20 per cent of the profitability of one place in their last two-motor additional magic models compared to the market leader in this section, 365-center Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing's declared characteristics are partly based on the comparison of the 10-local rows of 777, with the original 9-local component of the constructional decision 77.
The earliest expenditure is reduced in comparison with a 10-local company currently used.
“Boeing's risk is to get more places and make his aircraft more competitive than our developments,” said Kevin Kennethon, head of the Airbus Traveller's Comforts Division in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that shoes with full 10-place lines for the existing 777 are indicated that many passengers prefer a fleshly shock that may go over the hand with lower taxes.
“The sydeny of a width eighth duke would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that the Airbus’s proposal was threatened by the 777th model,” said the specialist on Sloan Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing don't put a box, but they propose the supplier directory, from which the aircraft can choose.
Training aircrafts in peace even have a roll in order to check competitive planning.
By enhancing the comfort, all manufacturers also propose flights with a very fleshy company for the budgetary aircraft and regional shipments.
Airbus offers A350 with 10-style lines, but says she has not sold it yet.
Having recently, Airbus emphasized the need for additional channels to be modified, proposing a broader shipping place on some of its flights.
Without support of the only other large modern aircraft manufacturer, as the experts say, her calls to the new sector standard, not to fly, but may be highlighted from the sales trails of the 777X model.
New anti-nicotine vaccine may be removed from the smoking process of satisfaction
Scientists have developed an antinicotine vaccine that could avoid the smoking process of smoking.
One vaccine was able to protect the mouse from the nicotine dependence throughout the life.
There are further tests before the testing is needed for a few years, but Professor Ronald Cristal from the medical college Wayl Cornels in New York said that the first results were needed.
“We are very hoped that this vaccine application strategy may finally help millions of fuming who tried to get away, trying all methods today on the market, but have found that their nicotin dependence is sufficiently strong to survive it through these modern means,” said Professor Cornel.
New vaccine contains an improper virus that was developed to provide genetic information for the production of anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus is selectively infected by the pig cells that then begin to produce a stabil antitle flow.
Antilles survive any nicotine molecules in blood by neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker of nicotine attack.
In the tests of vaccinated muscles, which later gave nicotin, continued their normal activity.
And the muscles that weren't given in vaccine were "sneak", and this is the sign of Nikotin's income to their brain, says researchers.
These experiences are described in Science Translational Medicine magazine.
Previous taxi vaccines had failed because they had an anticorps.
To maintain the high level of antitle, the skins needed to do so often that they were worthy and non-operative.
But the value of the new vaccine would probably be much lower, because it converts the pig cells into the antitle factory.
Professor Cristal said that if the future human vaccine would be fully safe, it would be possible to give children before they wanted to try to smoke, prevent nicotin dependence.
But more likely she's going to be used by smokers to leave smoke.
“They will know that if they start to smoke again, they will not receive satisfaction from this because of the nicotine vaccine, and that may help them to be removed from this attraction,” he said.
The British scientists said that the results were interested, but warned that additional research needed.
Oilers: Third agriculture of the Submovies are completely available
The Vice-Guberman of the Sub-Subs Jury Olyner said that almost third-party rural settlements of Moscow are fully adherent to
The total allocation of the region ' s budget receives 187 populations from 288.
In 2013, 187 visits from 288 were received from the area budget.
A certain amount of expenditure income in the budget of 122 rural populations exceeds 50 per cent and 83 per cent.
The budget safeguard of the area budget is ordered to 25 billion rubbers,” said Olympic.
The Governing Vice-Gubernate also noted that only in three cities, the Middle, the One and Pushino budget income is more than 1 billion rule for 2013.
Income in agriculture in many regions is less than 3 million rubbers, "that is not enough".
The expenditure of the local administrative device in 88 submissions is over 70 per cent, " which is observed by the decline of service", stated Olympics.
He had previously appointed the heads of municipal education of the Sub-Subs until the end of November to consider what residences need to be sanctioned, associated to urban districts or changed by the administrative system.
These proposals will be made up to the end of January.
To that end, the Governor of Moscow stated that the Administrative Reform in the Submuseum plans to reduce the number of rural housing.
Also, in the Mojay, Kashshire, the Solar Bayer, the Colombian regions, the Luxembourg and the Cottericks, there are requests for municipalization.
The discussion of this issue in the cities and regions of the region begins in November.
The President of the Municipalities of Yugoslavia also said that it was planned for some 30 rural populations in 12 areas of the Subcovery.
This has been linked to the fact that from the 178 rural populations in the Subcommerce less than the third, the financial basis is acceptable and the 100-year-old.
Dean Arbenina replied Helloud with his children
Diana Arbenina does not cover what great joy it receives from the education of her children.
Despite what is now, Arbenina gives a lot of time to creativity and public activities, it is still the opportunity to return with Martha and Artem, which is not only time for their education but also to develop as possible.
In the last week, Diana was read two times before his worshipers about their pedagogical talents.
First she posted a photo to Facebook, which shows how she taught children to read.
And last night he had the fans showing how Artema and Martha had been employed on Helloud.
Our first halloween is ready to go on the legs, and he called Diana's photo of his children in the celebration costums.
What is irreversible, since they have no other Russian girls and girls in their relationship with this party because they were born in America.
Germany first in Europe introduces the "unspecified gender" in registration of children
Germany will become the first country in Europe, where children born by hermphrodites are authorized instead of men or women ' s "indetermined " .
Parents will have the right to leave the " poli" calendar in a witness to the birth of an unfulfilled.
Instead of "F" or "M" parents may record "X" (not specified).
This decision is aimed at not submitting parents to the speed of the field 'determination' operation.
According to statistics, one of the 2,000 newborns in the world is a hermphrode.
Thirds refused that the influence of Obed has been undermined
The former Minister of Labour of New South Wales, Joe Trimou, will be a figured investigation of the State's anti-corruption supervisory body.
The former Minister of New South Wales, Joe Trimoy, is checking the changes in the driving of premature objects on the request of his political employee, Eddie Obad, who was secretly owner of the duties in three objects of impairment in the State.
Independent commission against corruption (ICAC) extended its investigation of Mr. Obeid in a number of ministers of State for the proliferation of the Arrangements in Serkular Kii, where the family of Obads belonged to two restaurants and cafes, without having the departure of the Tendor after the expiration of their action in August 2005.
She now examines the approximation that Mr. Trimoy knew the secret participation of Mr. Obeid in unmovable objects, after the indication of the data of the former Vice-Chairman of the Administration, Mr. Trimou, Linn Ashpoul, on Friday.
During a few years of the discussions started in 2005, the Government urged the aircraft to make an open competitor.
The arbitrators were against this, and they also wanted more long terms of shipment.
In 2009, undertaking firms for Cercullar Ki, which had brought the Owed family $2.5 million per year, were extended without open competition.
Mr. Trichoy, Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, originally spoke for open competitions.
However, he refused that changes were made on request by Mr. Obeid, who, as Mr. Trihoy acknowledged, recommended to change the Government's army policy.
The reported ICC has been discussed in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Trifoy and Steve Dunn, an elderly official who came to the Ministry of Ports after the work of Mr. Obeid in the Fisheries Division.
“As a question discussed during the phone conversation, is the development of the commercial arden policy,” asked the assistant, Mr. Trichoy, Mr.
"No," said Mr. Trihoy.
I can't remember what it was discussed, but it's certainly not.
Of course not between me and Mr. Ode.
According to the high-employed official, Israeli military aircraft attack the goals in Syria
The High Officer in the Fox News interview confirmed that Israeli military aircrafts were attacked in the Syrian port of Latvia on Friday night.
The official didn't state that it was for the purpose, but he said, at least one.
The “Association Press” reports that the aim of Russian production SA-125 was to be missed.
At least two times ago in this year, Israel was insured by shipping aircrafts with missiles within Syria.
Foreign work on sub-class visibility may be tested at "justice"
The “loyality” test for foreign workers at Classe 457 is being reviewed by the Government, as it notes the expansion of repressive measures.
The test, in the case of its adoption, will be applied under criteria for preventing the use of the visa of class 477 to comply with unabled posts or as a layer for the movement of family and friends in Australia.
The document presented by the Government was published today, while the former Leборist Deputy Maxine McKu discovered the ritories of the Government on foreign workers, said that this could bother neighbors of Australia.
“Another explanation of the type of “Australians, at the end of the race” and “the work of the Australians” represents a very unpleasant disappearance when professionals needed the protected labour market,” she stated today at the Australian Institute of India.
Historically, this means that the white work was to protect - and if some in the region had seen the resignation of this historical art, I wouldn't be surprised.
The document presented in the discussion is 12 measures previously considered by the former Minister of Immigration by Kris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration of Brendan O'Connor, who was last night in Sri Lanke, where he meets official persons on the contract of people, has already made five of the recommended changes and the remainders are at the stage of consideration.
If “justice” criteria are adopted, the applicant may be investigated to obtain a visa in order to “exhibit the candidate when a candidate is a parent or a close owner or a person with a financing of undertakings.”
Employees may also need to be counted on the number of sub-class visa owners, as they had previously taken a small number of employees, then taking hundreds of workers.
Between the 35-year-old shri-lanke, who seeks as a refugee, was predictablely killed from the infant after the ships arrived with refugees on the island of Christmas on that week.
The murdered nine-year-old son of the man led him on the way to Australia, and from the time of his death, his father supported a two-year-old brother who was also on the board.
Australian authorities have successfully sent a man to the hospital of Christmas Island where he died.
The friend of Seman Warlamow said that okokist suffered by alcoholism
A friend of the okkinist Seman Varlamom of the Eugenia Waurinik said that he suffered by alcoholism is transmitted by the Russian News Service.
“He has no idea of how to stop drinking,” said, in particular, the woman.
Remember, the Bavarianic was sent to the court for the slaughter of the Russian Semen Varlamom, who is also a member of the Corrodo Club.
As she said, the okkinist shocked her for his hair, and also slaughtered - after the attack, the hands, the shoes, the beast and the shoes were damaged.
Barlamous himself came to the police of Denver and acknowledged the murder, describing the event.
He was arrested, but later he was set up at $5,000.
The court was not limited to sports in the country's movement, but made it prohibited to approach the Bavarianic.
He also threatens prison until six years of domestic violence.
The Government of the United Kingdom has announced a study aimed at improving the economic effects for Skotland from the project of the HS2 carriage.
Draft HS2 proposes the opening of a high-quality communication with Skotland and North England, with the beginning of the First Stap in 2026
The Minister of Transport of Baroness Cramer noted that the project “Combined Britain”.
The Minister of Transport of Skotlandia, Kit Brown, said that he was “in the shopping” of the planning work with the Government of Britain.
The first stage will be in the construction of a new high-encreased hydrocarbon line between London and West-Midlands.
When the second stage is closed, the lines will be implemented in Manchester and Lides.
In June, the Government reviewed the estimated value of the building of high-encreased line between London and North England from £32.7 to £42.6 billion.
The Government of the United Kingdom, which conducts negotiations with Scotland transport, has mandated HS2 Ltd to consider further improvement in the iron road capacity and reduce the duration of travels to Northern England and Skotland.
This should include the possibility of crossing the road from Glasgo and Edinburgh in London for three hours or less.
Baronese Cramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is to create a real national network that will make Britain and its city closer to each other.”
We're developing HS2 because the benefits that it brings are great.
Without him, we're going to face the crisis of passing capacity in our iron-related network.
However, it is also about the transport of cities; 18 cities, including Glasgo and Edinburg, will be better received by HS2.
Skotland Hospital Alister Carmachel added: “The most annual declaration is a good news for Skotlandia.”
On behalf of the Skotland Government, Mr. Karマイkla called for “unlikely” to support the integration of Skotlands in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: “The high-scale sea road has all the possibilities to bring great economic benefits in Scotia, but also adds the economic weight of Skotland to a general argument on the high-scale coal road throughout the United Kingdom.”
We therefore are pleased to work in partnership with the Government of the United Kingdom in order to consider the construction of high-scale iron roads in Scotia, the creation of benefits for all and the continued weight line of Glasgo, Edinburgh, which is already planned by the Skotland government.
I would like to wait to consider the results of the study with the British Ministers in the next year and to adopt a joint decision on the following steps.
Tori is a new hope of nuclear energy?
Governments worldwide continue to think about how to ensure energy needs.
The flow of hydrocarbons (which they are) is negatively affected by the climate.
Renewed energy sources require large ranges of generation.
A atomic energy is covered without any other, but remains the mass of the road in the identification of waste.
Recently, scientists focused on the third -- another radioactive element of the Mendelyev system.
He meets around the world, and, as specialists say, his discharge does not leave waste that must be saved for centuries.
Rules of use of electronic aircraft devices in Australia until it remains in force
The Australian aircraft passengers will also need to be deleted with their plans and phones during the flight and floor, despite measures in the United States on the relief of the device data.
The Federal Aviation Office of the United States allowed American transporters to change their procedures so that passengers could read electronic books, view or play on their devices during the flight and aircraft, provided that they would remain in the Field Ready.
The passengers can already do this during the main part of the fleet, but many disappoint that they do not have access to their electronic books during the flight and shipping.
Australian transporters consider this decision required by the American airlines to make a great number of work to comply with the new requirements, but have indicated that they are not planned to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Security Office also noted that they considered this statement, but stressed that the limitation of the use of electronic devices in the critical flight phases still worked in Australia.
“The security management of civil aircraft is currently not a special rules regulating the use of electronic aircrafts in the aircraft”, said it.
This issue is regulated by the rules required by the aircrafts to ensure security for any time and by passengers to comply with the security rules reporting them to escape members.
The Virgin company, who had already discussed with the Office of Civil Aviation Safety Flight Expansion on the shipping of its Wi-Fi system, was not against changes but said that it would follow the instructions of the regulator.
“We would be grateful to consider the Office of Civil Aviation Safety Question on the authorisation of the use of electronic devices, as we really think that it will improve the quality of customer services now when it (bottle free-floor system) is on our flights,” said the secretariat.
Qantas stated that the rules of procedure would be held at this time.
“ Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during the flight and flights, and in the nearest time we are not planning to change it,” she stated.
The FAO is distributed to American aircraft.
However, we are always interested in regulatory changes that would benefit passengers, and we will, of course, study the FAU decision and the reasons that it has taken.
For the United States transporters, the impact of the decision will vary from the aircraft to the aircraft and depend on the age of their aircraft.
Transporters should prove that their flights have sustainability to mobile devices, as well as to review support, training materials, handboard standards and passenger instructions.
“If the aircraft checks and confirms its fleet, it may allow passengers to use portable, light electronic devices such as planners, electronic books and spotphones at any height,” states FAU.
In several cases, the escape will give indications to passengers to disable their devices during the flight.
In addition, in accordance with the recommendations of the group, there must be more heavy devices under the seats or in high shoes during the flight and shipping.
The Dagystan's head hears the footnotes of extremism in Kuba
The smooth between Anji and Kubaanua has been in a political collision between the authorities of the Cross darkland and Daguestan after the Dutch Flag, and Mr. Kubani was shocked by the slaughter.
Head of Dagestan Ramazan Abdulatiff, on Friday, invited the Republicn parliamentars to go to the court, since Mrs. Crossnodar's land would call for an international discretion, in particular call for war with "basurmans".
Take the Hungary of the Cross dark, which has been approved in 1995.
It's the same shock, and no one does it.
"O you here, remembering the mother of the family, the enemy, the enemy, we are going to a dead battle, "a word to write to the jinn, to bring some of the believers to the other believers," expressed the solidarity of the Abdulative Chairman's parliament of Hizri Shishaid.
Putin's impunity for his friend Asad
Now, news from the ocean, namely from Syria, where we have known today, Israel has attacked the Russian production missiles that, in the message, called Hezbolle.
Today, Syria has fulfilled the important condition to destroy its production of chemical weapons until 1 November.
This was made within the framework of the Russian agreement and the envoyed United States not to perform a military operation to which they were shocked in the summer.
More details of the weapons and what all this means for the Syrian President will tell our chief international representative Richard Engel.
Washington stated that the Asad regime will be punished for this.
More than 1400 peaceful inhabitants, including hundreds of children, died in August from equivalent gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombs, but in the form of a treaty built by a friend Asad Vladimir Putin.
Syria is dismissed from its chemical weapons to the midst of the next year.
And today it's a important time.
The International Experts Group reported that Syria had issued the declared manufactures for chemical production.
The longer-term and harder task is the destruction of the tons of chemical weapons and components to it.
As we understand, it's about thousands of tons.
Younglington told me that the days of Asad were shocked.
I think Assad's got to go.
The question is not whether this happens, but when it happens.
He's not a lithium anymore and he's got to go.
But Asad remains.
And it feels more secure.
His troops continue to use artilleries, missiles and shocks.
His opposers are displaced and badly armed.
His people are forced to leave their homes, and many are hungry.
Some need to take care of skins and skins.
Many believe that Bashar Assad has avoided punishment for massive murder.
Chemical weapons agreements are the success of diplomacy, the inspectors condemned the Nobel World Prize, and Asad also made the impression of man who was ready to cooperate.
Today, in Washington, the United States Ambassador in Syria had to answer unfair questions.
When a child dies from hunger, his mother is not easier than killing it with chemical weapons.
Assad's still holding.
And weapons change to power.

In Singapore's owners are good, while the medium class is difficult
In the hamburger in the Benemir Trade Center in Singapore Janani Amortharing, the golden bracelet, the shooting and the serums, to pay the school education of her daughter.
“My husband and I have just purchased the house, so all my money are involved there,” says Mrs. Amorthalynga.
Although it has $3,000 ($2400) per month as a administrator and her husband works, the monthly income of the family is not enough, she says.
Indeed, the question of the various parts of South-East Asia, where household debt grows, is that the valueMax, where it carries its business, became a third band registered at the Singapore Fund.
It is not just a fast way to get money ($1300 for Mrs. Amorthalynga), but also almost as much as uncertain bank credits.
In Singapore, hamburgers generally account for the effective annual rate of 17 per cent — more than 15.4 per cent proposed in the United Overseas Bank Office, local creditor with the branch in the same trade center.
However, lombards have the advantage that they do not require creditability checking or payment evidence and can provide credits faster than banks.
Thus, millions of people in the whole region are in the hamburgers because families feel the pressure of increased the value of life and rapid growth of household debt and consumers.
After five years of sustainable growth in the world financial crisis, and deficit credits undertaken by free monetary and environmental policy in developing economy, families with low and medium-sized income are in place to compensate the reducing of income while the growth of their economies is reduced.
In this week, Standard & Poor's, the Rating Agency, has indicated the increase in the family credit headquarters, mainly due to the growth of epothetics, as a risk factor for the creditability of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest rate of household debt to the monetary internal product in Asia.
Malaisia made this list from 80 per cent from UNHCR compared to 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned at the high-level of consumer debt in Thailand, which was out of the technical recession in that week.
In the fourth meeting, the continued export reduction and the weakness of the consumer demand were shown.
“In fact, with the increased price of people in the average and lower parts [income], they will search for ways to fill their income where they can only be able,” says Seng Seung Won, CIMB economicist, the Malaysian bank.
In the past two years, high gold prices have increased the slowness of the people's own personal things, since they use the possibility of obtaining money for their family decrease.
In Singapore about 70 per cent of the substances consigned in 200 swimming pounds of the city of State are golden items.
People say: “The price of gold looks good, let us put the golden cup of grandfathers and get it back in the next month. ”
In Thailand, EasyMoney's largest operator observed the increase in the number of customers using its offices in the past months to 20 per cent.
The growth in the low-based business is that valueMax, the operator of the Bethel Division and 15 other in Singapore, is planned to expand not only in the neighbourhood of Malaysia, where he has four shops, but also in the borders of Asia, he says, the Executive Director of ValueMax.
The company will finance the expansion using 60 per cent of S$66 million, as a result of the location of Singapore funds.
While some creditors call for fire critical because of high-percentage rates, Ms. Jaah said that lonbard is not only proposing more lower taxes than other creditors, it does not also increase the debt directly.
“A clients have the objects they have already owned, and the monetation of individual assets does not increase the debt of households,” she says.
The scheme is an increased public recognition as a means of receiving short-term financing.
This is not only the categories of people who are in a serious financial situation.
Both people in Singapore are also using the ValuesMax offices with gold rings or Rolex hours, which may give up to 60 per cent of their purchase value.
We're seeing customers from all parts of society.
“They include state persons who need to take money for commercial projects or investments, or undertaking a small business that is necessary to overcome temporary money difficulties,” says Ms. Yah.
Sometimes they just need money very fast.

Saving package of $325 million for health in Tajikistan
The Federal Government states that the savings package of $325 million will be supplemented by a weak health system that ensures that the Government of the State does not cost the cost of the State.
The Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plybersk, declared that the Society takes “urgent measures” to prevent the older crisis caused by the people of this island, the higher chronic disease and the limitations of the system.
The financing decision was adopted for four years after Government consultations with the independent Deputy Tasmania Andrew Wilki.
“The relationship has proposed a package of extreme salvation measures which we believe will solve specific problems faced by the state,” said today Mrs. Plybersex.
The pack of $325 million includes $31 million for planning operations.
Another 2600 operations, including ortodotic and cataractic disposal operations, will help to continue departure.
There are also money for the clinics that are ill without pre-reporting records, in Hobart and London, to improve the quality of departure after the station, training of medical experts, psychological health services and the introduction of personal electronic cards in local hospitals.
“ These investments will go to the explanatory doctors of the idea how to help Tasmanian health systems,” said Ms. Plybersex.
The Minister said that the Government of Tajikistan would work in a strict reporting and responsibilities regime.
The State will be required to support the current financing levels to receive money from the Society and to take account of the funds that will cost these additional resources monthly.
The Commission of three persons will be established to ensure that the State provides services as effective and effective.
Mr. Wilki said today that $325 million would not be resolved, “if the real reform will be followed to the Tajik health system on a more sustainable basis”.
However, he endorsed the Government for the answer to his request for urgent assistance to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
“I hope that the federal assistance package will contribute significantly to the outcome of the health system from the state of critical state,” said Mr. Wilson.
According to the Government of the State, these additional election procedures significantly compensate recent reductions.
But the Federal Opposition Representative for Health Peter Datton believes that today's statement is “the decision of the same laptop.”
“The risk we are here is that the Leabolist Government has cut $430 million from health systems,” he said the ABC TV committee.
When the State government decreases almost half billion dollars and the Commonwealth contributes to 300 million, it is not possible to make good news.
Mr. Datton requested Mrs. Plybersex to ensure that no dollar from the saving package will be paid to an additional bureaucracy.
The screening of Geim Nikla Romana Danny Didro may be able to shut up with the exceptional decree and historic details, but it is also more seriously recognised than it should be.
The film, conducted in France in the 1760s, tells the wedding history of Susan, a young aristocratic sent to the monster of his family.
When she begins to boot, she experiences the extreme cruelity from the hands of the sadisty-auditor and becomes an object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film never goes to post or sense — and the whole problem is.
Because of its serious tragicity, the event is a risk of being tested as a slaughter and for audience.
Syria has destroyed its resources for chemical weapons, said the observer group
Syria has destroyed the main equipment for the production of chemical weapons and bombs with equivalent gas, declared in the fourth of the international observer group, while the pestilences were shocked in the northern country near one of the objects where they believe that toxic substances are stored.
The Syrian activist group also stated that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of civil war in the country almost three years ago.
The statement of the Organization on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before
The extreme deadline of 1 November established by this organization in Hague for the destruction of Damaskus or ‘incapacity’ of all means of production of chemical weapons and mechanisms that enable chemicals to reduce and comply with other gass.
Confirming that it is the primary stage of destruction, the important era in an ambitious graph that aims to destroy all chemical weapons of Damascus in the midst of 2014.
The destruction of the equipment means that Syria cannot produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus should still start the destruction of existing weapons and stocks.
The country, as they think, has some 1000 tons of chemical materials and weapons, including heat gas and nervous gas.
This statement was made during the terrible battles in the city of Safira, where, in the view of experts, the chemical weapons production objects, as well as its safeguard, reports the basement of the Syrian Centre for Human Rights.
The active group, which monitored the losses through the network of activists in Syria, stated on Thursday that 120.296 people died.
From that number, as stated, 61 067 are civilians, including 6365 children.
From the Government, he stated that 29,954 men were members of the armed forces of the President of Bashar Assad, 18,678 were the prosecutors and 187 Libanonian fighters.
Even among the dead, as stated in the statement, were 2202 armies and about 5375 opposition fighters, many of them were foreigners.
According to the UN assessment of 25 July, 1000,000 died in conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this number has not been updated.
The conflict slaughtered about 2 million people to run out of the country.
Asaida had been fighting in Safire a few weeks, many of whom are linked to the Al-Qaida groups.
The Centre stated that the victims of both parties were on Thursday, but did not bring specific data.
Boys emphasized the dangers faced by the chemical weapons inspectors filled with the deadlines of their mission for the release of Syria from the Toxic Army, in the disappearance of the continued civil war.
In the Declaration of the OSC, which works closely with the United Nations, it states that its team was “here satisfied with the verification and view of all the declared Syrians critically important production and equipment for interacting/contracting.”
She added that “no further inspection activities are currently planned”.
The inspectors said that they had completed the first round of checking work, visiting 21 of the 23 objects stated in Damai.
They couldn't visit two places from the security meetings, they said inspectors.
In Friday, the OHCHR stated that both places were moved in other declared places that were checked by Syria.
It could not immediately find whether there was one of the two places that OHCH inspectors had not been able to visit.
Syria presented a full plan for the destruction of its chemical weapons, which should be approved in the next month by the Executive Committee of the OHCHR.
“I welcome the courage and engaging you all have demonstrated in the implementation of the most complex mission that has ever been taken by this organization,” said the Director-General of the observer group Ahmet Wuzimj in the comments published by the OHCH.
Since the third year of civil war, the Muslim Sunnites, with the Government of Asad and its security forces, which are members of his alibi sect, is the response of the Chile Islam.
As regards other events, the Head of the Rami Abdulakhrman centre said that it was a strong explosion on the EMS object in the coastal province of Syria.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Anger because of the condemnation of the terrorists in Bali
The remaining 202 victims of the bombs in Bali, in 2002, had been angryly reacted to the last conspirators who had been sentenced before the court and said that Urmar Pattex had to be shot.
Patete, who spent nearly 10 years of fleet as one of the most discovered people in South-East Asia, was sentenced last 20 years of freedom for his role in establishing explosive devices used during therapy.
It may be released for 15 years if it is obtained for a timely release.
The 45-year-old convicted was recognized in massive murders because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and still were arrested.
He was also acknowledged by a number of other terrorism accused, including in the drought of church explosions throughout Indonesia in Christmas Canyon in 2000.
The prosecutors needed a deadly period, although they could like to claim that a person called “subjector” for their reputation to the manufacture of explosive devices should be sentenced to the death penalty.
This decision has affected the sick memories of the mother of Perth Juni Cortin, who lost his 39-year-old daughters of Jane and Jenney in the therapy carried out by Patek and his reporters nearly 10 years ago.
She said that he had to be sentenced to the death penalty.
“ I really think he must follow the stages of others.
He must be before the shooting team, said Ms. Cortin AAP.
"I must live every day, knowing that I will have no grandsons and I will not see my daughters."
The Sara Club was destroyed when a massive explosive device was carried out outside the flight, immediately after the 11th October 12th, 2002.
Peter Hughes was in the Paddy's Bar where the terrorist was shocked by the explosion, just 20 seconds ago.
After that, he entered a month in whom and “more” three times, being connected to the life-care system.
Mr. Huez said that Pattery should share the participation of the three other terrorist cell "Jama Islam" responsible for bloody warfare, named Amrosy, Muslais and Samourah, who were sentenced four years ago.
Indeed, this man has more death punishment than everyone.
No reason to save him life, uh, no reason to keep him alive.
20 years after he killed 202 people and blessed hundreds, it's not so much.
Patte is the last of the terrorist participants in Bali, represented by the court.
He was hidden for almost ten years, but finally he was detained in the Pakistan City of Abbottabad, where the American armies killed the former Head of Al-Qaida, Usama Ben Laden, less than four months later.
During the judiciary, the FBI reported that the data were evidence: Packy was in Pakistan to meet Ben Laden in trying to restore the relationship between the terrorism groups of South-East Asia and Al-Qaid.
“It's not done,” said Mrs. Cortin.
Before recently, he was not regretted about how pain he had caused others.
The sentence was made in the 10th anniversary, which will be later noted in Bali and Australia.
“In this year there will be much laugh,” said Ms. Cortin.
The Patent can still condemn his sentence.
FAU: “Aviation passengers can now use a flight switch (not calling with mobile phone)”.
The safeguards will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the floor to read, work, play movies and listen to music, but not on mobile phones, according to the long new guidelines published in the Federal Aviation Office on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect to change immediately.
As soon as this change will be implemented, the aircraft will be depending on, said the Administrator of the FAU Michael Wart at the press conference.
Aiacompanies should show FAU how their flights respond to the new guidelines, and that they update their training aid for college escape and device board rules to comply with new guidelines.
FAU stated that it had already received plans from some aircrafts to enhance the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the aircrafts that have already submitted plans.
“In depending on the state of the plan, we could accept the expansion of the use of electronic devices very quickly,” stated FAO.
The passengers now have to disable their phones, schedules and other devices as only the door of the flight is closed.
They should not restart them until the aircraft does not reach 10 000 feet higher and the captain will not give it a good.
The passengers must disable their device again when the aircraft is low and do not include them until the aircraft is on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, the aircraft whose aircraft aircraft is properly protected from electronic flights may allow passengers to use these devices during the flight, aircraft and ruling, as a result of the FAU.
Most new aircraft and other aircraft modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi in large heights, as expected, respond to these criteria.
Laura Gladying, President of the Association of Professional Drivers, welcomed these changes.
“ As the new policy will be successfully implemented (and we're going to work closely with the transporter to achieve this), it will be an unproduced option),” said Gladyning.
We were openly smelling to feel “schooled in school” when the case comes to this question.
However, the connection to the Certification Internet, the exchange of electronic letters, the texts or the download of data will still be prohibited at least 100,000 feet, reported the Agency.
The passengers will be proposed to change their phones, planners and other devices in the aircraft mode.
Thus, no "Wolf with friends" is an intellectual Internet game in which Alex Boldin played on his phone in 2011 when we had the case: the actor was deleted from the American Airline flight because he refused to disable the device when the flight was in the flight.
And more harder devices, such as notes, will continue to be put into the bathroom because they can be traumated if they fly over the whole floor.
Mobile phone calls will still be prohibited.
The regular telephone powers belong to the Federal Commission, not the FAU.
FAU may remove the prohibition of some electronic devices during the flight and flight
In the last month, the National Transport Security Council Mark Scencker stated that hundreds of phones were still considered as a risk.
“The phones are really a problem, not only because they can make places for navigation devices, but we know through the SCF that they can build a place for over a hundred connections when the aircraft is in the air,” said Redner.
The Branch Advisory Committee established by FAU to study this issue recommended in the last month that the Government should authorize more use of personnel electronic devices.
In the past few years, pressure on FAO has been raised in order to reduce their use of limitations.
Critics, such as Senator democracy from the state of Missouri McKaskil, claim that there are no reasons for prohibition.
The observance of limitations is also more difficult to ensure, as the application of the device has become universal.
Some research shows that until the third passengers are forgotten or ignoring the indication of their devices.
FAU began to limit the use of electronic passengers in 1966 in response to the posts for navigation and communication devices when passengers began to bring FM-radio-accessors, high-technological shoes at that time.
New aircrafts are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations, but are also developed and supported by FAU as sustained to electronic fires.
Abia Company proposes passengers to use Wi-Fi at the Crescer height for a few years.
The wifi system has also been more sustainable for fires.
The majority of the shipping rays are available to increase the use of electronic devices in accordance with the new guidelines.
Today's electronic devices are usually removed radio tank as much lower than the previous generations of the device.
Electronic books, for example, are removed only the minimum signals when the page is transferred.
But signals are more powerful when the devices are loaded or sent data.
The Amazon.com company was among those who tried to reduce the limitations of the use of electronic passengers.
In 2011, the representatives of the company loaded the entire aircraft of their e-childrenship devices and flyed to check the existence of problems but did not find them.
Members of the Advisory Committee of the FAO expressed the fair feelings about whether the device was used.
The Advocate Kidd from the National Aviation of Aviation Saverages said that the position of the device was considered real, even if the risk was minimumed.
Other members of the Committee said that only individual pilot communications were available, confirming that the device could establish places for aircraft systems, and most of these communications were very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAO permits the pilots to disable the device during the installation at a limited visibility conditions.
The Group of Representatives of the Tourist Industry welcomed these changes by calling them a healthful step towards passengers who are now using many technological devices.
“We are glad that FAU recognizes that passenger comfort is not incompatible with security and protection,” said Roger Dou, Director-General of the United States Tourism Association.
Autoskills will be able to review driving rights
The exhibition of driving rights will be able to take private companies with their own computer driver.
This refers to the Government ' s draft decision 'to allow the management of vehicles'.
According to the newspaper, today in Russia is about 30 such vehicles.
It is suggested that students of such "favoured" autonomy will consider the results of internal testing.
In that regard, the Gosaato Inspection will conduct a monitoring of the reviews each half of the year.
If it is found that more than 30 per cent of theoretical reviews and more than 20 per cent of the students have not seen from the first time, this school will be free of privacy for half a year.
The technical requirements for automotives contained in the Government's draft decision shall enter into force from 5 November 2014.
The draft also contains requirements for training for the start of a two-rowled technology.
From 1 January 2015, motorcycle owners to obtain the rights of category A should be reviewed in the conditions of urban movement.
Furthermore, from 5 May 2014, the company will not be able to work for foreign drivers with illegal rights.
Such employees should receive Russian rights after the examination.
A bird switched at a safe place with a burning plant in the North Sea is returned to the beach of nature
The bird that was moved at the beach after it was found in the state of the ocean in the North Sea, was returned to the beach of nature.
The water passenger was placed in the helicopter sent to Amberin last month and then entered the Scotland Society for the Prevention of Common Training (SPCA) in the Savior Center in Alloa.
The manager of the centre of Koin Seeddon said: “This is probably a water pasture, which is the winter migration from Northern Europe, which has been in the region of strong winds over the North Sea.”
It seems that the bird was shocked and able to find a refugee on the ocean.
He added: "He was not able to fly again, so they called us help."
The water pasture was healthy and in a good condition until he was released.
Is Elita Europe ready to take business with England?
Business for British campaigns were launched in April with the obligation to gather business representatives and to determine what changes the well-being and workplaces of Britain want to see in EU relations.
To this end, we have stated the greatest and most complete question of British leaders and asked them to express their thoughts about Britain, business and the EU.
YouGov's company asked more than 1,000 leaders of business representing a wide range of business in Britain on size, sectors and regions.
The conclusions of the survey are not expected for many.
We have found that the majority of enterprises are currently looking for exporting opportunities for the borders of Europe by particular attention to countries that are modernized and growing, while the EU countries are in the West.
They want the Government to give priority to new trade relations with countries such as China, India and Brazil, not to have spent time for debts and difficult reform processes in the EU-based institutions.
When they asked their views on specific political issues, from anti-monopolitical regulation to the Production Acts, most leaders believed that the control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was a general deterioration of the single market, with the representatives of the business, that the expenses from Brussels are now transferred from the profits of the trade zone of Europe — even 40 per cent of large enterprises, traditionally the most industrialized from all enterprises.
The latest and most indicative is our business leaders' investigation showed that the clear majority of Britain wants to change the treaty and the relationship with the EU based on trade, not on policy.
This result, which has been observed among the enterprises of all sizes and the largest business groups, shows that business is a significant change that will return to the power of return to Britain.
High rates — the achievement of the treaty changes and the more favourable conditions for Britain will ensure 16 per cent of the vote in order to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not have any doubt: this question shows that the British business supports its plan to revise the conditions of membership in the EU.
He also pointed out that business expects that the review will lead to a significant revision of the current balance of forces to the part of the United Kingdom.
The best conditions for the British business are possible and are increasingly necessary when the Euroon is in the way towards a more closer economic and financial association.
The priority should be given to the workplace and economic growth in Britain, and, as our survey shows, this means a strong focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels regulatory activities.
The US Special Services listening to the private phone of the Pope of Rome
The activity of the Vatican is under the guard control of the American Special Services.
New documents from Edward Snowden's collection show that the United States’s expertise had heard all the negotiations of the previous Pope Benedict, and now the French Pope is deeply oppressed.

There are no secrets from the United States leadership in the sacred fathers.

All of this has been conducted by the head of one of the largest veterinary companies of the country, President of the Russian Union of Isak Sheps at the IIIth Annual Conference of the Institut Adam Smith "Thura of daily demand in Russia", which was just concluded in Moscow.
It was discussed by the public market management.
From 2008 to 2012 the Russian bird market has already reduced 18 per cent, since in the last few years the country has seen a significant increase in the control of the animal sector in the production and trafficking of drinking, with small alcohol content, reported to the listeners of the Sheps.
None of the world has such a heavy restriction on the market of birds that are unpredictable to all new and non-logical bans that are based on the ways of combating alcohol abuse.
The drinker said that many legislative bans aimed at decreasing alcohol abuse did not have a special influence, but all new initiatives were constantly found.
More than all of the animal producers have been attacked by the ban on sales of cyskets since this year.
"We have lost 35 000 consumers immediately," said Isaac Sheps.
Two prognoses for the next year.
Optimistic is the one who sheep said: Sell drinking remains at the previous level.
Psychiatically, there will be more than 2-3 per cent.
In order to maintain their arrival, businessmen have to go from the shoes raised to the user in the "premium" class, which will be less slow, but it will stand the road.
However, radio-scale consequences from the fall of sale with a small number of springs are not visible.
"In my monitoring, the level of alcoholism disease remains nearly at the same level,” reported Dr. Alexis Stern.

The Russian mafia has finally made a new name -- the Brat Circle.
This week, the "Russian Mafia" list was filled with new names and four companies.
The United States Finance Ministry entered into the Brat Circle of Russia's three representatives, two Usbekistan and Israeli citizens.
One of the Russians was known as Gregory Leps, who suspected the transport of money for grouping members.
However, in the United States ' s black list, 22 persons participated in the Brat Circle and six firmed organizations.
Many experts, however, are doubtful that such organization is real.
"The Declaration on the Brat Circle is more to try to combine discrete criminal groups", previously stated an expert on organized crime and professor of the University of New York Mark Galeothy.
He believes that the Brat Circle reflects the popular "Russian mafia".
"I have not met any in Russian law enforcement bodies or anybody who would confirm the existence of such a criminal organization," said Mr. Galeothy, the American Centre for Corruption Research and Organized Crime.
Mr. Galeothy agrees and Professor George Mayson's University Liz Shelly.
"If they are and acting, it is more like a criminal network, but not an organization," brings her words to the Centre for Corruption Research and Organized Crime.
In the middle of the past year, Mark Galeotti said that the Brat Circle was assembling the most closer Russian war in the law of Assasan Usoyan, known as Dad Hasan.
Criminal Authority was killed in January this year.
Similarly, Lashi Sushanashili and Zacharia Calashwa, filled with the list in 2012, were closely linked to Dad Hassan, and another participant in the list, the Timuri Mirzov, was the Dad Hassan tribe.
However, Mr. Galeotti notes that some personalities and have no relationship with Usoyan.
It believes that all of them were better combined with general financial and criminal interests, such as drug supply from Afghanistan.
One of the subjects was scanning the includement in the Brat Circle, Gregoria Leps, the favorite President of Russia of the Wohlmier Putin, highlighted the attention of Kremell.
Of course, we consider that we will receive more detailed information from our American partners, as a result of this decision, why it was taken in such lists, - said the Secretary-General of the States of Dmitri Peske.
In any case, he (Leps) is a civil RF.
Like the interests of all RF citizens, his interests will be protected.
Head of Gazproma Alexy Miller says that the tuberculosis in Bulgaria is a new era in the gas area.
The construction of the “South river” in Bulgaria is a start of a major energy project in Europe, said the head of Gazproma.
“The year was a marking event: the construction of the South River, the largest and most important project in Europe, began to be built by the Bolgar Gasproma, ” said President Alexy Miller, in his statement on Thursday.

Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks related to transit countries were eliminated “forever”.
Bolgarian consumers will receive gas from the South River on a low price, just as the project will start working in 2015.
Gazprom stated that construction should be started in other countries further on the road of gas to the end of the year.
The annual project slowing capacity of the tuberculosis is 2.2 billion cubic feet.

Two officers of the MICA have been accused of sexual crimes before the accused of Jonathan Laurd, as it was known by the Kingdom Commission
Two NSW officials were accused of sexual crimes against children in 2011 against the Child Child Child Employees in Caringhaw Jonathan Lard, reported the Kingdom Commission on Sexual Violence on Children.
However, the Commission's entry declaration stated that “he had never had cases of sexual violence against children within its organization.”
The Chief Executive Director Philippe Harah asked the same case the employee of MICA was accused of crimes related to child pornography, and another case when a sporting instructor in MICA Caringbah Hall was sentenced for sexual crimes against children under his visit in 1991.
Mr. Hair said, Gail Fernes, a lawyer who provided the assistance of the Commission that he knew about the first case, but did not know the second.
He acknowledged that MYCA was also entitled to the Commission by claiming that “for external controls of the MYCA that the MYCA was in the first series of children ' s security.”
The evidence submitted to the Commission indicated that MYCA had been notified that it had received the second from the end of the four possible quality assessments carried out by the Department of Education and Communities in August of that year.
Mr. Hair, who entered in the MICA when he was 21 years old, acknowledged that he and the following leadership had permitted the labour and also did not have a clear understanding of the staff of its obligations relating to reports on the violations of child security policy.
Previously, the Lord was sentenced for sexual crimes against 12 boys during two years of his work in MICA.
He was arrested as a minimum of six years.
But Mr. Hair rejected the suggestion that the MICA corporates had stopped the staff to report on the violations of Lourd in the area of children's security.
The employees showed that they had observed violations, including that Lord was one of the children, who personally sweared them to the colleagues, said he loved one of them and allowed them to play their mobile phone.
Daniel Okewell, who was under the Laurd leader, asked her to teach children's protection because she was concerned about his behavior, proved that he found Jacky Barnett, the manager of MICA's children in Caringbach, who was the leader of Lord, was “a very fearing and difficulty available”.
The Executive Director said he did not accept the explanation of staff that they had not been able to report the situation to his superior leaders.
In his words, their friendship with Lord led them from the thought of the need to report to him.
Mr. Hair said he had submitted the Council to the New South Wales that the lesson for the organization of the organization with Jonathan Lord was not “information” by the staff and agreed with it.
Mr. Hair said that the decision to make staffs to sign a confidence agreement immediately after the detention of the accused was adopted by the Director-General of the MICA on the Surveillance of the Children of Liam Whitly.
He said that it was intended to prevent the portion of evidence, but it was “resurrected” and that decision was wrong.
MYCA of New South Wales was not safe for children during the work of Jonathan Lourd during the 2009-2011 period, reported the Commission of Experts on the raising of children Professor Steven Smolbon from the University of the Griffit.
He said that serious problems were in the collection, selection, instruction, staff education and control.

Look at Qua who held a high-level meeting.
experts of the transportation activities in Cardiff to fight for the League Year knew that competitiveness would be very high.
But nobody was ready to appear in the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Even not a schoolman, only for a few months before his first steps, the small one with his chetland scene, Tofie, was walking through three towers to take the main task, left 30 adult partners away.
This unfair couple — the same growth — has received high assessments for the external species, conduct and style of the annual competitor, which is the centre of Sannibenk’s final sport in the city of Rari near Cardiff.

However, they're a good team.
The judges noted Fenton and Tomfi for their external nature and for their presentation at the show-ring.
They appreciate the vulnerability of the poet and manufacturer — Fronton and Tophi were the best on the market.
I'm sure that Fenton helped his attractive side, he really looked well in his role.
Public appeal of the Chinese newspaper “The Reorganization must be”
The Chinese newspaper, published at the first point, calls for the release of the accused reporter to be reorganized, reports the press regulator.
The New Express newspaper in Guangoo made an unexpected public statement requesting a journalist Chan Youngjo.
Mr. Chan, however, later acknowledged on television that he had received the writing of false articles on company with the public share of property.
Now, the New Express should be “complete correction process”, as the regulator reports.
The Guanduan government commanded the Press and Publications, Radio, cinema and television.
Previous investigation showed that the member of Yangcheng Evening News Group of New Express published a number of false reports on Zoomlion's company in the period from September 2012 to August 2013.
“The volume of the revision of the New Express” was decreased,” states the regulator.
He states that it was decided to “invite the administrative appeal to Chan Yunjoa in the form of his reporter license”.
He also recommended that the Yangcheng Evening News Group indicated the full correction of the errors in the New Express and investigate the situations related to the newspapers and immediately introduce changes in the guideline of the New Expression.
Mr. Chanje wrote a number of articles for the New Express, which stated that financial violations were undertaken by a construction equipment named Zoomlion.
After his detention was detained, his newspaper published two calls for his release, claiming that it supports his journalist activities.
But Mr. Chan, then, appeared at the public television, acknowledged that he published false articles for money.
“ In this case, I lost the Zoomlion company, as well as all the news media industry and its ability to rely on public confidence,” he said the public advertising company of the CCTV.
I did this mainly because I wanted money and glory.
I understood my fault.
After his recognition, Mr. Chanya The New Express published an excuse on the first field, he said that the newspaper was uncomfortable to check his reports.
Recently, some accused suspected have recognized television.
Experts say that the practice of exclusion in China has continued to be widely distributed, despite recent amendments to laws prohibiting the authorities to demand someone to self-contract.
U.S. tunnel - Mexico for the transfer of drugs equipped with its own iron road
One of the most complex tunnels is found for drug contracts between the United States and Mexico, which are covered by its own lighting systems, ventilations and electrical relves systems.
The U.S. authorities describe the tunnel of four to three feet width as one of the most complex secret paths ever found.
The tunnel, which consists of almost six football fields, is connected to installations around the city of Tihuana (Mexico) and San Diego (USA).
The area is filled with unacceptable equipment that makes it easy to hide drug loads in the carriage.
The Tunnel was closed before any drug was immediately transferred, as stated by the authorities.
According to the judicial documents, the guards have confiscated eight and half tons of marihuana and 327 feet of cocaine in the discovery of the tunnel.
Twelve men, according to the law enforcement, were declared in the guard of marihuana and cocaine in order to disseminate.
In the case of sentence, they are threatened by decades of 10 years before their life penalty.
In the city of Nogales, Arizona, the contractors use wide underground channels.
Tunnel is the eighth large passage found in San Diego since 2006.
A number of larger tunnels have been found in Central Mexico after the assembly of marihuana in October, which made the drug carriage a complicated task to deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a length of about 700 meters of raining roads that flew from the kitchen of one of the houses in Tihuan to two sites of San Diego.

The British Police has the notification of the extradition
The British police today has reported to the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assanja, who was launched in the Ecuador Embassy in London and asked for refuge.
In Scotland and Yard, they stated that they had assigned an Australian 40-year-old “official requirement” to appear in the police office, adding that, in the absence of this requirement, he would continue to be arrested.
Assanju threatens the extradition of Sweden in sexual offences after he extented its possibilities in accordance with the British law when the Supreme Court rejected its appeal for extradition in that month.

Taxes for foreign owners will lead to the flow of the London Post
The Chambership has made a preliminary evaluation of capital growth tax measures, but expects the final decision by Mr. Osborn, which in the 2012 budget introduced the public post rate of 7 per cent for the household value of more than 2 million and annual payments for buyers who decided to possess houses in companion, not as physical persons.
At this time, Mrs. Violence in Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, which consists of 708 million feet in the financial year 2012/13, has already exceeded the overall amount in Northern Ireland, Wals, Skotland, Northwest, New Yorkshire and Hambera together.
Mr. Kuk said: “After the increase in the households and the inclusion of this legislation against the abuse is very difficult to say that the integrity of the cost-free immobility is decreased independence on the impact of the slowest municipal tax system.”
"But this step may lead to the fact that some foreign investors will unwantedly purchase in movement in London or the present of its owners will not want to sell it", he added.

Scientists blew the light to how the dog moves are related to its vision.
More early studies showed that satisfactory dogs are shocked to the right side of the dog, while the sweet dogs smell as well as the left side.
But now scientists say that other pseudophysician representatives may observe these points of differentity in the heat and react to them.
Professor Georgeo Valluturgerar, an neurologist from the Trintuary University, says: “Onely knows that people have left and right the brain's brain's brain' in a wide part of the forming of constructors that cause positive or negative emotions.”
Here we tried to look at this and other kinds.
He added that the right dog of the brain controls the left side of the body and the opposite, and two measures play different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs respond to the diversity of other dogs, researchers observed animals when they looked at the films of other dogs.
They measured the frequency of the heart of the animals and analyzed their conduct.
Maybe we're already understood why they're on the other side, and sometimes to another.
Prof. Vallatorgerar said: "We have shown dog videos with dogs, or naturalistic versions, or strength to be removed from any other deceptive factor, and we could handle the movement of the cow and driving more left or right."
When the animals saw that there was nothing in the rest that was not expressed by the dog moved to the right (or the point of view of the heavy dog), they remained completely slow.
But when they noticed that the skin was shocked to the left (once from the point of view of the honey dog), their hearts were engaged and appeared to be sweet.
Prof. Vallorgirr said he was not thinking that dogs would have been communicated with each other with these movements.
In fact, he believes that the dogs have learned from their experience what movements they should be worried and no.
He notes: “If there are several meetings with other dogs and often their shocks in one side are related to more friendly behavior, and the right side gives less friendly behavior, the dog reacts on the basis of this experience.”
Researchers say that these results may give the owners, veterinarys and auditors more deeply understanding of the emotions of their animals.
The expert on the conduct of the dog John Bradshaw, an scientist in the Veterinary School of Bristol University, said that it was not the first study to check whether the dog was important for the left and the right dog.
In the past year, a group of scientists from the University of Lincoln found that dogs strike the head to the left if they look at an aggressive dog, and right if they look at a good dog.
And in another scientific work at the University of Victoria, he reported: “The children have been more approaching to the dog, when the slaughter was left and not right, instead of being shocked, the opposite behavior for Italian research.”
He said that the differences could be because dogs in various studies did not completely accept animals in films or dogs as dogs.
It could be useful to investigate how dogs respond to the dogs, he explained.
“ While there are sufficient evidence that two orbiters of the brain are used for various purposes, many details still need to be clarified, and dogs are not exceptional, ” he said.
However, taking into account the easierness of which their behavior may be registered, we may have already understood why their throats sometimes move to one side, and sometimes to another.

Pope Francis will get the first cardinals in February
The Pope Francis will take new cardinals in the sanctuary of the Catholic Church for the first time of its service on 22 February, as stated in the Vatican Friday.
Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they choose the pope, so France will designate their first group of people who will finally participate in the selection of his predecessor.
There are now 201 cardinals.
However, after the cardinal of 80 years of age, he cannot participate in the elections of the Pope is the preventive group of 120 “cardinal-electors”.
In announcing this news, the Vienna Press-Secretary Father Felico Lombardi said that before the sanctuary, all the present cardinals, known as consist, would be held in the congregation before the sanitary ceremony.
“Papa Frances decided to notify its decision to consult the consist in February to facilitate the planning of other meetings with kardinates from different parts of the world,” said Lombardi.
Jack Valero from the Catastrous voice organization said that in February the number of cardinal-electors would probably be decreased.
He said that the Pope usually calls such cardinals as necessary to reaffirm the number of cardinals to 120, as well as so many cardinals older than 80 years older.
The next year will have a great importance, since it will be the first time of the French election in March this year, according to the Valero's words.
There is now its kind of prevention for Europe and in particular for Italy.
“It is interested to see whether the new Pape of Cardinal from other parts of the world is to restore the balance,” he stated.
In South America, 40 per cent of Catholics live, but there are no number of cardinals.
This will also be the first chosen cardinals since the French Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all the world, which has been assigned to search for ways to reform the church.
In the past, my dad decided everything alone.
“ At the time, Francis chose eight cardinals to help him, ” said Valero.
He said that Francis would be addressed to the cardinal for the advice.
But we weren't in this situation before it -- it's all for us first.

The Crystal of Obama's Elector
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing hope for changes
He said that Obama allowed the structuring of the Republicns to make no joyful efforts.
Restructuring cannot be corrected by the Web site reformed by the Health System, the attacks of impilots
The 2008 Obama campaign Memories are the painful memories of what might be
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student of the second course of the Harvard University Medical School.
I'm reading a terrible painful book in these days.
I thought that this book would encourage me during the second course of the Medical Faculty and restore hope in me.
It is called “Dersity for Victorship” and it is the Memory of the President-Chairman's 2008 Championship Baraka Obama.
When I finish the reports on my patients and lie in my bed, this book returns to me while the policy inspired millions of people and the statements could be able to shut up the spirit.
The benefit of elections was shocked, and the news programs made a pause to understand that historical moment.
My classmates cryed from joy, and my parents took all the newspapers they could only find.
The White House had to come to a young team of losses, and the people had been ready to change.
In 2008, the support level of Obama was 82 per cent.
Then I'll close the book.
Returns now represents a deep trial, as a restraint from the dream.
It is difficult to remember those days of optimism — they say a further reminder, the painful memories of the launched opportunities.
Over the years since I left my first election office, the changes have really occurred.
That was what I couldn't even imagine.
I will give Obama to his great and different achievements, from the adoption of the Act on Available Medical Assistance to the conclusion of our militarys from Iraq, the amendment of the Rules of “Do not ask, don't say”, the murder of Usama Ben Laden.
Furthermore, I believe that the partial restructuringism has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, opportunities to elect public health and to close the base in Guantanamo among others.
But after a countless number of times, when I was on the side of the Ombudsman administration, by protecting it before my colleagues and grandmothers, I have completed the explanations I can give.
I reached the political disappointment.
The Republicators cannot explain the permission of foreign leaders or the shock of slaughterers for innocent children in other countries.
It cannot explain the collection of data on the private life of Americans of the National Security Agency or the persecution of deployers who discourage governments.
He cannot explain the murder of an American citizen Anvar al-Aulaki without courts and consequences or the non-observation of public funding and expenditure during the presidential campaigns.
He cannot justify the conclusions of the report, which states that the Nixon Administration examples of the White House's efforts to silence the media are “agressive... with the time of the Administration”.
In recent times, he cannot justify what is not possible to develop a simple web site over more than three years after signing the law on access to medical assistance.
I don't know if I had to wait.
Should I understood 18 years of age that the leadership may oppose political campaigns before him?
Obviously, the work on the selected post is not a predicted programme of action, since our public dialogue will be formed by the opposition of a political party and by evental meetings such as injury in Newtown.
However, all of the above-mentioned examples show that they were significantly the choice of the Administration.
And that's what I'm worried about.
I have again voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I have been enthusiasm on his candidate.
Mr. Romney was an unreasonable and cruel alternative that was not able to make decisions on its own policy or views.
I thought, at my second time, that Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, justifys the hopes we have heard for such a long time.
However, when Obama's rating was below 45 per cent in this week, it was more difficult to return in 2008.
This makes me touch in many promises that have flewn.
In this week, I read the part of the book in which Clinton was described as Obama had a sensible view on primary elections in Pennsylvania.
At the analysis meeting, he told his staff that they should return to the normal ring and remain faithful to their goals.
“ I want us to return our appreciation, ” he said.
"We must remember who we are."
Five years ago, Mr. President, and I agree with you.
The comments expressed in this opinion are exclusively belonging to Nathaniel Morris.

RBS excludes two monetary trainers
The Kingdom Bank of Skotland has temporaryly disappeared from the work of two trainers in its monetary operations, according to the information of two persons known to this situation, which is another confirmation that the overall control of regulators in the monetary market is strictly collecting trafficking.
Some of the largest world banks, including UBS, Barclays, Germane Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they cooperate with regulators in investigations related to the largest financial market in the world, a daily trading of $5.3 trillion.
These two trainers will be the first RBS staff, which are disrupted during the deployed investigation, which is called on the scanner related to the LIBOR interbank rate.
In refusal of commenting, the bank reaffirmed that in this month he received requests for information from the regulatory bodies.
“We continue our current investigation, and we are fully cooperating with FCA and with other regulators,” reported in the bank two weeks ago.
In the last month, the informed persons said that RBS had transmitted e-mail records and mingles that received and sent him the former trainer to the United Kingdom Authority — Financial Control Office (FCA).
This trainer, Richard Asher, left from the RBS in 2010 and, as he knows, provides a departure to his current post of the European Structure Monetary Trade Director in JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the leader of the European Social Trade in Citi, went to the departure this week, while Matthew Hardinner, an ex-more monetary trainer in Barclays and UBS, was discarded from the work of the Standard Chartered bank on this week.
No of these trainers was accused of any violations.
Mr. Asher had a group of contacts involved bankers from Barclays and Citi Group, under the words of informed persons.
The UBS Bank reported this week that he took measures against some of his staff after the Swiss regulator Finma said that he would investigate the predicted monetary manipulation in a number of Switzerland banks.
At least six world regulatory bodies — the European Commission, Finland, the Switzerlandn Antimonopolitical Authority Weko, FCA, the United States Justice Ministry and the Palestinian Government of Hong Kong — are considering the appeal that the bankers have entered a conspiracy for the repercussion of the monetary market.
HSBC, Citi Group, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also began internal checks or received requests for information from the regulatory bodies, said that persons were familiar with the situation.
The banks have been recorded by the mixed communications and the electronic letters for a few years in the search for crimes.
The checking news has increased trends in the field of activities in recent years one of the largest sources of commercial investment banks income, which, however, had faced difficulties since the low flexibility of the currency reduced the benefits of the buyer.
Some bankingers tried to reduce the seriousness of the situation, saying that the wide and high-level currency market was almost impossible to manipulate, but the senior trainers said that it is not always true.
According to the older trainer, despite a large amount of daily trade on the monetary market, the liquidity fraction between different trade platforms and the more wide use of their internal platforms means that " you can start playing an impact on the market for a very small price".
This news came on the same day when the credit Suisse bank declared that one of the trainers of London's Fund Trade Market Office was released this week after the loss of almost $6 million at the end of the last year.
The bank has immediately notified the relevant bodies and cooperated with its regulators.
“We are sure that the trainer has acted alone and that this issue was able to locate,” reported Kredit Suisse.

In Egypt, the first President is elected freely
Mohammed Mursey is judged, but the day of his complaint would not be marked by the end of the political fight in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Muhammad Murcy promised the “new Egypt ” when he offered a sentence, became the first elected President of the country, who changed Hosney Mubarak, who was rejected 16 months ago.
In its inauguration before the Supreme Constitution Court, Murcy also became the first elected Islamic President of the Arab world and the fifth Head of the State in Egypt after the monarchy over 60 years ago.
He took a sentence before 18 judges in black mantics in the neighborhood of Nila, built in the style of the ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are trying to make a better future, new Egypt and the second Republic,” said Mursey during the Traditional Ceremony shown in direct eternity on public television.
“The seventy-year-old Egyptian people have put the foundation of a new life, a absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” stated Murcy, a 60-year-old engineer with the American education of the Bretiv-Musulman, a fundamentalist group that was a large part of its 84-year-old organization that was prohibited by a mixed action for the cruel action that changed one another Government.
The building was protected by hundreds of soldiers and police, when Mursey arrived with a small sleeves soon after 11 a.m. to local time.
Only hundreds of persons were gathered in the court building to welcome the new President, and, unlike the presidential age of Mubarak, the movement was stopped only in a short time to leave the car rental for a normally living road that combined the city centre with Southern rewards.
Although Murcy was expressed as an unharristical “safe route”, his personal prestige increased from the moment of his victory and the fifth statement he tried to imagine himself not only as Islamic candidates, but also all those who want to prove to the end of 2011 resurrection against the Authority Mubarak.
“The sixth Year of Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” said Murcy, who was obtained in the blue business cost with red grace, judges in the circumcises of the tree panels where he has accepted the sentence.
Afterwards Murcy moved to the University of Kalifornia where he had to do his inauguration.
He was given an official receipt with the armed orchester who performed a public jinn during which he was “mother” standing.
The military department was presented by Hussein Tantavi.
His visit was gathered by the Army and the people, one hand, which scanning hundreds of meetings in the main board hall of the university.
Based in 1908 as a pledge of light education, the University of the Kyrpic in the 1970s became the opposite of Islamic Study Groups.
Murcy took a symbolic sentence on Friday on the Tahrir area, where the resurrection of the Museory Authority rule last year, and promised to return the authority of the President whose office was reserved by the military council, taking the case of the refusal leader.

A regular meeting of the Association of Tunisia's Car Constructors was based on the Yalutor Car Industry.
In the context of the event, the new electrical tube line has been represented.
As the commercial director of Denise Gribanon reported, in 2011, a new owner of the market research on the market in Tunisia was conducted.
It was found that the region needs more than 500,000 tons of electrical tube per month.
After that, it was decided to change the profile and installations on it for their production.
More than 70,000 tons of production have been downloaded this year.
Investment was more than 120 million rubbers,” said Dennis Gribanon.
In October, a new state that allows to increase assortment.
The manufacture is launched as a small tube profile that is used for swimming households, small forms of construction and furniture, as well as the largest sector.
Plan to go to the production level of 500,000 tonnes per year, with approximately 10 per cent of its consumption in Tunisia.
In spite of the other terms of transition, the number of enterprises have not been decreased, now 157 persons, in the purchase of new equipment, more than 50 employees.
The company is being prepared and the necessary specialists are collected from the existing.
The future year is planned to introduce a new proliferation agriculture has become total to five miles (5 milimeters) to reduce the autonomy of production, as well as another condition, with a speed of tube production up to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014, enterprise plans to release a tube used in the housing and the community.
The Enterprises ' s task is to close to 70 per cent of the needs of the Tunisia area in this product.
The Vice-Chairman of the Department of Investment Policy Leonid Islands recommended to provide more attention to the modernization of carriage enterprises.
This aims and forms of public support for industry, including the reimbursement of the percentage credit rates for the purchase of new equipment and its liquidation costs.
This year is intended to allocate 150 million rubbers, two thirds have already been lost.
The last Commission, which will consider the subventional treaties, takes documents from undertakings until 15 November.
Furthermore, the budget is paid to the participation of local producers in the international burdens.
The future budget is estimated to $150 million, which can be used to compensate licensing payments and credits for the purchase of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated to the nuclears, 3 million to the energy conservation programme.
The reimbursement of the refunded and paid equipment produced in the south of the Tunisia area for the oil complex is reduced to 72 million.
According to Leonida Ostroumvu, this form of support will be stopped, since it was the motivation of paying taxes to benefits from the oil companies paid in the area budget.
At present, they do not do this and subsidies are the direct cost obligations of the region.
In this regard, the Government considers the immediate support of industrial enterprises, not the financing of the oil sector.
Budget assistance will be linked to investment projects that will be implemented in production.
Many corporate leaders expressed concern about the counteracting situation of oil relations.
The provision of their purchased equipment is the competitive advantage of the Southern Tunisia industry, and it will be difficult to reverse the price from the average Russian pool, where the more delicate work force is.
Furthermore, the new owner of TNK-WD is the Rosneth company that has not yet been able to place his claims on Tuman enterprises.
The Ukrainian project implementation agreement is concluded in 2013, and the applications for its extension have not been made.
Today, the undertaking of the Southern regions that are specialized for oil sectors cannot form an order portal for the coming year.
The question remains that the taxes of the oil in the Uwa region in the budget of the region or will be paid on the location of the new owner of the place.

The declaration of the official representative of the SKR Würmir Markin is likely to be understood that in the collection of the pictures collected by the Organszerist case, the accounts were found.

However, the artistic expert, designated by researchers after arresting these pictures, established that they had no art value and, simply, are deep details," noted Markin at the beginning of October.

What was the reason for the proclamation of Vasilia’s home arrest, which has not yet been communicated with the press?
Maybe the woman couldn't respond to the accused of a bad prisoner?
Or is it the right of the journalists, "Commshoolki", who claimed a couple of days ago, that she "slaughtered in a larger detention" because of the reconciliation of Anatolia Serdouka with her wife and his return to his family?
The famous military survey of the CP Victor Balanz in his article “Searchs have returned to the wife?” wrote: “The Sladingers do not exclude that after such a surprise, it may become more conversative for interrogations.”
Previously, Vasilva had some accused of the illicit sale of the unmovable property of the Minoboron.

Dmitri Medveev: The growth rate of GDP RF is not sufficient for State development
Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev considers that it is not sufficient for RF to increase its GDP and that the situation can be improved, facilitating business credit conditions and changed the Russian economy structure, or innovation, reports Reuters.
We planned GDP growth in 3 per cent in this year, perhaps even more.
Really, it will be less than 2%.
In the background of the recession in a number of European countries, it would not be very bad, but it is little for us, because the economic basis is not as strong as a number of countries in general, and in order to develop, it must be higher.
Now it is very important that Russian companies receive normal price credits are the first thing that must be done,” stressed the head of the Government.

Travel through strikes, rivers and jungles to provide free medical assistance
Dr. Jorge Bwelle provides free medical assistance in the rural area in Cameroun
Bwelle and his team are conducting almost every week, taking hundreds of patients
In this West African country, the doctors are not so much — only one for 50,000
Avoid here or through your mobile device.
Dr. Jorge Bwelle is one of the 10 main heroes of CNN 2013.
You can vote for him or any other 10 main heroes to become the CNN Heroes.
This person will receive $2,50,000 to continue its extraordinary work.
During the 21th year, Jorge Bwelle saw his father returned to life and again in an inconscious state, shooting through hospitals that were not equipped with the right way to help him.
Jamef Bwelle received a trauma in the car accident in 1981, not far from Yaunde, Cameroun’s capital.
First, he was only cut off his hand, but the infection was distributed to the brain and called a gematic that recalled herself to the end of his life.
“ There were no neurochirurgs in Cameroun, ” said Jorge Bwelle.
If we had money, we would have brought him out of Cameroon.
Instead of that, Bwell has given his father in overcome clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment they could have received.
“ It’s not easy, ” he said.
- You can go from home at 5 o'clock, and get to the hospital to be the first, but you're not the first one.
It's a lot of patients.
Some may die because they have to wait.
The situation was not very changed since the father of Bwelle ended in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, only one doctor in Cameroon was 5000.
For comparison, the percentage in the United States is one of 413 doctors.
And even if the cameras could call to the doctor, many of them wouldn't be in the carman.
Two of the five people in this country live in a fair poverty, and almost three four health costs are private.
“ The only problem of them is poverty, ” said Billy.
And because of the poor, they cannot enjoy their lives."
I saw his father's suffering and many of his co-conciliators, Bwelle had decided to do something.
Last year, Dr. Jorge Bwell and his volunteer team carried out 700 free operations.
He himself became a doctor and works with a co-adult surgery at the Headquarter of Yaunded Hospital.
He also found the non-commercial organization of ASCOVIME, which organizes travel travels to the agricultural field for free medical assistance.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group had been assisted by almost 32.000 people.
Once each Thursday, he and 30 people are killed in the shooting, lifted up medical ownership and moved to visit the people who need to assist the village.
It's not always a chance to conscious them.
Sometimes they had to cut the cars through the rivers and the hills.
But when they come, they meet as the real heroes: it is a celebration of songs and dances and the best places that can only offer local inhabitants.
The cost of medical services in these villages is really a matter of celebration, and Bwelle with its wide sweet and unlimited energy more than happiness to join.
The next morning, the brigade begins to take hundreds of patients.
“ We take 500 people on each journey, ” said Bwelle.
They come with the whole area in the radio 60 km from the village, and they're coming to the beach.
Each of these clinics offers various medical services.
Many people receive malaria, tuberculosis, injury, diabetes, parasites and sexual diseases.
Others may receive shoes, skins or free birth witnesses — documents required for schools that many poor families simply can not allow themselves.
On the night of the brigade, simple operations are carried out under local anesthesis.
Operations are generally carried out in the school building, municipality or house; after the patient procedures, they stand up and go to the post-operation area to release the place for the next man.
Using the general for the lighting of operational and sanitary equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers worked until Sunday morning.
This is an unfortunate time, but the integrity of the brigade is usually helping tree musicians.
“ All the night they shoot in the barbaron, so that we will be guarded and continued to work, ” said Bwelle.
On Sunday, the members of the brigade return to the city, but the honour of their work.
The group, which was from the Cambodia Doctors and foreign students, has conducted 700 free operations for the past year, and they know that their assistance could have a great importance for those who are helping them.
One person explained that the free surgery surgery received to allow him to work again.
“ This will change the future for me and my family, ” said a man.
In addition to these clinical receipts in the weekly and work in the hospital, Bwelle also works nights in private medical clinics around Yaounded.
That second work, as he said, provides 60 per cent of the financing of his non-commerce organization; other means are covered by private donations.
"I don't even know when he's sleeping," said Kathy O'Melly, a medical student of the second course at the Philadelphia University, volunteer in the Bwelle Group.
He is always in the hospital or is trying to pay money for the organization to continue these campaigns.
For future doctors and nurses, such as O'Malley, who came from the United States and Europe, to join Belle in the performance of his task, is the possibility of a practice that they would never have received home.
“We got the opportunity to assist on operations where we helped to remove the blood or keep the tools for Dr. Bwelle,” said O'Melly.
As a bus student, you would never have received such a possibility in America.
The voluntary students usually pay their travel to Cameroon, often reaching donated medicines.
But when they arrived in Yaoundda, their food, transport and education pays Bwelle.
"He's a hero, without doubt," said O'Malley.
He gives his lives to this organization, and his desire to help Cameroun people.
For Bwelle, almost permanent detriment of work is not a hard test.
Helping a happy life of others to fulfill the promise of his father is what brings him great joy.
“ I am so happy when I do this work, ” said Brell.
- And I think of my father.
I hope he's seeing what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to people smile to reduce their pain.
Go to the ASCOVIME website and see what you can help.

Bomba is rejected from his words of health
Among the crystal of President Obama, last night, he was on the midday about his often repeated, a unique promise that “if you like your medical insurance plan, you can keep it.”
For centuries of thousands of people have been informed of the stopping of service from their leaders, the Republicns recently discovered the President because he introduces the American society in a mistake.
Last night, a few of Obama sent its original public promises.
“The majority of the health insurance who works may keep it,” he said in his statement in Boston.
In view of the fact that it was called “new use” for the stopping of service, Obama called for the Americans to search for other market options.
Most people will have the possibility of obtaining the best, comprehensive medical insurance plans at the same price or even deterioration of the provision.
“ You will get better conditions, ” he said.
The Administration stated that nobody should surprise that 5 per cent of the people who purchase insurance could be made to change the plans because their claims did not conform to new standards required in accordance with the access to medical assistance law.

The Rosbalt Agency has lost the media status for an inestimable burden
On October 31, Moscow decided to acknowledge the invalid license on the registration of the Rosbalt Agency, writes the Lent.
In the absence of the Media Statute, Roka Navigation was the systematic and cruel violation of the media law.
During the process, an unpleasant presidency was established: the court had read the possible closure of the media, in fact rejected the publication in the right to issue contracts.
What's "Rosbalt"?
THE Rosbalt Information Agency was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the following years, the Agency opened the second main office in Moscow and a number of regional units.
Agencys also work as representatives in the former SPD countries.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has developed and functioned as a federal information and analytical agency.
The Agency was a list of the most well-known private media networks in Russia in the mid-2000s.
The " Rosbalt " has always been a very specific low: the nuclear of the exceptional publications of the Agency was (and still constituted) the notes of reference to the sources of law enforcement bodies.
The discussions on the proximity of publications to force structures continued to have been held throughout the existing of the Agency.
On the other hand, Rosbalt had a wide source base in various states, in favour of such provisions, and was said in the chapter of the project, that Nathania Chaplin was a wife of Victor Checksov.
The Chapter's role is not clear until the end is: mostly it is called "printer of the project".
The Director-General of the Agency is Laris Afonina, the main editor of Nicola Williams.
Recently, Rosbalt has not been launched in federal media racings - nor by citiration, nor by audition.
In October, the Agency took the 25th place to visit Russian media websites on Live Internet.
According to Live Internet, the mediated rosbalt.ru website audit is about 1500,000 unique visitors (and up to 500 000 reviews) monthly, about three million unique visitors.
In addition to the most popular materials in the past five months, Krimla's impairment notes in Ukrainian relations, the death of the Kroll and Shot Group in the capital Brazil.
The Rosbalt Conflict began in July 2013 when amendments to the media law prohibited by journalists were entered into force.
Wednesty has found the prohibited pharmaceuticals in two posted video agencies on the website "Jigit from Rosnodar" and "Pussy Riot disabled oil exhibitions".
The further parts are different.
Rosbalt, on the basis of the discovery videomaterials, accused Rosbalt in a cruel and systematic violation of the media law and requested the court to choose the license office.
The Rosbalte state claimed that the claims of the State were unrighteous: first, the roles were not editing materials, secondly, mother words were discarded and, thirdly, the role was removed immediately after the warning.
The representatives of the Agency were pleasing for the claim of the Royal Surveillance in the World Court and when Moskow Court adopted the search for Royal Surveillance on October 22, 2013, the consideration of these complaints continued.
However, the 25 numbers of world courts have already decided not in favour of Rosbalt: the main editor of Nicola William acknowledged the guilty of the administrative offences codes and slaughtered 200,000 rubbers for each role.
Obviously, it was also predicted that the outcome of listening in Moscow -- if it was rejected from thinking that the exit could be previously been predicted.
31 October the Court decided to recognize the invalid witness of the registration of Rosbalt, actually removed the media Agency.
You can't say that Rosbalt remained alone during this opposition.
The Agency supported the Chairpersons (the statement on behalf of the Headquarters of Alexander Jarov, on 10 October, was signed 26 deputés; the same document was issued by the CPF initiative).
On the injustice of the closure of publications, the head of the Russian Journalists, the President of the Moscow Union of Journalists Paul Husus, and the President of the President of the Human Rights Council, Mikhail Fedotos.
Furthermore, according to God's words, the Royal Surveillance Guide has even provided to him any guarantee that the license would not be reached before the license was sent.
The Court of Rusbalt showed that, under which laws are more safely available in Russia today, there is a major issue.
Syria has destroyed a carriage equipment
Syria has destroyed all the declared powers for the production of chemical weapons and recognized the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
The first stage of the disarmament has finished the day before the deadline.
By 1 November, Syria should be destroyed production and other subsidiary objects intended for the preparation of slaughter-related substances.
The destruction of the same substance or its chemical components should be completed in the midst of 2014.
According to the representative of the OHCHR, there are currently similar substances in printed storages.
International inspectors were sent to Syria after more than 1400 people died at Damaskus 21 August during the chemical attack.
The main task of the inspectors was not to lose time - so that the Syrian authorities would not allow more chemicals - and destroy the infrastructure to mitigate chemicals and munitions.
These productive powers will now be carefully observed so that they do not allow them.
The next century, in the midst of November, the OHCHR and the Syrians must agree to the detailed plan of destruction of existing materials.
A lot of questions here.
Where will they destroy?
Who will provide this equipment?
All Syrian declarations will be carefully checked by Western Intelligence Services.
They are willingly recommended to the inspectors of new objects to check if the reason for suspecting that Damask is not opened before the end.
The United States believe that the shooting was carried out by regular armies.
Syria and Russia argued that this is the case of Syrian rebellion.
The world community was required from the Syrian leadership, in accordance with the agreement reached by Russia, to destroy or bring all powers to produce gas and heat and to fulfil the equipment of these substances.
Now, when this stage comes, the next step should be the destruction already in the Syrian armed army.
It is suggested that the arsenal may be more than 1000 tons of nervous and parallel substances, every nitrogen gas and other prohibited chemicals covered in several decades of different places.
In order to destroy it, the OHCHR and the Syrian authorities must start agreed with the graph of action, two weeks.
The Supervisor of Field Operations OHHHH, Gerry Smith, declared that his inspectors were "normally observed for the destruction of the equipment".
"They are now not able to make further production or discharge of chemical weapons", he said.
The OHCHR states that the inspectors visited 21 of 23 objects in Syria and convinced that equipment and similar substances were destroyed or inconsistent.
The remaining two objects are too dangerous to conduct the inspection in the document, but the equipment was transferred and checked by OMS specialists.
According to Smith, the destruction of the infrastructure of chemical production was particularly unlikely, as it was necessary to work in the continuing conflict.
At the beginning of October, the Nobel Peace premium received, but, as Smith said, the time to repair it was to the inspectors until there was not found - they were too busy.
John Carry says in his unprecedented recognition that the US spy “is gone unpleasantly far”
John Carry demonstrated the smoothing tactics of the United States coverage programs, acknowledging that in some cases the U.S. spy “is gone far away”.
The secretariat also acknowledged that, in addition to Barack Obama, it was “in the car drive” during the exhibition of the speech disbursements of Edward Snowden on the ANB.
The information losses were made by the United States Government in the centre of diplomatic scandale with their associators.
Mr. Carry, on a videoline at the open Government conference in London, said: “No doubt that the President and I have, as well as other Government members, have actually taken some of the cases on the car pilot, because this is already existing, and during the Second World War, and in the very difficult years of war, and of course, 11 September”.
He then became the first member of the United States high-employed Government, acknowledging that the U.S. Spionship was too far, but stressed that no rights were violated.
He said: “In some cases, it came unpleasantly.
And the President has decided to shut the light on this issue and explain to the people, and now has a careful analysis for no one feels of malnutrition.
Indeed, I believe in you that there is no innocence against the unbelievers in this process.
Mr. Carry insisted, however, that the ANB had worked out of good dealings and that his surgery operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We are working in the new world where people are ready to be injured.
In the world there is a radical extremism, an unreasonable and full determination to kill people, to attack people and to attack the Government.
And if you were able to overlook it, would you stop it before it happens?
We actually prevented the violations of aircraft, building explosions and murder because we had been able to know about these plans."
Among the subject, American legislators are sent to Europe to help address questions related to the United States shooting spy and to convince Europeans in the need to continue joint anti-terrorism events with the United States, said the Chairman of the Senate on European Affairs in November.
The Senator of the Connectolic State, Chris Merfi, said that he had interfered with members of the European Parliament and other persons on this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorism organizations because of distress in connection with the national security Agency.
“In the interests of the United States national security, the Europeans remain our partners with regard to our common anti-terrorism efforts,” said the Democracy, who works at the first time and is the Chairman of the International Senate on European Affairs, at Washington interview.
- And I go to Europe to understand that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their angry with these ANB programmes."
News that ANB had collected millions of telephone talk records in Europe, have deteriored the relationship with some United States unions, although the head of the Agency has stated that they were incertain and reflected the uncertainness of metal data collected by NATO and shared with the United States.
Other disbursements were made by Snowden, which showed that ANB had performed the monitoring of the mobile phone of the office of Germany Angela Merckel, as well as the phones of some 34 other world leaders.
The Director of National Intelligence James Clapper protected the spiriting activities against the unions as necessary and said that it was a common case with both sides.
On the basis of this smile, Murphy said that his office is organizing a trip of members of the Congress, which is expected to be traveled this year, and he hoped that the delegation would enter both parties and the two rooms.
The names of other participating legislators should be heard in the nearest days.
He said that the travel program is still at the stage of development.
Although Murphy stated that the purpose of traveling was to improve relations, he said that some of the “related rates of best convictions” would also be shown.
He said that European leaders should be honest with their people in which spirit programs themselves were used for many years.
“On as we can change our restraint programmes to better protect European rights, they must also agree with the fact that we are not the only ones who are in knowledge,” said Murphy.
Mr. Carry should be sent to those weekends in the Middle East and in Poland to address the problems of enemy with regard to the United States Strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the disclosure activities of the United States.
The new compositions of the public observing commissions increased the impact of prisoners
Today the Council of the Joint Palestinian (OP) may adopt new compositions of the public observing committees in 43 Russian regions.
If a vote is adopted, the troops will increase their influence.
OHCHR is public structures that control the conditions of freedom of imprisonment.
The case of Sergey of Magnita and Leonida Distribuiev, the emergence in the copy colony, which is, through the UNHCR, has been resigned to most of the resonance events.
The UNHCR control is the fight between human rights defenders and forces lobbyists.
At the meeting of the ODA Working Group on the Formation, I proposed to make a criteria for choosing the experience of human rights activities.
"He didn't accept and formed the lists, but did not develop criteria," says Valery Bourjev.
Bore is the present Chairman of the Moscow Observatory Commission and the Association of Independent Observers, the Russian Alliance Structure of Human Rights Protectors in prison problems.
In the event of Mr. Gosmith, he developed the law which regulates the activities of the UNHCR.
The OOP Council should vote for UNHCR compositions in 43 countries.
At 1800 vaccines, less than thousands of desires have been claimed, and in Ingustain and Kabardino Balkara the competitors had not been able to organize because of the lack of candidates.
The OOP promises to organize a donation on vaccine places.
OCN Moscow is one of the few committees with competitors, despite the new composition instead of 20, 40 participants.
According to Borneva, the current composition of the capital Commission of 11 human rights defenders and 9 forces, and the variation that is on the vote in the OP, is changed to 17 to 23.
In that respect, 30 human rights defenders wanted to be held in the capital Commission.
The new composition can reiterately enter the representative of God's Brotherhood Vicheslav Callin.
He was a member of the UNHCR for three years, but he never visited prisoners.
Borgeist believes that, by designating his Chairman of the UNHCR, forces will be able to do the work of human rights defenders inexperienced, so the rights defenders do not exclude collectively from the Commission.
They believe that the movement of forcers coordinates an UNHCR member of the "Russian Officers" (Russian officers) which remain the interests of the force states.
"I'm not the girls in the trunk," RBK said daily Anton flowers.
He refuses that the prosecution of any lists and said that it is not intended to prevent human rights defenders to visit arrested oppositioners.
According to the Flavick, he did not even interest in which list of votes were now voted in the OS.
The publication of Bore Information is considered a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders is the planning change of the leadership of the Chilebian ONG.
Her former leaders are disabled from the last year's copy care.
The General House concluded that the leadership of the local commission had ignored the problems of prisoners.
And here, the UNO of Rostova-na-don can go from human rights defenders to the forces.
From the new lists "slaughter" the local Chairman of the Chairman of the Commission, one of his opposers was lacked, despite the Federal Public Hall excluded him in May 2013.
The letters of the Moscow and Growth Commission Bourjev is considered a Copeesk's position.
Tolokonian hopes did not affect the UNO of Mordovia, which is considered a "weapon", which was a new composition that had wanted only one human rights defender and had not even adopted documents for competitors.
Member of the OP Nicolay Swanidzee reported RBK daily that he voted against the proposed list, as it was noted by the situation in Moscow and Rostove-na-don.
In his position, he dismissed other members of the Council.
His colleague on OP Paul Guss said that he voted for, since he likes the proposed Moscow list.
He coordinated the preparation of lists of UNO Vice-Secretary OS Vladislav Grib, also as a staff of the FIIN Institute.
The Group told RBK daily that it was not the right to share candidates to human rights defenders and forces and not agreed that the Chairmans of the Commission were sufficiently powerful to prevent its work.
The group is not able to predict the results of the vote of the OOP Council.
If the proposed list is rejected today, the amended option will be made within the next days of the vote.
