The social map of the Jewish area is recognized by electronic payment.
The changes provide the maintenance of rents in the public passenger transport.
From 24 September, it is changed to the organisation of expenses of citizens with the use of the social map of the Jewish area.
According to the Press Service of the Russian Government on the Ivanian area, changes provide the maintenance of rents to the public passenger transport and provide a schedule of mutual accounting on the social map, in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Law No. 161 FZ, the National Payment System.
The social map of the Jewish area is acknowledged by electronic payment.
Consequently, the conditions of its application are changed.
Yes, the complement limit is now not at travels as previous and in the amount of money, with the maintenance of winter and summer periods, not more than 400 rubbers in the summer period, but more than 800 rubbers for the present month.
Now, the social card owners of the asylum vehicles have to be monitored not the remaining number of travels, but the rest of the money.
The value of the loan passenger for citizens is of 1/2 tariffs in the transporter.
The remaining half of the cost of the travel is resetting the environmental budget.
The graphic of complementing social cards remains previously - in the period from 24 of the previous month to 23 of the current month.
The new schedule of social map travel will have a number of advantages.
Similarly, a detailed accounting of the costs of the social map is available to the copy.
Furthermore, there is a possibility of returning, but not expenditure of money.
We also add that the schedule of interactions with transporters is transparent, since the half of the cost of the travel pays the citizens, and the same amount is exactly reimbursed by the budget.
No committee will be invoked on the card.
On the other hand, Vasily Silkin, the Representative of the Department of Trade and Transport of Ivania, reported that in 2014 there were more than 33 million travels in the region with the use of social map, almost 25 million travels in 2015.
In the area budget, more than 470 million rubbers have been provided to citizens with the use of social map.
As at 1 September, the reimbursement for these purposes was more than 312 million rubbers.
At the time of the call, 911 providers are recognized in the murder of a friend
During the call at 911 votes, almost without the driving of the drone of Shannon Lamb, the police told the police that he shot his friend and that he needed staff who would have come home to them.
Lamb emphasized that the house had a pocket that was alive, but it was probably disastrous, and said that the contacts of the members of the family could be found in her phone.
The police found the body of Amy Printis and the note that was validly written from the hand on the white paper: "I'm very sorry, I would like all back, I love Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me," says the note, as the representatives of the Lamb's organs signed.
Nothing indicated that Lamb, who had made two online curses at the University of Delta in Clyde, Mississippi, had lost for 300 miles in the University Camp, where, as the police, he shot all of the respected historical historian of Italy Schmidt at the flight of his office.
The police head of the State of Delta Line Baford reported that university staff had learned about the shooting at 10:18 morning.
He reported that Lamb did the true call at 911 soon after that.
At the end of the day, the victim is on one more: Lamb ended with himself when the police was surrounded.
On the next day after the shooting in the training, students and employees have still tried to hide for locked doors, the body officers still tried to make a model of the Motives built by Lamba.
The information shared by researchers at both ends of the State, as well as students and staff who knew it helped to compose talents, but may be worried about the teacher.
The students told them that they were inclined to wait for his occupation.
The police in Gothi, where Princis died, reported that there were no accused of violence or crime.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in the book written in which he expressed appreciation for the "beauty people" with which he was settled in his preaching life.
Both were presented to the Social Science and History Faculty, which contains 17 providers, and many students visited lessons.
At the same time, there were some suggestions of problems.
One student who was well calling about Lamb, Brandon Bivers, reported that he was so nervous and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Six, reported that Lamb at the end of the 2014-15 school, told him how he was fighting with stress.
Lamb requested the University of the Delta to give him a license for sickness, said he had some health problems.
In this year, he provided only two online curses.
Recent changes in the university rules were made to work that a doctor's stage, whose work was so continuous, would not guarantee him the automatic receipt of the prosecutor's post.
The President of the University of William Laford reported that he had nothing to know about the conflict between Lambo and Shimed, but "It is apparently, Mr. Lamba had something in mind".
These are questions that Lamb can't answer.
The police attacked Lamba after his flying from the camp when he returned to the Mississippi from Arkansa.
Before he was able to arrest, Lamb was shooted from the rear arm of 38 calibra on the back of the house, a mile south of the house of his parents in the Greenville camp, Mississippi, reported the king of Washington Metel Johnson around.
His car with the driver still standed on the road.
It was unreasonable why Lamb came to this house, although Johnson said she thought he knew the people living in him.
The lamb grows in those lands.
Lamb began to work at the university, with a population of about 12000 students in 2009 and delivered geography and pedagogy.
He received a stage of the doctor's pedagogical science in the same early year.
One of the old friends of Lamba described it as a wise, charistical and pleasant man.
Karla Haarston told her that she was 15 and 20 years old, when they met through common friends.
She and her friends were learning in older classs, and he was an older boy, who tried to learn to play her on a guitare for a few years.
In those years, he was successful in women.
All the girls were thief when he was close," says Hairston, who is now 40 and who lives in Jesson, Brando's emperor.
Lamb and Princess at the moment of the events, looks like they've met some time.
During the call at 911 Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but the record of their marriage is not available.
A couple had a song named Latining, who lived with them in Gotya in a cyrpic house, which is the side of the channel.
According to the police, the dog's all right.
The former husband of Princess, Shawn O'Stin, reported that they had been defeated 15 years ago, but they remained friends, and that they had a daughter now 19 years old.
"It's totally rewarded," told O'Stin about the daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stin said he didn't meet Lambo, but he heard from her daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and playing blues.
Lamb met Princess when he and Abigail were both talking about a summer celebration three years ago.
Then they played together from time on the ports.
O'Stin told his daughter to write music and poet.
Prentis was a nursing and worked online on different companies.
Mike Shafer, barmen and jointly developer coordinators in the shocked bar The Julep Room in the front of Gotia said that he last time saw Lamba and Princess on September 5, when Lamb ended playing on a guest and a skin warm for a few visitors.
No suspect has been observed.
"There's a very happy couple," he said.
We enjoyed each other.
The two of them were very strict.
Schmidt, who was killed by a primary seminar and specialized in the history of indigenous Americans and colonial Americans, told Don Allan Mitchell, the employer of English in the same school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at the Kansas State University in Emporia and was the President of the Study Brotherhood and the Study self-administration.
At the Cleveland State University Championship on Tuesday, about 900 people, including universities, staff, students and community members, were attended in the Memorial Chamber.
Ms. Schmidt Liz and Brother Jeff Schmidt were also presented at the ceremony, during the university crowd of Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Adoptions will be restored in the midst.
"We're trying to return our students," said Laforge.
Crisis's gone.
Today's rebuilding day.
Amy and Rochelio Solys reported from Clilland, Mississippi.
The report was helped to prepare the authors of Associated Press Emili Watster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santan in New Orlean.
Material was revised with regard to the police statement that Lamba called for 911 after the murder of Schmidt, as well as with the fact that, although Lamb and talked about Printis as his wife when he called on 911, the information that they had been married was not confirmed.

Michael J. Fox is about the witnesses with the princess of Diana
The first film "Nazad in the future" was for Michael J. J. Fox a major event.
She was still noted for personal reasons.
"We sat in the film theatre and waited for the arrival of the Queen's family members, I noticed that the place is freely close to me, and I was here to see - the princess of Dian would sit with me in the trial, "he told a documental film "in the time".
It's starting a movie, and here I'm in my head that I'm literally on the distance of the hand cut off and in one false shooting from the testimony with the princess of Walk.
"At time" is a documentary film on Nazad in the future, which includes the interview with Fox, Lie Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as the director Robert Earth and the executive producer Steve Spilbergom.
The first film of Nazad in the future was 30 years ago.
"For me, Spilberg says, it's uncertainly the greatest movie of travels in time that has ever been cut off."
It will be available on VOD, DVD and some film theaters in October.
Head of the United Nations claims that there is no military decision in Syria
The Secretary-General, Pan Guy Mun, reaffirms that Russia's military support for the Syrians, is that for almost five-year conflict " there is no decision", and the growth of weapons only increased violence and suffering for millions of people.
The Head of the United Nations reiterated all participants, including the separated United Nations Security Council, to join and support comprehensive negotiations to find political decision.
Mr. Guy Mun declared the Press Conference in the Middle East that he plans to meeting with the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France at the Ministerial Session of the General Assembly in this month for the discussion of Syria.
He regretted that the disagreement in the Council, as well as among the Syrians and the local authorities, had “the situation of the unreasoned.”
Mr. Guy Mun called for five permanent members to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity that they demonstrated in addressing the issue of the nuclear programme on Iran and in the consideration of the Syrian crisis.
8 survey results shown that Donald Tramp is not angry
Some tried to smell him a shooter.
Others were disappointed from him as a shock.
Some need scandale.
However, as some Republicns are trying to generate the high situation of Donald Trump on the results of the survey, they did not (for the time).
Decades of the last 11 national surveys have demonstrated the advantage of Donald Trumpa in double numbers, and some have been wondering what this means for the magnetic unmovableness in the view of the possibilities of receiving a namement.
Of course, it's just starting a election cycle.
Nothing does mean that Tramp has the opportunity to be appointed by the Republic of the Republic.
Experts pointed out that in 2011, Rick Perry had introduced her best-being popularity in Germany Caine, whom no State had entered in the appointment process.
And there are many reasons why he would be struggled against general elections.
But external groups, such as the "Political Action Committee" Jeba Bush, and the conservative economic group of the "Growth Club", recognize the weaknessing force of Trampa and start to bring their dollars to prevent it.
These are some of the surveys that say that the magnets of immobility are not just a interim phase:
The symptoms of Trampa have turned back to 180 degrees.
Once Donald Trump anonymized its candidate in the mid- June, the survey at the University of Monmouth showed that only two of the 10 Republicns were positively treated with this magnet in the area of immobility.
It was 40 per cent in the midst of July.
It was 52 per cent at the beginning of August.
Six of the 10 Republicns are now positively related to Donald Trampo.
About three of the 10 says that they have a negative view.
And all of these indicators are obtained at the main stages.
The issue of Quinnipiac in Iawa has been identified last week that 60 per cent of the Republicns were regularly related to Trumpus.
Two thirds of the voters for the GOP would be a candidate.
In the question of the CNN/ORC last week, 67 per cent of the Republicns said that they had been "refrigerated " or " satisfaction " if the Trump would become candidate.
Only two of the 10 say they would be "repressed" if he was a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates the same level as Tramp (43 per cent of them say they would be "retroduced" against 40 per cent of those who say the same thing about Tramp).
The next one at the level of relief?
Marco Rubio, who has only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of the Republicns say that they will not be "comforted" or "repressed" if the prosecution of Jeb Bush will be a candidate.
Most Republicans do not consider the temperature of Trampa.
While the Trampa is massively criticized for his joy and distress, 52 per cent of the electoral Republics throughout the country believe that the Magnate is a suitable temperature to be the President, as stated by ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number is in the first country of the closed congregation in the State of Ivoire, where the same 52 per cent of the Republicns believe that he is the one who may be the main team, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 per cent believe that he is not a person who can be effective to post, and almost six of the 10 independent electors say that his temperature is not for the White House, according to the ABC/Post message.
The Republican electioners are close to this idea.
When they're shocking their shoes, the Republican electioners think that Tramp is a strip.
The question of whom was the most reliable winner in the GOP appointment, four of 10 said that Tramp was favorate, according to the CNN/ORC survey for the last week.
That's no longer when four of the 10 were put to Jaba Bush at the end of July.
Full discharge: GOP electioners have never had the right magic crisis.
At the same time, in the past cycle, four of the 10 Republicns elected Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 per cent were supported by the possible candidate Mitt Romney.
However, this indicates that numerous GOP elections consider the trampa campaign to be convinced.
Even if the Republicns were shocked around the other candidate, Tramp remained forward to all the other.
Some find that such differences probably play the advantage of Trampa, and that the unsubstitute trampas are equally distributed among more than ten other candidates.
However, the question carried out by the Monmouth University at the beginning of September shows that Trump almost always receives a major support for the hypothetical renovation between the Trump and most other Republican candidates.
He encountered Carly Fiorin at 13 points, Marco Ruby on 14 points, Walker for 15 items, Jab Bush for 19 points and, finally, Randa Pole, John Casich and Christ Christi for 33 paragraphs.
He has nothing with Ted Crewes.
The only candidate who's going to do it?
Ben Carson has shocked the businessers at the total of 19 points in the hypothetical renovation of one.
More than half of Donald Trampa's partners say they're thinking about it.
The new CBS/NYT survey shows that only more than half of the voters who support Trampa are sure in their votes.
Of course, many may happen and change the situation, and no one can actually say that he never changes.
46 per cent says they leave the door open for other candidates.
However, the most pressed competition in Trampa at this time is with the colleague-autsider of Ben Carson, but electors who say they have thought that they would probably choose Traampa.
Six of the 10 Republicns say they agree with the Tramp on Immigration.
Since Donald Tramp had called immigrants from Mexico in their open-ended campaign, the theme of immigration became the most active in the discussions in 2016.
Some are worried that Trampa's garage would reverse the key electioners from the Republic of America from the Republic of America and prevent rebounding.
However, in accordance with the question of ABC/Post held on Monday, six of the 10 Republicns said they agree with Trampo in immigration issues.
Thus, until the immigration focused on the general attention, it seems that Donald Tramp remains at the same position.
The distress of the Government has new trafficking.
Donald Tramp and Ben Carson are now supporting almost half of the Republican electioners, mainly due to their status of authsseiders.
Six of the 10 Republicns on Monday, ABC/Post states that they wish to be a political athlete than a man with experience in the Government.
And they're also buried at Washington.
The question Des Moines Register/Bloomberg, held two weeks ago, shows that three of the four Republicns in Iwai have been disappointed by the activities of the Republicns in the Congress, with 54 per cent of "needed" and 21 per cent of "in agestion".
The Government decides to the Court of Pension Indexes in October.
Vice-Premier RF Olga Holga Gordoch said that the Government now searched for the implementation of the Pension Index Act in 2016 to a real inflation level.
She noted that the decision should be found at 8 October at the time of the budget for the next year to the Government.
In addition, Cambodia discusses the option of proliferation of the decisions on the raw pension of the Russian assaulting pension.
The head noted that the amount of pensions was equal to 350 billion rubbers.
The amount of pension index is almost the same for the next year.
According to Vice-Premier, there is no final decision on the question of whom should pay contributions for non-employed citizens.
The head believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not relate to, in this case, to the socially protected categories of citizens, it is not absolutely fair that it pays the society for it.
Previously, the media reported that there were two options of the guest balance in the castle.
Why are they often disappointed and corrupted?
The doctor-oftalmologist Tatiana Levashwa answers:
Our centuries are the widths that protect the eye ball from many small parts that are on them.
When we forget regular cleaning, we often contribute to the development of the literature.
Easy Output:
Don't three eyes with a smooth hands, with a special helmet of power for the dwelling;
It shall not be 1-2 times a day purify the land from those covered in them for the day of harmful substances.
cleaning procedures are limited to complement and warm compressions with the disappearance of milk grass (shalfey, routines), smooth secrets of salt irons, and then the mass of the shoes, which should be carried out by the circle movement of thicks;
As a maquillage, don't use spot-containing materials.
They smell and smell the skin and contribute to further protection of the secret of salt irons.
The Phone claims that the Korean nuclears have created an atomic fighter.
North Korea's authorities reported that the main nuclear reactor in the country was the nuclear complex in Yonban.
This report was found at the Headquarter of the Land Telegraph Agency.
It is noted that, at any time, the CDC is ready to respond to the "agression and nuclear threat of the United States" and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons as a number and quality.
The last test of nuclear weapons of North Korea has been carried out in 2013.
In that regard, the reactor has not been reported on the full rebuilding plans since then.
The Phone claims that he was able to create an atomic fleet.
Also, the CDR has not performed a medium and little duration test, writes polit.ru.
The Jurinium was necessary to get out of the Russian giant the mention of the brothers.
Leader LDPR Vladimir Jurinois believes that the national guimin should take note of the unity of the brothers' folks.
In this regard, he declared during the Gospel meeting, reports the Russian News Service.
Who are these people now?
Fashisters and killers!
"The longest jinn, the longest of the world, even the sports aren't overlooked," said Jillrinus.
The deputy believes that it is necessary to remove all the fourths in which it is found:
In the late 2014, the Jürinus stated that the present jinn had to be replaced by the "God, the king of the guards" and the Russian tricolor to replace the Imperial flag, writes polit.ru.
Asad urged all forces to join terrorism.
The President of Syria Bashar Assad called all forces to join terrorism.
Asad is sure that if Europe wants to address the problem of refugees, they should stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not that Europe takes or does not take refugees, but that it is necessary to eliminate the first cause of this problem.
If Europeans worried the judge of refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
This is our view of this problem.
"In this is the question of refugees," he said in the interview.
We must continue dialogue on behalf of the consensus.
However, if we want real success, they are impossible until people die, while bloodproliferation continues and people feel fully safe.
"We can thus achieve consensus, but we can not realize anything until we won terrorism in Syria," said Asad.
Remember, some 5000,000 migrants have arrived in the European Union for this year, including Syria.
The European Union stated that the current migration crisis in the world was greater since the second World War.
It is not excluded that among the arrival of migrants in Europe, thousands of the extremist group "Islam State" bombs can be found.
Members of the terrorism organization, prohibited in Russia, may use the situation to create their cells in the EU to carry out terrorist activities.
The people of the German city have established a festival for refugees.
In the last month, Germany became a leader for refugees' receipt, although recently she has enhanced the border control to keep them pressed.
According to the authorities, about 8000,000 migrants will arrive in Germany until the end of this year, although some experts are called significant numbers.
Since September, more than 90,000 refugees have arrived in the country.
Correspondent Bi-bi-si Jenny Hill was located in the city of Darmstadt, whose migrants are very warm.
Jeremy Corbin addresses the questions of the Prime Minister
After elections, Mr. Corbina has been dealing with the question of the Prime Minister ' s session
The new leader of the Lebourist Party, Jeremy Corbin, will immediately take place at the meeting of the Prime Minister's first session, mediting with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbin will speak with the first six of the second half of the issues in the second half of the day; for his statement, the press and the members of the Parliament of the Leyborist Party will probably be able to follow the press and members of the Laybourist Party.
He called " less theatre and more facts " at a weekly demonstration talk.
He also said that he could leave some meetings by leaveing them to their colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corbin as a leader; it will be held after the appointment of the Ten and his speech at the Thursday Year Congress on Thursday.
As a result, the leader of the lebourists decided to remain silent during the fulfilment of the national giant at Tuesday, the 75-year-old Best of Britain was criticized by a number of conservative members of the Parliament and became the subject of a number of previous articles in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbina's decision did not sing the public jinn attention
Mr. Corbina's secretary stated that he was "in almost silence" and acknowledged "the heroism of the Royal VS in Bitwe for Britain".
However, a member of the Tenor Office, Mr. Corbino Owen Smith, reported Newsnight to BBC 2, that he would recommend the leader of the Leaders to sing a national "independence" from his confidence in the need to cancel the monarchy.
A few ten ministers refused to play in the team, Mr. Corbin, with a disagreement on economic, defence and international policy, while at least one sixth members of the parliamentary party supported it as a leader.
The Political Correspondent BBC Robin Brant said that political differences are also covered in the labour party after the appointment of Mr. Corbin for posts in the European Union and the limitation of compensation payments by the Government.
Mr. Corbin declared at the Conference of Tree-Unionians that the Laybourist Party had amended the concept of restrictions in general.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, the Dark Minister of Labour and Pension payments stated that there was a "complete clearness" in the party that it was only in opposition to the Government's plans to reduce the upper limit from 26,000 feet to 23,000 feet.
Mr. Corbin will be the fifth leader of the Labourists whom David Cameron meets in the "Corry Box" for the last ten years since he became the leader of the Conservation Party.
The leader of the lebourists, who promised another approach to policy, states that he had “approved collective resources” to take the ideas of Mr. Cameron and received more than 30,000 proposals.
Member of the Parliament on the circle of Ilington Nort said that the question of the Prime Minister is a extreme conflict, and that it would be dealt with and from the strict answers and exchange of colleagues, instead, promised to concentrate on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and problems faced by youth.
Mr. Corbin stated that Angel Ygel, Minister of Economy in the Canadian Tower, would replace him on the matters of the Prime Minister when he would miss, for example, when Mr. Cameron is outside the border.
He also heard the idea to allow other colleagues to say, if possible, that he had addressed the Palestine of the John Burkou Community to discuss this issue.
As a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron stated that he wanted to go from the political style of " maritime ballaghan " often associated with the procedure of the Prime Minister but acknowledged a few years later that it couldn't.
Since the first transmission in 1990, the Prime Minister was the key indicator of leadership, their ability to manage the House of the Communities and the reputation to other members of the Parliament, although the critics claim that this has become a cartoon and requires a major reform.

The sterling fund increases in payment rates in Britain
The Front increased in the fund of payment in Britain, with the FTSE 100 index, thanks to the purchase of SABMller.
From May to June of the wages in Britain, as a result of the Bonuss, increased by 2.9 per cent compared to the same period last year.
The growth has been the highest rate since 2009, and it was gathered as an early period of prevention on possible cotton growth.
The sterling fund increased more than 1 per cent in relation to $1.5505 and $1.84 per cent for euros, was $1.3730.
FTSE 100 increased to 6229.21 per cent.
The SABMller shares were generally increased by 20 per cent through the purchase proposal from AB InBev competition.
The process would combine two larger drinking companies in the world, gathering such burdens as Budshair, Stela Artois, Butni and Grolsch.
Burberry's actions have grown by 0.9 per cent on the basis of the useful news from the competitive group of trade producers in the class of Lux Richemont.
Recently, Richemont's sales data overlook all the expectations and showed that selling in China is on the key market for Burberry, again starting to grow.
Glencore shares increased by 5 per cent after the guigner claimed that the amount of $2.5 billion was to be obtained by the allocation of actions under the Debt Reducing Strategy.
The Moondi Paper production groups and packaging material shares were the leaders of the index - 4.3 per cent - after Goldman Sachs decreased the shipping group to "produce".
JD Sport shares have grown after the company's sporting clothes reported that 83 per cent of the growth was reached for half a year to 46.6 million feet.
Head JD Sports says that higher payments may prevent expansion
The Executive Director of JD Sports Peter Kauguill said that the increased minimum payment for British workers is “more purchasing capacity in the carneys of potential consumers”.
But it is unlikely that such purchasing capacity will exceed the value of the job costs.
The costs could affect JD expansion plans, adding that it could mean reducing the number of additional vaccines.
Metcash launchs a initiative under the initiative to fight Native Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA purchase from the Aldi button in South Australia and Western Australia.
The OECD Food Manufacturer launched a market share of IGA riders in South Australia and Western Australia in the light of the future income of Aldi 700 million dollars.
While Aldi is prepared for opening two optical equipment and first of 120 businesses in South and West Australia at the beginning of the next year, the Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening the relationship with local food providers and through IGA marketing in leading media and social networks and the type of "Adelaide Show".
The campaign joins rituals and suppliers of IGA, such as the manufacturer of the marine Simmo's in Dansboro, which proposes degustization in IGA shops, and owners of shops that sell permanent tickets on the football League of South Australia.
It is expected that Metcash will develop more details of its protection strategy on 29 September - day when this advanced supplier of food, drinking and domestic products will take place on its annual day of investor strategies.
There is a small number of extents, since in South Australia and Western Australia, the IGA shop is almost 30 per cent of all Metcash shops and shows higher rentness than the Metcash IGA network in Eastern States.
The purchasers in South and West Australia are known as an accurate router, so the market is more favourable for IGA riders than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland states - more than 30 per cent in the UK and 24 per cent in the U.A., compared to approximately 14 per cent in Eastern States.
However, analysts, such as Morgan Stanley, believe that Aldi is 5 per cent of the food market in these two states for 12 months after the opening of its first shops, taking the number of events in all present players, but mainly in independent rituals.
In the report published this week, Tom Kirat, Morgan Stanley analysis, believes that IGA ritories can lose $360 million per year and Metcash $2,2 million to the end of 2016.
The project was based on the permission that Aldi is opening 25 shops in SA and 30 WA in the next year, purchasing $500 million and $600 million respectively on these markets.
The loss of the feed and sales of food at high-level Metcash costs may contain about 13 million income for payment and taxes, Mr. Kirat.
At the same time, Metcash lost the share of the market in Eastern States, mainly from Aldi and Coles, and this is the recent study of Morgan Survey found that the most faithful purchasers of IGA have been in the GA.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash food sales will be 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reduced the market company rate from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent to 2020.
Last week, the director of the Fundamental Manager Hamish Duvolus, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, noted that Metcash could " have been able to disappear for decades.
The Metcash company refused publicly to comment Mr. Duclass' comments.
But it is suggested that the member of the Mecash company's Directors Board had been linked to Mr. Duclass last week.
The IGA market share was decreased from 2010 from 18 to 14 per cent, and Metcash income from food products undertaken by some 1200 IGA rhythms was 43 per cent compared to 2012, as a result of the operational defence and the pressure on sales and retailability rates.
However, the company does not pay more than 150 million dollars annually because of balanced prices in Coles and Woolworths for thousands of weekly positions and supporting IGA rituals in the rebuilding of trade spaces, as well as proposing a rapid expansion of raw products and more wide selection of corporate food products.
The Director-General Metcash Yen Morris said that the balance of prices and restructuring of trade areas is covered and hopes that the company will increase the clean arrive in 2017, first in four years.
Tanasy Cokinskis supports President Tennis Australia Steve Hile
Tanasy Cookinskis has a feasibility, not critical for their conduct.
Tanasy Cookinakis has recently suffered in a skandal around his friend Nick Kirros and has been more than critical, as President Tennis Australia Steve Hilly says.
Cookinakis, a young man in the talent and often called "Special Ks" was unnecessaryly focused on the turn of Montreal Masters.
Shortly after that, in the time of a warm qualified shop in Cincinits, the judges had two times to discover Cokinskis and his opposer Ryan Harrison, said, "The Bavarians had to put on the Kyross shoes, and I have to put on the shoes of this guy."
As the last time Cookies saw a smooth missile after Rishara Gaske saved his feet from the possible struggle on the United States, Hili was loyally protected by the Cookies.
Young people are currently in Glasgo, struggling with Sam Grood for the right to be second after Bernard Tommych in the single routine of Kubuc Davis against Britain.
"I'm so worried about one thing, namely that Tanasy had been in the conflict," said Hilli.
He really broke a missile when he had a feet open to the US, but he wasn't the first player who shooted the missile when the hope was shocked, and I know Tanzay's enough good enough to be sure that he wouldn't be proud of it.
But in fact, he had a very well-bearing situation in the United States, with Harrison and etc., and I'm sure he's trusting.
He's around a good team, he's a beautiful family, and I just think he's done a little unrighteous.
He's a very nice 19-year-old man, he's working much, well in the team, he has never had problems with other players, he's respecting it outside the cort, he's training intensely, he's in a good form, he's a very widespread and developed young man, and I think he's supposed to be assessed by dignity.
Hilli also supported the decision to forgive Kiros for the important shop that started on Thursday, thinking that it was a right way for all, but considering that the man from Canberra returns to the team as a long-term player.
"Whatever we want, we want the team to focus on the match, not on the conversation around [Krisos]," said Hills.
And I think that Nick's got a strong force that proves to people like the Federer and Mareya, he grows up in the public, lets a number of serious errors and benefits all the critical that he receives, but we try to help him understand the consequences of his action, and I need to take him out of the center of attention for some time to think about them, and that's better for the team and the best for it.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary announces an emergency situation, closes the border, delays migrants
In the statement of an emergency situation, Hungary turned the border with Serbia on the south of the border and deduces those who are trying to spend illegally in the country to keep the slow inside the migratory river.
A hundred migrants were collected on the border, and the Serbian authorities were extremely negative.
At an uncertain time, the road between the control-up points of two countries, people flying from armed violence in their family, disappeared the palms and settled on this place.
Nevertheless, injury has been struck.
When the police helicopter circled over them, the migrants cryed to "Close the border" and cryed the distortion in the address of the venerian police.
Some protest dismissed food and water.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Serbia announced the "unacceptable" expulsion of migrants from Hungary, when they are increasingly coming from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the problem addressed, not by a co-conciliating damage.
The next days we have to take negotiations with Brussels and other countries," said in the Prague of the Ivy Darchich.
Volunteers at the Venice-Serba border started on the next day after the block of 28 countries could not develop a common immigration policy at the joint meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed to provide a general responsibility for 40,000 persons who were looking for refugees in the overlaped Italy and Greece, and expressed hope that in the future (in the next month or at the end of the year) will be reached an agreement that the European States will receive more than 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
The President of Germany, Angela Merckel and Austria, had to gather on Tuesday, next week, a extreme Summit of Europe to discuss an immigration crisis covering the continent.
Hungary, however, is not hoped of rapid action from Brussels or neighbors.
The emergency situation announced in Tuesday in two southern regions gave the authorities more powerful action towards the crisis, which allowed them to switch the road and accelerate the cases of rescue.
As a result, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Venice Peter Siyarto stated that his country plans also to switch up from the slopes of the border with Romania to move migrators through the country when it was completed in the Serbian border.
The Correspondent CBS News Charles Dagata reported that even prisoners had been connected to an urgent work on the end of the shipment between England and Serbia.
In the past few months, Hungary became the main "looking place" and the point of movement of the border of Europe for the population, many of which are refugees, the victims of war in Syria and the Western countries.
However, Prime Minister of State Victor Orban insists that most people who arrive in the country are economic migrants who are looking for more well-being than refugees are victims of military action that have the right to protect, and that point of view is closely separated with the views of other EU countries, etc., Germany.
New laws entered into force in Hungary are now considered a crime of transfer of 4 meters (13 feet) injury from the slaughter of the Government towards the southern border with Serbia, and are also more long terms of prison for the trafficking of people.
" The Venezuelan Government, due to the situation of the mass migration, declares an emergency situation", stated journalists to the Government of Seltan Kovach in the southern city of Segad.
We understand clearly: the illegal transition of borders is a crime.
Regularly, the Parliament should still authorize the location of military forces that is expected for the next week, but the Associated Press reporters, which are on the border, have already observed there for a few days the presence of armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs.
Dear Bacondy, the Consequent for National Security, reported about 45 persons who tried to cross the border at the border, and 15 other persons within the country.
They have crossed the border, cutting the ships, now under the police detention and accused of judicial violations of new laws.
The authorities quickly restore the seat.
The Vienna authorities also closed two of the seven passengers on the border with Serbia on Tuesday morning, striking to block one of the carriage vagons with a swimming shock.
Orders were shocked through the main slope of the border around the city of Riosk (Hungary), as the cities were placed in the serviceplace for the slope of people within the metal container, and the shoes gave each other to interrupt.
There were about 20 people inside, and thousands of people remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main car carried out from Serbia to Hungary and announced the refusal of food and water until they were transferred to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hilary Clinton's priority on Bernard Sanders has reduced two in national survey
The former secretariat Hillary Clinton continues to keep the double advantage of democracy for the namement throughout the country, but Mr. Bernie Sanders approve it.
Clinton is now supported by 47 per cent of the primary democratic electioners (lower 58 per cent) and Sanders is a second of 27 per cent (more than 17 per cent).
Vice-Chairperson Joe Bayden, who has not yet announced whether he would participate in the presidential chain, receives 15 per cent of the primary democratic electors.
Over five months prior to the beginning of the conflict on the primary elections, most democratic elections say that it was too early to say that they were determined with the candidate to support.
Clinton's parties are more confident in their election, whether other candidates are supported.
Since the CBS News survey in the last month, Clinton lost support for some demographic groups, Sanders reached a number of cups.
Clinton holds a great advantage between women and dead, but it has decreased.
Her support among men is significantly disappeared, and Sanders remains on paragraph 5 of it.
The preference for Clinton's democratic electors for 50 years is gone, and they're with Sanders at the same time.
But Clinton still has a great advantage among the senior electors.
In the last month, Clinton has doubled Sanders to a double number of Liberals, but Sanders now has the advantage of 5 points in this group.
Another half of the primary democratic elections throughout the country say they would support Clinton if it would be a candidate to this party.
Fourth would support her with some reservations, and 15 per cent would support her only because it was candidates.
Six percent would not support it.
It may be unexpected that Clinton's current partners may probably show more enthusiasm on her account.
Among those who are not supporting Clinton at this time would have been more contrary - only some four with an enthusiasm.
While 48 per cent of the primary democratic elections say that they would have supported Clinton with enthusiasm, less than the Republican electioners say the same leader, Donald Tramp (35 per cent).
When a open question to the partners of Clinton is why they want to see her candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the necessary experience (16 per cent), then that the present time of the Chairman (13 per cent), and that it is the best candidate to this post (10 per cent).
Clinton's partners also speak of the association linked to Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
It is also called an agreement on issues and opportunities for election.
As Vice-President considers potential participation in the elections, 57 per cent of the primary democratic elections would like to be joined to the chief, although the third believes that it should not.
When they ask who they would like to see in the second place among the candidates of the party, the primary democratic elections in most cases call Bayden.
Among Clinton's most half says they would have chosen Byden to the second, it's more than Sanders.
If Bayden decides not to put his candidate from the Democratic Party, Hilary Clinton's advantage will increase from 20 points with Bayden from 30 points without it.
Fifty-five per cent of the democratic elections see the candidate with the best chances of winning in general elections, but the number has reduced from 78 per cent in the last month.
According to the Bayden, with a large departure on the second place, but the percentage of those who believe it is the most reliable candidate has increased.
However, with the answer to the question that the most important thing in the candidate, democratic elections choose other options except the opportunities to be elected.
Similarly the situation in the last month, no candidates from democracy or potential candidates are an unacceptable nomination for these primary electors.
The candidates from democracy, or potential candidates, have shown good results on some key characteristics among the primary electors from their party.
Most believe that Clinton, Sanders and Bayden are honest and reliable to trust in people with good leadership.
Byen of all three is leading honestity, and Clinton's strong side in its leaderships.
30 per cent of the primary democratic elections do not consider Clinton a honest and rewarded trust, two times more than those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent have no view of it in this account.
The primary democratic elections generally consider similar ideological views of Clinton, Sanders and Bayden.
For all of these measures, some four democratic electioners have no view of Sanders.
Although the issue of the personal e-mail sheet and the server at Hillar Clinton continues to be slaughtered by the secretariat, most democratic electioners are satisfied with its explanation on this account and believe that this has not affected the general view of it.
But it's a very different story in the American public in general.
The half of the Americans today have not been satisfied with its explanation and only about a third.
The public's views were further divided in March, soon after the story was known.
Most Americans say that there was no impact on the Clinton ' s general view, although 36 per cent said that their opinion was worse.
The Republicans, more than six of each 10, claim that their views about Clinton have been worse.
Even though Clinton is considered honest and worthy of confidence from its party, it continues to be a problem among the registered electors in general: only 32 per cent of its honest and rewarded trust, at eight paragraphs below than the last month, and 15 compared to her mother.
Sixty-2 per cent of the electors registered does not consider its honest and rewarded trust.
At the same time, 55 registered electioners throughout the country do not consider the Trumpa honest and reliable trust.
However, both Clinton and Tramp are good marks on leadership.
From the six protested candidates of Bayden, Carson and Bush showed the best results of honestity.
Most people see in Sanders more honest man than not, but, like Carson, many have no view of it.
The error for the selection of 351 primary democratic elections is 6 per cent.
On the basis of the national survey, Ben Carson approached Donald Trampo
Ben Carson came to Donald Trampoo in the last CBS/New York Times survey
Two of these candidates made half of the elections in the new survey, left all the other in the search for opposites under the footsteps
The Republican electioners throughout the country continue to support Trampa massively, which has increased from 23 per cent in recent CBS-related discussions on Fox News in the last month, to 27 per cent in the summary conducted in Sunday.
But Carson fled the same period from 6 to 23 per cent.
The survey also showed that Carson was supported in all demographic groups, confusioning Trampa in the group of representatives with higher education.
Recent candidates, except Carly Fiorin and Ogayo John Kascha, have been displaced with the Governor Viscals Scott Walker, whose support has fallen from 10 per cent in the last month to 2 per cent.
Ancient Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, former Governor, Mike Hacabi and Senator of Florida Marco Rubius, are working together with the third place of 6 per cent.
The error for the election of 376 representatives in this new investigation was 6 per cent, which was held in September.
The recent CNN/ORC survey, published last week, showed the growth of Carson in the surveys, demonstrated 19 per cent of the Republicns, with 32 per cent of the support of the Trump.
The last survey of ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Tramp was significantly infringed by Carson.
With regard to the growing support of Carson, the last week, Traamp made a number of critical accidents to the former neurochirurg address, even when Carson regreted that the Trump's faith was doubtful.
"We need energy," said Trump in the past Saturday during the shutting of the Ivoire campaign.
Four brothers are accused of the death of the first college Baruch
About two years later, after the loss of a college, the brotherhood in the mountains of Popono in Pennsylvania was condemned against five persons.
"The members of the Brothers of Pie Delta Psy from New York's New York College, strictly attacked Chana "Mycla" Denga during the dedication of September 2013, and did not put him in the hospital at the time that had been killed by his death," reported to the police.
Official persons say that a student with shocked eyes and 30-four feet sweet smells were touched several times since he tried to achieve the goal, a squad of surface.
Mr. Deng, at the end of the end, welcomed his head and then slowed without awareness.
The members of Pie Delta Psy did not call at 911 when Dengue lost conscience and waited for a time before he was taking it to the hospital, she says to the police.
However, they found time to change the clothes of Dengue, find his symptoms in Gugla and contact with Andy Menng, the National President of Brothers, to ask the Council as he told at the press conference of Chris Wagner.
"In this moment, brotherhood members began to hide personal property, as a result of the well-being of the brotherhood of Michael Dengue's health, " said the chief Wagner.
He couldn't save, and he ended the next morning.
According to the coverage report, Dengue received a number of smells of heads, smells and poor.
“A lot of families suffered from brotherhood rhythms, since at least one student dies during them every year, starting from 1970,” said Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
Brothers and their members should be responsible, and this step by the authorities is very important.
The court boards of Monroe were sentenced for the murder of the third stage for the first five members.
Twenty and two other members, including Mr. Menga, have been accused of violence against news and crime.
"We want to accompany the responsibility not only of the individual parties, but, if there was an organization that has authorized all this officially or informally, it and it", said Vaganer at the Press Conference on Tuesday.
The College Baruch prohibited the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood was excluded from its structure of the local office.
What happens when the Federal Reserve increases rates
The rate increased, and the "float market" is confronted, the income of flows increases, and the economy is declined in recession.
That's what we know.
What we don't know, how long it's going to be, and how long it's going to be.
It is clear to the economy that it explains about time.
The recession started only 11 months after the first increase of rates and totally 86 months.
The validity of the Federal Reserve for Taxes often, although not always, determines the reaction of economic and financial assets.
The United States Central Bank is therefore so slightly emphasized that investors should not focus on the starting of taking taxes and how much the adaptation will take.
Indeed, the multitude of those changed.
At the end of the end, however, the market participants may find that the whole ratio around the increase of the rates is overwhelmd.
The Federal Reserve for Global Financial Crisis will not be safely interpreted by some as a sign of the end of the EE of Deep money,” reported Julian Jessop, the main specialist for the international economy in Capital Economics, in his comments on customers.
On the contrary, we are not expecting that the progressive return of percentage rates in the United States to more normal, but still lower levels will be a semitic impulse that many are threatened.
This does not mean, but it will not be the consequences.
This is how some economies could react in depending on historical trends:
As the market has already been seen in the last month or around, the expectation of increased rates may lead to unemployment at some time.
However, when taxes increased, the consequences are usually not such dramatic.
"It seems to be income from actions at 12-24 months after the first squad, which may be remarkable again in monetary policy," said the German Bank analysis in recent studies on the increased rate of the Federal Reserve.
If specifically, the market is more slightly changed over the past 35 years - about 14 per cent of the rate increase, remains sufficiently equipped for 250 days after that (medium growth, 2,6 per cent), then, after 500 days, returns to the average income of 14.4 per cent of the last six cycles, according to the recent analysis conducted by Bob Doll, the main specialist on the trade strategies in New Asset Management, the public in Barrons.
In Germany, the results of valuable burdens have no tendency to become more expressed at the stage of increased rates, and the income from actions begins to reduce.
Recesions are the fact of economic life, but increased rates often contribute to them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve has put into conditions that have not previously existed and could accelerate the recession.
Mainly, the currency internal product will be almost in its lowest point for the existence of an increased rate.
According to the German Bank, in 118 cases, the tax increase from 1950 was only two times of the nominal annual SFB below 4,5 per cent.
Even in the second trimestre of 2015, he was 3.6 per cent, but few believe that it is long, while only 1,5 per cent of the Atlanta Fed data.
The improvement of the rates to such an instable economic fund may be risked and asks "does it be differently", reported in Germany.
The market participants are prepared to increase the rate of the Federal Reserve System in the whole year, with their view to the meeting of the Federal Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategic and economic experts believe that FOMC could accept increased rates at this meeting, the feast trade is only a 25 per cent possibility.
"In our 1950 study, all cycles of increased rates have been in the supermarket increased financial market in GDP, which predicted the recession, very quickly after the start of recovery, " states the report.
On the contrary, it was a slow rebuilding after the worst recession of the election period.
The current cycle at this time is the length of which the Federal Reserve System had expected from the end of the last recession; the recourse has been 35 months, the total amount of 74 months and has not yet been completed.
The fixed income was also insufficient while the market expects to increase tax rates, and this scenario is somewhat like the one who is implemented for actions.
The principle difference is that the effects are more rapid than for actions when the Federal System changes the strategic course.
In cases of circumstance, the income changes the vector immediately after the first increase/reduce of the cycle.
In the end of the cycle, the income rate is immediately falling", reports Germane.
Charles Schwab’s strategists believe that the increased rates will lead to the approach of long-term and short-term revenue levels and make a more polar.
Interferences with high income often make themselves better in such an climate, although "we are still threatening income", says Cathy Jones, the analysis of the fixed income in Schweab.
It is interested that Johns considers that the markets have already been adapted to the expected results of the federal policy system.
" In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and the fall of inflation expectations, the market has been a more strict monetary policy", wrote it.
The rates of short-term employees have been increased, with a decreased income of more polar, credits continued to be increased, and the flexibility of all market features has increased when the federal system was implemented.
In general, the company that leads to its main business in the United States wins from increased percentage rates, and the local product will become more attractive.
The international companies have long been worse because the increased dollar makes their production more costly in the world market space, and their debt is more costly in financial.
The story shows that the "case" actions demonstrate the effectiveness of the market over three months after the initial increase of the rate", said the Goldman Sachs analysis in the report for customers.
The company with a stability financial condition has been insufficient with the results of each increase in 1994, 1999 and 2004 average of 5 per cent of the rates.
The company with high income of the capital and low-government shares also showed the best effectiveness than low quality shares in average 4 (per cent) and 3 (per cent) respectively.
The end will be a great question.
The company with a high percentage of swimming debts lose more, according to Goldman.
In addition to purchase contracts, the consumers will benefit from an increased dollar.
The income could also be viewed by higher income, although the experts disappeared as fast as this happens.
"BBC Radio 3 - Classic FM copy", states a member of the parliament by Andrew Bingham
Member of the Parliament of Andrew Bingham has discovered the station for "Reducing standards"
It demonstrates that it is less different from the commercial competition
The BBC Music Awards also stressed that the premises are just inconsistent with Brits.
The colleague on the parliament, who has violated The Voice with the same criticism, was not originalized.
"BBC Radio 3 converts to Classic FM," said the leaders of the parliament, encouraging telecommunication to prove that it does something that does not make the commercial company.
The member of the parliament from the Conservators Andrew Bingham also declared the BBC guide that it seems that the public radio "Glupeet" seems to be less different from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 looks like I don't like to use the word "forgiving", but it seems to be classic FM," he said.
He also stressed the BBC Music Awards premium in December.
BBC Music Awards, who was old in the last year, looks like The Brits in other names.
So if you're trying to do something different, this is two examples that first came to me in the mind that you really just copy what you're already on the market," Mr. Bingham said.
The Director-General of the BBC rejected the accusation, claiming that BBC Radio 3 was far forward to his commercial partner when it was related to live music and audio education.
What I know through Radio 3, I don't know anymore about classic music.
And his loyalty to the living statements and the creation of music is indeed not more compared with anyone.
"There is really very important, I think, the interest in Radio 3 in searching for a new music and promoting new events," he said.
The BBC Radio 3 Alan Dave said that radio stations should work much more to take audience than in the past, because the Britishs were less classic musical education.
However, Radio 3 was not the only child of the BBC, which has been attacked by the attacks of the commercial competitors during the hearing of the Special Committee on Cultural, Measures and Sport.
The member of the parliament by Thory Damien Collins attacked The Voice musical shooting, which BBC has purchased in the Dutch Talpa Media for an orientational price of 22 million feet of sterlings.
See why this program is often discussed in the absence of originality and different aspects?
Lord Holl states that BBC 1 show in which Palm Feat and Boy George participated in the typical BBC style.
He adds that the Corporation wants to be "wet in our own home chair" next time she will start a deformation project.
However, it is not necessary to prevent the order of the new sessions of The Voice in the future or the use of money for those who pay the licensing collection for other forms.
The Internet sales rose was maximumly delayed in August, and it may therefore be the Black Five
In the first three months of 2015, the increase of online sales for 7 per cent was observed
Last month, the late growth has been observed since it began to be observed in 2000
Online sales have been actived three years ago by using mobile devices for shoping
Experts are convinced that the New York Black Five could contribute to the sustainment of costs
For some ten years, a vulcanic shooting has experienced a boom, transforming many central streets in Britain to a precaution city.
But experts say that there have been signs of online sales equation, after the last data shown only seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.
The general costs for online-shooting in August have shown minimum growth since they began to fix in 2000, with only 5 per cent increased.
Experts say that there have been signs of online sales balance, after the last data showed only seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at growth in the past years and return back to 2000 g, they have always been reasonable to explain", said Guardian Andy Malkech, editor of the IMRG sale index.
He explained that the online sale has been intensified three years ago when the buyers were using their mobile phones for purchasing.
This means that more people had received the opportunity to buy online, and that they could do it in any condition, for example, sit at the garage.
But now it comes to the payment, and you can see the decline (on growth).
The phenomenon of the Black Pearl, who came from America, mentions as one of the reasons for the delay.
Experts believe that the purchasers could stop the purchase of the event that happens on the last Friday of November.
In the past year, purchasers have spent five times more average to computers to be successfully used by benefiting proposals, with the same violation of the number of sales websites.
Experts believe that the Black Five when purchasers come into the real fight for profital purchase, they could put people up from the chopper
According to the study published by British Retail Consortium, more than 1 pound of sterlings of each 5 is online.
With regard to goods such as television and natural machines, more than one third is sold through the Internet magic.
At the same time, more than four people purchase clothes and eggs online than in modern shops on central streets.
Muslims are guarded by murdered in Mexico, and Ben Laden's family are sanctions
Muslims have the body of 29 deaths on the street, as the first crowds in Mexico are starting
At the same time, Saudi Arabia was a partly guilty for the accident of Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health reported that the total complexity of 394 individuals was also traumated after the crime of the ground
Hundreds of Muslims were shocked on the streets so that 29 of the victims died in the main sword of Mexico.
The mainly obtained in the white part of the cemetery were designed to respect the first of the dead who had been sent to their last path to the Al-Moaisem board.
The special process passed in a sacred place where the building clan had tried the swords and slowed to the desire in a few days before.

Among the dead were the father of four children of Kasim Akram from Bolton, the Great Manchester, who was in his first pallonic journey when he disrupted the clan.
Mr. Akram was in the Grand Sword together with his parents before the start of the annual hage.
Sauditan authorities have already promised that Haj will continue, since thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman said that Binladin Group should not leave the shooting of the shooting in the lack of work.
The Arab version of the Decree, published by the Saudi Press State Agency, states that Binladin Group has a partial guilty for crime.
The English Addition of the News Agency did not tell this detail, but reported that the leaders of the company were prohibited to go outside the country.
Last week, Salman promised to explain the reason for the fall of the crowd in the main sword where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were shocked to go to the hage this month.
The Binladin Group has not made any statements on the abuse of the land, and its representatives were not available for comments.
The Kingdom Decree also condemned the company in non-use of modern security measures and inadequate agreement with the meteorological service.
Decades of pines are around the Main Sword of the Mexican Strip, under the extensive construction work of the Binladin Group.
The Ben Laden's family has been in the centuries of the nearby rule family of Saudi Arabia and leads to larger construction projects.
The dead leader of Al-Kaida Ussama Ben Laden was a son of name whose family was rejected in the 1990s.
The accident occurred in strong winds and rain only a few days before the Kingdom’s arrival of millions of people to participate in the Palestinian, which would be obliged, even if one time in life for each working musulman.
The officials reported that 158 persons remained in the hospital.
Official persons decided to pay a million rivals (approximately 174,000 feet) to the parents of the dead, and the same amount was inevitably punishable.
The final victims will receive half of this amount.
Chapter B and Q states that the trend is explained by the existence of Eastern European masters who work for small money
According to Veronica Larry, the Britishs are increasingly taking repair specialists
The number of qualified workers from Eastern Europe increases
Results - Opening more than 200 new Screwfix shops for specialists
At the same time Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q shops throughout the country
Author: Rupert Steiner, head of the city Correspondent Daily Mail
They say that the Britishs are put into the side of milk and malarian cups, instead of taking qualified Eastern Europeans to carry out home work
If you can talk to a milk or a ball to red the wall, it seems that you're in minority today.
Because, according to the B&Q owner company, the UKs are increasingly taking master specialists to carry out an uncomfortable home work.
Veronel Lori, the new Director-General Kingfisher, who owns the home management network, reported that this train had a significant flow of qualified masters from Eastern Europe offering minimum price services.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open more than 200 Screwfix shops that are specialized for masters and also close 60 B&Q shops.
Ms. Lari said that she would like to see more women in the shopping of B&Q, as eight of the ten-third purchase decisions were taken by the representatives of the weak gender.
Today, most staff are men.
According to its words, it cannot be noted that the last demographic trends that characterize the increase in the number of households of single women, more than in the past.
Ms. Lori said, "The man still works in our shopping.
We need to take steps to achieve the balance.
In general, half of our customers are women, and 80 per cent of the decisions for the purchased products are taken by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Lori, one of the five women in the UK leadership, whose actions are taken into account in the FTSE 100 index, has also changed the composition of the fuel management team, purchasing among the directors of the equal number of men and women.
Kingfisher is not the only company in which about 50 per cent of women are women, including the general and financial director.
Ms. Lori said: "This was a conscious decision, the diversification is an important issue for us.
It was not difficult to find suitable women in the Board of Directors.
After the group has taken its shopping expenditure, Kingfisher's company showed the reduction of arrival and sales in half a year.
As a result of this train, Kingfisher, owner of Screwfix and B&Q, opens 200 new shops
Time for decisions on the percentage rate of the United States Federal Reserve
The World is looking at the meeting held by the Federal Reserve Bank, which is discussed within two days of the decision to take or not a percentage rate in the first decade.
Reuters' 80 economists reported that more than half of those still considered that the Federal Reserve would now believe that it still slows and keeps the rate at the current level of diameter 0-0.25 per cent.
This is a historic event, because it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve has decreased the rate to zero.
The first time we approach that the main bank can be accompanied with the null notes and start the normalization of percentage rates," said Anhel Wilde, headquarter of the International Economy Institute of Peterson.
The United States economy works effectively, the economic flow adds trillions to the balance report and inflation is small.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision affects the world economy.
He warned the market that it should be prepared for changes, but all of them said their confidence is that all the opportunities against such a step were possible.
The decision will be announced at 2000 CET on Friday.
New Balkan market: Refugees go to the EU through Croatia.
"Attention!" - Scan the hundreds of refugees in the Horgosh control point on the Serbho-vengerate border.
From Tuesday, Budapesht moved the border to the residents.
Refugee searchers already start to experience other route options in Europe.
One of them is through Romania in a close border with Serbia.
The other is through Croatia and Slovenia in Austria.
According to some data, buses that have brought refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now sent to the city of Shidu to the Croatia border.
Völderi received a provision from the authorities to follow without stopping.
The Serbian Minister of Internal Affairs, Neboish Stepanovic, ensures that his country do everything to help refugees but is limited to its possibilities:
Our work is to ensure Serbia as far as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people to make a huge relationship with them.
But it's already a common European problem.
It is unlikely, no country in Europe will do so alone, and a smaller country as Serbia.
Belgrade requests Budapesh to open the border for refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
But Victor Orban is unprecedented:
If someone is called a refugee in Serbia, he must fill the necessary documents for that document.
And if he doesn't do this, he will not be in our country, because Serbia is safe.
Hungary has already established 175-thirds (that) border with Serbia.
But Orban is not intended to stop it: it plans to make the same wage on the border with Romania.
Buharov already stated that it was incompatible with European principles.
The Encyclopædia Britannica: "Europe wants to help us."
In the course of a few years, the angels of Meimarracis entered the orthodox Governments that, according to the left, were the country towards the financial crisis.
He now, as a temporary leader of the New Democracy Party, slows the calls of Cyprus.
In a few days before the election, he met a journalist Euronus.
Mr. Meimarakis, welcome to the Euronuz!
Evangelium: Thank you for the invitation.
12 months ago, your party suffered a devastating conspiration, engaged in the SIRISA coalition, but now, in the investigation, the "New Democracy" compared with it as a popularity.
What's changed for that time?
The Encyclopædia Britannica: Greece has changed, and we too.
Mr. Cyprus had a lot in January last year.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget and economic growth perspective.
Now, the countries have re-budgetary deficit and high levels of unemployment.
The investors went out because Mr. Cyprus's spent them.
In the last nine months, Greece was able to assess the situation in which the country was in January and the false promises of Mr. Cyprus.
And now they can easily compare the promised thing in reality.
The daily life was significantly worse in comparison with January when the situation was improved, with which the majority of Greek citizens were involved.
Eurowes: But you're saying that, in the case of the elections, you'll try to join the other parties, including the SIRIZ.
The Encyclopædia Britannica: The fact that, as we have understood over the past few years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
Indeed, in all other countries where the rescue programmes have been acting or still operating, political forces and all rule parties have gathered together for the implementation of the programme on which they agreed without rejecting their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I believe that at the present stage only the cooperation of political forces and institutions allows the country to go forward.
Eurowes: Your party was proclaimed in support of the agreement between Mr. Cyprus and the creditor of the country.
If you will be a new prize on Monday, will you fulfill this agreement, or will you try to change it at least?
In reality, we proclaimed Greece's movement on the European road, because we are well representing what pleasant consequences the country would bring out of the EU.
Europe is now helping us by providing aid to farmers for their production, we have solidarity funds, Yunker package and support in the bank sector.
All of this would be lost if there was no treaty with Europe.
However, the current measures of the economy were the result of the negotiations of Mr. Cyprus.
I know that Europe doesn't want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek Government in the first year wants to rule, it works rationally and understood that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue programme, then I am sure that all the commitments that cannot be fulfilled because of recession may become a object of negotiations but only a certain time.
It would be wrong to believe that in the first year of the new agreement, we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors because they are expected to completely implement agreements.
If we want to return their confidence, we must continue to privatize, reform and structural changes agreed by continuing using EU funding advantages and large investment opportunities that we must open for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, in the negotiations, the Government of Cyprus did not submit any serious arguments on many key political issues that we have explained, discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can provide an example of farmers income.
We have explained our European partners that it is not about the fixed monthly income, and therefore it cannot be fully covered by the previous tax.
We said that the Ministers of Cyprus never spoke about this.
The Greek Ministers were not prepared and badly informed, and therefore there were negotiations and unsuccessful agreements.
Eurowes: If you win for elections, you will soon be on one table with Mr. Yunker, Olland, Mrs. Merckel and other European leaders.
Are you going to differ what you're telling to them from what your former Antonio Samuels said to them?
Encyclopædia Britannica: First of all, I explain to them that until the end of 2014 we tried to comply with the 2012 agreement with the strict edges in it.
We moved forward to reforms.
Of course, we did not have the necessary determination and speed, but we have acted in emergency circumstances.
The line slowed, and it was not apparent that potential buyers were ready to pay the prices that the Greek Government was slaughtered.
At that time, I was a parliament spyster, and I could agree on the views of the three parliamentary groups that were then the majority of the government.
Despite their serious ideological differences in key legislative projects, we had a parliamentary, and that is in the presence of popolists and extremists, as well as of massive demonstrations outside.
We were able to make a country a normal situation that would continue to improve if the process was not stopped by the long-term elections made by the Presidential elections.
Eurones: The last week on the territory of Greece is the mass flow of refugees.
What do you think of this situation, and of the reactions of European countries in which these people are trying?
The Encyclopædia Britannica: Crisis with refugees is an unexpected action bomb with which we should have a case after the winning of elections.
And the reason that the Syrian Government did not act in this situation as it was.
In such matters, the restraint should be taken because, if the problem is at you, there are only emergency measures.
And now we're in this situation.
Even the temporary Government of the SIRIZ has done over seven days more than Mr. Cyprus for seven months.
I am sure that these actions of the provisional Government, which provides valuable assistance to the President of the Republic, inviting the EU Summit, will make a decision.
We need to see how many refugees will be able to leave the country and note the illegal immigrants.
These are the victims of the war in Syria, the victims of some emergency events that have occurred with them.
There is a deep humanitarian aspect in this issue, and we will keep the position that European policies must take in this new situation.
This decision should be adopted in the EU's own, and the United Nations should be involved.
We also need the best coordination of action, more effective cross-border control and refugee reception centres.
We must also use effectively the EU's economic assistance to be able to address this poor problem.
Eurourones: Mr. Meimarakis, thank you for the interview.
The Gospels: Thank you.

A man who disabled the gun at the University of the Delta, left a note with excuses
After the shot and murder of his friend in Mississippi on Monday, and before he shot and killed his colleagues later on the same day, Shannon Lamb wrote a record that he said "congratulated" about the first murder and wanted to "too back", reported the authorized bodies on Monday.
The police in the city of Gotia, Mississippi, reports that the employee of geographic and public science at the University of the Delta, called at 911 a.m. to 10 o.m. in the service.
On Monday and told him he shot someone.
Lamb said to the supervisor that the police had to send people home.
He said, "I killed my wife last night," and he said that there's a "pocket" in the house that "no one's throne," but probably is disappointed.
The police was interested in calling, but he didn't call it.
Lamb didn't explain why he opened the fire.
When the police arrived in the place of crime, there was 41 years of the body of Amy Princess, which was written by the Lamba's record, 45 years old, saying, "I'm sorry I would like to return everything.
I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me.
When he wrote the note, Lamb passed 300 miles to the University of Delta, where he killed Italy Schmidt, a historic publisher, and the lunch night, when he was around the police, he ended with her.
The doctor of William Laford reported that he was not known about any conflict between Lamb and Shimed, but "It was evidently aware of Mr. Lamba".
In spite of the Monday information that the Lamb pretends Roman between Princess and Schmidt, official offices in Monday reported "no information or evidence" of the "a loved triangle".
Principes replied as a good man, Shawn O'Stin, who told her that she was married for about seven years.
They've been broken 15 years ago, but they've remained friends.
O'Stin told him and Princess had a daughter of 19, and she was "smile."
He added that Princess and her daughter were the best friends.
According to Lindsie Noux, the Sun Gerald newspaper called a close friend of Princess, last time he worked out of home through the Internet.
Noulds told Princess had a pleasant snake for the Latining, and she met Lamba for about three years.
Noulz said, "He always wanted to help people."
According to the police, Lamb called the parents at a moment on Monday to say that he wouldn't go in prison.
On the same evening, when the police shocked him on the shoes near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, shooted out of it, fled to the forest and shooted there.
According to the summary made on the University Web, Lamb was received in the University of Delta's Pedagogic Sciences in spring 2015.
Stars losing their luck
Atter (left), on a photo with her son, Redmond, right, survived a few difficult years.
In 2001, he was fighting with lyquemia, and in 2009 he lost his multi-year-old life satellite Farra Foset, who died from cancer.
As reported, the actor also suffered from drug independence and arrested him in 2008.
All of this, of course, has played its role.
Luke Shaw from Manchester for a few months, because of a double break
Luke Shaw cut the right leg in two places during the Champion Champion shop, where the United States played PSV in Andhoven.
While the safeguarder is concerned about this matter which is not able to go to the field for at least six months, Louis Van Gal hopes that Shaw can play again in that season.
The trauma occurred during the unreasoned subcondition of Hector Morno at the 15th minute when the 20-year-old Shaw was slaughtered in the PSV.
He was helped in the field for nine minutes and gave oxygen before taking into the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double bar, and he's in the hospital."
He'll be moved to Manchester tomorrow or day later and then operate.
This is a terrible, young man came to Manchester in 18 years of age, overcoming great difficulties and playing fantasticly, and this happened here.
It was a oxygen mask in the slaughter.
He cryed.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double bar, it's six months, and the guy can't play in a group stage.
I hope he can play again in this season.
Morno was glad he didn't receive a red card and was not appointed to the toolbar.
Arbitr Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish a mexican.
Van Gall believes that the Italian court had made a mistake.
Judge yourself when I say it's to be the snake and the red card.
It was a very bad shock from two feet.
In your Twitter, Shaw writes: "Thank you all for your message, don't describe how devastated I have been, my way to restore, I'm returning stronger than it was."
Furthermore, Manchester United is concerned with Luke Shaw when ISS played
The english protector will have an additional stimulation to move to Championato of Europe in France on June next.
Phillip Cooke, a PSV trainer, said, "This is a very hard trauma."
When any game is elected with such a trauma, it's all very disappointed.
This was never the purpose of our players to traumate the opposite.
Morno moved his feet off when he played in Mexico against the Dutch team under the Van Gal leader in Championate Mira 2014.
"He's now very hard, because he didn't have a purpose to hurt the opposite, and when you hear that it's a very hard trauma, you feel good," said Cooke.
I wasn't able to see the same moment.
The only thing I could see, it was a smoke that flyed in another direction, so that looked like he (Morone) was shocked, but I didn't see Luke's snake.
In the conversation with SBS6 Morno said, "I know what this is, I know how difficult it is to overcome.
I'm very hard, and I'm so sorry.
Andrés Guaradad from PSV was also put to the hospital after Chris Smolling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about Lorex?
Each parent is quickly exciting one thing: if your child likes a book, it will take a little time before you get to know it almost.
Let's see if you're not David Cameron.
In replying to the question of the representative of the group of children ' s dishes in the Canadian, his loved child book, the Prime Minister chose a statement with a environmental circle written by Dr. Suzu in 1971.
This was a difficult choice, wrote Cameron in a comment published on the SuperCamps company, and continues to say: "This is a joyful, thrilling, unreasonable history with a strong message I love to read to your children, because it is always discovering some form or message that we are missing."
And it would be good, except the last paragraph in which Cameron is prescribed, to report the content of the book, but in fact it is a single movie that was covered in 2012, with new personalities and details added to develop a very short original event.
"In the surrounding gardens of the city of Alliance, where no green and even air was sold for money, the boy, named Ted, hopes to get the heart of Audrey - the girls of their dreams that would like to see the real tree," we read in the text of a lovely history known by Dr. Suzu (the actual name of Teodor Susan Gazel), who died in 1991.
If this seems uncomfortable, Cameron's text is almost read as a short post of the Larex film, published on the Internet Movie Database website: "In the environmental high stars of the city, where everything was artistic and even air sales for money, the boy named Ted hopes to get the heart of Audri - the girls of his dreams."
It seems unreasonable that Cameron, with a general recognition of an active parent, is so unconscious of the content of a book named the boy knows how it destroys the environmental shocking of trees and the "exhibition" band, despite the Protestants of Loraks (which is made in the name of the book) is a smuggling substance with the smell that speaks from the name of the trees."
It is likely that such an incomplete PR post was assigned to a executive who has never read the Laraks book 20 times.
The representative of Dunning-Strip said that the text was intended to be obtained from Cameron's office in the election circle.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was obtained from Cameroon's stage, but it did not follow further comments.
For Adam Lita, it was obvious that the risk was not in the collection of England, but that is still a complex issue.
The winning of Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is an unfair task, but if you look at the collection that England has chosen for this tour, the recurrence of the test series on the last time, I don't think.
I wouldn't have excluded the victory in my field.
The Alistair Cook team may have been less experiencing than three years ago, but there are games that are vulnerable and collective thoughts; they will not be shocked since 2012, but only a youth position.
Monen Ali is converted to a bowl with sweet meat, and Adile Rashid, even if he is unknown for the test level, represents an attacking option.
Furthermore, Adam Lit was out of England's collection on the test cricket and replaced by Alex Hayes
The decision on the exception of Adam Lita to me, his main trainer at Yorkshire, is difficult to analyze.
On his seven tests, there were two good attacks in complex conditions, but the evident but cruel reality is that the crystal games were evaluated by the judges.
There were no questions on John Ruth, for instance, that the declaration was brought, because (and I have said it before) the games are better chosen by themselves.
A couple of half a year, and Lita could wait for a more long carriage, but he was in his own court.
We hope that if he gets more wounds for New Yorkshire, there's another chance.
The main trainer of the assembly of England, Trevor Baillis, was well referred to his attitude, even when he didn't show what he could, and that's not surprised me; he's mostly the command game, and then the rest.
The question of how much time will be before the test cricket remains a complex issue.
Lit played in seven games, like Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton was nine.
Only Compton had a chance to play in his and in the foreign field.
The only thing you could be grateful is that England has chosen Jonathan Tret for the Caribbean Prime Minister when Lit was in the best form, but this lost possibility is already in the past.
It looks like Alex Hayes, and he's a beatsman I'm appreciative.
He's an unpredictable cricketist that we saw in the New York City club at the beginning of this season when he paid 236 masks against us in the Trent Bridge area, which was already something.
It should be provided at least the same time as those who were before him, but it will, of course, depend on the composition of the OAS team.
The mosquito put Mona close to Cook as an open busman, which would give the opportunity to introduce an additional snake, maintaining four fast bottles, and I'm not going to be against it.
I don't see why a shooting player can't shoot there, but this legend has already shown that he's a good cricketist.
Monk may not be exactly what it's necessary for the Wurstershire grade but was a third number for them, and there's no big difference here.
My old companion by Jastin Langer played his first 38 test machines with the "third beatsman" before going to be open in 2001.
He won three hundred immediately and didn't look.
Zaphar Annari comes to the collection of a reserve, and with my uncontinuing society, he has shown me a very promised young man.
People may look at his example statistics — a mid-31 of battle and 35 of the mould — and think that it is a risked rate, but among the shoes of the voters, a little, and elected youth.
He's learning a lot in this tour.
In addition to the collection, England plans to make a couple of practical supplements in the training composition.
The appointment of Mahera Jayawordin, Sri Lanka Butsman, could be a master path.
He is one of the best guys for the game that brings the richest experience of it in all possible conditions and any attacks.
Paul Colingwood is included in the games where the white meal is used, and is assured for both energy and unprofit.
I always felt that he was born to be an international cricket, any game or training work, and, like Mahel, had a small intellect.
Sometimes new votes in the dispatch, even if they say what was already stated before, may bring new team forces.
Collega Colly on the Darem Ben Stuux team left for a day, Ruth provides a similar interruption in relation to Australia, and I, for example, do not experience this problem.
Although not all of these are agreed, trains and persons who choose players do not determine the schedule.
And you should remember how games are depending on the results.
Such decisions are never easy.
The Championship of Foreigners from Europe may be able to win if the economy is in the depression until 2017
The unplanned police David Cameron for the renewing of British maintenance negotiations in the EU is increasingly complex every day, even without the election of Jeremy-Geremia's "is it or not?" - the Corbine of the League League leader or TUC in Europe on Monday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyans and Nigera Faragey.
The European Polish diplomat explained, at the time, that the situation in which the EU is now concerned with different crises - not all of them own - is some of the participating countries on the hole of the British Economy Agenda on Sustainable Dispenses and the subsequent change agreements that they are mainly not wishing.
After meeting in Briton at an annual meeting, TUC decided that he would not, in any case, want to destroy social protection.
We could even call it the "Dave's and George's Style Programme".
The Prime Minister and the Financial Minister are chatted on the Samita and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photod themselves on the background of the known local memorandum, in the company of local representation or without it, and then come home and say that they join together to reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to be interested in maintaining external contacts under the tens of Europe - "Do not leave us together with France," says Berlin - proposes that the shocked ministers and officials in some cities be reached before understanding when they become the same, we stay or go.
Angela Mercelle, a very careful officer of Germany, is an unity, but she is in the power of ten years and wants to leave the office before the situation was worried for those in her place of Tatcher (11 years), Mitterran (14) and Cole (16).
Head of France France, Olland, is before the rechange or replacement in 2017.
He also lost power.
Poland may immediately receive the nationalist Government of the right touch, Spain, the left.
It is hard to see them useful from the skin in there to help the " British" whose energy could be lost to prevent Skotlands from coming out from Britain - what they do not want, because most of them have similar separation trends.
Therefore, some of these ministers may even plan out of an unnecessary snap in the SNP-style campaign in Britain in 2017 to support the EU-Britannia process, my friend.
"Ideal Fix" and "Britannia has not received anything of value from the renewed negotiations."
Europeans know what the Flight Street might be, and as skeptically as the EU's media magnets have been established, unlike the time of Tony Benham launched in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 to 2.1.
They can smilely remember Boris Johnson, a shocked Europorturist who glorified their "directe bananas" EU-British Corporation at the beginning of the 1990s.
With all his stupidity, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a pest company from the fearing jelly taxes, phone hackers and non-residents, most of our large newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair had the same view, but gave himself a report that when you're in the cell with a boiled, you have to give her the bananas to disappear it and not give her food on the box and again with the tea.
In fact, Millibanando was a larger commitment to Blair, as it was, in contrast to Cameron's concept of referendum, since Biller had been the principles for the elimination of the EU Constitution, the conspiration of French and the Dutch electioners in 2005, which gave him a winning ticket.
He didn't forgive anything from that.
But my lady Jeremy Corbin, who had a friend of me on Monday at Westminster, I told him that he had no longer time to lose him on me - it seems to be risking to repeat the "Boycot Mercoke" strategy from the 80s and then, and now.
This may take time, but he must develop a subsequent strategy for interaction with the press, not with me, but perfectly with Andrew Marrom, whose watch was on Sunday.
The official position of the Corbine for Europe is that I depend on the evolution.
He said he would like us to remain in the reformed EU.
Indeed, most people from Ukip's traditional trend and a larger circle of "lateral English" among the tori may probably say "you".
This is the same as Hilli Benn, but not Bennett, Benn said to the radio and TV this week, with all its internal boxers refused to acknowledge that the designation of the Corbine of John McDonald's "Tenive" Minister of Finance was a bad idea.
This reminded me of the 70s when his old sister from all of the TVs was struggled for the unfaithfulness of the Laborist Office, not too far and not to lose his post in the Ministers' office.
The Bethva Hilary was more appreciative.
But fighting to remain "in any circumstances" is Ben's phrase not what, said McDonald's, and not what J. C. spoke to the parliament at a private meeting on Monday night, with general view.
In order to want to report the democracy and the "speak" Corbine - remember, he even triggered me - the discipline of messages remains important at the round-sized television for seven days a week, and especially in the waterway of social networks, paralysis and pregnancy.
This is wisely to let Cameron not just separate from Europe, allowing him to support libraries during the Referendum campaign, as McDonell said.
Simon Jenkins's thinking like that.
But the main wrongdoing of McDonald's membership in the EU, in the context of the "bennitic" economy, is no longer a question of an ezoteric discussion among the left dissidents whose narcism, which is born in a minor difference, is a central principle in dogmatic discussions.
With regard to his mistakes regarding Nato-Tom Watson, J.C. will not act on the outcome - foreign diplomas will be able to try to bring it to their leaders home.
Why is Paris or Berlin expenditure of political capital - they also have suspicious elections - when all of this can be unreasonable?
The United States have already been very disappointed by the weak military action of the United States in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even when the Government of the Authority has slowed expenditure, which I have recalled at Monday during a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticize electronic smoke reviews from the Public Health of England
Declarations by the Government of the Agency that electronic smokes are less harmful than smoking at 12 people, some of which are related to the Tavic Industry, as reported by researchers.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) together with Lancet have found evidence used by the Public Health Agency in their electronic cigarette report.
PHE has published an important report, the "returning phenomenon" in the last month, called it "international review of evidence".
However, some researchers made doubt of data reliability and pointed to the connection of some experts with the tabak industry.
The last month, in the draft article of the Medical Journal, Lancet discovered a “excellently shock”, based on which PHE has built its main conclusion.
In article BMJ, more two researchers asked whether these statements were "favoured or slightly foundation".
Martin McKi, the representative of the European Health School of London hygiene and tropical medicine, and Simon Caevelle, who presented clinical epidemiology at the University of Liberia, reported: "The basic principle of health - the rules should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
According to their words, publicity expects that the PHE declaration shows that "the best evaluation shows that electronic smokes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" was based on a detailed selection of evidence and modelling.
It is actually the only meeting of 12 persons to develop a multi-critical analysis model in order to promote their views on the damages related to different nicotinated products; the results of the meetings are briefly presented in the scientific publication.
MacKi and Capewell reported that one of the meeting publishers was a company named EuroSwiss Health, the Director-General, whom he had reported that he had previously been financed from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also confirmed the BAT certificates in the field of health report on sustainable development.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced the financing of the electronic smoke producer, not mentioned by the financing he had previously received from the tax company Philip Morris.
The election of members of the Council was not made, but there were a number of known electronic cigarettes, some of which also declared the financing of the industry in the publication.
It is unknown if other participants have the experience of management experience in the Tahitian matter.
The meeting also visited the manager of the Taxi Guide in the PHE.
The study article, published by the group, "speakly agreed" with the fact that there is a lack of "excellent evidence of the harmful impact of most of the products in most criteria", wrote McKi and Caepwell.
However, no of these connections and limitations have been covered in the PHE report.
MacKi and Capewell told that the PHE statements “in the present time there are no evidence that electronic smokes are a road that brings children to smoke or smoking.”
Prof. Kevin Fronton, Head of Health and Women in the PHE, told that BMJ claims had already been answered.
He said, "Electronic smokes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One of the two smokers of the whole life died because of their injury.
All evidence understood that the health threats from electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study remote consequences.
The PHE has a clear responsibility to inform the public about what proves and what does not prove, especially where the publications had doubts about the relative danger in comparison with the tabak.
About 80,000 people die each year from smoking diseases, and smoking is 2 billion feet per year.
It is clear that, although electronic smokes are not safe, they are only part of the damage caused by smoking - we do our tasks before the nation.
The former Chapter of Channel 4 believes that BBC company should stop the EastEnders series
The former chapter of Cannel 4 Luke Johnson believes that BBC should stop the explanation of programs such as EastEnder and The Voice, noted that their business competitors would pay a lot for successful shows as a nice operation on the Albert ' s Programme.
Johnson noted that licensing collections should be used only to establish programmes that were not implemented by other British telecommunications.
He criticized the BBC that the company was a transfer of public advertising, which must be viewed only a small part of the audition, at a short time when the competitors were shooting with high rating, and on channels such as BBC4.
After the Director-General of BBC Tony Holl said that the company would like to cooperate with other organizations, Johnson noted that he had tried in his six-year-old work with the BBC in the channel 4.
"I can't separate from the thought that BBC is ready to start and translating transfers that could show competitive companies without subsidies," said Johnson to members of the Lord's Communications Committee in the context of the explanation of the further court of BBC.
If you keep the licence collection that I do not consider a good decision in a medium and long-term perspective, the company should leave only the programs that are not issued and will not be issued by other companies.
Shoo The Voice is in the slope, because the creators want to receive maximum support for the future.
The idea that nobody more shows it, is funny and apparently absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why regulatory taxes should go to the financing of transfers that could be paid without subsidies.
The Voice is one of these examples, EastEnders, and it is generally known that they are their own production.
Other channels, of course, would have been given a lot for it.
I don't understand how this can be a public advertising.
I don't think it would be a BBC.
A series of Johnson entrepreneur, launched by Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused BBC in shooting with "for the mobilizations of staff and because of their faith that this is the best way to support the duration of the duration".
His comments on BBC's most popular shows are called with the comments of the Executive Director Sky Tony Bolla, which proposed BBC to sell East Enders series in its study of McTaggart's memory in Edinburgh in 2003.
Johnson noted that the lower transmission of BBC public character " continue to go to BBC4, where it is often impossible to evaluate the audit, but the company's function is fulfilled, and it may be predicted as a argument for the Canjean preaching that justifys the revenue of the licensed collections at 4 billion feet: "No, of course, we do all these unbelieving transfers that no one looks."
They're putting them into the shooting where no one will never see them.
With regard to the licence collection, Johnson reported to the Committee: "I call you to find a more registered system about whom more will be obtained from it.
Of course, you're all thinking we all think that 150 feet per year is a great amount, but for people whose 150 feet are large money, I'm interested, because they're thinking so because they're not very watching and listening to the BBC.
The former Executive Director of Sky and Channel 5 David Elstein, who also spoke to the Committee on Monday, said that BBC should review the mission of Rita for information, education and development.
He noted that only a small part of the BBC material is formally classified as educational, it is 1 per cent of the television content and 0.1 per cent of the radio, and that the company should be subject to the initiative of Australian and Canadian advertising companies under the nine "Information, education and development".
On the partnership, Elsten noted that BBC should make more efforts in the fields such as the Premended Contracts (e.g., in his words, 'TV') and entering the Alliances with commercial publishers to make them available to review online.
Sonogenetics allows to control the brain cells using sound weather
The video shows that nomates change the direction of movement when they have the impact of sound impulses.
Scientists have produced snakes with a genetically modified nervous system that can be managed using sound waves.
Increased nonmates change the direction of movement at the time they affect sound impulses, too high that human ear can hear them.
Impuls have effects by activating neurons genetically modified to use membrane channels that react on ultrasonal waves.
Furthermore, researchers have controlled the brain through light
Scientists said that the thread showed the possibility of a new method called "sonogenics " which means the use of the ultrasons to recover certain brain cells, heart and muscles, and the source of the ultrasonau exists outside the body.
Sricant Chassani, a Scientific staff at the Solka Institute, La Haya, California, told Guardian that the methodology could once replace the deep stimulation of the brain, an invasive procedure in which human brain sends electrical impulses and used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
Red-Natoids are not reacting to ultrasonautic, but Chassani found that they were starting to react when they were placed in a smoke with microscopic pushes.
He found that the powders have increased the ultrasonic weather that then goes into the corner body.
Enhanced ultrasonal weathers affect the structures called TRP-4 channels, found in the memorans of some corner cells.
The vultras are launched by these ion channels, which are linked to cells, reported in the Nature Communications report.
In order to create nonmats that can be managed through the ultrasony, Chassani made genetic changes to the wheat, so that their motor neurons used TRP-4 ion channels.
During the use of the ultrason for the impact of modified organisms, the sound trails have increased microscopic pushers and have been introduced into the raw organs by intensifying modified motor neurons.
This method is similar to the "optogenetic" application of a new direction that allows scientists to include and exclude nerons through light impulses.
Chalahani argued that, compared to the methodology of sonogenics, there may be some advantages.
Unlike the light that is delivered to the necessary part of the brain on the ocean, the low-spot ultrashore flows unprecedentedly through the skin of the body, so it does not need to pass within the corner box.
" We believe that, in order to treat some neurological diseases in clinical conditions, the use of genothertherapy and therapeutic virus can make human nerons sensitive to the ultrasonal signal, " said Chassani.
He added that, moreover, the methodology could apply to muscle and productive cells.

Advertising statements are issued on the British arms trade
See the role of Amnesty International with protest against the exhibition of weapons.
Awesome drones killers!
Destructive weights of iron candals!
Damn bombs!
Electrical light-shoes, which causes unexpected pain, but don't leave the sequences!
The strict voice and availability remain doubtless that this advertising of a larger international weapons exhibition - an episode of the Amnesty International prepared to address the goal of the British Government ' s ' s repressive systems, using the EXCeL centre in the Docundase for defence technologies and security systems.
Another subject: DSEI arms exhibition: Authority regimes are in London
However, a special campaign has also resulted in an emergency exhibition of a number of bus stoppers and trains that are required to see them again.
"The important declaration from the DLR line from 15 to 18 September?" is written on one of them by the London Metro fonts with a DLR line that turns into force of the tank.
In September this year, the trafficking traders strike at the DLR line. The passengers ask for help to prevent the exploding of weapons.
300 posts are recorded by artists who have made their work in the "True Design Mouse" in the Bank's Desmaland Park.
The Collection, called the Group, helped to distribute them in London using the "Public Exploration" of 6 feet hae keys, which, as it is stated, "it provides access to about three advertising spaces on the planet's bus stopping."
London's transporters were unlawful of such "vandalism" in the form of non-authorized audience.
One of the paradox declarations issued by the Group on the Pattern.
According to Gavin Greendon, a smoker of Cruel Designs and providers at the University of Escoce, artists are more demanding and are attempting to bring political art to the audience beyond the gallery.
Many artists start to work with the protestists, understood that they have to go into a real world for their art if they want to influence society.
Another test against the exhibition of weapons welcomed by passengers in the metro.
Amnesty's video was reviewed more than 1000,000 times per 24 hours on Facebook and created a VCCP worker for bono, with the addition of graphic designer and audio artists that also work freely.
The creative director of the VCCP Matt Lever was a remarkable peace surrounding arms exhibition, with a launch in the ExCel Calendar, and thought, " Let them build a campaign that they are trying to avoid. "
They thought to create a more realistic and hydro-based corporate advertising, but "completing her home with light colors and animation was more enthusiasming."
"They were incredibly helping us to focus on the sale of illegal torture equipment on exhibition," says Tom Davis from Amnesty.
Now we need to ensure that the Government of the United Kingdom has taken measures and ensured that this torture equipment will not be legally sold directly to our face.
It may be the most creative art of the arms exhibition in the area of ExCeL, where the participants are fantastically equipped.
Saab opened information on the order of "AT4CS RS to shoot shoot shooting " by the United States army.

Eight Golden Rules in Study Communities
11 years ago, since I moved to the student as a normal 19-year-old man, who still believes in the beach and morality, but just now I remember the smile of those who I disappointed - and many long-term complaints on others.
On the basis of what I learned, I can put it on eight simple rules.
The normal movement may vary from the light of the nervous to the absolutely scary.
He encourages me to tell people where you're getting academic leave and where you're going to support the Corbine and why you're "right, nor love, nor Marmith," because, seriously, it's just a brain extract of Hahahaha, I'm going to be on myself."
Respirate.
And help others too - give questions and demonstrate interest.
This supports conversation and helps you to find people you like, not those with whom you wouldn't even have spoken, even if you'd have the race, but they would have disappeared the fires.
Let's get people out of space.
People are often converted into drinking, medium-sized films, and general smoke places, but they are also where people are sweet and controlled whitely.
Another question: Don't even think to start learning at the university, in relation
Introvertants in universities are injustice.
Your room must be refugees, but many communities form a culture of shatting from one room to another that contributes to friendship, society and leads to debt friendship.
This may be a goddamn for those who try to restore the power.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "You like me, and I want to keep friends with you, but I need you to go, and I have been able to restore the energy I've lost for communication with you."
You're going to feel when the competitor is cut into the community, not to shoot him, but to send SMS.
Just about the stage, do this.
One man in my community followed this principle: if the door was not closed, he was invited to enter.
He saw something.
Take friends with the kitchen.
As you start a university life at the shock of Bake-Off's popularity show, it's going to be shooted in the door to imagine and transfer a shooting shooting shooting, that's not so strange in the 1950s, it's not likely to remind them, "But welcome, we're neighbors, I've been sweared to you, and I'm going to smile, and I'm going to give you personal questions."
Propose home feeding is a good way to get married.
Your neighbors will feel that you should be sick and maybe your face will be associated with them with a nice surprise.
You know, this depends on how good you're.
The smell smells, sofa and grain will make people sleep when you're going to smell them.
Eating is a typical crime in students.
You know, the induction of some smokers is a shooting, but is it a smuggle?
You're going to be the owner of the milk.
Maybe he'll suggest you not to smile, even if it's inside the shooting.
If someone smells your things, it's smelling, and I feel you -- but try to get away from this adult than my neighbor who put in his milk skin for the shoes to detect those who took it without demand.
Now she's in prison.
You don't have to make a sound that will prevent people to sleep or learn.
Not just to be a good man, but because you're the same people from the talking about shoot houses.
The girl in my core asked the neighbor to kill the blue and the bash-guitars as it was three hours in the morning, and she's in the morning.
In response to the neighbor, the volume increased.
When he was finally quiet at 5 o'clock, she was kind to let him sleep two hours, and then shoot her music and closed the door and sent him to a three-time review.
Wasn't it romantic if your future mate lived in the same community as you?
Instead, it wouldn't be extraordinarily, before the shooting, unlike if you took a neighbor for your future mate, you'd like to have a relationship, and you should see him every day, and maybe look at how he moves to your own side all your common friends?
Of course, you don't get your heart - but if your cold neighbor is perfectly not your future mate, make it easier to cover your own skin.
When you understand that someone left the keys inside your slow room, the slight between the shooter and the smell more dark than it seems.
It's fun, but it's turning into its contradiction for the seconds considered.
Precious and interesting security lesson, hide something, but never pack any of the room of a tooth pack and shampoo.
Without the foreign door and leave the keys in the stainless water that you'll then put in the shooting, but don't get the foreign things in the Blu-Tack shooter two times.
iOS 9: as to set a new iPhone operational system after Apple update
A new operational system can be requested when you enter the Settings Appendix, select General, and then software Update.
If it is ready, the phone will allow you to scan him and install it.
Some had faced problems after the installation when the error reported to them that "Annualization could not be updated".
In order to avoid this, users are recommended or waited until the survival is stopped or tried to update through iTunes.
The phone statements will allow you to go all the process to the end.
The process may include the removal of appliances to increase the freedom of place - but Apple has minimised the possibility of this action, reduced the size of updates, and also facilitated implementation with a special notification that proposes to remove the applications and to re-establish them after the process end.
You should be sure that when you update your phone is loaded or situated close to the loaded device to allow your battery disconnection.
If the apple is too low, the update is stopped because the phone order may lead to a bad update.

Washington responded to the military activity of Russia's phone call.
The Secretary of the United States, John Carry, called his Russian colleague Sergey Lawrence to discuss the situation in Syria.
He believes that the military support provided by the President of Asad only leads to conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House will not talk about this with the Russian colleague, writes PJ Media.
The Secretary of the United States, John Kerry, called the Russian Foreign Minister for Foreign Affairs in order to discuss Russia's military activity in Syria.
This reports the PJ Media publication.
" The secretariat Kerry understood clearly that the further support of President Assad from Russia has a risk of distortion and proliferation of conflict, as well as negatively indicated on our general goal - fighting with extremism - if we also do not continue to focus on the search for the solution to the Syrian conflict through the direct transmission of the force", stated the representatives of the United States Department.
They also noted that Carry had regularly emphasized the commitment to the United States to combat the “Islam State” in the framework of coalition from over 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad could never be a member of her.
Furthermore, the United States "we will join Russia's constructive role in trying to oppose the Islamic State".
The past Friday, the representatives of the White House stated that they did not exactly know what Russian troops are doing in Syria, but Washington will discuss this issue with Moscow.
Furthermore, the Chairman of the White House Josh Ernest noted that time for a phone conversation between President of the United States Barack of Obama and Russian leader of Wormburg Puttin was until: "When the President decided that the phone conversation with President Putin will go to our interests, he will spend the pipe and try to make the call. "
Barak Obama itself considers that Russia's decision to increase the support of the Asad 'producing rate ' s support.
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putini four or five years ago when I told him that it was a mistake that the further support of Asad will only worse the situation.
"But he did not listen to my warnings - and the situation was worse," said the President of the United States.
The aircraft shall be released from customs payments.
The mine development is intended to temporaryly release aircrafts and other swimming means for dishes and sports from customs and tax payments.
The Ministry of Administration of the RF Government was prepared for the changes in the list of loan goods.
This reported the Assistant Minister for Economic Development, Elena Lashina.
In June 2015, Prime Minister RF, Dmitriy Medvedev, on the results of travel in Clay, has appointed a number of states of mini-economic development, Minister RF, Minicultures, MID, IFS, FIB, Russians to prepare proposals for the establishment of favorable conditions for icelands in the coastal areas of the country.
Experts, on their part, noted that the main problem is the absence of infrastructure for safeguarding, services and ice content.
The authorities prefer to store their courts out of borders — €2,200 million annually insured European States for shipping, repair and services.
The Russian Mine Development Development draft decision of the European Economic Commission on changes in the list of goods temporaryly carried out with full conditional release from customs payments, taxes, which provide full conditional release from customs payments, taxes for aircraft and other swimming materials.
The Ministry's view will, of course, contribute to the establishment of favorable conditions for the development of iceland in the coastal areas of the country, noted Lashina.
This issue was addressed to the subcommission on customs and non-arrithms regulation which protected measures in the external trade of the Government Commission on Economic Development and Integration held in September and was also accepted by states.
As noted by the representative of the Mineacon Development, the measures proposed to be full of conditional freedom in the aircraft are, in its own sense.
As a result, after the adoption of the protocol of the subcommission to the Government of the Russian Federation, the European Economic Commission will propose a discussion with the EAS Member States, explained Lashina.
The list of imported products that are fully released from customs payments, taxes include goods required to facilitate external economic activities and international cooperation, to apply in science, culture, cinematography, sport and tourism, to provide international assistance, and to the service equipment (Personal computers, machinery), control and medium-sized devices, burning equipment, spectacular costims and decorations, moved labs and masters, water, motor vehicles, machines, sports, newspapers, newspapers, newspapers, newspapers and newspapers.
In the press office of the Ministers RF, Jizvias said that they had prepared the compulsory arrangements on marine ports of Kerchi, Sevastopol, Yelta, Feodozoia and Evoporation, which provides a simplified order for the preparation of shipment and exit of small, sportive and passenger courts in the sea port.
The mining is given to the Captains of the sea ports of Crema to ensure the simplified operation of small, sportive and passenger courts in the sea port and the outcome of the seas port.
The Minister has also prepared projects of RF Governments on the approval of the border of the Cruma sea ports.
With regard to Yelt and the Federation, the rest of the agreement have already been adopted, noted in the press of the State.
The view of the Ministers, the hostage, the classification and observation, the hospitalization of small-scale courts used in non-commercial purposes must be implemented by the Republic of Cross and Sevastopol.
The problem is that Russia has been extremely weak because of the lowly developed infrastructure.
If we look at the south of Italy and France, there is a constant development industry in which a large number of people is involved.
In Russia, it's actually all on the place.
Our neighborhood is the Black Sea in Sochi, Helengica, New Russia, Anna, the only piece where we can circumspectly exploit ships.
But the great complexity is that the rules of border service are extremely strict in this area: to go forward, the masses of permissions must be formed.
Moreover, in Russia, you're going to be able to shoot anywhere.
Two days she can go with her fuel, and then stands a problem where he takes, says the director of the Northmarine Company Dennis News.
With regard to the icehouse place, Moscow and St. Petersburg now have special angels for ships up to 30 hours, and the vessels are also sent to guard in Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
News pointed out that the buyers of the ice is rich, but at the beginning, the ship demand was decreased.
The World Bank has paid Ukrainian credit for $500 million.
The World Bank adopted a new refunded project for Ukraine for $500 million for the development of the financial sector.
This reported the press service of the international organization.
" The new financing supports a number of priority measures to reform in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine," says the report.
The Director of the World Bank on Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine stated that the reforms of the banking sector would help to restore credits in real economy and to encourage the restoration of economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities have taken the impressioning steps on economic reform and the World Bank observed the first sign of stabilization.
But because of serious problems, Phany calls upon the Government of Ukraine to accelerate reform.
Previously, the Polish Government has approved the allocation of $100 million of Ukrainian credits, providing “Ria News”.
In prisons are requested to establish separate blocks for transgenders.
The General Council for the Implementation of Criminal Sanctions (FIIN) on the Protection of the Rights condemned in October 2015, including other issues, discusses the establishment of individual blocks for transgenders and transferers.
In this regard, the members of the Board of Vladimir Grib told them.
It believes that, in depending on the general number of convicted in Russia, individual chambers, blocks or even (if such crimes are much) may be able to establish a special colony for trans-selective.
However, Vladimir Grub stressed that to determine the punishment of the citizens in such isolated places only after the condemnation of the medical experts that will prove that the criminal is a person who identifies himself as a representative of the anti-pollution field.
He has established that the isolation of transgenders from other prisoners will ensure the security of restraint punishment.
In his words, the proposed practice has successfully been carried out: the AIDS (of which the accused persons are before the court), individual cameras for transgenders and the corrective institutions are special blocks.
This is the only way to work with such crimes today.
Similarly, they must be excluded, since the presence of transferers and transgenders in ordinary cameras is dangerous for them, the suffering of their family and the marine problems for FIIN staff.
The decrease of transmissions from socamers is guaranteed, said Vladimir Grib.
Depending on the number of criminals with an indefinite field, they need to consider where to distribute them.
SIZO needs not specifically only cameras, blocks in prisons.
Yeah, a separate column is possible if transgenders are much.
According to the report of the Group, 50 or 100 persons can be found in the block, and if the specialized corporation will be established in Russia, the punishment of the arrested transsectors will be able to be taken from any regions.
The citizens are in the AIDS on the place of crime, so the income of transfers or transgenders from other actors during the investigation and judicial process is unreal, and this is the case to introduce such practices for the already convicted in a separate colony - yes, it is considered by the Group.
Remember, the law enforcement officials were not able to decide where a prisoner, a man or woman, to determine the detention detained for the 24-year-old drug transsexual Dmitri Coyukah (known under the name of Alin Davis), because of the man with the girl ' s external detention was not arrested.
He's gone home under the signing of the invasion.
This news has been widely discussed in social networks and media, since the transgender content mechanisms in the AIDS and the columns in Russia have really not been available.
The Russian human rights defender, LGBT Activists (LGBT - Lesbians, gee, biosexuals, transsessionals) Nicolai Alexev supported the idea of establishing special places for the punishment of transgenders, noted that the possibility of individuals in the colony or women are also depending on their own desire.
In view of the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is right.
Yes, it's a very small percentage, but there's a problem, as well as the security question for homosexuals, says Alexev.
The prisons should be safe, so individual blocks could be done on behalf of this and for homosexuals, so that they are more in prisons than transgenders.
In this regard, Alexandre is doubtful that Russia had many citizens who are willing to take place for transceptuals because they are different from the ordinary colonies.
Of course, you can introduce medical observation before placed people in a colony for transgenders, but it is not always the same.
For example, one of the prisoners in the United States seemed to be a man, and already said in prison that he wanted to change the gender, said Alexandre.
A man may feel like anyone.
But until the individual places for transgenders are out of punishment, I doubt that prison officials will think about the security of such people and avoid their orientation or sexual identification.
At the same time, a international expert on reproductive health in the territory of the RF, Boris Lordkipanidez, noted that the introduction of the new system for the distribution of transsectional crimes in the colony could delay the start of the punishment of the convict.
The Commission is a sexual issue, the psychiatrists carry on long-term monitoring, it is not one test based on a high-specific conclusion.
Today, psychiatric opportunities are enabled.
Therefore, before the different field, potential patients are always expertise - they clearly show whether the field change is the necessary action,” says Lardkipanide.
However, I am difficult to imagine how this system is to be introduced in relation to the accused, because the average of this survey is a month.
The doctor, despite the general idea of establishing individual transsexual blocks, also doubts that in the current economic conditions, it would be appropriate to provide resources to build new places, medical experts, transgenders in Russia.
No official statistics are complex, but if you consider that Russia's homosexualists are about 5 per cent, it can be said that transgenders are still less than those who have such a rejection and have a crime, and they are incredibly low, said Larry Panids.
Now, as a request for the administration of the Homosexuality column, transgenders, and this can be given individual conditions.
Mikhail Antiopus wins the Younger World Championship on Shahmat.
The Championship of the Peace on Shahmats has been completed in Hantas-Mansik by junctions until 20 years.
The first end of the convenience was more than an intriguing.
The winner was determined only in the last tour, and the Russians Mikhail Antiows became a russman who was shocked to the Yan-Kshishitofa Dudu pool, who would certainly go to the title.
The Ukrainian shakmatist Natalia Bux was winning.
The Championship of Peace on Shamats since the beginning of September in Hanta-Mansik, which was already at the middle of the tourist distance, seemed to have perished nearly all the attraction, since the representative of the Polish Yan-Kshishetof Dud, who had issued a series of four wins (13 Swiss systems), was certainly switched by the leadership.
Bearing in mind that Duda was the first-feavorite rating of the Pervention, it is, in fact, one of the most promising young shakmatists, the probability that he would leave the revenge, was very slightly represented.
And even when Dood had cut the traffic and allowed the Russian Mihail Antipow to reduce the displacement of 0.5 balls, he remained obvious in the fight against the title.
The Antipoulos had to win immediately in the 13th tour.
But it wouldn't even help, win Dud to your party.
The obligation of victory could, of course, be said to the game of a Russian shommatist and bringing to uncompulsive errors.
Happily, Mikhael Antioch was able to avoid them.
He was certainly engaged with Francis Rambaldi, after he was deemed to wait when his party ended by Dud, who met Benji Bok.
Successfully, the Polish shakmatist was struggling with the Dutch.
Thus, Antipol and Duda had the same number of points - by 10 of 13 possible, but Antipoulos had the best additional indicators.
That is why he is the leader of the Hanty-Mansium Autocircle, whose Governor Nathania Comaru, traditionally focused on the development of shamat in the region.
And there was no enduring end in the slaughter of the girl.
The leader of the Tourism Nationality Buxe (Ukrainian) was not enough to lose the title in the last ture that she had succeeded and done.
So the winning of the Russians of Alina, the Bible, did not let her get Bux.
The Russian sport has remained the second with the disappearance of the champion at 0.5 ball.
The smuggle changes the regional structure.
The company combines the Premier and Ural region in one of the counterparted Voltaire and Ural regions, Syria and the Dark East in the Eastern region.
The draft will be completed until 1 November.
As has noted the genitor Mikhail Slobodyn, changes are made to "stand a strong market player" to develop a company in "new, not always favourable foreign conditions".
Mr. Slobodyn, in the TV canal interview, stated that they intended to reduce the “decimal” staff in Russia.
Rosing supervision checked 78 Moscow purchasing Burger King and issued 367 requirements.
As a result of the restaurant at the Volo-Column Shoss, 500,000 rubs were overlooked and 90 was closed to the Great Turk Street, but it was renewed after the elimination of all violations.
43 purchasers violated the requirements of the placement device.
Among other non-complianced sanitary, technical and sanitary and hygiene-contents, ventilation requirements have been found in some machines, bacteria of the cocktails.

Artemiaev, leader of the FAAS, said that the State against indexation of 10 per cent of the shipping and providing guests, as requested by OAS RJD.
First, they wanted 17 per cent of the index, now they want 10 per cent, and even multimillional subsidies from the budget, said he.
We say, it's too much, it's too much, it's too much, it's going to make your costs learning to economicize, reject price-free features, football teams, own TV, stop costs on the left and right.
He added that FASS had its "wise more strict" proposals that are now discussed in the Government.
Polymetal considers the possibility of non-related calculation with Sumeru Gold B.V. instead of implementing a total of $300 million, reported to the gold-contracting company.
In this case, Polymetal must be paid to $80 million (the difference between the cost of the Sumeru and the market kitchen) which may be taken from the free money flow.
Sumeru has time to 3 October to make options or needs of payments.
The details of the negotiations in Polimetal are not opened.
Option was concluded in the purchase of the "Kuzil" Polymetal project in Kazakhstan.
Nikita Stassin, director of the Department of Housing Policy, reported that the Ministry, together with the CIA, would develop the sanctions order.

In the current year, the Russian Management Association's Thop-1000 Russian Managers study was 16 times.
As a tool for the evaluation of the Russian high-ethon professional reputation, the study supports the work of Russian Administrators each year by identifying leaders in the areas and functional directions.
The initial pool of candidates consists of the last year ratings.
The winners of the past year are invited to confirm their participation as a candidate for the current year and to issue members of their management team.
In addition, each of the initial lists of candidates propose to deliver to ten new managers from other companies, which would be likely to add to the general pile of candidates.
The following operators may be moved: financial director, commercial director, staff director, ICT Director, Director for Public and Corporate Relations, Director of Authority, Director of Corporate Management.
Each proposed manager is sent an invitation to join the train and provides an opportunity to issue its management team and to ten new leaders from other companies.
The application of candidates on a sectoral basis is carried out by the Association Management Classifier: information technologies, trade banks, forest and forest manufacturing industry, machinery, medium-sized, metallurgias, multi-profiling, professional services, communication and telecommunication, service and production of consumer products, insurance, construction, trade, financial sector, manufacture, chemical industry, energy and fuel composite.
Each party shall provide logical and password for access to the website www.top1000.amr.ru where they see information on the other parties and may provide their reviews on the proposed for each functional direction.
Based on the methodology of the rating building, the "Looks choose the best" is that the vehicles are evaluated by the mine managers, the functional management evaluates functional administrators.
This principle allows to receive maximum authentic assessment of colleague professional reputation.
The final results of the rating are supported at the expert committees.
At the meetings of the expert committees, all the wishing candidates of the current year are invited and the multi-cutting candidates for the last year.
The Commission is organized on functional signs: Commissions for approval the list of senior leaders and eight functional guidelines.
The expert committees are proposed to adopt the lists presented in the alphabet mode (which remains strict in accordance with the Internet assessment and are closed to the publication of the rating) or to adjust their reserve candidates in accordance with the appendix list.
The company names are given in accordance with the Russian rules and the rules of the "t".
At the time of the publication, the rail can change the status of managers and companies.
Comfort rate for investment is 10-13 per cent.
As a result of experts, small and medium-sized business credit market in January-April this year was 40 per cent.
What is the situation in your appreciation today?
After the panic installations of the end of 2014, the amount of credit IFB was significantly decreased.
It is understood: a significant increase in percentage rates.
The estimation of 25-30 per cent of the year was not benefited by anyone.
If the bank could impose all its possible challenges in the advanced rate, from the duration to the non-return, it is not possible to do this now: taxes and so income.
For business, the current IFB credit rates are incompatible.
For a significant part of the investment projects, the current level is unacceptable to their purchaseability.
Tax level 10-13% would allow business to invest in a wide project spectrum and to form an appreciative income.
How is your estimates satisfied with the request for enterprises for credit?
After the CB reduction, the situation was a little better.
Main resources were more accessible.
However, according to our observance, customers have been insured by credits.
First, businesses do not understand the prospects of their development and future income.
Today, the business is one way: we need to learn to work on the current economic situation in the country and in the region.
We need to monitor the current results and monitor the movement of money.
At the same time, new technologies should be used to modernize equipment, reduce production costs and energy security.
All of this, finally, allows the company to make the production more competitive and to maintain business even in an instable economic situation.
What main trends of the ISI credit market will strengthen and will affect its development until the end of 2015?
Is there a percentage rate changed?
Medium-sized rate projects will be depending on the Central Bank policy, and the regulator now demonstrates that the key rate reduction is to be reduced.
However, the radical fall of credit prices for the ICB should not be expected.
The current situation of the problem is, first of all, an inflation that makes the necessary increased rate for real income.
Furthermore, the cost of money in Russia remains high even when the CIA rates are reduced.
In the case of the duration level, the traditionally small and medium-sized enterprises that are limited to the extent of money, as well as the adjustment of economic behavior, will certainly represent a larger risk for creditors.
I wouldn't have been waiting for a significant reduction in the share of bad credits.
The main reason is the international sanctions and their negative impact on the economy of the country.
New Mazda C-5 and a perfect mode.
That is the word of Mazda by the Japanese jerome.
Red, laconical and simultaneously complex is for those who are close to the cyliline or the latin.
Like the new C-5 crystal, as well as any other brand model: without ambitiousness lifted out, technically made inside.
The Japanese simply, under its "approximity", can be able to fulfil the bonds of the Star from the sun to the state of full relief.
You can make the arguments for the use of cars from other countries and, in principle, a person agrees to these arguments, but the whole communication is divided from the final phrase: "But this is the Japanese car!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Such people must probably love not only the technician, but also all other Japanese.
To quote from Bases, to administer youaby's food, to collect your cats and to get your friends - no, no, no, no, of course, but on the canon of the Japanese modern mode: nice, creative and very unexpected.
I am glad that the Japanese school form is the only form of which girls are pleased and after the school ended.
It has wonderful properties: simultaneously, feeling and striving.
And as older girls, the sweet is shorter.
The main change in the external N-5 is the decision of the radiator with five horizontal lines.
But where the more powerful changes the box of a new pharmaceutical image and the backwards, where the car is currently known in the stream of the car.
As before, Mazda C-5 seems very conciliant.
The force is harmonized, the forms of feelings, but the externalness has a stress flow.
I don't have to call the police.
Rule C-5, one of the world's most safeest, can only be experienced by the Japanese peace.
The distance engine of 2.2 l provides a high-speed moment in a wide speed range.
The fuel expenditure of this engine is composed of an automatical transmission and a full device.
Black bones, black sweet, black sweet...
To add a little black humor to this image, you can choose ligs with a police legend of No Cross.
In addition, Mazda has made maximum efforts to not be found on the C-5 Rule.
In order to increase the compound, maintening this excellent management, the reconstruction of front and behind amortisators was transformed, and the shape of the front markets had also optimized.
The full system is adapted under Russian conditions.
The speed level of roads and motors at high speeds is decreased by 13 per cent.
The cobaltor in the flowers or shoes is the same as the budget sedan.
Another case if a girl comes in a purchase with an original drawing.
For example, from a computer game in a roll shock.
Attention to her then is not less than the new C-5!
In the new C-5 improved construction as well as behind seats, which provides the optimal reserve of space and for wide shoes, and for long feet, who owns.
Another long-term evaluation of the faces in the front of the central tonn is now mild and not shocked by the ships in the expressions.
The most wide range of active security systems of Mazda is proposed just at N-5.
In order to identify potential threats, there are radars, lasers and cameras.
There's an adjustive lighting here, and the warning of the east from the field, and monitoring the dead zones, and safe movement.
Mazda C-5 is one of the best baggages in the class.
The load of a minimum expenditure is loaded by 561 l. The seats are represented in proportion 4:2:4, each section has an individual output market, and increases the bath sequence up to 1560 m.
The cost of the multifilm in Japan is called "cigurums".
It looks particularly nice cygurums.
We can do it!
Of course I'm sleeping.
But it is still to develop small children.
Or simply shoot such a beast on the street...
Because it is so nice when there is a opportunity to choose — a pleasant clothes, a manner of conduct or a car.
Thanks for the preparation of the KawaICAt shopping.

After turning to Kieve in February 2014 and the follow-up of the two Kiev countries, they began to organize relations with Moscow in the atomic sector, announcing that they refused to cooperate with the Hmelnik of the EAS and on the project of construction in Ukraine.

At the same time, in the past year, FedEx reported that there were 500,000 temporary workers at the feast.
The share of its shares was about 2,5 per cent of the pre-related trade for 45 minutes before the opening of the complaints in the middle.

In the most expected years of meeting, the Federal Reserve System will take two days this week in a 27-foot-foot table from the Gondoras red tree, decided whether the key percentage rate is nearly 10 years old.
At one time, a rich shocked room for meetings at two stages will depend on the sighted image of the United States.
The map is reminded that the President of the Federal Reserve System Janet L. Ellen and its colleagues should make the economic interests of the country above all others.
The Central Bank has received a double order from the Congress: to increase the employment in the United States and to maintain the stability prices here.
However, since the Great Recesion, the Federal System acknowledged that there was a third non-registered mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate may be an unknown factor in a almost sponsorized decision announced on Thursday, whether the United States economy has been prepared to take place from an unprecedented stimulation provided by almost zero short-term rate rate since the end of 2008.
Even the majority of data shows a reliable growth in the economy, the recent stress on world financial markets can maintain and so careful leaders of the Federal System from adding validity by raising the federal fund base rates - even only four per cent.
"Certainly, the labour market and inflation will become the first and most important object of consideration", said Lindsy M. Peegu, the main economicist of the Broker Company Stiff Nicolaus & Co.
"I think that if they're looking for a reason not to take up the rates that increased the incertitude around the world market enough to justify them to wait forward," she noted.
There is no consensus on what they do in the Federal Reserve System, which itself produces the financial market smuggling.
About half of the economists, recently revised Bloomberg, predicted the increase in the rate in this week.
However, financial markets are expected that the federal system will be maintained, while the key indicator only shows the likelihood of fast-speed adjustment by about 30 per cent.
This may lead to the market of actions if the Federal System is raising rates, provided that those who make decisions do not strike the promise that the next increase will soon be increased.
The Dou-Jons Index was at 228.89 paragraph, or 1.4 per cent, up to 16.599.85.
The flight was prompted by expectations that the persons who determine the federal system's strategy have left a tax on this week, said John Lonceki, the main economic group of Moody's Capital Markets Research.
"It's a surprise if the federal system increases the rates at this time," he noted.
If the Federal Reserve System is doing so, "we must go far in the adoption of their strategy to keep the financial markets in the hands so that they are not packed."
Other experts pointed out that the increased rates could be enhanced by the financial markets, as this would enhance the incertitude of how the Federal System would operate.
Every month ago the Federal System seems to have been able to spend 0.25 per cent in this month, making the first small chain in a long-term reliance of financial conditions, which could be reaffirmed by the continuity of the United States reconstruction.
Ellen stated early and at the beginning of the summer that she expected to increase taxes in this year, despite the complaints from the Liberals that the economic progress is needed.
Although new workplaces were delayed in August, the growth in the labour market was stable in this year.
The unemployment has reduced up to 5,1 per cent in the last month, which is the lowest indicator for over seven years, and almost at the level of the Federal System considered full employment.
The rate of payment shows speed signs.
While inflation continued to be lowered by the yearly central bank for 2 per cent, the Federal System stated that the key cause was the temporary effect of oil prices.
The economy "it can be achieved with higher rates and needs, taking into account the reduction in the labour market", noted Ian Sheferdson, the principal economist Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, the financial markets around the world have become shocked at the end of the last month, after China has smoothed its currency.
The average Dou-Jons-Index for Industry Accounts slowed to a total of 16 per cent in May with high importance, as investors feared that the delay of Chinese economy could slow the world growth.
The dimension of its positions in this month, and the Dou-Jons index is now at about 10 per cent below the high value of May.
In order to guide the Federal Reserve System, the market restraints are further complicated in the unfair calculation of the rate of increased rate.
"In the absence of the fact that the financial markets and the news on the weakness of China's economy would have become closed to the chain at this meeting, " said Steven D. Oliner, senior researcher UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former official of the Federal Reserve System.
Now, according to him, they will expect at least a month to obtain more control of the consequences.
"There is a great incertitude of the consequences of the American economy and they have almost no reliable data after the last events in China," said Oliver.
The health of the world economy does not include the main concerns of the Federal System, and its techniques should not be taken into account in the decision-making.
However, the Federal Reserve System became a world financial authority.
The impact of the Central Bank in recent years was great.
Only one mood from the then Chairman Ben S. Bernak in 2013 was that the Federal Reserve System could "speak" its money expansion, calling out the markets over the world.
In the world where markets and economic systems are still more slower, it may be expected that federal reserve system leaders will not only follow the development of events around the world but also consult with other Central Banks and experts to understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process is "speed art than science", noted Zakari Karabel, director of Investnet Inc, company, which operates in global state management strategies.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted in this month that "in the history of the Federal Reserve System, there were excessive reactions to the financial market movement that seemed to be not related to economic principles".
Laker, a member with the right to vote by the Federal Deputy for the Open Market Committee, which has made an example of decisions 1998-99.
The Asian financial crisis led to the fact that the Federal System reduced its base rate by 0.75 per cent for three meetings, "inviting the limited identification effects for growth in the United States," said Laker.
A year later, the federal system has deleted these reductions.
The Federal Reserve System should set the first place for the stability in the period of large crisis, such as the market in 2008,” said Adam S. Pozeen, former member of the Bank of England Tax.
The last panic and nearly did not approach this level, he said.
"You wouldn't, of course, want to be in the situation when you fear the growth of the rates because the markets are shocked," said Pozeen, President of the World Economic Institute of them.
The Federal Reserve System Act continues to have a double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and, until that changes, I do not think that they should overcome the events.

The note at Washington Post is beautiful that it's all over.

The Brazilian Pediators Riu-Grandi promotes healthy food for the grain
The Brazilian Pediatric Organisation SPRS has planned a skandal method to avoid women in the need for full food during the crudeline: the method is to demonstrate the images of girls with coats that are designed by harmful food images.
There are various proteins, grains, vitamins and hydrocarbons from which children receive all nutritional substances that are required to build a strong immune system.
With respect to high energy needs, women pregnant and born are recommended to increase daily calor standards at about 500 calories in the shore.
However, recent study shows that one improvement of calibracy is not the only change in the diabetes that the mother must do.
In recent study, Robert Waterland, professor of the Bailar Medical College in Texas, has found that the healthy food of pregnant women actually affects the expression of genes in children and prevents development in them.
Unfortunately, the negative impact of the inerte food on the immune system was identified.

Now, AMA recommends not to do this, but, from its view, to prohibit it.
I understand what happens unexpectedly - said the Vice-President of the Steven Pernis.
But in the way that there is now a box, such situations will always occur when the sports receive blood disorder or brain rape that leads to death, or serious damage.
For this reason, AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with this.

Sergey Narican invited the OBSE to derogate sanctions with respect to RF parliamentarys.
The scripture of RF Sergey Narashyn was called an invalid introduction of sanctions against parliamentarys.
In this regard, he declared, speaking at the UNOBSE session in the Ulan-Baktor.
We appreciate this as an invalid action as a reaction to the value of the parliamentary diplomacy.
"It should not be repeated, because it is a demonstration of political impurity and ignoring the principles of an open international dialogue," said the political.
Furthermore, Narşistan called the OBSE participants to restore Russia and the EU's partnership.
Let's go back to policy.
Let us return dialogue and the right to the practice of international community.
Let's turn back the gumnist ideas into democratic orders.

The Champion of Peace on a easy atlet of Sergey Suvenko.
This season can be called a triumphal for a 24-year-old lift from Barnaole Sergey SUBENKOWA.
At its coronal distance of 110 meters of barriers to win Europe's command, to set several recursions, and to become a champion of peace, which is first in the history of a dividend barrier.
In addition, recently, the Sports wined the 2011 final stage of the Brazilian Liga, which was a third stage.
New Publications requested Swedish to share the impressions from the coming season.
Sergey, isn't the season for you yet?
Yes, I'm going to go to World Military Games, which will go October to Core, and then I'm going to think about the rest.
True, I'm ready to be home now, Barnaole, and being home is a very different condition.
It's more easy than every week to spend peace.
You've told you that the bathroom's a loved year for you.
The end of August, the beginning of September, is a great time.
After the primary season, the load of responsibilities will not be given.
You can be joyful, "slowly".
You know, and let me go right now...
What about the slowness?
All the seasons are special, positive emotions...
The slowness to the end of the season is always shocking.
And here's no importance of what I've done more - winning or playing.
Each rating is stress.
Standing ships, movements are not all going to the body.
You're physically and emotional.
But now, of course, my emotions are on the floor.
I'm just happy.
At the time they finished the world champion in Peking, you're often back?
That's right.
Yeah, you, journalists, don't give me this to me.
But in fact, I think that the bad sporter who lives in old wins is cutting his successful ships again and again.
A couple of days have been pleasing, and we have to move forward.
The preparation for this wonderful season was very different from an accurate?
I can't say that something was such a particular thing.
We've been ready to start in December, but the winter season I've missed.
The first train was home in Barnaole, then at the meetings, and then home again.
Everything's normal.
But with the trainer, I was able to try to go to a new level that I wasn't yet.
Practically, the winter costs the base.
They flew a number of crews, trained together with physics, including and burdens, and we hidden the shoes.
Then we took the barrier training, and many were employed by technicians.
How do you follow the fighters?
I'm always trying to do this, well in the Internet's era, there's no problem.
I saw the winter champion of Europe, and there was a shock in the bar.
I thought more: I need something to do, to remove the company.
With each age in this season, you sweared and sweared the results.
Does that give confidence?
I have all the last seasons that are about the same scheme.
Not what I'm going on first 13,20, and then 13,50.
I'm always slowly cutting my shape.
The main thing you wanted to do is get away from 13 seconds.
All the work was focused mainly on that result.
But paradox is that you feel that you're ready to shoot, and that the snacks are not always ready to show up your willingness.
How was it, for example, at the Olympice in London?
I, if honestly, tried to forget it immediately.
It was very good, really it could get away from 13 seconds.
Even if it had repeated his best result at that time, it would be a blonde game device.
But it wasn't lucky.
Do you remember your first world champion?
What about it?
It was in Tegu.
I wanted to get out of the final, it was a Maximum program.
And he went away from the morning in the pre-spot flights.
Then I realized that smelling and smelling the head is that there's no way to fly.
Two years later, the World Championship in Moscow has already been finished with the best time.
I remember my feelings before the decisive shift: I wanted to win "good" already!
How is it possible, developing a good speed, nor losing the head?
And this is the most complex.
We need to be very accurate, focused on the technology so that we don't get the barriers away.
I noticed that when you're not on the result, but on the process, it's very easy.
And the most chair when you feel that you're flying and that's like yourself!
The real word, it's right.
Many of our aircrafts from the depths after the first serious success are trying to move closer to the capital.
Didn't you ever have such ideas?
The house's still better.
You don't imagine where I'm without my train, whom I need?
Maybe it would have better conditions, but I'm trying to be satisfied with what I have.
C, you've been together for a long time?
For 12 years, since the atletics came in the light.
Exactly, I first trained his wife who worked with my children, and then she brought me.
I started with a spant, and then shooted, three.
The child's multitude was that when they put a moon, they're walking along the place...
In 14, I tried to run with barriers, and I liked.
From the first time, the standards of the second adult group have been implemented.
That's it.
Didn't the fear of barriers ever be?
Sometimes it's possible to agree with them.
But there was always a lot of work on the technology.
It's over one shooting!
But there's nothing to do from this routine.
The technicians have to be able to shoot me on the night, I'd get up and fly through the bar.
Everyone who saw your seat in Peking claims that it was a very beautiful flight.
Thank you.
I like myself.
Normally, I can't overwhelm my shoes, and I couldn't stay here.
But the effectiveness needs to continue to work - no preconditions of perfection.
Don't you worry now that the winning a year before the Olympic Game is on a hard load?
As in such cases, I try to justify expectations.
Once you chose this way, it means to go to the end.
My trainer likes to repeat: if you're not weak, no additional snake should feel.
And I'm absolutely agreed with him.
Lar Kushanashville
Well, I'm not so nervous to make me aware of the reaction to the interview that happened in Ukraine.
People are busy, I understand, their bread isn't smelling, shut up the enemy.
And even though I didn't have a fleet, and that's the same thing, a million times I spoke here, and nobody's calling anybody's right, it's a different job.
All my pseudonyms have been shocked in seconds.
Pressing I'm doing is so strong that I even, the kind of a couple, I think the people are white.
It's going to go, go, and it's on you, and it's gonna swallow you.
But you need to know me, I'm not a room oral, I'm sweet, I'm a sweet, I'm old, people, I'm afraid.
Another matter is no support.
I didn't have such illusions, but now...
The best in me was always self-sufficient, so you're making it.
And to give passports to such kinds like Fred Derst or Monson, they're just shooting.
I'm better, the best journalist, I'm worried.
A week ago, in Kiev, Sara Kushanashvili, crymical events were occupied:
What they did with the Cross Military is a crime.
That's what they call an anonexy.
I believe that the reference to the extensive Crochet has tried to sign anything, nor in any case is inscribed in the general image of human society.
That's how to come to the neighbor and take him a dinner...
The war from Kremell went, and she's finished only there.
I have almost 100 per cent sure that, as the 2008 winter, it started from a shoe of Cremell's shoes.
I have proposals who could be...
It's not so long and there's been a lot of life.
I don't understand, he's the biggest artist, why he's supposed to smell his hands.
He's gonna lose the apartment?
Well, get him a memory.
Of course, people recalled him as a distressing family.
And the reconciliation now depends only on the Lord of the Lord.

Joffrey Haen had a number of options to start carriage in the NFL.
Detroit and Sittle were strongly interested in them after his movement to the United States, as well as many other clubs who sent requests after the impressed open training day at the end of the last year.
But Haen chose San Francisco 49ers and the trainer Jim Thomsula and seems to have been a wise decision.
Some trainers would have left Haya on the floor of all the rest of the games for the loss of the mud that the former australian line player had allowed to return to the band to the winning game with the Minesoe 20-3.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Haney another chance to return the pants, and he also joined him in the game after the rabbit of Ray Bush.
Tomsula was a good side and after the game, in the shooting.
Instead of establishing a division of news in the team's presence, he supported them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Haïn at the press conference after the match.
The 49ers Club Reporter reported that Haine also received support from the team coordinator Thomas McGoy, who encouraged him to forget the lost meat and think about the next game.
Jarrid Hayen lost the skin back to the band of the Minesock Wikings team during the first fourth time.

It was shown by Haen's ruining from the field after the loss of the bone, and later he told the leading show at the Australian Radio station 2DayFM 104.1, which couldn't imagine an older age for carriage in NFL.
"So happens, you're just thinking about the next game and everything," said Hayen.
Hayen compared his debtors in the Origin game series in 2007 when the shooting shooting in his shooting area has tried to Quinsland.
Finally, this experience was very useful for the 27-year-old player.
Haine was photod with Australian flags and fanats after the game and posted Instagram pictures.

Carry warned Lauro about the risk supported by the Russian regime Bashar Asad.
During the telephone conversation with the Russian Head of Sergeem Lawroe, the United States Hospital John Carry, John Carry, asserted that the support of the Russian President of Bashar Assad had a deterioration in the country.
The secretariat Kerry understood that the support of Russian President Assad is risking to enhance and enhance conflict, and to undertake our common goal to combat extremism, if we do not focus on the search for conflict resolutions in Syria through an effective political transition,” states the report published on the United States Department's website.
Carry reaffirmed the commitment to the United States to combat the Islamic State Group (the act that was prohibited by the Supreme Court in Russia) in coalition of more than 60 States.
According to the secretariat, Asad "now can be a member of the coalition " .
In the telephone conversation, Kerry also stressed that conflict in Syria can only be permitted by a political transition from Asad.
In Belarus, the Russian home was threatened for isolation because of the support of the Asad regime.
The named Chairman of the White House Joshua Ernesto threatened the exclusion of Russia if it would not stop supporting Asad.
Ernest, as an alternative, proposed to join an international coalition conducting anti-terrorism operation against the Islamic State.

The head of the Russian Middle East, Sergey Lawrence, stated that Russian soldiers have been in Syria for many years and helped Syrians to learn the technology to apply it against Islamics.
Four of them died when the police opened the fire of the resian guns in Nepal.
Four men, including the four-year-old boy, were killed in the south of Nepal, when the police began a shot of residence guns in a ball protesting against the proposed new constitution of the country, as the official representative in the midst stated.

Besna Purad Dakal, the chief of the surrounding police, reported that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered in one of the police offices, some cast and heating bombs.
Mr. Dakar reported that the police used smoke gas, then shooted in the air before shooting rain bombs.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were arrested, said he.
It is not understood why rain bombs that, as they know, can kill, but they traditionally use as less dead alternatives have caused such high mortality.
This was the last few weeks of disastrous protests in the Southern, equivalent part of Nepal, where the representatives of Madezi claim that the new provinces in the new Constitution would reduce their political influence.
Protectors also passed western Nepal, among the peoples of Tara, who wished to have their state.
At least 40 men, including 11 police officers, were killed in cruel cuts, starting from 10
August, when four major political parties signed a country-partition agreement, which became a decisive step towards a new Constitution, but a very coherent issue in Nepal, which has been centrally managed over a few centuries.
The new Constitution work has been carried out since 2008, but legislators have accelerated the process after a destructive earthquake that has led to thousands of people in April.

Road work on two parts is already being carried out.
How is the president of the city undertaken by the RF on the construction of child gardens?
In July this year, 105 children were born in Saansk.
This positive demographic in the city has not been observed over the past 27 years.
So the issue of the security of places in children's gardens today is one of the most active ones.
From 1 September, the capital reparatory No. 10 was closed to 320 places.
The estimated value of the reмонn is 86 million rubbers.
Those cities haven't ever been obtained.

With regard to the construction, I add that Sayanch is one of the four cities of Pennsylvania, which entered into the programme for the residence of the class economy.
All necessary documentation is prepared.
The 90-section blocks will start in the nearest time.
We all declared that the building of 100,000 kW was very much of the lives of the Wilhelants to participate in the programme.
One of the conditions of housing must not be 300,000 rounds. Rule by one square meter, that value is "to the key".
If we take the amounts given, we will continue to participate in the programme.
With regard to investors, we and other interesting projects.
During its time on the territory, the Saian Sweekend Peek was built in 2004 for unexpected expenses.
We're working with the Prosecutor on the Protection of this treaty.
More than the earth under the object is in the federal property.
It works with Moscow and is addressed to the transfer of 88 g in the area property with the subsequently transfer of the land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor preparing for reconstruction and launching 1,5 billion rubbers.

Like in old good times, the participation of urban collections and organizations was a paradise.
The city’s airplane, the Sayan Poetbook, was issued.
The senior and individuals who have a serious contribution to the development of Sayanska are undertaken for youth melits.

How are social care problems in Saansk?
In the city there is no need for doctors and pedagogy workers.
In order to address a career question, there is a major importance for housing specialists.
In the past year, we set five rooms for the doctors and four pedagogs received the service housing.
We've been working on a housing program with the opportunity to stop it for five years.
In plans, a building switch which will be built for eight more apartments.

Google launchs a double-building campaign for the collection of $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced the start of a donation campaign designed for the collection of $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping refugee countries who fled from disappeared war and dinner countries.
Google used an unharmed personal approach to the collection of donations in his blog.
Instead of making a statement, Google Rita Madum, who runs with the family of Kabul when she was seven years old, described his personal experience.
"We've come to some doubtful trains and buses, to suffer hunger, desire, cold, and fear," she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But as the crisis of refugees and migrants in Europe has increased, many such people, such as my family, are desperately needed for help.
The donations will be transferred to four non-commercial organizations employed by refugees and migrants: “Products without border”, the International Relief Committee, Save the Child and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that it would take the first $5,5 million of donations until the amount of the google.com/refugeerelief would not reach $11 million.
Europe opposes a stronger crisis with refugees during the Second World War, which was a larger part of the four-year-old civil war in Syria, due to which more than four million people have moved this year.
Many run away from the armed wars of Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Diabetes with small fertilizing may help the surgery
A pleasant effect after the surgery of grain in persons with small fertilizers who suffer a 2-type diabetes may pass at least five years according to the new study.
However, until now, it is early to say that diabetes with small oxygen are more than those who receive non-chirurgic treatment.
"The mortality statistics are not soon shown", said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a expert on the surgery surgery's new study in the JAMA editor.
The surgery of fermentation, or barritory surgery, uses various methods to reduce the size of the heavy.
They reduce hunger feeling and limit the ability to provide food to the organizations.
In a few years, the barritory surgery proved its effectiveness for the treatment of diabetes two, but the main studies were conducted among people with morbide oxygen with body mass index (MT) 35 or above.
IMIT, the weight measure for growth, is considered normal, from 18.5 to 24.9.
IMIT 25 or above, it is said that human weight is lost, and people with ICT above 30 are considered to be gentlemen.
You can calculate your IMT here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new study of Tayban Hospital, Min-Sheng General researchers used data collected since 2007 for comparing two types of barritory surgery - the smuggling and hand-up gastronomy, with the medical treatment of 2 types of diabetes with small heat.
The average value of ICTs in the surgical involvement was from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year of their participation.
At the same time, ICT those who have received non-chirurgic treatment from diabetes remains at the level 29.
Among those who moved operations were totally dissolved from the diabetes 36 per cent, and partly 28 per cent.
The medication group in comparison with the total treatment of diabetes was observed by only 1 per cent, and only about 2 per cent.
In addition, blood pressure rates, triglicerides and " bad " LPNP " were generally better in the surgical group,” states the authors.
Studiers also controlled the blood level A1s, reflecting the blood sugar levels in dinamic blood.
Hemoglobin A1c better hold below 7 percent, writes researchers.
After the surgical interference, the A1c average hemoglobine was decreased from about 9 per cent to about 6 per cent.
However, he remained stable at about 8 per cent in the therapeutic group.
However, the best indicators of the hypoglobine A1c control did not reduce mortality levels for five years, according to Dr. Chi-Heng Su and colleagues.
The research group also compared the average results of two types of surgical treatment.
For the fifth year, compared with the hand-handed gastronomy group, the slaughter group lost more weight (18.7 km against 14.2 km), has increased ICT reduction (0.4 against 5,1) and A1s (3.1 per cent against 2.1 per cent) and was closer to the full remission of diabetes (46.9 per cent against 16.7 per cent).
While a new study does not demonstrate the advantages of the surgical method in the part of life after five years, there is a confirmation on the results of the investigation of people with the lost body in Sweden that the surgical treatment actually leads to a increase in lifelongity, as reported by Bleckstone from the Medicine University in Finix, the University of Arizona.
According to the Swedish study for persons who elected barritory interference, the possibility of died for 15 years was approximately 29 per cent below compared to the group in which more traditional methods were applied.
Despite the new study has not shown increased life sustainability, Blackstone noted that this would encourage people with ICT below 35 interested in this procedure.
" The report is very important, since it claims that such surgical intervention is safe in the group with low ICT, where there is no increased risk of mortality or sexual disease, " said she.
Blackstone adds that people and their doctors should start to be seriously treated as the patient had been in the diameter between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long to make people treat this seriously," she said.
I think that when they get genetic changes that start in their body of gentleness and diabetes, it is very difficult to make it again.
In the Mitians, there were 9 million rubbers from the shoe house.
In the Mitians, there were 9 million rubbers and three women's shoes.
This is the "Interfax" with the MVD Press Service.
The Inspector came on Tuesday morning.
Two unknown ones, through the open entrance doors, entered the house situated on the Garden Street, connected the 20-year-old son of the house and, threatening both feet, slaughtered 9 million rubbers and three shoes.
According to the preliminary data, the amount of the damage was 9 265.000 rubbers, as a criminal case under the Razboy article.
Fanates from Europe are risking to become homeless.
Only 23 Peterburg hotels have the right to accommodate tourists that will come in 2018 to see the Championship of the World on Flotball.
The ultimate guests are not intended to receive appropriate permission.
experts think that's a very worried sign.
In the prevention of the world's primary, the authorities must urgently consider how to divid all guests of the city.
The Rosbalt advisers believe that the cost of the coal apartment is 10-30 per cent due to the turtle, and that and after the champion of the coal housing, it must be paid.
The Championship of the Peace on football was urged to focus on the state of Russian guests.
According to the law written under the first convention, each hotel Petersburg should be classified and prove that it corresponds to the number of stars and the level of the service.
It is now understood that this is not all: the hotels are so scared of checking that they often have not sent documents to request the Federal Antimonopolis Service for Petersburg.
As Head of the UFAS Vadim Wormlers reported, the State has studied 138 hotels and now plans 34 cases for the guests, many who simply did not respond to the anti-mono-users.
There are signs that the leadership of the three decades of companies has been inflicted by a slight or a different number of stars in the advertising, noted the Worshipers.
The problem is that, now on account of each number, no one can lose before 2018.
The officials suspect that during a football champion, the peppers will take all the peterbourg hotels.
Now, in the town of the tourists, 30.5.000 numbers can be calculated.
According to Smollnow, in Petersburg, 17 5-year-old hotels, 51 four-star hotels, 100-2-thirds, 550 one-stars.
According to the first Vice-Premier Committee on Tourism for Nana Guinea, only 23 guests had been classified at this time - such a verification of the company accredited in Petersburg.
And if some of the hotels had ordered such a procedure in regional enterprises, the Smoul of the surprising situation was unknown.
I mean, the last classification may also be more, but no one knows about it.
The director of the Northwest Office of the Russian Tourist Ecatherine Shadaki, who was the last half of the hotels, recognized the director of the Northwest Office of the Russian Union.
This is explained in the high season, during which the hotels pay more money and don't want to do other matters.
Another reason is that the budgets in which the audit expenditures were not paid, and the guest may depend on the status of 30 to 100 000 rules and more.
However, recently, the guest leaders have been intensified and began to make requests for classification, assured the Shadaw.
The hotels have to be paid until 1 July 2016, not only they pay the payment, but have no right to work on the world Championship.
It is already known that, depending on the stars, a fixed payment in the hotel will be developed at the time of the tourism.
The terms for which the value will be calculated are numbered in the next year.
This was made to prevent the flow of prices to 200-300 per cent, for example during the Peterburg Economic Forum.
We need to have conscience and not allow up to two-third times, but the hotels must also be able to pay.
"I think that growth will be up to 50 percent," explained President of the Russian Host Association of Gennadei Lamshine.
In its own view, Vadim Gormimler is not convinced that the fixing of the prices corresponds to the understanding of the market economy.
I don't know how this is in the economic theory framework, but I hope that this measure is justified.
"It's better for an unconscious trip," he said.
It's not clear that it will be with popular hostels.
The Members of the Hospital have introduced a draft legislation, which has to be prohibited in homes.
We hope that this law will not be adopted or dealing with Petersburg.
"We will leave the point of view that the hostels must be kept," says Nana Guazia.
However, in any case, the owners of the mini-actors should be ready to restore the Life Code.
If the Hospital's draft legislation is in Petersburg, about 80 per cent of the hostels, and at this time 1.5 thousands of numbers.
According to the President of the Republic of the Re restaurants and hotels of the North-Zea Ocean Leonida Harvar, in Peterburg there are no two-third hotels, which are once and inhabited by football farmers, as well as in the four- and five-star hotels.
This situation is similar when " 80-month stadiums are 750,000 wheels".
This can be corrected as once through mini-actors.
The expert's possible prohibition is "ideotic": "I think it's strange that one person can live in the apartments, and that's why there is no reason."
If the guest is used as a community, I agree that it's wrong.
But if you come as a guest in which the guests come to a short time, why not?
The mini-hotels are risking to lose the champion of the world on a football and because of their irradiority.
The whole hundreds of small hotels simply have not been able to classify themselves.
To summer 2016, all the guests of the city will be assigned to work.
"Communities that may not take this procedure so much, therefore they will reject less paid orders from mini hotels but choose those traveling," noted Gennadei Lamshin, added that in various cities, such as Moscow and Volgograd, the indicators of the check at this time are significantly higher than the Peterburgians.
The Peterburg Delay is related, including the permanent stops in the Turkish shuttle, which does not contribute to the coherent work.
Experts believe that if the Peterburger hotels are not enough, they may have to be focused on the local guests and the rest home.
For example, Petersburg’s 300-year-old celebration may mobilize a different fleet, which means the tourist guests will be able to live in castles.
Furthermore, many smugglers will be prepared for the slaughter, where they will be able to be at night.
"It's not to make so many guests so they're wearing up." - He's sure Gennadey Lamshin.
The large population will also be used during the football premises.
The most likely one in the city will build coffee reserves.
Rail lines will grow up to 10 to 30 percent.
"The first one will go near the stadium," said a specialist on the Agency for Development and Research in Laris Bragin.
The price of the rail may not be returned to the previous level after Championet, especially in bed areas.
This will contribute to the construction of new transport services in the area of the city, emphasized.
It should not be forgotten by human qualities.
For example, Leonard Harvard is convinced that Peterburg was always a hospital city in which people are not simple to show the road but may still be a mini-exploration.
There's also complications.
My father, in the 1970s, met a family from Murmanska, a father, the mother and two children.
There were some nights where the guests were hard to sleep on the board.
"And the dad brought them to our communal apartment," remembered the cousin.
Indeed, it adds that this is not the case in the inhabitants of the city - to call to her home the consequences and horrible effects.
But may the errors of the hotels and the Government be remembered in 2018 after the unsuccessful decisions?
The Julian's "Sends" of the Amuria area.
Today, with enthusiasm, he looked at the clause of the Jürinus in Goskun.
He did such things when our generation was still learning to trade newspapers, and he is still in a beautiful form.
The topic, like "the LDR protest against the results of the Amirian elections".
Protocols are not triggered - because there is nothing; other protocols, except signed by the elections, are in the LDR, judged at all.
He is the second place of Ivan Abram and shouted something like: "This is the winner of the elections."
And there's nothing to do with Rodney, and then, after the shoot, the fraction of the meetings is out of the meeting room, and it's literally "You're all with the fronts of your shoes and sweets."
The press, of course, is not Abrahamwa, but the skandal and demarch of the fraction as a result of the scandal and distress.
Really, Volfoovic was beautiful and elegantly swimming the Amuria area together with the Abraham.
For the whole country, this is the normal journey of the Jürinus style, and it is not always protesting the political party against the results of concrete elections.
And the fraction was formally scanned, and the elections were not acknowledged, but the leaders of the subject are obviously smiling.
He offers the dead in Amore to shut up their dead, and he pronounced against the only Russians in the whole and nothing that has not been sentenced to Rodney.
A great decision to not lose the face, and in the reality, but not the shown scanning.
Another thing is now that Abram itself is in a strange situation.
He did not expect anything, but no alternative protocols on the hand.
He is not in public attention, on the other hand, and on the other hand, he became formal and to torment the respected Championship, and, in other words, the Champagners in the ER and the ONG.
And here, of course, he must really think about what to do.
Because from the main beneficiary of the elections, policy number 2 of the region and candidate number 1 to the only area of one-handled area, it can be converted into a couple which has been possiblely used by its own party leadership and super-speaker for the same ONG and the Party Guideline of the Foreign.
That's exactly that it wouldn't be Jironic, he would have had to think and look for him almost.
It's still growing and growing to him.
The news showed that LDR returns to the hall during the next plenary.
That's what the bath is gone.
Only the theme of Abram was polluted.
It's really red.
"It's impossible to all come to Europe."
Europe cannot take all refugees, stated that the real decision of the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The leader of the Tibeth Buddhists called for the end of violence in refugee countries.
The issue of the continuing crisis of refugee crisis was addressed to the opening of the Centre of Consulting in Oxford, dedicated to the Ethic Studies, at the beginning of its 10-day visit in Britain.
He stated that in existing circumstances, human interests should be above the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, although this results in refusal, the reaction of Western European countries to the crisis of refugees is not adequate.
"It's impossible to all come to Europe," he noted in his own speech.
Although Dalai Lama highlighted the actions undertaken by Germany and Austria in relation to the crisis, he stressed that it was only a timely decision.
"The concern of thousands of refugees is beautiful, but at the same time you should think about long-term decisions, how to bring real peace and development, mainly through education, in these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we must consider how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We have to deficit the use of force.
The application of the force has never solved these problems," he added.
On violence, Dalaylama also commented on the action of George Bush after the terrorist acts 9/11, said that the US cruel reaction had started the cereals of non-controlled events.
After 9/11, I expressed my confusion in the letter to President Bush and said that the problem could be addressed by non-weapon.
I know that his purposes were good, but he applied power, and it declared unexpected consequences," said Daly Lama.
Four democratic growth in the last four years
Toxicological centres in the United States reported about almost 400 per cent increase, starting since 2010, the number of children under 12 years of age that have been declined with high sperm maintenance, as reports the Toxicology Centre of Georgia.
According to Dr. Gailorda Lopes, director of the Toxicological Centre of Georgia, the case of the proclamation of children to 12 years of hepatitis for the declination of the hands reported in the toxicological centre increased from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
"The children are contacting these substances more and, unfortunately, some per cent of them are sent to the Headquarters", said Lopes CNN.
He said that some children have a special deficiency of deficiency, and some do this to make a impression on their friends, or towards social networks.
The YouTube video shows that adolescents have a declining flexibility as a deep drink.
As reported, adolescents have dismissed the deficiency of a spy-containing liquidity for the routine to get more stronger drunk.
Childs of age may touch the pleasant lowness.
"The baby doesn't think it could hurt him," said Lopez.
Many of the most attractives (disfixing skins for hands) are the ones that are aromaized.
There are deficiencious weights for the hand of clobs, wine and apples, which are very attractive for children.
The deficiency of the hand contains 45 to 95 per cent of the spurt.
In small children, in particular, only a number of disappointments may result in alcoholic equality.
“ This is a high-concentration spray,” said Fox 4 in Cansas City, Dr. Steven Thornton, the principal doctor of the Toxicology Centre in the hospital of Cansas University.
You wouldn't just leave a whiskey with a visa, but people keep these deficiencious materials for your hand, and if children get to them, it's a fast way to use a large number of alcohols.
Rassel, a six-year-old girl who recently promoted a dismissing means for the school with a cluster aroma in a number of approximately four discounts, was sent to the Headquarters.
The blood level in it was 179, in two times more than the adult, which is considered in the state of alcoholism, according to Dr. Chris Ritchy, a doctor who had treated it in the Gwinnett medical centre not far from Atlanta.
He traveled to his words and couldn’t walk when she was put to the office of rapid assistance.
The doctors watched her all night in a single child clinic, not to miss any signs of brain trauma, because the girl fell down and shooted the head, said Ritchy.
"It was very scared," said the CNN Organia Scott, mother of Nazi.
That could be dead for my child.
Lopes recommended that parents and teachers use non-pilot substances or deficiencies, instead of stirling deficiencies for children ' s arrival zones.
In addition to alcohol disappearance, some deficiencious hydrocarbons are linked to deaths.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after the declination of the instrument contained in toxicly unreasoned ingredient.
Health officers suspect that the product contains metal is a death agent, not a physician that was indicated as an active substance.
In January, the three four-quarter students in the north of New York were condemned to compare their "contrast" teacher through the "distribution of antibactrial substances in the class", according to the police report.
The teachers made a strong allergic for desinflators for hand, and she prohibited to keep them in their class.
The police believes that the unsuccessful plan was a " post-debat" and addresses the issues of the discipline of school district.
As the oldest child library in Barnaole became a family club.
At the slope of the castle, the N.N.K. swimming sweet snake in their shoeting library.
The young people who are looking for books are trying to fill her with confects.
A number of generations have been in the library for 95 years.
The first readers in the last twenty - century have been cut here with a slight piece, spectacles on the Maako’s spectacles, literature vectors and recorded with the wife of Lenin.
The record continued four years, and the 1939 newspaper The Young Fashioner, with the "Family of the Constantin Group and of the Child Library of the City of Barnaula" became more strong.
Constantine's hope even sent away from the barnaul friends his child's photo.
And when the barnaulers asked, whether Constantine’s hope would not be influenced by the library, he wrote that no.
The letters are long covered in the museum, and the first readers have to explain whose bad profile steals the barrier in the library building.
In the years of rebuilding, they were often calling different people, saying: Why is the child’s library not renamed?
Please be a library of a good child writer, without political shock!
The village library officers thought and decided to leave everything.
It's the most famous and loved library in Barnaole, as a "leinkin" in Moscow.
On the field in the library, the car is a strike from a helmed cyrpipea.
The "First of the Delicate City" is the favorite theme of the artist Oli Moscowy.
Olla was a legal manager, was eighth working, in five, and all other managers were different from love for qualification.
And then there was an advertising in the Internet: "The illustrator is needed for a book."
The book wrote a little American girl, and she was called "My Cancer Mommy" - "Mother cancer in my mother."
He made illustrations and thought that life could end at any time, and there will be no miracles in it if you don't create them.
Now she works in the library, illustrates the children’s books of the world, and its own statements.
Traditionally, children lost interest in the book that they are still living in some virtual space...
But we're going to read children, and their parents understand the importance of reading -- tells the Russian Planet Director of the Tatiana Kushvid Library.
In the past few years, we have even been assured that the child's library needs, and she will live - the children are going here!
I think it's interested to read again.
The library is a large exhibition with updated photo exhibition.
On the quarter, new photos of readers that are in the entire family library: Mother, Dad, and children.
The library welcomes that the pope has become more often.
If a child had been read all the Cuchows in two years, he needs a book more complex.
But now the law under which the eighth-year-old junk has been prohibited to issue books from category 12+.
In order to get that book, the child must bring parents to herself - they come back and then return, and the "Cruz" slowly becomes something like a family club.
In the library, a revolutional collectioner was conveyed to the King in the annex to the New York magazine in 1936.
Because we are now not only a conceptual booking space, but we are now open to move, we are trying to become a special place: not a house, not a job, not a school, and Tatiana Kushvid explains.
We can come here to read, play, shoot all together.
We've made a game area for a little kid comes just to play, and the hands still go to the book!
Some of our parent readers take care of their feet, but they do not want to get away.
Moms are often coming with shoes - and we are glad that the library is the first place among all the rest of the places where they have to come with the kids.
The mother of Kushvid says: The modern children like the classic child literature as we have ever said:
"The creative matter is now developed, and a lot of attention is given to the authors who are a linking agreement between generations."
And if you talk about small children, they're important to be a hero that travels from one book to another.
Kids don't like to get up with their heroes.
The library regularly issues books for parents who tells what happens in the modern child literature, which books should be focused and why.
The bottles are so encouraging and encouraging that adults are interested, but this library is not for them.
The issue of books on the front of the read room for adults is prohibited.
This magnificent prize has only children.
...In the latest library room, there is a square board with an old wooden box in the bookhouse.
The girls will shut up under your steps -- it's a very old time machine.
With your childhood book you're seeing like old friends: Hello, well, we're not changed with you.
Ellie is still a joyful step on the road that was able to strike with a skilled skille, the ring of the Tolla Rijke's shoes, and Malchish-Kibalchish did not say to the deceased trumpets of the Military Taina is a strong word.
The books are like the passwords, you can know their own in any place.
There are roots in the storage and the real books - for example, the revolutionary collectioner had been with the souls and hermes.
Or to conduct King in a famous annex to New York magazine.
Or the "Morzily" in 1936.
The time was shocked, the page was cut into a tea.
These publications are no longer issued to readers.
It's our future collection, and I'm all dreaming -- I'm going to pension and I'll take a rare child book.
But the kids aren't going to say that, and the beautifuls in old books aren't very light, and the theme... you're opening the first page, and there's Lenin, the party, the commode.
Now you think, why did we all write this Pioneer Truth?
But it was still interesting - it tells Galina Elisa that was a book guarding.
Mursylsky's pages were shocked from time.
Galina Vasiliana has a book guarding all his life.
She knows the color of the cylinder in Buratino, in which Harry Potter was the captain of the Griffindor Championship at the championship, in which situations Carlson uses a motorist, and whom is the father of Alice Severine.
The library work is little paying, and everyone who can live without these lines is very fast to find another professional.
It is only the most convinced ones: teachers, pedagogues, workers of the book culture.
They can also know that it's a professional child library.
If he rid you in the first minute of conversation, it's a professional.
I really love children's books: I like the library that they are precisely and beautifully standing on the fields, and I like to read them, says Galina Vasilivan.
I'm reading everything: military, historical behavior, statements, fantastics.
Reading the modern Russian authors, the traduction...
Of course, I think there was everything else in my childhood.
The books were the most interesting and encouraging of everything that happened with me then.
And as I was ridiculous to love them, I thought the library was a magnificent place.
And I wanted to work where everyone sits and read.
I hope the book will always be, despite the riders.
And I'm glad when our former readers bring children and the grandma...
Listen: The Slovenia does not have any differences
Graphits checked discussions on the differences in Sertica after the recognition of Dale that "Hupps" in a bad situation, but it will correct it.
Harts will protest against the complaint of the Skotland football Association to Neilson, and Warberton is threatening the signing of contracts in January, which might be violated by the team.
"Dons" has increased the advantage before "Seltic" to 5 points
Adam Runey's pants in the first store gave Aberndin a small advantage over the Hamilton in Pittdore, which allowed Dons to save the Set at five points.
Graphits on the verification of discussions on disputes
This has been listening to the differences in the Slovenia, which were sent by Griffits, claiming that he and his team partners were not suffering from any enhanced critical, preparing for meeting with the Dutch League leaders.
I don't think we feel pressured, I think that the games are trying to him.
The Dutch's fault because the Skotlandians do not fight the title - de Bur
The former Reyngers and the former member of the United States collected Ronald de Burr declared that the Dutch football farmers had lost interest in the Saltics because he was not covered by the title of the Rangers.
Where Bour, currently the representative of Akkos, said, "The most appreciative moments in the Holland are no longer shown in the "Seltica" game and why?"
That's because it's not the Rangers.
People here aren't just talking about the Reangers' return.
They're talking about the Star Company.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interesting.
In the Star Company game, it's much pressure, and not only people in Skotlandia want to see these games.
"I'll change everything," said Dale.
Ronnie Dale acknowledged that "Slect" had difficulties, but the Norwegian trainer shouted everything to change.
According to "Malma" and, as a result, the Champion League immediately afterwards the 10-footballists of "Aberdin", which now takes the top of the table box.
However, Dale said, "The Selitha was bad periods and before, and we will go again."
Now we want to get out of this as fast as possible.
I understand that it's very enormous, and there's a lot of people very, very bad or disappointed of what happens.
And we too, but we need to continue.
And we really need the Sletic support because the games are much better.
Stay together now so important.
Warberton is incredibly waiting for January transfers
Despite the view that the whole few weeks ago, they suggested that he determined some of the goals of the January Transfers, the boss of the Rangers Mark Warberton is incredible with regard to the January campaign, claiming that he did not want to destroy the team.
The previous attacker Brentford said: "The Yenvar transfer window is very different from the flight window."
As regards the players coming in the year, you have a period before the beginning of the season for their adaptation, which you have seen in our own group in this session.
The team's really good work.
Sometimes there is more harm to add unnecessary players to what you really need.
The thoughts that Sletic interested, emphasized the finishment of the carriage.
The attacking Soonsy Mich, linked to "Settick" during the transfer window, stressed that he could leave a football after the contract with "Liveds".
29-year-old player had suffered from shipping problems for two years, and he couldn't leave Wells in this summer.
Harts will oppose SFA claims to Neilson.
"Charts" took into account 2:1 when Patterson was removed, and began playing at 3:2, but the red protector card later deleted; this is the third Cololum's red card, which was cancelled for eight months.
Neilson is not rejected by my words, saying, "I didn't make any doubt of the ethics, I didn't comment on the game."
Griffits pleaded to avoid Tynkash.
Hybernian's direct player received a conversation after acknowledging that the song was condemned by the ex-harts game Rudy Skycell.
The university occurred in the Rooseburn area in Edinburgh before the Edinburgh Deb in Tinkasle in March 2014.
"It was a shock, and it was shocked," he said the attacker, adding, "I'm sure I wouldn't go back to Tainkash if he doesn't play for "Slect".
Donnelly: The Tannadis Council is confident in the "Daddy Younged" mining
Simon Donnelly claims that the Board of Directors of Danny Yunetted is still sure that the manager's team will change the situation to the best, but agrees that the deterioration of the situation should be done.
I think Steven Thompson believes us.
We will prepare the people to go again," said Donnelly.
MacInness is glad that he won Hamilton.
Dereck Macinez acknowledged that his "Abertin" team had been desperately fighting against Hamilton Assis to achieve the seventh winning in the first liga, put them up to five points above the "Seltica", above the tourist table, through Adam Runy's channels in the first time.
MacInness said, "No team that would have winned anything is a cube or a liga champion who did not win meetings like this."
The level of unemployment among the Skotlands is not changed, while the United Kingdom will grow overall
BEZRABITY in Skotland remained a level of 164,000 people from May to July, while the number of unemployed in the United Kingdom in general increased from 100,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.

It was nearly a year since Skotland has taken a historic decision to remain in the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen the further improvement of the situation in the Scotia market in the growth of employment and the reduction of unemployment.
Why I Is A Witness in Oclahom
Today, when I abandoned legal participation at the late stage, I'll see how people say it.
If this happens, and I hope it's not yet, I'm going to sit on the guard garage of the mortality camera in the Oklakoma State when Richard Glossip's death infection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
The first request was made in January, through his close friend, and even though I was returned to shock, I agreed.
At the nearest time I was afraid.
So why do you do that?
I agreed, as I thought it was a good way to tell the detailed history of death penalty.
That would propose a unique racism.
Yes, journalists are authorized to attend the complaints in America, and since those wishing are often more than the place, the results of the lady lottery decide who will be elected.
The number of press locations were reduced from 12 to five.
Whoever was chosen, he will look at it without emotions.
I can't do that.
I'm going to sit with the closest friends Richard Glossip, and we have experienced our own relationships after a few months of phone calls and one visit over two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We're often laughing when we talk to him.
The prison administration claims that I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I'm not allowed to take blocks and hands to write what I see.
I have to try to remember all the details.
One journalist from Oklakoma accused me in Twitter that I do my impartiality.
It's a lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he likes to get access.
I thanked her.
She acknowledged that she could "we could" but she still believed that I was wrong with what I do.
Richard Glossip did not agree with what I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me that I was writing, but I wouldn't do this even if he said.
I told him that he could get me out of his list of Witnesses at any time.
But he wants the journalist of the international publication to write it.
If he dies, he believes that it helps the movement of the death punishment.
Kim Belver, a Haffington Post reporter, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this, listen to the subscriptions I wrote.
I'm not going to get here in detail again.
I can't say with sure that Richard Glossip is not guilty.
His acts after the murder, Barry Van Treeze, are guilty of crime.
But I believe there's a great probability that he's not guilty of murder.
I am firmly convinced that the authority for the death condemnation was not enough.
I think his punishment is wrong.
And from this cancer I'll see how he's going to die.
I can't say I'm the whole objection.
It will be other reporters to which you can call for it.
From me you know how this is to look like a man who loves me dies without the need.
The prosecution of the Human Police has been deputed out of the Canning River
The Canning-Well Construction has been able to talk to man out of the Canning River and to remain sweet.
The people of Perta intended to get out of the police, but they didn't know, shooting in a slow water in a few meters from the police officer who tried to "speak to talk to him to go to the beach".
The police of Canning Wail was sent on Tuesday on the illicit pronouncement on the Foreign Territory in Baqingum.
When the police were noticed the suspected, he tried to get out of them and leave to Canning.
But he didn't have a boyfriend far away.
"He stood in the water and said, "I'm not going out, let's go, laugh me," said the senior sergeant Chandel Castle.
The Laclan Perhavez constituted not very much, so he used a more safeer receipt - " negotiations with a good police."
"Atimes people do strange things to try to escape", says the senior sergeant Castledan.
Footballist-chumpion Ben Cassince is that and remembered.
In 2006, Cassince went to the cube to avoid meetings with the police patrol to check alcohol and tried to stop Soon.
His efforts were shocked, but the local people were understood to discover the shooting "Batlon Ben Casinz".
Peter Mudy accused the sports in trying to spy and threaten to get out of the end of the sport
Peter Mudy accused Racing Victoria’s stirs in trying to introduce a spy into his ship last year and threatened that the end was immediately left.
His museum became shoes and officers of Racing Victoria, whom he accused that they organized a personal campaign against him, and removed from old Lady Tatai, because of the violation of the rules of use of drugs in the old day, in the midst, became the last slomb.
Musdi reported Fairfax Media that he always illustrated all the efforts that had been involved in the skatings, and it was in a difficult situation when he was talking about the positive results of the leaderships to what he could not explain.
He held a language about suspicion in the spy for half years and didn't want to "seen as green wine".
"I wouldn't speak anything about it, and I had long suffered, but sometimes you're so exiled from the colea that you're not going to hold," said Mudy.
They know that it's continued.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to survive the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep strongly.
I want to walk with a high-standing head and I want my owners to know - I do everything to them.
When they're gonna start thinking that's not true, then I'll have to stop being a trainer.
Then I have to think what to do with my license.
Previously, Musdi declared sensitively during the interview at the racing.com that the team of the ethics tried to spy in his ship.
"A half years ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stuart sat in the room with the man I'm calling if they ask him, and they invited him to work in my chair to transmit information about what I'm doing in the chair," said Mudy at Racing.com.
They're obviously thinking that I'm a fool.
If so, all of them should, indeed, make a statement because the attempt to get me out of them is not possible.
Robert Rollton, former Chairman of RVL, David Mudy, current Chairman of RVL, and Bernard Sondry, the executive director of RVL, knows about it all the time and now.
Should this make me think that the case becomes personal?
Should RVL be courageous and call for reply to what is happening in this business, other people other than trainers?
Is I a Cool for this Professional?
Is that what I'm wrong for this professional?
Maybe people think it's like that.
Maybe they're gonna have to take my license and cut me out, and I don't doubt what I'm saying now, I can let them think about it.
But I'm coming to the point where I'm all right, and that's my worry.
I'm sorry for this.
I will give pressure to them and give them responsibility for decision-making.
I have a family support, and I can go.
The trainer was only growing during the long investigation of the case with the cobalt and the leaders, and the latest removed horses from the age ordered him to declare that he could "move his license on the table".
Muddy, most well-known about preparing an unbelievable champion of Blake Kaviar, called for the application of medical preparations on the day of the "cover" remedy after the legs of the horses were made compressed from the grain, which is a violation of the rules.
This is a violation of the rule on the shoes.
"I must take full responsibility for that," he said.
One of my wrong workers made her complaint on his feet.
She could get a complaint last night.
She could get him yesterday, as it was.
She was with him on the day of the flight.
Museums may be dismissed for three months in accordance with the rules for the application of medical preparations on the day of decrease for the use of the compresse, which opened the investigation.
It's anchodote.
Those who establish these rules do not know anything about the horses.
"We all know that we need a rule, but it's too far," said Musdi.
A train driver from the place of origin in Kyriam is arrested
The police was arrested by a man who was a motociclist in Kyriam on Wednesday and was hidden from the place of the event.
The motociclist was put on a helicopter in the Hospital Royal Melbourne, with serious wounds after the slaughter of the car on Murray Welle Hawaii on Saturday morning.
The police said that the driver was gone without stopping to help a shocked motorcycle.
On Monday, the 50-year-old residence of the city of Natal was the police in Sheperton.
It is expected that it would be pronounced in the leave of the event, non-assisting and in violation of other rules of road movement.
The motociclist, a 40-year-old resident of Kyama, remains in a stable hospital.
Melbourne Storm train, Craig Bellma, is part of the accused of conspirators in the use of cruel force admissions
Melbourne Storm train, Craig Bellma, called the shooting criticism of his shooting team as a "abination of the agenda" of the two NRL chariot fabrics.
The Trinity Rosters train stated that the judges allowed Storm to fight his team during the emergency winning of Storm in the end of the qualified game in Sidma on Friday evening.
Brian Broncks trainer Wayne Bennet made an outstanding shoot on "Storm" after his team funded a qualification tournament at the Northern Quinnsland Kabujos night on Saturday, when he called this typical game for the driving line and said that two of the Queensland teams weren't successful in the leading appeal.
Bells protected the shooting of their team and claimed that they were just focused on the "contact".
Bellham added that he had the confidence of his team ' s criticism from two leading trains, since this means that they were concerned about the possible slaughter of the Ttorm.
"I didn't hear that Trent Robinson talked about heavy receptions when they played us with account 242," said Bellam in the midst.
I can ask you that we have not changed anything in our systems or technicians, just in the last six weeks we have given special attention to contacts with the smell, and that was a turning moment for us.
There's three years ago, and he's obviously training a good team, so he's probably not likely to play, and it's been a little tricky for him.
It's amazing how it is always shown in this year.
Bellham talked to Bennett's idea about the impressioning football, recalled his teacher that "Sen-Jorge-Ellavar Dregons" had winned Bennett in the champion in 2010, showing a sweet football.
Wayne's talking about the hidden football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with our Friday night, and see how impressing their game was," noted Bells.
I remember that in 2010, St. Jorge was a little criticized, calling a sweet team, and Wayne said that he wasn't worried about it.
But now he has a team that can show what he is looking for as an impressionant football, especially his young half-defenders with their speed.
It's a football in which you would like to play when you have such games.
He made this observation in 2010, and now he wants to all play in the football in his style - not in each team, there are two of them, such as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, that they could play like that.
It gives me more confidence, because they say these things, because some of them are worried about playing with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when they arrived to large games.
Bellham also noted that the "Storm" and "Rosters" game was consistent with a larger number of views than the Bronscope and the "Chavajos" game.
The Broncks game probably was good, I didn't see her, but what was the account? 16-12?
He was at our game 20:18, there were two other trials - and what is that the impressioning football?
Or consider impressed interruptions and unexpected attempts?
It's a rutin for me.
If they mention us, it means that at some stage we can meet them there.
The "Storm" at the end of this week, as they wined the right to take Nort Quinnsland Kaubyoz, or "Cronalla Sharx" on Saturday afternoon at the AAMI Park stage, the tickets will be sold on Tuesday morning.
Prosecuted for the reserve of drugs serbs employed by $2000,000
A man who threatens the life-care prison to spend 40 kilos of cocaine in Quinsand Contract was issued by $2000,000.
Marco Maximich, 29 years old, was one of the five arrested ones last month after the federal police found 100 kilometres of drugs on Solay, who had seen from South America through the Vanuatu, and was shocked in Kumer in August.
During the morning, Maximuit and his messagers were watched at the stage, and later he met them in Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 km of drugs in the Toyota Echo car.
Despite the threat of the deadline of life for the purchase of drugs in the amount of enough to sell, the lawyer Maximвич claims that the evidence that the last party has tried to pull the whole party is missing, and that the man could be in the coffee without any meaning.
The Supreme Court of Justice Peter Flanagan doubted that Maximuit had to leave.
The last report has been linked to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in the court in the midst.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied the police about the place of his arrival.
The mothers and fathers of Maximvich were proposed to put a joint loan to $200,000 for his release.
"The two shows show that the amount of $20,000 is too large for them," noted the Court of Flanagan.
But one of the measures is inadequate as a guarantee that it would not disappear, added the judge.
Maximuit was allowed to be released under the shuttle, provided that it would be held as an Australian and Serbian passport, daily to the police and to observe the comandant hour from 6 to 6 a.m. to 6 o'clock.
Foxis Cacicaris: "I'm going to fight the Greek gathering until the last seconds."
The main trainer of the Greek collection of Fox Cacicaris gave his team after the 1/4 shop of Evobolaket-2015 with Spain (71:73).
He said that the judge of the game has decided to be a specific mistake.
It was a big game, quoting AFP Kacicaris.
We were ready to play a good game in the performance of the Spanishs.
They were forced to work in the defence, but the defence mistakes were identified by a meeting court.
It's painful, but I'm proud of my guys.
They fighted up to the last seconds.
Joel Friend: "I'm going to be in the Cana function."
The newspaper of the CSC Joel Friend said that he wouldn't believe in the wicked army.
The British man also expressed confidence that his new club would be able to break the negative trend and finally win Eurolygu in the next session.
I talked to the trainer Dimtris Studis several times this year and, just after I joined the team, quotes "R-Sport" Fredland.
Yeah, I need some time to rebuild the central position, even though in the NBA I played more forward.
But now it's going to be more to resist the big crowd, but I've already done it, so I think, and now I'm going to do it.
The last time the Army wins Eurolygu in 2008.
Since then, they had six times to Final Four, but they couldn't show their best basketbol.
It's the opinion that somebody's shocked.
All this game, you can't run forever.
Of course, it's complicated, I understand all the disappointment of the club and his ballers.
But we have a good team now, and if we show the best thing we can, we have a good chance to win Euroly, I really think so.
I always wanted to win this title, the mosquitoes have run to the tourism, and I think this year will be the CSCA year.
With regard to the smell, I am not a sovereign man and I do not believe in any wickedness.
I believe in a hard work and decisiveness if you connect these two things, it's possible.
I don't have any certain rituals before playing, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as possible.
Louis Enrique: "I'll be special to Roma with me."
The main trainer of Barcelone, Louis Enrique, was not going to hide that it returned to Rome to the 1st tour of the group tournament Liga Champion with Roma with special feelings.
According to the employer, his current and former team will not be rowned for him.
Let us recall that Louis Enrique trained ships in the sezon 2011/12, but he did not have to show himself with the best side in the capital of Italy.
I returned to Rome a few years later for a certain experience.
I have a very warm memories with Rome.
This will be a special game for me, but that's not so important.
The main thing is to try champions in Liga.
The august-based meeting at Kuba Johan Gamper does not affect the team's action in the nearest match.
I'm waiting for the "Roma" game she showed in the A series against the United States.
It's a strong team that can press and know what to do with the skin.
Wadim Scripthenko: "Crasnodar" has various options of attacking action.
The principal responsibilities of the Hurala train in the prevention of the 9th squeeze of the first squad with the "Ronnodar " noted the diversity of the attacking team schemes.
According to the employer, the "boys" have a number of models in their architecture.
The unit will be 21 September and start at 16.30 at Moscow time.
How we're gonna play with "Ronnodar" we're looking at the official website "Urala" scripts.
We've got a whole week of preparation.
This team has various options of attacking action, and manywise its attacks, and we are not less late, so I think that it will be very interesting.
In prevention of this game, considering that the Krusnodar's lingery of Liga Europe against the Tormund Burundi is working to be very well prepared for the victory.
Rocher Cannez: "Astana's house can look at whom you want."
The Astana Protector Roher Cannez, after the 1st tour of the group tournament of Championians with Benfia (0:2), expressed confidence in improving the quality of the game of his team in the future.
The Assistent believes that there is a ability to draw up the shoes in any competitor.
Despite the weakness of the shop, I can say that we have played well, - it brings the official WEFA words of Cannes. - We haven't got a little bit of courage in the attack.
"Banfick" above the class, but in the home match, I think we can take a look at them.
It's real.
But first we need to think about the Galathazara and then about Atleticco.
In home shops, we can shoot out anywhere.
Rafael Bentez: "To the second time, Cristinana Ronald is the best in the world."
The main trainer Rafael Beetes expressed the satisfaction of the great victory in the 1st tour of the Championian group tournament Liga with Shatter (4:0).
The specialist gave a specialist forum to Christtian Ronald, who became the author of three heads.
Matt wasn't easy because "Shatter" could have a shirt, it brings the official WEFA words of Bentes.
There were no few moments, but their counterparts are always in danger.
I don't know that Real played perfectly, but we were prevailing.
I'm glad that we didn't lose the bones and killed four.
Cristinana Ronald confirmed its level.
This is the best game in the world, I repeat it as many times.
"Christ Ronald can't compare with Messia."
The Barcellone Protector, Jordan Alba, believes that nobody can compare with his colleague Lionel Messy.
According to Spanish, Christine Ronald's Real Force can't do this.
The Messiah's five heads above the other, quotes Le Figaro Albu.
Even Christine Ronald.
Leo's all changed, I can't compare him with anyone.
Daniel De Rossy: "Barcelone" is not only unique, but also clear personalities.
The Roman Protector Daniel De Rossy, a group tournament of Championships with the Barcellona, noted the importance of compact and encouraging in the game with such a strong conspirator.
The meeting will take place tomorrow, starting at 21.45 at Moscow time.
Remember, the CE will take its text transmission.
Barcelone is a special conspirator, a good team with beautiful games, quotes the official WEFA de Ross.
It is difficult to play with birds because they are not only unique, but also clear individuals.
To leave them, we need to smell the whole match and smell each other.
The Messiah has almost always been successful when it comes, so we need to keep compliance and organizationality.
He hopes to get out of the SCA in a slobane machine.

"Dinamo" played well, everyone's got bad shoes.
The team's still lost.
I'd better miss more, but the team wins.

Steven Hog uses a girl's phone to put the pedofils to send photos
Pedofil used a 11-year-old phone to request images of child violence.
Steven Hog took a telephone when she was sleeping, registered into the Internet Service, where a number of unacceptable pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl wakeed up, found a lost phone and found him in the hand of the sleeper Hog.
She checked it and found shocked photos, after which she immediately focused on that.
The police came and saw five images after investigating the computers found under this address, and found "required" requests for the search system using words to discover unacceptable images of children.
Gog then declared the police that he did it because it could "train the pedofils", and then he would "that he was a policeman to fear them."
The author of the judge, Elid Robertson, reported to the court of Sheriff in Dani: "He said that it was a tragic, he tried to fear people.
He acknowledged the requests on the computer, but said that it was because he wanted to make a police to fear the pedofils.
He was asked about the conversation with an unknown person who sent his pictures and asked him to send more photos.
He said he did this to replace them.
He said he had a problem with his head when he drinked, and said he wanted to see pictures of violence and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found a photo on the phone, she called her mother, dry and cry.
She saw inadequate phone images, and then the accused was carried out.
The girl was requested and reported that the accused used computers and "Plaçashn" to talk to the girls who looked much more like him.
Hog, 23 of Ward Road in Dani, acknowledged himself to be accused of making unacceptable photos of children on June 14, last year, violating the conditions of the imprisonment of 25 January of that year and not in the court to listen on 24 March of that year.
The lawyer Gregory Sim called for no request to put Hogh into the list of sexual crimes, since it could be proved that there was no "important sexual element" in this crime.
Sheriff Alister Carmachel has delayed a sentence to October before receiving social services.
Gog was displaced under this case, but he was taken in detention before listening to other remaining cases.
He was listed in the list of persons who have committed sexual offences before the sentence was sentenced.

Hewlett-Packard will reduce to 30 000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard intends to reduce from 25 000 to 30 000 workplaces under its restructuring and reducing services costs.
The same year, Hewlett-Packard is divided into two registered undertakings, separated computer production and printers from faster development sectors of machine safety and service operations.
The estimates resulting from the estimated reduction of workplaces are about 2.7 billion US$, starting from the fourth quarter, stated in the Hewlett-Packard statement.
" This restructuring provides more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise", stated Mag Whitman, Chairman and Director-General Hewlett Packard, who will launch the organization after the separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be less concentrated than now Hewlett-Packard, and business portfolio will be wide and deeply helping the company to move to the new business style," said Whitman.
As a individual company, we are in better situation than before to respond to the growing demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have an annual extradition of more than 50 billion dollars and "food to provide previously unfavourable technological decisions" to companies, is reported in the company's statement.
This is shared by a company educational by the Stanford University of Bill Hulett and Dave Patterd for electrical equipment; their gate in Palo Alto was called "the place of birth of the Criminal Valley".
Hewlett Packard is in a wide reorganization process to transfer from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This is the second step in the world of personal computer manufacturer and one of the largest technical companies of the United States, which is the new development in this sector, based on confidence that co-operated companies work better.
Captain Arsenal, Michael Artet says that his colleagues should support the traumated Jack Wilshire before playing with the "Dinmo Zawb"
In the conversation with William Winger, he also stressed that only September, and that, in the condition of the rebuilding of the Wilshire, nothing would prevent him from turning back to Christmas.
With the very appreciative development of the Wilshire events, at least four of the next games in England will have been clearly held and, taking into account the success, its participation in the Championship of Europe remains in the next year.
Both in this recent problem, Wilshire had certainly finished the past season with the only trauma of the ship and was to come back to an aggressive style of game during the pre-session preparation.
Wenger: "The trauma doesn't threaten his carriage."
It's just not the end of the living bone.
Nothing serious.
It's just a case.
This is not related to ships or traumas that it had happened before.
This may be related to medical point of view, but, as Wenger has allowed, there are additional risks for any player to go back in the middle of the season.
There is also an unpleasant train.
According to the Primier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire had 23 different traumas that had occurred for six years since his debt.
He also played only in 65 of 157 "Arsenal" games for the last five seasons.
If you look at the "Arsenal" schedule wide, you can note that in the six of the eighth seasons, starting from 2007 to 08, the Arsenal was one of the two Prime Line clubs, which are the most delayed days.
Winger recognizes the possibility of shocking in the pornography, but Arsenal believes that the improvement of the raw statistics will continue in the last season.
"Atimely, when you return to the trauma, you're vulnerable for some time - for that time you need to restore the power and take the competitive advantage," said Winger.
Jack's enough young, and it's going to be.
I hope he'll restore physically, I'm sure that his carriage will be the one he won.
The Arsenal starts the Championships in the Mediterranean with "Dinamo Zagreb" and continues to play on Saturday with Chelsey and the next environment, with "Tethenham Hotspur", and Wenger intends to break up a composite.
Ector Belerin and Aaron Ramzi did not come to Croatia, so they would like to play the mother of Debushi and Artite.
Wenger may also enter the part of Kiran Gibbs and Olivia Jill instead of Nacho Morella and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and to give a little preview to players that it needs," said Winner.
Although the Arsenal is favorable in the F group, the Maximim Stadium in Zagreb refers to the most encouraging in Europe.
"Dinamo" hasn't lost any of 41 pieces since they've been able to pass the past season as "unbelievable."
On Monday, the station was affected by the earthquake of 3,2 balls on the Ritter scale.
It was 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is sure that Arsenal has saved the lessons received in the past session when the team has suffered a shock in the League of Champions from Monaco, and remains with the weak hope of bringing a club to the end of the Championship.
"It's an incredible driving," said Winger.
Arsenal has never done this.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but, on the other hand, I am realized with the article.
We have an ambition, but we don't have dreams.
FriendsFest: Commodity show that offered us serious lessons of a man’s friendship
The absence of such stories is cut into the eyes, especially if you see how disappointed men have been, now more than ever, while the level of self-assault among young men is at the maximum of 15 years.
This became the only major cause of death of men in the United Kingdom between 20 and 45 years of age in 2013, and men are three times more than women.
In trying to deal with the issue of the “Campaña against Unfortunate Life”, the Year of Man has announced a year in order to leave the calls of culture that does not give men to help when they need it.
The friend is in the center of this battle to take the calls.
Recently, over 2.000 students of universities who show the symptoms of depression have found that if the patient had a sufficient number of friends in normal vision, the possibility of elimination is to be taken.
On the other hand, those who are not in depression, the circle of mentally healthy friends two decreases the possibility of mental disorders.
But, of course, that the friend works, first of all, that she is.
When communications are managed by social networks when the style prefers, the rapid response is often more than the content of contact.
Our digital life depends on the need to be strong, loved, and successful, even if the reality has a single reign.
Such supernatural success depends on the fact that psychologists call for external values - money, edges, social status, the purpose of internal values, our internal efforts to personal growth and friendship, which influences our mental health.
And as you recently noticed one billion, a video player, you're not buying more happiness for money.
The dignity of Friends is that they focus on this attention.
Each person was not determined by its work, but, likely, through the personality that had been identified in association with friends.
Yumor Joey and the permanent Chandler circumcision, the moments of the football review on the pleasant stages, the slightness of the Russian Rachael, all comes from the understanding that men may feel that, even though they are often retained from the full study of their feelings.
As I said, Samarians: "I'm the role of listener for people who feel depressed and socidian, I stress how even the smallest friendship can benefit."
Often those men who treat us feel not in the power of talking to friends.
The old teaching "living with this" is strong, as well as the feeling that the open conversation on problems can be accepted as weakness.
Friends one of the shows that I'm minding when I try to propose more long-term working mechanisms.
It stressed the few moments of a man’s friendship.
With regard to my task, the bilateral status of telephones helps people at the time of disappointment, and the long-term support is from the nearby family and friends.
So if you're visiting FriendsFest in Comedy Central in these weeks, where the party has completely restored decorations, why don't you take your friends to drink in Central Perk.
Or better, if you see a single man at Starbucks, you're smiling and say "Prive".
Before not mention the benefits of friendship.
Friends Serial shows the Comdy Central from the beginning and until the end, all 236 series, on the #FriendsFest
De Marie forgets the hole by helping "PSJ" to roll Malma
Anhel de Marie is equal to Blood Matty and Edison Cabany's murdered meat at the Malmaw gate.
Anhel de Marie, debtoring in Liga Championon, killed a ball that lets the PsJ easy to spend Malma's Sunday.
This is the match report and the game reaction.
Anhel de Marie and Edinson Kabani did their business when "Sen-Germen" began their game in Liga Champion, with extremely good winning 2:0 against Malmau at the station of Park de Prens on Tuesday.
De Marie slaughtered a mine than four minutes after his first game in Liga Champion, as a PSJ player, to bring the Championships to France, but they left a number of opportunities before, finally, increased their advantage when Kavanoi slaughtered the 61th minute.
In addition to the "Real Madrid" and the "Shahter" group A, "Pari" had to start a good game against the Sweden Championships because they were not targeted to qualify triops, but to continue the series of successful games in the last three sessions where they arrived to the four-fillional.
They were shocked, but at the same time it was not the best decision by Loran Blan to read the Zilatan Ibrahimvic is inutile and then replace it in the field against the team of his family city and club, in which he began his close carriage in 1999.
"It's not easy to win home or guests in Liga Champion, so being winning with account 2:0, bringing problems and playing finely in the protection, is a good start, even if there are other moments that we need to work during the season", said Blan.
It's more promising.
We wanted to win, and we did it, although I regret that we didn't lose one or two more.
Ibrahimvich returned after the trauma in one of the replacement of the Paris team, which brought her no account of 2nd in the "Bourdo" in the first weekly, but he was on the back of the Di Maria plan for the fourth minute.
The Argentinian attacker noted as a player that could come to new levels in Europe, after he was purchased in the United States in the last month, and he proved why he fled from Marco Verratt to protect Malma and was beautifully completed the attack, sent by Johana Willand's swimming shoe in the round of the door.
But if someone waited for a simple and great victory, it was supposed to be shocked.
"Malma" who wins Slattick in a triop to reach this stage, composed of nine world-level games at the beginning of the game, five protectors and two opposite defenders in the middle of the field, was a serious opposition.
But except Nicholas Judgitch, with a shooting shooter on the door of Kevin Trapp on the 34th minute, they attacked a little bit.
The " PSJ" was able to pursue itself by non-resultative transferers and weak attacks, especially by Ibrahim, which only in the first half has been able to perform five attempts, and then did not have been able to handle the shooting killed by Cabani immediately after the renewing of the game.
However, he showed himself much more clearly in the precise passages, and it was a pass from Ibrahim, who was sent by De Maria to a shocked shock that had been in the shock of Vienna for 52 minutes.
The second floor was finally forgotten after the clock mark by Kawani, the slaughter slaughter slaughtered his sixth meat in the season after Ibrahimvich sent a meat sent to the field center from the left band of Maxwell.
This ended any ideas in Malmau about the return to the game, and only the wheat of the Virgin with a close distance did not allow David Luis to increase the final account before the replacement of Essequiel Lavezy was not read in the end of the match.
Malme's trainer, Age Harrede, later admitted that PSG was the class above his team, said that the Norwegian was the last game in the Champion League last December.
Since then, we've only played in Swedish liga, but it's not that level.
Qualification is inadequate.
"Pari" sweetheart!
It was a wonderful shop with them.

Matt Damon against highlighting the ethical diversity of people employed in film production
Matt Damon had met with an African producer Ephy Brown, claiming that it was not necessary to take into account the ethical composition.
During the Sunday of the Project Greenlight on the HBO channel, the famous actor moved Brown when he tried to emphasize the need for alternative views on the main black hero in the scenario project.
"Multiful image is suitable when you're conducting a casting for the movie itself, not for the show," said Damon.
Oshiran Brown, not believed in his ears, sweetly called "Ooh! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

Twitter user M.Pooni has been shocked about a video shown: "The explanation of the fact of the diversity of Matthew Damon's only black man in the TAKE BÉLOE room that is sick."
The Twitter has got more than 5000 twins and 4000 skins.
The statements of Damon appear as a time when the graphic lighting of racial theme in the media is the most strict issue of the public debate.
After 2014, a teenager named Michael Brown was shocked by the police, the Black Lives Matter movement decreased the population throughout the country, calling for legislators and authorities to stop discrimination against a color-based population.
In February, the slaughter Prince mentioned this movement during the presentation of claims to the Album's appointment at the Grammy Awards ceremony.
"The albums still have an importance," he said.
Libraries and lives of blacks are still important.
The recent leaders of the Black Lives Matter have made an official statement in response to the question of the Co-operator Fox News Elizabeth Hassselbeck that would be considered by the group as a group of hate hatred.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love," reported the leaders of the movement.

Inconsistent whether the actor took the invitation and met the Pope.
"American Ninja Warrior" pays the first champion.

And at the end, I never even imagine how it would be... the future is unknown.
A executive producer Kent Wild met the journalist The Hollywood Reporter to talk about the final and why Britain, who first passed the trace, will not receive any money.
In accordance with the rules, money will receive the fastest party.
"If the finished players are more than one, it's the most fastest of them," said Wid.
Although money is a wonderful reward and changed life, it is still a great satisfaction.
I don't think he feels dinner about this.
He's happy to do what he did.
He received the tons of rescued calls from the fans.
He's a wonderful man and a family.
He's hero for her children and wifes.
Jeff said to me, "If I've been suspected to lose someone, I'm glad that it's Icek."
And I think I would feel the same if we change the roles.

Detrot Timeers are quietly talking about Mineoston Tuvens.
MINNEAPOLIS – The second half-year season was not particularly fun for Detroit Timeers.
One of the best beesball teams ever, Tygers now has been the last place in the Central Force of the United States League.
I just recalled to smile, the Tygers winned the Monday in Mineos, with a 5-4 on Target Field.

He was well shown in the battle (walk of battle), notably better in the battle and maintained this quality for the games.
He took three wounds in the second half of the seventh innigue, and Tunes got the best chance of returning back to the game.
Central Bairon Baxton opened the insight by the left line of the field.

Economy - Nobel Lawreat: Globalization
The impression of globalization processes should contribute to a reduction in the world ' s inequality.
The situation seems to be different, the difference in income of the population in developing economy, instead, grows.
Eric Maskin.
In order to correct this, it is necessary to improve the level of education of low-educated workers, as the primary scientist of the International Analysis Lab and the choice of the NIS, the Nobel Premier for Economy 2007, Mr. Eric Maskin.
In the past twenty-years, the world has survived the unreasonable growth of global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become more open.
Globalization Parties have predicted great benefits for the development of the economy.
"And these prognosis have been overcome," said Maskin.
For example, China and India have received a serious growth in the population.
But it is not so happy.
It was expected that globalization would reduce the loss of the " minors" and "imminent" in poor countries, which are expressed in a large inequality of income, and the exact payment of work.
However, this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Maskin in its article “When the global markets have not reduced inequality in the development economy” published in the World Bank Economic Review, which translated and quoted NEE WSE.
With the economic professor of the Harvard University, Michael Cramer, Eric Maskin, has developed an alternative theory that shows why the difference in income in poor countries in globalization is increased.
The new global market has been specific processes.
In order to demonstrate them, Maskin sets four levels of qualification of specialists - A and B for the rich countries, C and D - for the poor.
After globalization, D specialists from poor countries have no level of qualification to cooperate with specialists A and B from rich countries.
And if employees from poor countries have increased payment by cooperating with B staff from the rich, D employees do not feel that their payments fall all over.
A comprehensive effect of the internationalization of production will contribute to increased dispersion between the two categories of specialists in the poor countries and, respectively, increased in equality.
Cramer and E. Maskline suggested a wonderfully beautiful model, an alternative Ricardian theory of comparison benefits.
It explains why globalization has resulted in income in inequalities,” says Foad Alexandres, a ordinary professor conducting the International Analysis Lab and Selection of Decisions, the Director of the NIS Mathematic Department.
And as any powerful theory, I'm sure she's going to lead to an empirical work in this area.
The problem of Eric Maskin is to improve the level of education of low-capacized workers.
However, as the scientist notes, there is no means that they do, but the companies are not able to pay their training.
In such situations, governments, international agencies, NCOs and private funds may play a significant role as a Maskin.
The scientist notes that the developed theory, in any case, does not call for an end of the globalization process that brings and produces its fruit as a GDP growth.

He worked in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The United States government in Moscow deeply regrets the decision of the Russian Government to close the United States Office at the All Russian State Library of their M.I.Rudominino in Moscow.
" The recent RF steps are undermined by the commitment of the Russian Government to link between the Russian and the American people who have not even been interrupted during the cold war and other difficult times of the history of our countries," states the United States Ambassador John Teffta, who was conducted in the Interfax.

The Green Tribunal was soon on the race.
The typical situation: Four officials stand before the court Squatter Kumar, listening to his claim to work.
The court is not satisfied with the quality of your work.
We haven't given you a 110-strand order to comfort it, says Kumar.
If there's another cyrpyptic, we're gonna make up all the buildings.
Kumar is engaged in the National Green Tribunal, the judicial authority established in 2010, in order to stop the intense pollution of the environment with a burning economic growth in the last decades.
At that time, the Tribunal had been able to consider more than 100,000 areas related to air pollution, the collection of mushrooms, geological developments, toxic waste and the construction of dambs.
In two of the three cases, the court decides to stop the building leading to pollution.
Incredibly high: Over 60 years since the declaration of the independence of the violent industrial development, India has turned into a country of women jongles to one of the most popular and polluted countries of the world.
In particular, the problem is in major megapolises where the development of infrastructure is not insured for a delicate urbanization: the city's swimming pool, the rivers are filled with pesticides and households, and the rest of the living masses are disrupted under the establishment of new housing quarters.
Despite the formal support of the green movement by the State, NZT is regularly criticized by the Government of Narendor Modedi, since it is often the main cause of the cancellation of major investment projects.
Yes, in May of this year, the Minister of Environment called the Court of Extraordinary and Incomplete.
Sometimes the court decides that it is really impossible to carry out a deadline in the court, confirms the lawyer on environmental matters by the Council of Panjwani.
However, the unfulfilled departments have a positive part, and at least they put the responsible persons to be slaughtered.
"It's the main goal to overcome this system," adds the lawyer.
The Green Tribunal has already abolished large buildings several times: the end of the airport, the electricity stations and hundreds of smaller equipment.
In this regard, people are also trying to forget: for example, during the discussion of the pharmaceutical company in the State of Telagna, a polluted local fraud river.
We can close your factory, but we respond to economic consequences.
"Their people are losing their job," said Kumar's decision.
However, such explanations do not always have a understanding of simple people who can change their lives through one slaughter.
Similarly, in April, the Tribunal decided to prohibit all vehicles for more than 10 years of entering the capital than the general insurance.
In spite of the extreme popularity and criticism, Svataнтер Kumar refused to reject the decision.
Instead, he stated to the Government of the Deli statistics on the incoming and exit of cars, and made a proposal to buy 10 000 additional bus, prematurely recognised the manufactures if they could comply with the same order.
As a matter of attention, the court began to deceive the sources of pollutant such as waste, fuel quality and even road incidents, the public anger began to smile.
But the worst theme of the Principal Court became a programme for the Gang River, with the temporary anonymous Prime Minister of Narendro Modi last year.
When it comes to the Gange sacred for the river, the judges are often stopping to keep their emotions and move to cry.
You know what the word "saint"?
Someone slaughtered the water from Gang on the statue of God, and there's a fake, and the judge's hot.
You're continuing to pollute the river because you think it's Gang, he's gonna take all our sins.
This is the river we worship and see what you're doing with her every day.
The cleaning of Gang is the most ambitious and precious environmental project an anonymous new Government.
Today, the number of factual bacteria in the river exceeds the standard more than 120 times.
A year from 1,5 to 3,7 million of the infections in it have died from infectional diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi had even offered the Gang's Saving Fund for saving money from the sale of his feet, in which he met Barak Obama and 455 other objects from his personal collection.
The ecologs were accused of the polysm prize: the cost of $7,000 was purchased, while at least eight billions of dollars were required to purify the river.
The Green Tribunal members agree that India is going to be a long way before it could be called by a developed country, but they do not think that a valuable progress should be in the environment.
" In the developing country, the discussions on the environment are often understood as an unreasonable roses, " said the active organisation of the Gang Zoe " Malika Bhannot.
The court is trying to find a golden medium between ecological and development."
