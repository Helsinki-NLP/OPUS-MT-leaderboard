Obama accepts Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not just friendly.
The two wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreements and of the Teherans' destabilization measures in the Middle East.
However, it is also important for the conflict with the Palestinians and the debated two States.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been developed for years.
Washington criticizes the sustainable Israeli seed construction, and Netanyahu introduces lack of will at the peace process.
The contract of Obama on the Iranian Atom Programme has continued to deteriorate the relationship between the two.
In March, Netanyahu had held an overwhelming conversation on the invitation of the Republicns before the United States Congress, which was evaluated as a opposition against Obama.
The speech was not speaking with Obama, a meeting was rejected with reference to the election that was before Israel in his time.
In an emergency call, Professor's got to shoot his girlfriend.
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police's voice that he shot his friend and that the officers should come to his house.
The Lamb was important to emphasize that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably angry, and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
The officers found the body of Amy Prentis and a hand-handed note that was criticized on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to make it back, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who loved me ever." This was underlined by the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by the Lamb.
There was no indication that the Lamb, who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already been 300 miles away to the schools, where he was shooted and killed by the door to his office, according to the information of the police, Ethan Schmidt.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said that university employees heard the shoot at 10:18.
He said that the Lamb had made the uncommon emergency once later.
To the end of the day there was another death: the Lamb took the life when the police checked him.
One day after the shoerei at the university, students and dozens began to hide behind close doors, the authorities still try to make a picture of what the Lamb motivated.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the State, as well as what students and employees knew him, helped them to draw a image of a talented, but possibly difficult teachers.
Students said they enjoyed his teaching.
The police in Gautier, where Princess died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned the Lamb in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the "herourable people" with which he shared his academic life.
Both in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose 17 teachers include, and many students visit two courses.
At the same time, there were some inclinations to problemal behaviors.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who loving the Lamb, said, he was also a little nervous and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that the Lamb told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the Academic Year 2014-15.
Lamb had before the Delta State University requested a license for healthy reasons and said that he had a health problem.
In this year, he was teaching only two online curreses.
The new changes in the university's employment policy mean that the promotion that the Lamb had worked so hard would not be guaranteed for him for an automated way to a position as an assistant professional.
President William LaForge said, he didn't know anything about a conflict between the Lamb and Schmidt, but "actually, there was something in Mr Lamb's thinking."
These are questions that the Lamb can't answer.
After the flying from the campus, the police later found Lambs Spur when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, the Lamb killed himself with a .38 calibre Pistole in the back of a house about a mile south of his parents house at Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington Conunty Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car is still in the car.
It was not immediately clear why the Lamb went to this house, but Johnson said she thought he knew the people living there.
The lamb rose in the area.
Lamb began his work at the university, which has 3.500 students in a city with about 12.000 inhabitants and taught geographic and padagogic geographic.
He was promoting in the early year in PÃ¡dagogik.
One of the long-year-old friends Lambs called him intelligent, charismatic and sweet.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and the Lamb was 20 when she met with friends.
They and their friends were in high school, and he was the sweet old man who tried to add them to the guest game.
He was the woman's warm.
All the girls smile in there when he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and at Brandon's capital.
The Lamb and Prentis, obviously, were together some time.
In the press call the Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no origin of a heritage.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the backstone house, which was limited to a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said the dog was okay.
The former husband of Princess, Shawn O'Sten, said they've occurred 15 years ago, but friends remained and had a daughter now 19 years old.
"He was totally destroyed on the ground," said O'Sten about his daughter.
You and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Sten said he never met the Lamb, but by his daughter Abigail he heard that the Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentis when he and Abigail were both on a summer market three years ago.
Later, they played together with one or another.
O'Sten said his daughter writes and sing her own music.
Prentiss was a hospital who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a barkeeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a weak bar near Gautier, said that he had finished the Lamb and Princess Night in the night on September 5, last time after the Lamb had finished his guitar and mouthharmonica game before a special public.
There was no signs that nothing was wrong.
"Indeed, only a happy couple," he said.
We were on the room and we were struck with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense for kiss.
Schmidt, the whole professor, directed the first seminar program and specialized himself on American origin and colonal history, said Don Allan Mitchell, a English professeur at the school.
He was married and had three children.
He studied the Emporia State University in Kansas and was President of his brotherhood and student committee.
On Thursday, the Delta State Campus in Cleveland took about 900 people, including dozens, employees, students and community members.
Schmidt Ms. Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the guard, while the university's "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
The education will be re-included at midnight.
"We tried to move our students back," said LaForge.
The crisis's over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press Authors Emily Wagster Petus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans attended this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police now says that the Lamb called the emergence after he shot Schmidt, and that the Lamb in his emergence called Prentiss as his wife, but there is no indication that the two were married once.

Michael J. Fox shoes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premier of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also noted for personal reasons.
"We are waiting in the theatre on the Royals, and I notice that the seat is empty to me, and it will be very clear that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for a previous documentary film "Back in Time".
The film starts, and I'm in the sense that I'm a simulated ghost and a weapon length away from there to be with the princess of Wales at a date.

"Back for the Future" had 30 years ago Premier.

UN Chief says there is no military solution in Syria
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says that his answer to Russia's strengthened military support is: "No military solution" of almost five years old conflict, and more weapons will be worse for millions of people.
The United Nations Head reiterates all parties, including the shared UN Security Council, to support together and integrative negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said a press conference on midday that he plans to meeting the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the five Permanent Member States of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom and France - at the border of the General Assembly's Ministerial Meeting in this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the dismisses in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional forces "insolved this situation".
Ban requested the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity that they have demonstrated when reaching a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 Interview values showing that Donald Trump is serious.
Some have tried to brand him as a Flop.
Others left him as a witz.
And some waited for a slaughter.
However, as some Republicans try to go down from the top rings at surveys, it has not worked (not yet).
Decades of the last 11 national investigations showed that Donald Trump conducted in a double area, and some start to ask seriously what does it mean for the possibilities to name the real estate moguls.
Of course, it is too early in the election period.
No one claims that Trump probably will win the Republican namement.
Experts pointed out that Rick Perry's leadership was issued at this time in 2011, with no State in the namement process.
And there are many reasons why he had been fighting in a general choice.
But foreign seat groups such as Jeb Bushs Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Trumps' maintenance and start to leave their dollars to shoot him.
There are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate module is not only a provisional phase:
Trumps' popularity values have turned up to 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidature in the middle of June, a survey of the Monmouth University showed that only two of the ten Republicns saw the real estate mogul.
By mid-July there were 40 percent.
At the beginning of August there was 52 percent.
Now, six of the 10 Republicns have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three of ten say they have a negative view.
And these figures are holding in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60% of the Republicns have a good view of Trump.
Two thirds of the GOP elections GOP would be happy with Trump as candidates.
In a survey of CNN/ORC last week 67 percent of the Republicans said that they would be "happy" or "friendly" if Trump was appointed.
Only two of 10 say they'd be "heated" if he'd be the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates the same intuition as Trump (43 percent say they would be "compassed" by 40 percent, which say the same about the Trump).
The next thing in a shock?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other side, 47 percent of the Republican electors say that they would be "unpleased" or "enhanced" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the stability, the candidate.
A majority of the Republicns do not consider Trump's temperature as a problem.
While Donald Trump is closely criticized for its bombastic and political statements, 52% of the Irish electors who tend to the Republicans believe that the real estate Mogul has the right temperature for a president, so ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the first state of the country, the State of Iowa, where the 52 percent of the Republicns think that he has the personality for a super-commander, says Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 percent think that he has no personality to perform its office effectively, and almost six of 10 independents say that his temperature is not going to the white house, so ABC/Post.
The Republican elections are aware of the idea.
When they set up their scientists, the Republican electors' Trump hold for reality.
If they are asked, who formerly wins the GOP nomination, tells a survey of CNN/ORC from the past week four of ten that Trump is the best weight.
This is a change since four of ten ends July put their money on Jeb Bush.
Complete Revelation: GOP electioners had no clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this time, in the last cycle, four of the ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the namement only 28 % for the final candidate in Middle Romney.
However, a variety of GOP elections has shown the campaign of Trumps as a plastic.
Even if the Republicans gather to another candidate, the Trump still proposes almost everybody.
Some experts point out that the scattered field probably participates in Trump's leadership, while the anti-Trump support is distributed to more than twenty other candidates.
But a survey of the Monmouth university at the beginning of September shows that Trump in a hypothetical head-an-copf resource between the Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, the multitude of support.
He has 13 points before Carly Fiorina, 14 points before Marco Rubio, 15 points before Walker, Jeb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It's a head-an-rent with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who shoots him?
Ben Carson would overcome the entrepreneur with 19 points in an hypothetical head-an head-rent.
A nice majority of Donald Trump fans says they have formed their views.
A new survey of CBS/NYT shows that only a little more than half of the electors who support the Trump say they have forgiven their voices.
Of course, there can be a lot to change this, and no one can really say to never change the opinion.
46 percent said they let the door open to change to other candidates.
However, Trumps is the strongest competitive at the moment of the other foreign sisters, the Neuro surgery Ben Carson, but electors who say they have created their views are twice for the Trump.
6 of 10 Republicns say they agree with Trump to the issue of immigration.
Since Donald Trump in his election-friend two months ago, immigrants from Mexico "Manager" were called, immigration in the public discourse in 2016.
Some are concerned that the bombardical expression of the major Spanish Americans from the Republic of the United States will be dealt with and damaged by new orientation efforts.
But after the new ABC/Post survey of Monday, six of 10 Republicns say that they agree with Trump in immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the ramp light, it seems to be done too.
The flexibility of the government is on new maximums.
On Donald Trump and Ben Carson, around half of the support of Republican electors, especially through their foreign seat status.
Six of 10 Republicns say in the new Monday survey of ABC/Post, they would like a foreign political sister than someone with government survey.
And they're also hungry on Washington.
A survey of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa shows that three of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated in the Congress with 54 percent "unfriend" and 21 percent "successfully".
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusively residents of Germany
Here on the Hobookenweg is the cheapest residence place - with view of the North Seawatt.
In the street, a square meter of a reetdach house costs 73.300 euros.
"After the offer is naturally limited to objects," says the study, therefore, the high price.
A new study shows how a square meter is mostly costing in particular areas.
Of course, 18.70 euros per squaremeter for a student bud in Munchen aren't really little.
On the contrary to Germany's top types, one of the prices comes as Peanuts.
The real estate service bar Angel & VÃ¶lkers has published a rail list of the most exclusively German residential locations - with square meter prices in swimming heights.
There are several tens of thousands of euros nix - per squaremeter, well-known.
But well, who's able to spend it...
Tops: Munich is closely not at the pitches.
Champions League: Bayern unit start by muller and gods
Two-face towers in Pireus: Bayern-Star Thomas MÃ¼ller has just a way.
A happy part of Thomas MÃ¼ller offered the FC Bayern the way to a winning 3:0 at Olympiakos Pireus - then free's.
The Champions League Session is a sovereign attack.
The World Master Thomas MÃ¼ller and Mario dioce have a dream start in the "Mission Mayland" of the FC Bayerns in the Hexenkessele of Pireus.
Trainer Pep Guardiola's shipping game in the Champions League at the Greek register Olympiakos in warm atmosphere thanks to Mullers Doublepack (52./90.+2) and Detzes Treffer (89.) benefits from 3:0 (0:0).
The twenty-five starter in Serie will be the first step to Finale on 28 May 2016 where Guardiola finally wants to take the heavy pool to Munchen.
Muller received his 28th meeting in the Champions League to Bayern's leadership with Olympiakos Turwart Roberto, who took a shooting of the world's master as a flank.
"We will not consider them," said the Chief Philipp Lahm before the game in the Karaiskakis City before 3.6.88 soft fans - and gave the word to the munchers.
They showed a concentrated and engaged idea without clarifying.
Piraus had winned his six recent home games in the king class, including against giant clubs such as Manchester United, Atlantic Madrid or Youventus Turin.
2011 Borussia Dortmund was also shocked here (1:3).
But the battlers, in the seven Europecup doubles with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They were courageous, but they were often unexpected to work in their offensive efforts.
The attacks were often launched by game movement on the Links Out Douglas Costa, which was rarely rounded against the previous slaughter Omar Elabdellaoui.
Muller had been more luck than his flank from the right half of the top left toreck.
In the 67th minute, the World Master was the possible 2:0.
The best chances in half one had Robert Lewandowski.
First, when Olympiakos Stormer Ideye Brown was the pool of the pool from the line (26.).
Then by direct decline, the Torwart Roberto shared with the kin (35.).
Although the battlers used to play dominant games, Pireus was able to set up the Nadelstics.
But on TorhÃ¼ter Manuel Newer was left.
Like he shocked a shooting of idea over the latte (56).
Before the new, Guardiola defended a fourth chain with David Alaba in the center of Jerome Boateng, which did it well.
Mario dioce, after muscular problems back in the frame, first went out.
The WM-Held just gave the green light after the final training, said Sports condition Matthias Sammer at "Sky": "What you want to do anything else, that is already bad."
In the first changing, Guardiola also decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the Lewandowski (59).
Didze came late for Arturo Vidal (76.) and 13 minutes later made everything clear, with a swimming swimming swimming pool.
Before the game, it came to Krawall in the stadium.
After a smaller group of so-called Bayern fans had apparently triggers of guests Pireus with words and ghosts, the security forces took into, and they were slaughtered against the munchers.
At least one Bayern fan was lost from the stadium.
Who smokes has a higher risk to lose denses
Who smokes, it hurts not only the lungs, but also the dents, which is close to a long-term study.
The good news: In visibility the risk is fast.
Hurry has a significant increased risk to lose their teeth early.
This comes from the long-term study of a international research team, including several employees of the German Food Institute (DIfE) in Potsdam.
In comparison with non-smokers, the risk was to lose their teeth prematurely, to increase the 2.5 to 3.6 case.
Scientists had observed more than 23.300 participants.
The main causes for dental disasters were the carries and distortions of the dent meat, emphasizes the difE.
For this parodontitis, to be a risk factor, the authors highlight.
The relationship between smoking and dental losses therefore returns to more common dentists in smoking.
It is not clear that it also increases the risk of cards.
People who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time, the researchers write in "Journal of Dental Research".
However, over ten years, until the risk of non-smokers can be back to the level, the student Thomas Dietrich declared by the English university Birmingham.
People should be convinced to become non-smoking, declared director Heiner Boeing of the DifE: "Twipe reduces the lifetime."
Not to smoke is good for lungs and feet and leads to a good dent health up to the age of our knowledge.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the populations in the age of 65 to 74 years of dentiality were affected by dentistivity, the difE shared.
Previous investigations had already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early dentists.
The new long-term study supports the funds.
Archaeologists slaughtered at KÃ¶lner Rheinufer on rest of the past
Once again, the right Rheinworn in Kulln's Archaeological Funds have been made.
Near the building of the new Rheinbowlevard, architects of the Roman-Germanian museums skelet and rest of historical buildings have been buried on Tuesday, said museum leader Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the start of the construction work at the Rhein, the historics are looking for so-called so-called earthquakes.
In all building projects in the city centre of Colonia, the Museum will always be accompanied as a fachamt for archaeological landscapes.
In the third part of the Rheinbooleard, Archaeologists have now been proclaimed.
The text documents have already been known that in the fourth century, the establishment of a church and the eighth century had established a trier.
Besides the rest of the establishment and the Kirchurm, a Friedhof was also discovered with about 350 plants that apparently belonged to the church.

The EU Commission proposes, in the strict way, a new Court of Justice on TTIP
The Commission proposed a wide reform of the current scheme of Scheedsgericht system to renew the barriers on the planned transatlantic free trade agreement.
The restraint private clarification facilities for conflict between concerts and States should then be dissolved by a more transparent system that is clearly more traditional courts in its function.
"We want to establish a system that trusts the citizens," the competent Commissioner of the EU Cecilia MalmstrÃ¶m explained at the proposal.
Sweden has proposed to make the proposal as a European negotiation position in the free trade negotiations with the USA.
The German government announced support.
By TTIP, the largest free trade zone of the world is intended to have 800 million people.
The plans for reform of the current Scheed procedures are concretely proposed that EU States and the United States choose jointly independent judges for a new investment court.
They should be the same parts from the EU, the United States and third countries.
Predicted is also a second instance for the first time.
It would allow it to revoke a sentence against judges.
By the same time, the prosecutors accepted each other of the Schieds Directors, there was no possibility for their judgments.
In the debate of the last months, it has been clear that citizens did not believe fairness and justice to the old ISDS system in matters of fairness, commented Malmstrom.
In the long term, the Commission wants to work on a international investment right.
There could be, for example, achieving conflicts between Chinese enterprises and EU States.
The main reason for the major resistance of Europe against TTIP is to be the investor State Scheed procedures (ISDS).
Traditional ships are criticized by enemies as a type of parallel justice, enabled by the tax payers to impose national laws or to reduce consumer and environmental standards.
In the first opinions, anti-TTIP organizations such as Campact were not sufficient to the proposals of the EU Commission.
In particular, it was criticized that it should not apply for the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
However, the German Economic Secretariat Matthias Machig (SPD) called the plans as a great progress.
The Commission takes into account the key points of reform which the Federal Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel has developed in the spring with other ministers of the EU.
The old system of private shields are from the table.
The French government also welcomed MalmstrÃ¶m's plans.
The European Business Partnership for Business Europe warned that the economic possibilities were limited by many new rules.
In particular, smaller and medium-sized enterprises could be affected by this.
When the discussions on the Free Trade Agreement TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) can be concluded, it remained clear on midnight.
The negotiations are starting since mid-2013.
The investment protection has not yet been discussed with the United States.
It should originally be a framework for the Agreement for this year.
This term applies to the remaining time.
Delician Folk of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
11 years ago, Sufjan Stevens sits on the beach in the KÃ¶ln Prime Club (hour: Luxor).
Besides him, a Flipchart is registered by the protected folks of the Malean American state Michigan with the Field.
The whole public, about 40 people, is closely reached by the Steven's debate.
He speaks on the hand of various places that he always marked on the map, which tells his minimal and zart ordered songs.
Where they are washed up and how it looks like there, in his home.
Ifther, Stevens is a wonderful creative Irrer.
With the 2003 and the third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State" appears to be slightly composed songs that are very close to the American Folk of the Late Sixty, but they can slowly drown.
It decreased that "Michigan" would be the first part of a changing series: each of the 50 United States will be discussed as follows.
But in 2004 and in Rhein nearby, "Seven Swans" has already appeared, and there are positive expectations.
Reduced Stevens gets up here.
Live is enough to gitarre and Banjo.
A year later the musician who lived in New York returned to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Fel The Illinoise") 2005 appears to be a surrounded master work.
Overwhelming on ideas and stilist finish.
The album grows in the American Billboard Charts and lacks no yearly best list of the influentious music media.
According to productive experiences, Stevens is on the "The Age of Adz" (2010) very large electronic substitutes.
This sixth ordinary studioalbum is still wide orchestrated, however, by programed sequences or beats and plays with all effects and halls.
During the smallest clubs, the shoes shows here will be shocked in spectacles from Neon-style countries and large fluorescent shoes.
Today Sufjan Stevens turns as part of a five-five band by Germany.
More in dark Hamburger maintained in the dark!
Theater represents mainly the "Carrie & Lowell" available since March.
Although now nearly 2000 guests have been able to sit in their shoes, Stevens returned to the intimity and follow-up.
Without a word to the public, the group of excellent musicians plays through the broad album.
From the public it is heard: the discussion is "opulent" and it is possible to remove the "platte on the ground".
First to an appeal, Steven's decisively plays little older songs and finally sweet down under a real applause.
Jeremy Corbyns debut at the questionnaire of the Prime Minister
Since his choice, Mr Corbyns' DebÃ¼t is expected to be asked at the questionnaire of the Prime Minister's appointment.
The new chairman Jeremy Corbyn will give his debut at the questionnaire of the Prime Minister and set up with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will be exalt to put the first questions that he has given on midday after which his performance of the media may be examined nearly and the labour deputy will be examined.
He requested "ancient theaters and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could overcome some meetings to leave them colleagues.
The appeal will be the first parliamentary review for Mr Corbyn's leadership, as it comes after his appointment to the member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC annual session on TuC on TuC.
In the interim period, the decision of the Chairman's workshop, on Tuesday during the day of the National Hymne's date at the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in Style, has caused a criticism of a number of tory MPs and is at the center of several titles in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national sympathy has taken its attention.
A speaker of Mr. Corbyn said he had been "in respectful style" and he recognized the "the Royal Air Force in the air fight against England".
But one member of Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told in the BBC two newsnotes programs that he was born to the Workers, to sing the national symne, "independent" of his faith that Monarchie should be created.
Soon a twenty-five ministers refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's Spitzen Office, and they call for differences in the economy, defence and foreign policy, while less than one sixth parliamentary party supported him originally as leaders.
The BBC Robin Brant, politician co-responsibilities, said that political differences are in the labour, and according to Mr Corbyns' statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of the profits.
Mr Corbyn said the TUC Conference that the Labour proposes amendments to remove the whole idea of a restriction.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith said the Minister of Labour and Rents that the party is very clear that it is only against the government plans to reduce the limitation of 26,000 Â£ to 23,000 Â£.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth working chairman, David Cameron, since he is the Tory Chief, in the last decade, against the Dispatch box in Parliament.
The President-in-Office, who promised another policy approach, said that he had "Crowd-source" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP said that the questionnaire of the Prime Minister is to be comparable, and that it will be left by both "slaughterness" and the distortion of rebellion and, instead, has focused on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadows of the Economic Minister, will be present to him if he does not participate - for example, if Mr Cameron is in the foreign.
He has also discussed the idea that other colleagues are able to take the word, and he talked to John Bercow, the speaker of the undercoming house, to discuss the problem.
When he was leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said he wanted to remove the policy in the style of a "casperle-theaters" which is often linked to the questionnaire of the Prime Minister.
As it was first sent to the television in 1990, the questionnaire was considered with the Prime Minister as the principal barometer of the judgment of a leader and its leadership in the sub-house and his position under its parliamentary colleagues, although critics have argued that they became a carriÃ¨re and needed more reforms.

Pfund increases by speeding loan growth in the United Kingdom
The pound increased by data showing an increase in the loan growth of the United Kingdom. Parallel, the FTSE 100 was increased by the target SABMyer.
The result of Boni in the United Kingdom between May and July was 2,9 % against the same previous period.
This percentage has been estimated as early as 2009 on the time of increased interest.
The pound increased by more than 1 % against the dollar at $1.5505 and up to 0.84 % against the euro at â¬1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index concluded by an increase of 1.49 % to 6.229.21.
SABMller was the extraordinary share on the market and made a decrease of 20% after the transfer of the Rivalen AB InBev offer.
A transaction would combine the two largest routines in the world and combine marks such as budges, sterea Artois, butni and Grolsch.
Burberry actions were higher than 0.9% after encouraged messages from the concurrentity concerns for luxus-government Richemont.
Richemonts' latest sales numbers slaughtered all expectations and showed that the transfer in China - a key market for Burberry - was re-established.
The shares of Glencore increased up to 5% after the mountainbaue said he took $2.5 billion through a sale of shares as part of his debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper center Mond were the largest losses on the index, with a decline of 4,3%, after Goldman Sachs had set its evaluation for the company rating on "very".
JD sports increased around 3,1% after the sporting companies reported a preimbursement of 46.6 million.
The head of JD Sports says that higher loss threatens the expansion.
The director of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum loan for UK employees could mean "more purchase power in the costs of potential customers".
But it's not likely that this purchase power will compare the higher job costs in his company, said he.
The costs could meet the expansion plans of JD sports, added, and that could mean that there are less additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital city: on Beeber-Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Lippie 21-year-old, a handfish with upper flight.
The guy with the platin brown hair is 100 million euros hard.
Before even more.
Mr. Beeber is now in Berlin.
And the generation U17 turns back.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-olds have never heard the name "Ritz Carlton."
Don't worry.
Hundreds of fans joined Justin yesterday.
In addition, Ewa and Victoria from Poland.
However, since 7 a.m., the polyn is located on the cold stone plates Berliner Luxus Hotel at the pussdare place.
The Beeber-Bau: Here you live Idol, whose poster goes up to Stettin, since Monday.
The suite in which the Canadian songs lives, at the day costs exactly much as their mother Ewa pays in half a year.
If it's true.
He says: "In the first time my victory should be sit in the tenth class in the gymnasium."
"I fill her a dream."
School responsibilities?
Who's juckt?
Not the fans.
Not even the biber itself.
He didn't do anything.
For the advertising breakfast of the Superbowl, he covered three million, a two-year account with a anti-pickel company, a lot of dollars on the Beeber account.
And with each pup that looks like him and over the ladder, the beer also covers.
If Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, you're wondering about the window's head.
More than 100 million of people should have been so shocked.
Some say the Hype went too far.
Others point out, Beeber is finally just in the United States and the United Kingdom with its new language "What do you mean?" on place 1.
Beeber itself, whose fourth album is to follow in November, does not first interest many none.
At least he does that.
Pegida-Plakat brings Libanon to Cartoffeldern-Idee
Cartballs or dinners?
It is both in the cartofloor that has developed the Oldburger Imbisowner Hani Alhay.
Inspiried through the speech "Cartoffel instead of DÃ¶ner" on a place of the Pegida movement, Alhay kartoffel and meat cast together on a sword.
On the idea, a placette brought him in a Pegida demonstration with the "Cartoffn instead of DÃ¶ner", which he had seen in the television.
Since then, in his shop, a swimming skin is equipped with meat and cards.
"This is Multiculti for the magic," Alhay says.
The idea of the Libanon is to take place at the Patent Office in Munchen.
It is protected by the Authority, according to the information, as soon as a pattern of use.
How many fleshs and how many cards of the skin are, Alhay does not want to betray.
Just so much, "It's still better together," he found.
In his customers, the Kulinary People's Reciprocity is also well-being.
Metcash starts a land-related campaign to combat Aldi accidents
Metcash tries to protect the IGA filiaries before a Aldi-Authmash in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food-western Metcash has started a land-campagne to defend the market share of IGA individuals in South Australia and Western Australia for a $7,7 million invasion.
While Aldi prepares the opening of two distribution centres and the first 120 lodges in South Australia and Western Australia in the next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food providers and build IGA Marke through Mainstream marketing and marketing on social media, as well as events like Adelaide show.
IGA shoppingers and suppliers spring to board, with brands like iron manufacturer Simmo from Dunsborough, which distributes samples in IGA lands and sold shopping shopping tickets for the South Australian football liga to faithful customers.
It is expected that Metcash will be published further details of its defence strategy on September 29 when the large leaders carry out its annual investment strategy.
It is much on the game, since South Australia and Western Australia almost 30% of Metcashs IGA loads and generate higher winning margins than Metcashs IGA network in the Eastern States.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoricly provincial, and IGA individuals have a more strong market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30% in South Australia and 24% in West Australia compared to about 14% in the Western States.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will be deleted for 12 months after the opening of its first markets, around 5% of the food market in these two States and that all existing operators, but mainly self-employed individuals will be deleted.
According to a report published in this week, the Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA units could lose $360 million per year and Metcash 250 million to the end of 2016.
This prognosis is based on the acceptance that Aldi opens 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and will reach $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss of food and food business and the amounts of Metcash high fixed costs could be about 13 million dollars of Metcash winning before interests and taxes, said Mr Kierath.
At the same time Metcash lost market share in the Eastern States, mainly at Aldi and Coles, although a recent investigation of Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most faithful.
Morgan Stanley argued that Metcash's repercussion in food and food business is 3.8% in 2016, at 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018 and the market share of 14% in 2015 will be reduced to 10.3% to 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told a business session in Melbourne that Metcash would probably be in a decade.
Metcash refused to react publicly on the comments of Mr Douglass.
But it will be said that a member of Metcash has contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
The IGA market share has been reduced from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010, and income from Metcashâs food and food trade providing about 1.200 IGA individuals has been 43 per cent from 2012 to 43 per cent, which reflects the operational debt reduction in the same pressure on repayment and margins.
However, the large shop is growing and investing more than 150 million dollars to compare sales prices with Coles and Woolworths with hundreds of products every week and to improve the IGA units in improvement of their loads through rapidly growing fresh food and provide a better selection of private label life.
Metcash's principal business manager Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and loading programs will be adjusted to Elan and hopes that the largest employee will return back to the first time in 2017 for four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis gives greater lob as critical for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "coalitional damages" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and granted in view of the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy most Lob as a criticism for his own behavior.
Cokkinakis, a young man of the talented Duos, who is always called "special Ks", is shocked by the fascinating interview of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters Masters on the light.
In a fair qualification game in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his partner Ryan Harrison had to be separated two times by the swimming leaders, and Harrison said: "Wawrinka had to shoot Kyrgios, and I should shoot the child."
While he was lastly seen as he destroyed a tennis-platting, after a crack a potential US open seat of Richard Gasquet, he was firmly defended by Healy.
The adolescent is now in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth, on the second place in Bernard tomic in Davids-Cup-Halbfinal against British.
"A thing I'm quite exciting is the fact that, according to my view, Thanasi was put a little into the war," said Healy.
He destroyed a shooter because he lost a shooting in the United States, but he is not the first player who destroyed a shooter of fleet with himself, and I know Thanasi enough to know that he's not proud of it.
But, indeed, he has been extremely good in the United States opening, even under the very provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he's giving a lot of recognition.
He's got a great team on himself, he's got a great family about himself, and I think he's being treated too strict.
He's a very thrilling 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he's walking in the team and soon, he has never had a problem with the other players, he's respected in the environment, he's trained hard, he's good in shape, he's a very stable and excited young man, and I think he's worth to be assessed after his own services.
Healy also supported the decision not to take into account the important decision of Kyrgio, which begins on Friday, and describes the "general decision" as the right for all, but safeguards the man from Canberra to return to a long-term set part in the team."
"We first want that the team is completely concentrated on the competition and not on all the contraverse around [Kyrgios]," said Healy.
And I think that Nick has made the resort very fast, which people like Federators and Murray have indicated. He has grown in the eyes of publicity, and he has made some bad mistakes and wins all the critics he has done, but we try to support him, we try to make him understanding the consequences of his business. Sometimes outside the shock light in which he can think about it, I think it's the best for the manner and it's the best for him.
European Refugee Crisis: Hungary explains the state of the border, closes the borders
Hungary declared the state and resigned the southern borders with Serbia on Tuesday and observed all who tried to come illegally into the country. All with the purpose of stopping the throne of migrants.
Chao followed the border, as hundreds of migrants gathered together in a country of nowhere, and Serbian officials reacted with rebuilding.
Those who were flying before violence were shocked for an unknown time in a landscape at the road between the two control points of the country and built ceilings and left there.
But the frozens slowed.
When a police shocked over them, the migrants scanned "Open the borders!" and shouted clauses against the Hungary Preparation Police.
Some foods from protein food and water back.
Serbia Foreign Minister explained that it was "inacceptable" that migrants would be returned from Hungary while coming from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbian) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
In the next days, there must be a conversation with Brussels and other countries", said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulences at the Hungary-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation block at a strict meeting in Brussels, no common immigration policy could be agreed.
However, the Ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who were looking for refugee in the overwhelming Italy and Greece, which expressed their hope that finally - the next month or the end of the year - would achieve an agreement that the EU States would take more than 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
The Federal Officer Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special office of the European Union to address the continent's migration crisis on Tuesday.
However, Hungary did not put his hopes to a rapid action of Brussels or its neighbors.
The emergency in two Southern regions in Tuesday gave the authorities more power to control the crisis, so that they could switch the roads and accelerate asylum procedures.
The Hungary Foreign Minister Peter Ssijarto said that his country was also the construction of a steel rail along his borders to Romania, to stop the throne of migrants through the country, after it ended a sorrow on the Serbian border.
CBS News Correspondent, Charlie D'Agata, reported that even prison sequences were used to build the stage race between Hungary and Serbia.
In the past months, Hungary has become a significant engaging and starting point in the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and other parts in the Middle East.
However, President Victor Orban has found that most of the incoming economic refugees are in the search for a better life, and not war refugees, which have a right to protect - a view that is strong in reciprocity to other EU States, including Germany.
The new laws in force for midnight in Hungary make the overriding of the borders or the damage of the 4 meters (13 feet) high punishment that the government has made up the southern border to Serbia, which also set up higher prison penalties for convicted persons.
"On the basis of the situation that has occurred by the mass migration, the Hungary government declares the state of emergence," said the government speaker Zoltan Kovac's reporters in the southern town of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: illegal border transition is a crime.
The Parliament must still agree on the use of the military, which is expected for the next week, but reporters by Associated Press have seen hard-weapon soldiers with vehicles and dogs a long time on the border.
Gyorgy Bacondi, Countryes Security Adviser for Orban, said that 45 people were trying to find out the borders, and 15 other were already deeply entered into the country.
They come out by harming the punishment, they are now in the police and are accused of crimes in accordance with the new laws.
The authorities are in order to quickly repair the punishment.
The Hungarian officials also concluded two of the seven border transmissions with Serbia after a steelwaggon with a steel route to close the borders.
Chaos crossed the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungary opened a small office in a metal container, to edit the data of people and press a human size to join there.
It was about 20, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the most important truck connection of Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they could return to Hungary.
Select-2016: Hillary Clintons Prepayment before Bernie Sanders in national investigation
The former United States Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues to have a two-third in the democratic wage for the namement at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders will win her against the ground.
Clinton has now supported 47% of the democratic elections (58% before), while the sanders are on the second place, with 27% (augmented by 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not announced whether he is candidated to the President, is supported by 15% of the democratic electors.
More than five months before the beginning of the forecasts, most democratic electors say that it is too early to say that their view is fixed, which candidates are supported.
But Clinton's supporters are more responsible in their choice than the other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey, Clinton lost a number of demographic groups while Sanders achieved some wins.
Clinton holds a great deal with women and gentlemen, but these predictions have reduced.
Your support for the men is clearly cut, and Sanders is back here only with 5 points.
Clinton's advantage in democratic elections under 50 years has been fleet, and they and sanders are now at the same height.
However, Clinton has a large shock in the older elections.
In the last month Clinton was a two-scanning prepair in the Liberals, but Sanders now have a 5-ponct prepayment at this group.
Another half of the democratic elections of the pre-selections are saying that they would support Clinton with enthusiasmation if they were appointed by the party.
A fourth would support her with some preserves and 15% more would support them only because she is the candidate.
6% would not support them.
Maybe it's not surprised that Clinton's current supporters are particularly shocked by her.
The views are stronger mixed with those who do not support Clinton today - only a fourth would be supported.
While 48 percent of the democratic elections say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm, less republican electors say this about their piccent candidate Donald Trump (35%).
If Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question, why they want to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 per cent) follows that it is time to be a President (13 per cent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 per cent).
Clinton's supporters are also mentioned their connection with Bill Clinton (9%).
The approval of the problems and the selectiveness is also discussed.
Since the Vice-President is taking a potential for the President's office in the Waag School, 57% of the democratic elections would like to see him in the rain - although a third believes that it should not be done.
If democratic elections are asked who would be their second choice for the party, it's a angry on the pitches.
Clinton's attendants say more than half that the skins would be their second choice far before Sanders.
If the skin is decided not to candidate the namement of the democratics, Hillary Clinton's prepayment is increased before sanders, of 20 points with skins in competition on 30 points without swimming.
Fifty-five percent of the democratic electors see Clinton as a candidate with the best opportunity to win the choice; but this number of 78 percent in the last month.
The skin is a second at this measurement, but the percentage that looks like it is the most selectable.
However, the question of what is more important in a candidate is called democratic choice questions.
Like in the last month, there is no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for this election candidate as an inacceptable table.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates give good results in some important features in the choice of their party.
Most of them consider Clinton, sanders and skins as honest and trustful and with strong leadership qualitys.
Beden is the best of the three candidates from honestity, while Clinton's strength is the leading force.
Thirty percent of the democratic elections do not believe that Clinton is honest and reliable, so many say about Sanders (15%), but 27 percent have no view of it.
Democratic elections generally see also Clinton, Sanders and Beden ideologically in accordance with their views.
In all these measurements, some four of the democratic electors have no view of sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and a server are continued to be held as a foreign minister, most democratic electors are satisfied with their declaration of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions in general.
But it's a different story in the United States public.
The half of the Americans is now unpleasant with their statement, while only a third is satisfied.
The public view to this was divided in March, short after the problem was lighted.
The majority of Americans said that e-mail control did not have an impact on their general views of Clinton, although 36 percent said that their opinion was still defeated.
It is mainly the Republicans, more than six of 10 who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is viewed honest and trustful by the electors of their party, this is still a problem for them understood: only 32% they are earnest and trustful, eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less than since May.
62 per cent of the election owners do not maintain a honest and reliable person.
At the same time, 55% of the chosen countries also see Trump as not honest and not trustful.
However, Clinton and Trump receive good notes to lead.
From the six tested candidates, the best switchs, Carson and Bush are to be honest.
A majority of sanders looks more honest, but as Carson has no views of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 democratic elections in the pre-selection is 6 percent points.
Ben Carson is on a country-wide survey close to Donald Trump
Ben Carson is located at the latest survey of CBS News/New York Times close to Donald Trump
The two candidates are now half of the support of the electioners in the new survey, and others are dramatically losing stop.
The Republican electioners continue to support a large number of trumpets. The support increases from 23% in the last CBS survey, which was held before Fox News in the last month, to 27% in the request of the Service Day.
But in the same period, Carson was 6% to 23%.
The survey also acknowledged that Carson was well accepted by demographic groups, and that Trump was about with high-education in the Republicans.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio-governeur John Kasich, is shocked with Wisconsins Gouverneur Scott Walker, who has been the most deepest deeply, even from 10 % of support in the last month to 2 %.
The former Florida Governeur Jeb Bush, the former Governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio is located on the third place with 6%.
The error margin in the sample of 376 persons from the Republican elections in this latest investigation is More or Minus 6 % and was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey, published last week, shows that Carson increases in the surveys - he supported 19% in the Republicans, after the Trump with 32% support.
The recent survey of ABC News/Washington Post also showed clearly the Trump before Carson.
With regard to one of the past weeks, Carson, Trump found a few sides for the former neurochirurgics, even after Carson apologised to ask Trump's faith.
"We need energy", said Trump on the past Saturday during a campaneous event in Iowa.
Angular bath temperatures: The East Mediterranean is up to 29 degrees heat.
Even if the pitches are measured only in the television, there is a trip on the Mediterranean to present a warm water for bathrooms.
A bathroom in North or East Sea should be a shorter comfort at maximum 17 degrees.
Some do not go to the sea: Maximimal 18 degrees have the water in the North and East Sea this week, shares the German Water Service (DWD).
Bade temperatures still offer the Mediterranean: in the East it is even up to 29 degrees.
In the Adria, it is 25 degrees in France 23 degrees.

Five members of the brotherhood with the death of a Balch College Neuling
Two years later, after a student died during a sketchy ritual of a student connection in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, the murders were sent against five persons.
Chun "Michael" Deng, members of the New York Burke College Pi-Delta Psi assembled brutally during an introduction national in September 2013, and delayed his transport into the hospital, which had been involved in his death, shared the police.
The officials said he was shocked with a 30-pound skin skin, and was repeatedly attacked while he tried to get a goal over a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about head pain, then he was unconscious.
The members of the Pi-Delta Psi branch did not call the emergency number 911 after Deng was deniable and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital, so the police.
However, they had time to change dengs' clothes, google his symptoms and contact the national Presidents of the brotherhood to get the Council, said the police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this point the members began to hide Utensilians and put the well-being of brotherhood on the basis of Michael Deng," said the police chief Wagner.
He couldn't be resurrected, and the next morning he died.
After an autopsy report, Deng was repeated with stroke power injuries to head, smells and upper tank.
"There are many families that have been destroyed by the skins of the brotherhood. At least one student dies from the Scans every year from 1970," said Douglas Fierberg, a law lawyer who represents the Deng's family, in a statement.
Brotherships and their members must be taken into account, and this step of the authorities is very important.
A Continent Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an appeal for murdering three degrees for the first five members.
Twenty members of the brotherhood, including Mr Me, are also accused of a criminal association.
"We do not only want to be responsible for those involved but if there is an organization that has sanctioned it officially or inofficially, so we will also take them into account", said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baltic College has prohibited the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood has reacted to the local group.
This will happen when the Fed increases the interests
An increase in the interest rate, and the houses will be generated in channels, payment rates will be increased, and the economy will be led to a recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it will last and how long it will stop.
In particular, the history of the economy only provides low guidelines to the end.
A recession occurred within 11 months after the first increase of interest rates and duration of 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserves in increased interest rates is often, even though not always, a factor in how the economy and the financial institutions react.
As a result, representatives of the US Central Bank have so strongly emphasized that investors should not focus on when they start to increase the interest rates, but much more on the period required for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
At the end, however, market operators may find that the total restraints may have been transferred because of increased interest.
"The first increase of the feed since the global financial crisis will be interpreted immediately by some as a signal for the end of the "balanced money" era", said Julian Jessop, Chief of Capital Economics, in a communication to customers.
On the contrary, we are not expecting the continuing return of US interests to normal heights, but still at a low level to lead to the sixth shock that seems to be afraid.
This does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here is a basis for historical trends in how some areas of the economy could react:
As the market has been seen in the last month, the advancement of interest increases can make a time volatile.
The impact is not so dramatic when increases.
âA tendency is apparently to decline 12-24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in the monetary policy,â said German bank analysts in a new study on what happens after increases in the feed.
Indeed, in the past 35 years, the market has been mostly in the slope - about 14% - on the way to increase interests, was very difficult in the 250 days (mean wins of 2,6%), then returning to a normal state of 500 days, with a average retail rate in the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to an current analysis, the Bob Doll, Chief installation strategies at Nuveen Asset Management, published at Barron.
The German Bank said that the effects on shares tend to be significantly in the increase cycle and that the revenue begins to reduce.
Recesions are a fact of the economic life, but interest increases often promote them.
In the current case, the feed is faced with certain conditions that have not been before and could accelerate a recession.
It is also noted that the brutal domestic product will be close to its lower point at an increase in the interest rate of the feed.
According to the German Bank, 118 interest increases since 1950 only two times the nominal BIP was at 4.5%.
Although the second quarter 2015 was at 3,6%, only few expected that this will be delayed and expected for the third quarter according to the information of Atlanta Fed only 1,5%.
Increased interest rates in such a questioning economic culture could be risking and the question "If it is different this time", said the German Bank.
The market sharers took place throughout the year to increase the feed, and all the eyes were addressed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategies and economists believe that the FOMC can accept an increase in this meeting, the Futures Gandal is only a probability of 25%.
"In our study all cycles of increase from 1950 to today in a super cycle with increased growth in the PIB and highlighting pre-recesions very rapidly after the start of recovery," says the report.
In contrast, this is a clearly long-term recovery of what was the worst reception in the observed phase.
The current cyclus is the longest expected of the feed since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is up to 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatile, since the market has increased interests, and the pattern is very similar to the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect of loans is faster than in shares when the strategic course changes.
In the case of the income, the inverse seems to change the direction when the first increase/sequence is followed in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, the suppliers immediately fall, said the German Bank.
Charles Schwab's strategies believe that the increase in the interest rates will lead to a closer gap between longer and shorter rates and to a decline in the curve.
High-equity loans often bring better results in such climate, although "we are still careful to expect higher income", said Kathy Jones, Fixed income analysis in Schwab, in an analysis.
It is interesting, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to Fed Strategy expectations.
"Besides the strongness of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations there are some signs that the market has adapted to a more rigorous monetary policy", he wrote.
Short-term interests have increased, the fund curve is easier, credit levels have expanded and volatility has grown - all features of the market when the Fed decrease its strategy.
In the whole, enterprises that develop the largest part of their business in the United States will benefit from increased interest rates and local products are more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debts will be worse, as an increased dollar makes their products on the global market and also the financing of their debts.
"The story shows that "qualities-" actions are to react three months after an initial interest increase exceedingly", said the Goldman Sachs analysts in a report for the customers.
Enterprises with a strong balance have surveyed a average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital rates and low volatility in their shares also transferred their pendings with low quality to average 4 (percental points) and 3 (percent points).
Debts will be a great problem.
Businesses with high shares of flexible interests are mostly lost, said Goldman.
Out of the clean share games, consumers will also benefit from the increased dollar.
Sparer could see profits by higher income, even though experts are different views how fast it will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the classic FM, says parliamentary member Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the sender for its "disputation"
He argued that it is not to differ increasingly from commercial rivals.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that she just tried the Britishs.
Parliament's College Damien Collins adopted the sentence The Voice and said that this is not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "switchs" to classic FM, holds a leading parliamentary member and increases a new pressure on the sender to prove that he does something that the privates do not do.
The Conservative Deputy Andrew Bingham also said the BBC's boss that the public and legal radiostor "verdume" and increasedly not to differ from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "smile" - but it seems to change classic FM," he said.
He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards that started in the last December.
The BBC Music Awards, who started last year, seems to be just under another name.
So, if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples, in which you actually just pull out what is already on the market," Mr. Bingham said.
BBC General Director returned and argued that BBC Radio 3 was long before its commercial competitors when it goes to Live music and public declaration.
What I learn from Radio 3, I will learn about classic music anywhere different.
And there is a commitment to life music and music, which is really unconfronted.
"And to find the engagement of Radio 3, new music and to give new works assigned, I think very important."
Starting this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that it was hard to join the public as it did in the past, because the Britishs are less informed about classic music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only element of the BBC production that, during the consultation of the Committee on Selection of Cultural, Media and Sports, was to come to the feet of the commercial rivals.
The Tory Deputy Damien Collins applies to The Voice - the musical talent show of the BBC, bought by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for estimated costs of 22 million Â£.
See why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly marking?
Lord Hall found that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced "in particular BBC wise".
He added that he wanted that the company "un hot from our sweet steel" when it started a serial of entrepreneurship next time.
However, he refused to exclude the order of additional series of The Voice in the future or give money to payers for other entertainment formats.

In the last month, the lower result was since the start of the records in 2000
Online sales increased the use of phones for buying
Experts believe that the Black Friday has broken the expenditure in November
For over a decade the virtual purchase has grown, and many of the main purchasing streets of the United Kingdom have become spirit cities.
But experts say that there are now signs that the online environments are stamping, after new numbers only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure for August represented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only 5 per cent increases in the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are stating, after new numbers only seven percentage growth in the first three months 2015
"If you consider the growth rates for the past years and return to 2000, it has always developed in the course of time", said Andy Mulcahy, the producer of the IMRG sale index to the Guardian.
He explained that the online sales were increased three years ago as buyers to operate with their phone purchase.
It means that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments, for example, to home on the sofa.
But now it's involved, and we'll probably experience that growth is reduced.
The black-friday phenomenon imported from America is quoted as a reason for the following circles.
Experts believe that the purchaser remains their purchase before this event, which happens on Friday last November.
In the past year the average number of buyers was five times cut off to their computer to make their shoots, and some handler websites cut off.
Experts believe that Black Friday, in which the buyers were fighting for shootings, could stop buyers to make buyers.
A study of the British Retail Consortium found that from 5 Â£ expenditure was issued more than 1 Â£ online.
In some products such as television and wash machines, more than one third of the buyers are now performed via web shops.
At the same time, more than one fourth of the people's clothes and shoes online instead of the model chains in the cities.

The English Service of the News Agency did not report this detail, but said that the management of the companyâs foreign travels was prohibited.

Other losses receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says that the time of the valuable Eastern Europe Manufacturers is over
British employees growing handworker, says Veronique Laury
The number of qualified handlers from Eastern Europe has increased
This leads to opening 200 additional screwfix devices that go to handlers
At the same time Kingfisher 60 B & Q sales plants are closed to the country
Of Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of Daily Mail
It is noted that British households and pinks are undergoing for the use of qualified Eastern Europe workers that carry out the work in their homes
If you can get up with a hammer or a pink to strike walls, you are apparently a minority.
Because British employees are increasingly employed to carry out home workers in their homes, so the chief of the company behind B & Q.
VÃ©ronique Laury, the new leader of Kingfisher, who has the tree market chain, said that a large increase in the number of qualified handlers from Eastern Europe, which offers services to deep price.
Therefore, Kingfisher plants to open 200 more screwfix Shops, which are closed to handlers and to close 60 sales facilities from B&Q.
Mrs Laury said she wants to work more women in B & Q-Shops because eight of ten purchase decisions are taken by women.
The men are now overcoming with the employees.
She said it was necessary to put the growing demographic trends that show more women's single budgets that are more renewed than in the past.
Ms. Laury said, "It's still working a majority of men in our branches.
We need to move this to a more balanced weight.
In fact, half of our customers from women is 80% of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision process.
Ms. Laury, who is one of the only five women at the top of a British Index in the FTSE100, has also changed her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions.

Aich/Dob officials because of infidelity before court
In the country's court, two officials of the Austrian Volleyball Vice-Minister Aich/Dob have to be responsible for infidelity and expenditure interference.
The accused were not accused of being sentenced.
One of them was also accused of official abuse.
It has been free of law in May.
The current process has been declined.
Under the investigation, Ober State Avocat Robert Riffel was criticized that the lawyers used for private purposes in the years 2006-2011 funds of the United Nations accounts, which were available to them in their functions.
The damage is covered by about 400,000 euros.
Sport officials are also accused of financial acts.
This fact was the Chairman of the Creator, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It must be negotiated at a later time.
The defence in the conspiration of the infidelity indicated that the agreement had not yet been a share of possession.
Sport officials had only calculated injuries and the sport club, for which they had been working from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money, had been debt - the passive was about 600,000 sculling in 2001 (set 44.000 euros).
"After then we standed before the situation: Do we continue or try to find the club?" said one of the accused in the Broadquarters of the Financial Office.
He then decided to take this task with his colleagues and mixed complaints.
With all the risks.
"We shooted money to add our life assurances as security to the bank," he said at the invasion.
It should be agreed with the Agreement: you can manage the money freely, it may not be made a debt.
Furthermore, in the relevant financial success, the payment of induced damages is resequently decided until 1991.
Therefore, a part of the injuries has been paid since 2003, as one more on the account.
The former Obmann also explained the operations of the pauschale and not detailed reservations.
The accounts and books managed the two complaints together, said the second accused.
Why the expenditure was not openly opened to the Agreement, the judge asked.
The agreement has not been interested in the details of the financing is important if only the debt freedom was, so the answer.
When an official investigation began in 2011, an amount of EUR 120,000 was exceededed to the Agreement.
That was the resettlement, the accused declared.
This value paper account came on the name of the second complaint and was not known according to the Agreement.
"Why?" the judge wanted to know.
The questionnaire did not know the answer for a long time.
Then he finally thought that he believed that this was the best for the United Nations.
If something happened to him, no one would know about this money, the lawyer put the State lawyer in the room.
The Mitange complaint has been informed, the official justified.
This reference was formulated as "Shaden revocation".
Why would the judges and the lawyers want to know?
The first complaint declared that he had not agreed with this formulation because the treaty had never been harmed.
But what I have to do when the lawyer says, "You are all out of the snake."
"If I am a law adviser?" he asked.
Furthermore, the official said he never had a Cent Containment, he just calculated kilometers and dishwashers.
He has taken into account the Agreement EUR 1.000 per month, but the real transfer has been much higher, he added.
The complaints could not submit exact documents for the previous years.
They were not reserved after an operational examination where everything was correctly judged, they were declared.
The second accused was also a kilometer payment.
All advertisements were in bar, he had to walk from his home to the bank to Bleiburg, explained in his statement.
The main negotiation is continued on 23 September with the question of Witnesses.
Hewlett packard stretchs 30,000 jobs
Furthermore, for three years, the computer racing will reduce further jobs when the company is deployed.
The positions in the US computers Hewlett packard (HP) do not find a end.
The US Technology Centres set up the restructuring of 25,000 to 30,000 sites in its company party.
Thus, the company shared the costs of $2,7 billion (2,4 billion) on Tuesday.
The step will lead to a special charge of around 2,7 billion dollars that will be attacked from the fourth quarter.

HP was still employed at the end of the year 2013/14 around 302.000 employees.
Afterwards the hewlett package was 2.3 per cent.
The large-scale concerts from the California Palo Alto are currently shocked: so the computer and printer business will still be slowly covered in a new society, separated from the most important areas with computer servers and data records for companies and other services.
Both business lines should be notified at the Burse.
A re-interest PC and a weaker demand of enterprises according to its services have recently led to Lenovo to the world's second largest PC manufacturers.
In the third business center at the end of July, the paragraph of PC and printers returned to 11,5%.

Slovenia: Abuse of violence to Serbian and Ungarn borders
The Hungarian police has used in the Serbian border at Roszke's Tennessegas and watercraft against hundreds of refugees.
Euronews Correspondent, Daniel Bozsik, has presented violence on the border control point.
He reported phone:
A group of refugees crossed the borders.
In the meantime, a police line had been formed, and the police had been prepared for a water cluster.
40 to 50 refugees began to shoot with stones, shoots and plastic fleets after the employees.
The officials first introduced uninterrupted pfefferspray.
Afterwards the police used the Trina gas.
Many of the heat gas was spent in direction of the refugees.
That's how the group was dissolved.
Refugees have now retreated something unexpectedly.
A younger and apparently afflicted woman was taken out of the area.
Kids who cut the skin gas cry.
Other refugees settled together and suffered under a breath.
Infringements also suffered by the use of tension gas and pfefferspray in Serbian police.
Time of decision on interest rates for the US Note Bank
The world observes if the US note bank is together on two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, to take the important decision, whether for the first time for almost one decade the interests will be raised or not.
A survey of 80 economists that were asked by Reuters found that a little more than half of the view was that the Fed would do this, now think that the feed will be reducing some longer and the interest rates on the current position of 0 - 0.25%.
It's a historical event, because it has been seven years since the Fed quotes were placed on NULL.
"On the first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the Null resource and starts a process of normalization of the interest rates", said Angel Ubide, leading employees at Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The United States is at a relatively good rate of performance, an adjustment of billions of dollars are added to the balance and generate only a low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rare view of global proportions.
It warned the markets to increase, but the signs pointed out that the opportunities against such a step are good.
The decision shall be announced at 20.00 p.m. on Thursday
Death protection at the Delta State University
After the shoot and murder of his friend in Mississippi on Monday, and later on the day of his colleagues, Shannon Lamb wrote a note to tell him that it "leads doing" at the first murder and wanted, "he could make it unexpected," the authorities announced on Sunday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that the Lamb, Dozent for Geography and Social Science Education at the Delta State University, endeavoured at 10:00 p.m.
And he said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb said to the employee of the emergency centre that the police should send the police to his home.
He said, "I shoot my wife last night" and he also said that it's a "sweet dog" in the house, but "no one will ruin", but it's probably to be angry.
The police asked the appeal on his name, but he didn't give him.
The Lamb didn't explain for his shoes.
When the police had the scenes, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a manual note of Lamb, 45 who said, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to do it back.
I loved Amy, and she is the only woman that ever loved me."
After the letter of the notes, Lamb took 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor for his history, before he finally took his own life on Monday night, as the police turned to him.
President William LaForge said, he didn't know anything about a conflict between the Lamb and Schmidt, but "actually, there was something in Mr Lamb's thinking."
Despite reports on Monday, the Lamb believed that Prentis had a relationship with Schmidt, the authorities said on Thursday, it was "no information, no evidence" for a "trueck relationship".
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Sten, who replied that they were married for about seven years, as a "good man".
The two of them happened 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Sten said he and the princess had had a daughter that is 19, and she was "destructed on the ground".
He said that Princess was her daughter "are absolutely best friends."
Prentiss worked online from home to home, following Linsday Knowles identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Princess.
Knowles said that Princess, who had a dog named Lightning, met with the Lamb for about three years.
"He always wanted to help others," said Knowles
The police said that the Lamb had called friends at a certain time on Monday to tell them, "It's not going to prison."
When the police took him on the highway 1 next to Greenville in this night, the Lamb went his car on the side, flew up, walked into the forest and killed himself with a shooting.
Lamb received a doctor title in the spring 2015 from the Delta State University, as its life switch is on the site of the university.

Eurowings: Airhansa builds the concerts
The airhansa planted a great concentration.
A half billion euros in the year want to spend the airhansa concentration alone with a better organization.
150 of the world's over 1000 leadership forces will cost the workplace.
There are new negotiations with the pilot work.
The airhansa builds its undertakings structure and evaluates the eurowings.
The objective of re-orientation is a result of approximately 500 million euro per year from cost- and reliance synergies, which shared the airline at midnight.
Among other things, there is no scope for passengers at the future.
The Eurowings Eurowings flow was to be developed as well as possible.
In the headquarters of the Carsten Spohr, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings.
Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the concerts are to be held against Ryanair and Easyject.
The organization of the 120 000 employees had been strongly complex.
The airlines were signed under the Head of the Passage Airline Group, which constitutes three fourth of the annual sum of EUR 30 billion.
New negotiations with pilots
In the tariff conflict with the pilot association Cockpit (VC), the negotiations should be re-included after the legally slaughtered strike on Thursday.
This was shared with the workshop.
The theme of the discussion should be the peace scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to get "in a year with a prognosed record result" soon as possible results.
The conflict between trade and airline has led to different strikes in the past months.
The sparconcept "Wings" is close to the transitional supply of pilots.
It seems that the airhansa in the fight against competitors is covered by Eurowings.

Luke Shaw from Manchester United can not play for months because of double fraction
Luke Shaw is at the Champions League League site of Manchester at the PSV endhoven, a double fraction of his right skin.
While this brought the left foreign defender to wine and will be excluded for at least six months from the game, Louis van Gaal does not give hope that Shaw can play again in this season.
The infringement was caused by an unreasonable attack by Hector Moreno in 15 minutes after the 20-year-old Shaw was broken into the PSV.
He was treated on the game field for nine minutes and needed sugar before he was put into the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double infringement and is in the hospital."
He'll be drunk tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operate in Manchester.
It's horrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United, it's very hard and then plays fantasticly, and then it happens.
In the circle cabin, he had a sugar mask.
He swokes.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, then you're going to last six months, and he won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play this season again.
Moreno seemed to be happy to have gone a red map and the shipping of a one-mile feet.
Nicola Rizzoli, the Schiedsman, did not punish the Mexicoans.
Van Gaal summarized that the Italian Scheedsman was wrong.
You can judge yourself when I say that one eight meters and a red map were covered.
It was a very worse attack with two skins.
A Twitter account on Shaw's account said: "I thank you all for your news. Words can't describe what I'm, my way to the genezing is now, I'll return stronger."
As regards this: Manchester United delivers the loss of Luke Shaw at the PSV
The Defender of England has encouraged the European Meeting in France to get to the next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV Trainer, said, "It's a very bad injury."
If a player with this kind of infringement leaves the place, all are very tragic about it.
It's never the purpose of our players to hurt a enemy.
Moreno experiences an invasion when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland Mannance at WM 2014.
"He makes himself very hard because it wasn't his hope to hurt the enemy, and if you hear that it is a very bad damage, it's not good," said Cocu.
For me it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction, so that it was like if he [Moreno] had touched him, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
In the conversation with SBS6, Moreno said, "I know how it feels, I know how hard it can be.
I feel bad about it, I'm so sorry.
The PSV player AndrÃ©s Guardado was also put into the hospital - after a small game of Chris Smalling.
Are you sure David knows Cameron The Lorax better?
It's a thing that all parents learn: If your child loves a book, it's not long until you almost know it.
If you're probably David Cameron.
When he was requested by a provider of children's care systems to call his favorite Kin's book, the President of The Lorax decided to be the President of the Minister of the Lorax, apparent in 1971 to Dr. Seuss' environmental facility.
It was a difficult choice, writes Cameron in a message on the Super Camps company's website, and continues: "Like, moved, creative, and with powerful message, it is a book that I like to read my children because it seems always to give a image or a message that we have passed."
All good and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron properly describes the processing of the book, returns a record of the 2012 film version to add the new characters and details to extend the very short original text.
"In the midst of the city Thneed-Ville, where all the naturals went and even the air is a good, a boy named Ted, the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, he wants to fill a real tree," reads. A lovely interest was Dr. Seuss, whose right name was Theodor Seuss Geissel and died in 1991, but it was unknown.
If this would not be sufficiently suspect: The text presented by Cameron is partly read as the collection of the Lorax film that is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and begins: "In the overwhelming city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artistic and even the air is a good, a boy's named Ted, the heart of Audrey, to win the girls of his dreams."
Although he allows to be a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little confidence of the book. Here is an innocent young man, such as the local environment by the currency of the trees, thneed striking once-lers, despite the protests of the named Lorax, a shocking, "what speaks in the name of the trees".
The most likely was delegated in such a relatively low PR delivery to a helper who had not read the Lorax 20 times behind a child.
A Downing-Street speaker said that the text probably came from Cameron's election office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text of Cameron's employees was delivered, but no further immediate comments were made.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion of England, but it's still hard.
In Pakistan to shoot in the United Arab Emirates, it is a difficult task, but if you have chosen the Framework that England has chosen for the tour, you see a repeating of the 3-0 test series in my map.
I wouldn't exclude any extraterrestreat.
Alastair Cookies page may be learned less than those three years ago, but there are good sponsor players in the Batting exhibition, and Community spirit is strong; they will not be angry of 2012, just a youth-positive position.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is developed as spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he represents an unknown size on the test level, is an option for the attack.
Attention to this message: Adam Lyth is separated from the English test card and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth, of course, is hard to analyze me as his chief race in Yorkshire.
With its seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple, but hard reality is that cricket players are directed on results.
There was no question signs at Joe Root, for example, and this leaded to the namement, there - and I told it previously - the players are their own best choices.
A long time ago, you would have extended the way of Lyth, but he had the control over his own switch.
If he hopedly exhibits further runs for Yorkshire, there is another chance.
The British Trainer Trevor Bayliss loving his position, even though he did not produce such good performances, and this is not surprised me; especially he is a team man.
The question how much time it receives a test slagman to set his sign is difficult.
Lyth got seven opportunities - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton has received the opportunity to home and outdoor games.
The only project that you can raise was that England first in the Caribbean was installed by Jonathan Trott - as Lyth was in maximum form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes here, and he's a shooting man I'm swearing.
He's a X-factor cricket player, which we first saw at Yorkshire in this season when he reached 236 against us on a train bridge place, which was very close to us.
He must receive at least the same chances as before him, but this is of course depending on the vision of mansion in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea to let Moeen shoot next to cookie, which brings a extra spin bowler and would get four quicks, opened up, and I didn't have anything.
I don't see why a shooting man can't be shoot there, and this left country has already shown that he's a devil of cricket player.
Moen may have not completed his job for his County Worcestershire, but he's a number 3 for her, and there's no big difference.
My former team college Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drip before he was opener in 2001.
He did three hundred Runs immediately and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes in the box as backup springers, and in my limited relationship with him, he impressed me as a young man.
People may look at his statistics - average 31 with the shooter and 35 with the ball - and think it's a point, but there's no large number of backup sculpters that raise their hands and trainers have decided for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Unlike the manity, England has made a few pleasant additions at the train table.
The name of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman of Sri Lanka, could be a master cover.
He is one of the most beautiful ones of the game that will bring a lot of experiences, as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes to the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and powerful use in the setup.
I always felt that he was created for the international Cricket competition, as player or coach, and how Mahela has thoughts we can benefit.
Sometimes new voices can take fresh winds in the upkleide cabin, even if the messages are in line with the previously sentence.
Colly's Team College in Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used at the one day, root received a similar suspension against Australia and I have no problem for my part.
Some are not agreed, but coachs and team operators do not determine the timeplan.
And you must think that, as with the players, depends on their jobs from the results.
Such decisions are not taken by light heart.
The Brexit Lager (Brexit = Increased United Kingdom from the EU) could be gained if the economy is in a flat until 2017
David Camerons' unreasonable new negotiations strategy to keep the United Kingdom in the EU will be deeply slowly in difficulties every day, even without the choice of the genital Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn as the leader of Labour or the TUC, which is strongly destroyed for Europe on Thursday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomate friend said newly that some Member States are deeply cut into different crises, as the EU is now and not always because of their own fault, the agenda created by the United Kingdom itself with separate consents and deceived contract changes that they mostly do not want to want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual congregation that it should not be possible if they threaten the social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's Selfie Agenda.
Prime Ministers and Financial Ministers, clothes at meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign cities, make a photo of themselves before a famous local thinking, with or without local sizes, come home and say they will win partners for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants to see abroad British in the EU's Bah - "Let us not alone with France," says Berlin - and let us see that more and more shorter ministers and officers in some major cities have arrived to the point where it is difficult to stay or go.
Germany's careful Kanzler Angela Merkel is a friend, but she has been in the power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it seems bad for her as it has been done during the long-term rewards such as thatcher (11 years), Mediterranean (14) and Kohl (16).
Frances FranÃ§ois Hollande looks at his re-electment or replacement in 2017.
He's also a weird power.
Poland may soon have a nationalist government, Spain, a left.
It is difficult to imagine that they will be cut off to help the Selfy Britain whose energy should be used better to prevent Skotland's exit from the UK - something they do not want to do, because most of the similar trends have differentists.
This is why some of these ministers may have planned even unnecessary observations in the SNP style, while the United Kingdom's Referendum Campagne 2017 to accelerate the Brexit process, my friends are slow.
"The new negotiation was a place" and "Great Britain has won nothing from the new negotiation."
The Europeans know how the Fleet Street can be on their costs and what EU skeptics are the oligarchie of the Pressebarone, but it was not inspired by Tony Benn 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 with a relationship of 2:1.
You can slowly remember Boris Johnson, the Erz Euro-Opportunist who made a name as a "EU-Gerade-Banan" corresponsant in Brussels in the early 90s.
With all his stupidity, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This was the Medley of tax fears, phone-hacking foreigners and the Pseudo non-Ironics, which belonged to most of our large newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought about it, but found that when you sit with a warm Gorilla in a kitchen, you better distribute bananas to stop him instead of become his dinner and dinner.
Indeed, Miliband was more Blairianer than Blair itself when he opposed Cameron's Referendum, since Blair had established the principle of the non-accepted EU Constitution, which then was rejected by French and Dutch electioners in 2005, which opened to him a shift.
The press has never come to him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly crap on the back on Monday in West Minster, - I told him that he no longer needed time to forgive me - seems in danger to repeat Neil Kinnocks Boykott Murdoch Strategy of the 80s, a mistake at the time and today.
It can duration, but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
The official position of Corbyns to Europe is - I'm so kindly pressing it - in development.
He said we should remain in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside Ukips traditional blue and the wild fillings of Torys Klein-English is likely to say everyone.
It's what Hilary "A Benn, but not Benefit" Benn in the radio and at the television this week, when the pathfinder struggled in him, not to admit that Corbyn's name of the provoking John McDonnell was a bad idea as dark newspaper.
It reminded me of the 70s when his old father tried to be unlawful against his workshops, without going far and losing his kitchen job.
Hilary fight was still attractive.
But to fight to "to remain under all circumstances" - Benn's expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his colleagues and Members on Monday after all reports.
Whatever you want to give to Corbyn's so-called boot-up image - you think that he even has touched me - news-disciplin remains around the time of TV around the hour and before all things in the Structure of Social Media, a Brust of Paranoia and Treasury.
It is right to give Cameron no free cards for Europe that allows him to maintain work support in the referendum campaign for self-conscience, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins thinks that's sure.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic multitudes to the EU membership, in accordance with their Benefits, its anti-kapitalist past, is no longer a question of the Estetic debate among links departments, for which the Narzismus of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic conflicts.
As with its several details to Nato - Tom Watson, false feast is convinced that JC does not start a campaign - foreign diplomas will be obliged to try to find a sense for their own officers.
Why should Paris or Berlin pass the political capital, - they have also misstrayed electioners - to make permissions to the British, if all this can be uncomfortable?
The United States are already quite depressed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a decrease of the Tory government at the power, which I have been reminded of what was called the British Influence Security Forum when I started Monday.
Experts criticize Report of Public Health England on E-Zube Cigarettes
Insurance of a Stately financed Agency that e-smokers are less harmful than smoking came from a meeting of 12 persons, in part with smoke industry, said researchers.
Experts who write in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) are launched by criticating the evidence used by the Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-sigarettes.
PHE published the "global report" in the last month and describes it as a "comprehensive review of evidence".
However, some researchers have investigated the loadability of the data and pointed to the connection between some experts and the tabak industry.
A Leitary title in the Medical Journal Lance last month, the "excellently winnful basis" was based on the PHE's most important conclusion.
Two more researchers write in BMJ and asked whether the skins "build on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor for European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor for Clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said that the public expected that the PHE's statement "the current estimation is that e-smoking is about 95% less harmful than fuming" is based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 persons who were invited to develop a model for a multi-specific analysis analysis (Multi-critical Decision Analysis - MCDA) to make their opinions about the damages of different nicotin content products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were combined in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a meeting sponsor was a company named EuroSwiss Health whose business leader was to have received for an independent study before British American Tobacco (BAT).
He also subscribed the references of BAT to public health in a sustainability report.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive resources from an e-smoking producer but not the financing that he had to receive before the Tabak company Philip Morris International was added.
The reasons for the selection of members of the group are not provided, but include several known e-smoking champions, some of which also indicate a sector financing in the paper.
Some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know-how in the Tabak Control.
The Commission also took part in the Tabak Leader of PHE.
The research work of the group "it is essentially", wrote McKee and Capewell, "hared evidence for most of the damages of the products to most criteria."
However, there is no discussion of these connections or restrictions in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's audiences were not evidence that e-smoking was a way to serve for children or non-smokers.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Women at PHE, said that BMJ's appeal has already been reacted before.
He said, "E-smoking is significantly less harmful than smoking."
Each second lifelong smoker dies at his search.
All evidence indicate that the health risks of e-smoking are low in comparison with this, but we continue to study the long-term impacts.
PHE has the clear obligation to inform publicity about what is evidence and not what, especially if there are so many public confusions on relative risks compared to tabak.
About 80,000 people die annually in a smoking disease, and smoking costs the national health system two billion Â£ per year.
The clear presentation of current evidence that e-smoking is not without risk, but only a brown of the damage caused by smoking is complied with our national responsibility.
BBC should leave EastEnders, said former head of channel 4
The former Chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson said that BBC should stop sending programs such as East Enders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals "are right arm" for Hit shows like Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the Rundfunk fee should only be used to make the type of programs not sent by other UK senders.
He criticized the BBC that it would be a public and legal program that probably be seen by a smaller public, to place hardly rounded windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and sentences such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director-General Tony Hall said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he tried to contact the BBC for six years in his time at channel 4 without success.
"I have had problems with the idea that BBC programmes are in charge or sent, which would also be clearly shown by non-subventioned rivals," said Johnson to the Supreme House Communication Committee in the context of his research on the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the round funding expenditure, what I did not think for a good idea or long-term, you should, at least, produce its production to programs that others do not or give it in order.
They send The Voice into a first classical age window because they want to achieve the most wide support for their future.
The idea that nobody else would show this is a wrath, it's crazy, it's naturally unbelieving.
Johnson said, "I don't see why a returning tax programmes could also be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is a such program, EastEnders is another, given both own productions.
Honestly, other canals would give their right arm for it.
I'm trying to see how this should be public and legal television.
I don't believe that this would actually reduce the BBC.
Johnson, a employee for series, which led to channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC debt to the jagd after evaluations is "for the ambitions of people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to ensure long-term support."
His comments on BBC's most popular sendings returned to what the former leader of Sky, Tony Ball, in his MacTaggart proposal in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that BBC shows should be sold as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the most public-weapon programs should go to BBC4 where you can't measure the public, but they meet their tasks, and they can argue when they go to their likely missions for justifying 4 billion Â£ round funding, "No, of course, we have created all these obscured programs that no one has seen".
They're putting them into a time window where no one wanted to see her.
Johnson said to the Committee: "I ask you to find a higher return system in terms of conditions who can receive the best value from this.
Of course, you all think we all think that you receive a great value for 150 Â£ per year, but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 Â£, ask me whether that is true because they don't consume much from the BBC.
The former Sky and Channel 5 Chief David Elstein, who also addressed before the committee on Tuesday, requested the BBC to review its reithian mission, "inform, form and maintain."
He said, only a few of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1% of its television production and 0.1% in the radio - and it should take an example to the public and legal advisers in Australia and Canada to "inform, clarify and maintain this."
On the question of partnerships, Elstein said that BBC should do more in areas than the proms that he said that only one handful is shown in the television, and income alliances with commercial senders to make it available online.
'soongenetics' can control brain lines
The video shows how the nemates change the direction in the moment where they are shifted with ring powders.
Scientists have smoothed herbs with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by browns of cows.
The changing nemathodes change the direction at the moment when they have high frequencies for human ears to be heard.
Impulse works by enableding motoneuron cells that are genetically modified to bring the membrane channels that react on Ultraschall wools.
More to this topic: Read and write hyperactivity with light
The researchers said that the wheels showed the power of a new procedure called sonogenetics, which can be used at the ultralace to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreecanth Chalasani, researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, said to the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep symptoms of the Parkinson disease is a invasive procedure that depends on the electric impulsion in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson disease.
In general, they did not react on Ultraschool, but Chalasani found that they did it when they were flowing from a liquidness with microscopic air palms.
The brown, he found out, strengthening the Ultraschool wools that then enter into the dark.
The increased ultra-scale waves affect the structures called TRP-4-ion cananels and are found in the membranes of some of the dark cells.
The waves affect the opening of these ion cannes and enable the cells they are assigned, so a report Nature Communications.
To create Ultraschall controlled nemathodes, Chalasani genetically changed the wheels so that some of its motoneurones TRP-4 ion canaries.
When it applys ultrascale to the changed creatures, the shoes will be strengthened through the microblooms and transferred to the wools where they enter the modified motonurones.
The procedure has some differences with optogenetics, a spectacular tool that allows scientists to keep up and switch neurons with lamp impulses.
But Chalasani said that Songenetics could have some benefits against this technology.
On the contrary to light, which must be sent to the desired place in the brain, weight-frequencies can pass unhindered tissue and can so be sent to the brain from above on the shadow.
"We believe that with genetherapy and therapeutic virus is possible to make human neurons immediately accidental for Ultraschall syndrome in clinical position for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin production cells, he added.

The statements of the British Arms Trade
Amnesty International Anti-Waffen Messen-Video.
Awesome murderdroms!
Footballs shocked infessels!
Striubomben!
And the electric chock crowd that causes soft pain, but don't leave scene!
The joyful voice and the carton images do not doubt that this show for the world's largest weapons measuring is a struggle parodie produced by Amnesty International in order to bring the availableness of the British government into the light of a repressive regime on the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree in the ExceeL Centre in London Docklands.
Variation: DSEI weapons-messe: Authory Regime Stripes to London
But a separate campaign also leads to many placeholders that are seen in bus buildings and in the U-Down trains and requires a second view.
"Avery advertising: move from 15 to 18 September with the DLR?" (Docklands Light Railway) is read in the fonts of London Underground and the marks of the DLR line that turns to the image of a panzer.
In September, a black of weapons drivers with the DLR... customers will be requested to help when stop the weapon.
The 300 places are by artists who have made their work at the Museum for Great Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A colleague named Special Patrol Group helped to distribute London and use "Ad Space Hack Packs", a 6 Â£ pack of inbus keys, which is observed that "to reach a third of the bus-holding surfaces on the planet."
Transport for London does not find this "Vandalism" place.

After Gavin Grindon, Kurtor of Crueol Designs and Dozent at the University of Essex, artists will be more critical and will try to bring political works to the public outside galleries.
Many artists make themselves active in protest movements to work and noted that they must be left outside the real world so that their art has an impact on society.
Another of the anti-weapon trade platforms is the pendlers in the U.
Amnesty-Video was viewed over 100,000 times in 24 hours by Facebook, and was found by the VCCP advertising agent who works together with the graphic and voceover artists, which also works freely.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was sweet about the styles that rose around the advertising for the weapons - through a empty place of the ExCeL calendars - and thought: "We give them the campaign that try to avoid them."
They played with the creation of a more realistic company, but "the involvement with lighter colors and animation remains stronger forced."
"They have done a fantastic job by helping us to make our consciousness about the sale of illegal torture equipment on the messe, says Tom Davies by Amnesty.
What we need now is an agree of the British Government and the guarantee that torture devices are not being treated illegally before our home door.
Maybe the most creative art around the weapon measuring goes out of the area within the excel, where an exhibitor fantastically destroys euphemistic products.
In a press communication, Saab reveals an employee of the US army on "the AT4CS RS shot by the slaughter."
This includes a "single-formed feed cap, which provides extraordinary effects of impact within the objective".

Eight golden rules for life in student homes
11 years ago, I moved as self-forgettable 19-year-olds in a home of students, still in faith in Berket and moral relations, but now I remember those whom I had poor - and to the many, long-term complaints about others.
The mostly I learned can be destillated in eight simple rules.
The income of students homes is sufficiently nervous to be absolutely shocked.
It's funny to join: tell people where you're coming, whether and where you've taken a Saturday year, where you're talking about Corbyn and why "really said Marmite does not love nor hate, because in reality, boys, it's just a hefe extractor HAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Have you been breathing.
And help others to do the same - set questions and show interest.
It lends the conversation and helps you to find the people you like in contrast to those with whom you wouldn't speak, even if your wimpers were in Brand and were these fire solvents.
Let people.
People's rooms are often transformed in drink receptions, film nights and communal countpoints, but they are also the places in which people are attracted and justified.
Regarding this: Don't think about starting at the Uni with a relationship
Introverted receiving a great treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refugee, but many student homes form a room-to-bum culture that is friendly and socially and can lead to long-term friendship.
This can be the hell for someone who tries to get back.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want to continue our friendship, but you have to go away so I can get the energy that I used for the interaction with you."
Try to feel when a combination of severeness is created - and send him a SMS instead.
Proposes: Do it.
A man in my student home had the idea that a not closed door was a invitation.
He saw some things.
A friendship closed by the back.
Since you start the Unio at the top of the Back Many, the clown is at the doors of people to present with a full brown, less rare than the joyfulness of the 1950-years, "Well in the neighborhood, I have backed you something. So now, please smile if I put you a few personal questions."
Provision of house-case leckeries is a good way to close friendships.
Your neighbors feel obliged to maintain themselves and may eventually be associated with a slight surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a qualified bag.
Bad missing skins from meal, sugar and sweet leading people to sleep when you slept.
To steal food, it's a delicate crime in student homes.
Of course, the clue of dogs is a shoe, but is it also the taking of a thick milk for your tea?
Check this with the milk steel.
The chances are good that they say to serve themselves even if they cook inside.
If someone smells your things, it's bad, and you have my compassion - but try to do more equitable than my cousin, who added to their milk, to punish meat.
She's in prison now.
You shouldn't make a laugh that stops people from sleeping or working.
It's not just to be a qualified person, but that you belong to the people who sit in the glass house in the real sense of the word.
One girl on my stream asked her neighbors whether it seemed to make something less to drum & Bass because it was three hours tomorrow, and she had a test at morning.
They reacted with a laugh music.
When she finally stopped at 5:00 p.m, she left her neighbors friendly sleeping two hours before she left her own music, closed her door and took place to her trial test.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future marriage partner would eventually enter the same student home?
Nevertheless, it would be desperately worse if you keep a cousin for your future mate, strike on them, divided up, and then they must see each day and may have survived how they are about all the common friends?
Of course, the heart goes on his own way - but if a warm partner is definitely not your future partner, try at least to make your sublife a little conviction.
In the moment you notice that someone has left his keys in his non-closed room, the borders between a ulk and a mobing, as it seems.
A good strike is sweet, but it's just waiting until he becomes a bumerang.
Give with hide a valuable and comfortable lesson about security - but never allow any room with dentist and shampoo.
Close her door, and put your keys into a glass water that you're then put into the fridge - but do not fix your property on the board more than two times.
Round houses for refugees, single-driven, assembly drivers
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner is built in the Mediterranean eckental houses for people who have no money.
So for refugees - but also as a signal: "Don't only refugees need a living room, but also the only mother learning and the minister."
"I tell you how you can still build a good and well-being today," says the 44-year-old boys in the interview.
Thousands of refugees will be declined on the accommodation market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how fast a living room can be created: he builds a series house for refugees.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will be cut on the apartment market.
What solution are you offering?
Markus Gildner: The massive undertaking in containers or tournhals does not have sustainability.
Because people remain a large part of this.
In view of the refugee stream, we also need sufficient residence in the next decades.
A total banal, three-shocked row house is the solution.
Gildner: A series house needs the least place.
It facilitates integration.
It's different if you're understood the people in a living pool.
Each of the six houses that are built just in the pilot project consists of three units for each four asylum applicants.
Each living unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say, it's again peace, I'm going back.
Then the houses can easily be converted according to the needs.
How high are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters living area per house is located at 184,000 euros, without basement.
That's overwhelming.
Six months have longed the building.
That's appropriate.
Have the construction rules complicated their plans?
Gildner: Built law I have done my project correctly.
Specially complicated it is always the threatening Damokless weight of special construction and the position regulation.
Gruselig.
It is still understood who created three apartments in a series house, needs at least three locations.
Only in the cities lack the place.
And refugees and asylum applicants have no cars.
How have the inhabitants responded to their series house project?
Gildner: There were those who have planned me to build luxus buildings for asylum applicants.
What's definitely not true.
But do you not raise the competition camp for payable apartments?
Gildner: Verily, we had a tree in Germany over the past five years, but we were built in the Luxus residences that couldn't spend one more.
My project has the message, even the normal people need a living room.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or manager.
I'm saying how you can still build a good and well today.
That's why it's okay.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and first employed with environmental analysis.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when published Apple updates
The new operating system can be requested by going to Settings app, tip "all" and then choose "Software Updates".
If it is ready, the phone will be the option to download and then install.
Some have been struck on problems following the installation, as they receive a error message that reports that the "software update has failed".
To address the problem, users are recommended to wait until the switch returns or try to update the iTunes.
The phone itself leads you through the rest of the process.
This may mean the removal of applications to create places - but Apple has made it unreasonable by disabled updates. Also it will be easier to do this when you use a special tool, remove apps and then install them again when the process is closed.
It is glad to ensure that your mobile phone is downloaded during the update or is located near a loading device, so that the battery is loaded.
If the load is too low, Apple does not allow the update to continue, since the phone may be disabled in half-way way and it could lead to a decline of the update.

Bad Kissinger Chach Club has a prominent member
The "Shachfriend Bad Kissingen" stipulated three months ago has included another member in his series, thus increased the number of members on 19 players.
The new member is the employee Paul Gauselmann, a passionated shock and tennis player, who took place over 40 times in Bad Kissingen.
Gauselmann is the leader of the Federal Service Cruz 1, class and honor citizens of the towns Espel Camp and Lebbeke.
The Chach Club in Bad Kissingen has supported Gauselmann with a spend, which took the President Alfred Klein.
In this way, there is a possibility to be players who cannot put the member's share.
Youth work and talent search should also be undertaken.
Gauselmann wishes that the membership in the chach club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Rot WeiÃ" will be seen as a expression of his association with the Kurstadt.
Fourth office searches for direct contacts
Saludis and the Old Centre Antonist have joined themselves in the manner of the Social Office and opened a new routine at the Graf-Stauffenberg plate.
In addition to discussions, you can also participate in courses.
The Social Institute is from the mountain in the city.
Just said to the Graf-Stauffenberg-platz.
There was recently opened a new Quarter office.
Here, directly next to the purchase market, receives immediately senior and requesting information on issues such as safeguarding or the benefits of the hospital and physicians.
For years, we have found our ambulance service that most of our families are often left alone.
There are infinitely many questions.
"But there are no rarly many performances of the casts, because the complexity of insurance is not yet understood", explained the new householder Jutta Weigand, responsible for the ancestor of older aid, the civil police and the ambulance service "Amadeus".
In addition to the negotiations, the new Quartet Office also offers prevention, health rates and Wellness.
The Saludis was taken into the boat.
Therefore, additional offers such as storm prevention, memoranduming or physiotherapeutic treatment can be used.
The offers of the senior centre and the Saludis are ideally complemented.
Saludis is for prevention, care and reha.
"The Senior Center for Training and Training", Heyke Riedel, head of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new Quarter of the city is to see both business leaders especially in the demographic change.
Because this makes a good decentral infrastructure in the individual parts of Bamberg in the future.
Furthermore, Mr Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) was understood in the events of invasion, and the Quartet Office also has the age's agreement: "They have many events and offers on the programme and are invited to a regular meeting."
In this way, the Social Foundation has a great contribution to the possibility of seniors to live in their own and reliable environment.
The Quarter office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 to 14 hours, service day and Thursday from 16 to 18 hours and afternoon from 10 to 12 hours.

Wiener Architect Karl Mang 92 years old
Karl Mang, one of the doctors of the Vienna Architecture, is dead.
He was already dead on September 5 in the age of 92, as the artist's house was shared on Tuesday.
With Mang, the artist's house loses a member of honor and "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was called in the exhibition.
1922, born in Vienna, Mang studied Mang during and after the Second World War Architecture at the Technical High School in Vienna at Friedrich Lehmann.
Since 1952 he worked as a free architect, but he was also as teachers, writers and institutional leaders.
From 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute for Training.
In the 80s he was employed with the establishment of the shadow chambers in the Vienna Hofburg and the reconstruction of the Palais Lobkowitz in the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Park punishment: Tim Wiese employs police with money
Ex-FuÃballer Tim Wiese is unexpectedly discovered in Bremen.
Footballers were once, medium-term, Tim Wiese, an ex-national tourner in Germany and at Bremen and Hoffenheim, wrestler.
30 kilograms of muscle mass he wants to have made his own speech in the past two years.
However, he has not established intellectually.
Wiese just shooted the hair in the Bremer City when he saw a park-walker a punishment store for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Wiese slaughtered out of the business, ruled the officer and slaughtered the cash punishment before the feet, as reported the "Image" statement.
In the city of Bremen, you are confirming the prosecutions, but it is not clear that the consequences for the uncommon incident are not yet clear.
"The matter is still in the test," says the city of Bremen.
First, it will be decided whether Wiese is shown, or not.

The Witnesses are looking for the police for an accident in Bad Soden Salmstein: On Friday, against 23.45 hours, three young men were walking by Bad Soden in direction to SalmÃ¼nsters.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghanistan, followed the police's two friends in a distance of approximately five feet and called them to wait for him.
At this time, the group was at the height of the bft channel.
There were also three people on the ground of the tank station.
One of these men now cry to the youth, and shouted this with the faust face.
The victim is offered by a nausea burning, and he blew strongly from the nase.
When his two friends came up and shocked to the shooter, he first left his sacrifice.
From his friends, the lost young man now came home.
The murder followed the group with a Pkw to their apartment and was demonstrated more times.
When you don't see the vehicle anymore, the lost went before the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was again attacked by the slaughter and another man.
Under the support of a shooting stomach, the face and the upper ring of the victim were tested.
The latter had to be taken in a hospital.
There is only a low description of death.
One of the men was about 1,80 m large.

Dr. Frank MÃ¼ller takes the practice of rock houses and investes 310000 euros
Silvia Muller-Gongoll and Frank MÃ¼ller (from left) take the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel rock houses.
Furthermore, Samt Communist Meister Bernd Bormann, economic promotion Uta Seim Schwartz and Asendorf Citizens Meeting Heinfried Kabbert.
In many places on the country, doctors - Asendorf have happiness: where Dr. Frank MÃ¼ller takes the practice of rock houses on October 1st.
While Ursel Felsenhauses goes in peace, her husband, Karl-Heinrich, is on the side of his followers in the next months.
After a rebuilding phase, MÃ¼ller reopens the practice on 12 October, until it investes 310000 euros in spaces at the St. Marcellus Strategy 6.
It was sympathy at the first time when Frank MÃ¼ller and his wife, Dr. Silvia Muller-Gongoll, were aware of their special training in the Green Headquarter of the Hospital House for the next year.
"We always had in the backhead that the mullers would be good in this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felsenhauses and laugh.
"If it was so long, I just called her."
The wife Muller was pleasing the idea to do his own practice in the future in Asendorf.
"The nearby and the constant contact with patients are very attractive for us", says the 39-year-old muller.
"We want to know and join the families over the years."
As a advantage, he also looks to be his own chief soon.
And so you were agreed that the mullers bought the house with the practice.
The living will still be in the Bruchhausen flights.
The two-fold family, Frank MÃ¼ller, has also grown, his medical study in Hannover in various medical practices, as well as in hospital hospitals in Sulingen, Niembourg and Rotenburg.
He is now an over-actor in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was appointed to the leading Notarzt in the circs deep deepness and is engaged in the DRK Reservation of Bruchhausen flights.
Since September 19, the practice is prepared for the new chief.
While the surgery Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehauses works as a home physician, his Gattin Ursel (Internist) specialized on the gastroenteriology.
The mullers, both internalists, want to be disfellowshipped as home doctors.
"The Endoscopie is therefore coming out," says the 38-year-old Silvia Muller-Gongoll.
After the rebuilding, the rooms will appear more modern.
We will offer more ultra-scale research and long-term ECGs and need more conversation rooms.
In addition, the EDV is completely renewed.
A total of EUR 50000 will be granted to the MÃ¼llers in the framework of a country crystal support programme (25000 euros) as well as by the Summit Community (12500 euros) and the Community (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and joy we are to continue the practice," emphasizes Samt-Communist Meeting Bernd Bormann.
About 2000 patients reported that Silvia Muller-Gongoll are about 500 of all the quarters in the practice of rock houses, in the northern German average practice.
In Asendorf, there is another home physician practice.
A positive side effect of practitioning by Frank MÃ¼ller: The Apotheke remains according to the Ursel Rockstehausen in Asendorf.
If no follower had found, she would have gone.
However, who visits Mullers' speech meetings, he also continues to look in confidence faces: overcome the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of the rock house.
With its adoption a time ends in Asendorf, the medicines have practiced there for 30 years.
"After we had only two rooms," the Ursel of Stylehouses recalls.
It's a little weakness, and it's been a long time.
"Whoever we live in high-mode, and many patients will still be sure," says the internalist.
Your husband laughs: "We have a 6000-quaratmeter board."
"I've always been pressed before the garden work, now it could be different."
Moreover, the couple has two corners and enjoys traveling.
Croatia: "We let the refugees through."
"Now the border controls will also be highlighted at our southern border," said Minister of Interior Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The controls at the Hungary border remain parallelly.
It is clear that everyone who wants to make an asylum could make this "self understanding".
The provision and safety of humans is in advance.
But it's also clear, "It needs a clear signal", said the Minister.
People have to know that we do not accept unlimited migration streams, not even through the Austrian-Slovenian borders.
It needs a controlled procedure.
Croatia intended "Corridor" - Refused Slovenia
The Kroatian Government had previously informed, and Slovenia also wants to continue towards Austria and Germany and also to create corruption for refugees.
But this is not the case of the Minister of Internal Affairs, Vesna, the Znidar of Znidar in Laibach.
Corridorn's idea is "absolutely inacceptable", Slovenia will increase the monitoring of the borders, especially to Hungary.
However, the borders with Croatia have been strongly controlled as an external limit of the Schengen space.
As the Minister emphasized, Sloveni will not repay its borders for refugees.
"All Members of the EU must comply with its obligations, otherwise they cannot function", emphasizes Znidar.
As the Croatian Government informed, the first refugees had already tried to travel in the Sunday in Eastern Croatia at the Tovarnik/Sid border in order to issue the registration.
The Kroatian police could attack her in the nearest mass fields.
According to local media, the Kroatian Tovarnik has always met police vehicles with new refugees.
It is predominantly addressed to Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Saving services and the Red Cross have already been used.
In the next days, his country was counting about 4000 refugees, said Minister of Internal Ranko Ostojic.
Furthermore, buses from Presevo would be carried out from the Macedonian-Serbia borders that were brought to the Hungarian borders, and reported the Croatian and Serbian media in the middle of the night.
However, the government in Belgrado claims that it is to show the people to strike certain routes: "We cannot, nor we want to do this," said it.
According to the media reports, in any spring a first bus with approximately 50 refugees in the Serbian border city, the day would be expected more bus.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The invasions were through the macedonic borders of about 500 km all night through Serbia.
"We have heard that Hungary was worthy, so the police told us that we should go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to continue to travel to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
In this way, it could now be possible for observers to make a little more western movement from the previous Balkan Red Balkans of Turkey and Greece, Macedonia, Hungary, and Hungary.
Croatia: "Extensive access to border control"
Kroatian Intern Minister Ostoic had previously emphasized that his country had prepared for the case of a strong stroke of refugees' plans for possible exceptional situations.
He did not call for details, but said that Croatia had "complete opportunities to control the border."
We are conducted strict controls to qualify themselves for the membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia is part of this since 2007, the EU partners have since then shown a good witness to the country in terms of border control standards.
On the side of Serbia, the Hungarian border chain continues to fix about 300 refugees.
According to Belgrader media reports, they would have carried out the winning night on the border crossing Horgos, which leads to RÃ¶szke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two cross-border Horgos and Backi Breg continues to be completely locked.
If the remaining refugees want to continue to the Croatian borders, it is still not clear.
The Serbian Interior Minister Neboojsa Stefanovic still tried to relaxe at a local appearance in Horgos: he held the debates on the alternatives of refugees after the Hungarian border is closed.
It would not be a very high number of refugees today.
You can't even say whether they would continue their travels on Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helps Rating Migrants to - dangerous - Alternative fees
However, private Hungary refugee helpers have already started to distribute refugee cards on which alternative routes are signed by Croatia.
However, the cross-border cross-border between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous: there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatia war, there are still unpleasant mining fields.
On Wednesday, the Croatian police announced that a team of mining spaces was sent to the border region.
BÃ¶rsen-Hacker: Ukrainian payments $30 million
Suparannok was to have heard to a ring of Cyber crimes that will be proposed to have been re-experiencing still in public financial reports and press communications on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire.
The information shown should be made to the financial markets by the insider.
In this way, the investigators were totally assembled over $100 million.
"The present comparison shows that even those outside our country are finally captured", says the SEC Communication.
The processes against 32 other accused persons were delayed in the case.
Most of the detainees were from Ukraine and Georgia.
The murders should have acted both in the United States and in Eastern Europe.
Ecumenic Hospis Help Manheim has been held for 20 years
Run around the man home parade place is a rich operation.
People make their concern, partly fast steps, partially slowly swimming.
They are controlling the two stations of the man home autosalon on the paradeplace.
Keep the city trains.
Polsiting, beautiful life in wonderful birth sun appearance and medium-term four large tables everywhere with the title "After I want to die."...
The Ecumenic Hospice aid took note of its 20-year-old existance and seems to be mixed with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went through the city and among the people," said Josefine Lammer.
The Chief of the Ecumenic Hospital Assistance also provides the passengers for questions and discussions as well as the honourable workers.
While sometimes a passenger spontanely strikes to the circle and the set for "Mean life", "lease," "will walk through the United States," "the war stop" or "no longer suffering", the other remains short, read, say, "as far I'm not still" and then go.
On the border, small discussions on action are being developed, about life, the relationship with the death.
Peter HÃ¼binger's just right there.
"But if I make clear that for me the end of this world I can live responsiblely", says the Director of the Diaconic work Home, which is together with the Caritas Association Force of Ecumenic Hospis.
It is therefore good for the 20-year-old public action.
That not everyone wants to share publicly on the tables, however, be comprehensive, finally, it is a very personal matter.
The issue of death and deaths has been arrested as before Tabus, so the experience of Josefine Lammer, although just in the past few years the hospis movement has contributed to the opening of the people.
An evaluation that Angelica shares Godefroid.
The death and tragic associator belongs to the official workers of the first hour.
Persistent experiences face the thematics, read a lot of literature and decided to join themselves in death aid.
When the Ecumenic Hospistics searched for honor officials by call, she was immediately informed and had been founded in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 Ehren officials - 43 women and two men - accompanied by the employees and families in private households, hospitals, homes and in the Hospiz Sankt Vincent.
They're all careful.
Angelica Godefroid can work well with its task and experiences and experiences.
"I see the life of another wait, keep it precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the ambulant Ecumenic Hospital Service is free and independence.
Financial support of hospitals and pensions from families and beverages allows training and training and supervisions of the mortal and tragic partners.
All two years of training will be offered for new employees.
The tables described on Saturday are now issued in the house of the evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the house of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
There can also be more personal desires on postcards.
Mixed FedEx result, calculated financial views for 2016
FedEx reports outstanding results for the last quarter, and the delivery Gigant reported its profit view over a whole year because of the weaker demand of shipping services and higher costs in its ground transport service.
The company also said she planned to spend about 55,000 season workers for the holiday.
FedEx announced at this time in the last year that the company wants to set up 50,000 season workers for the holiday time.
The share was over 2,5% in the Premarket Heandel 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said a win between $10.40 and $10.90 in the business year, which ends in May next, 20 cent less than at the previous preview.
Analysts expected to investigate FactSet $10.84.
The lower perspective is, despite price increases in average 4,9% and effectively on 4 January, and despite higher appropriations for land transport of serious and large packages that will be risen from November.
The company said, however, that the results of the previous year would be increased because of cost reduction, higher revenue, and due to the growth in the online percentage.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "soled income, if the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in production and global trade, is considered".
The plans for vacation jobs were announced a day later than the UPS Rival, which plants, 90,000 to 95,000 additional workforces, including the same number as in the last year.
In the Quartal, which ended on August 31, FedEx $692 million, 6% more than in the previous year.
The result of the share was $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share that predicted 12 of Zacks Investment Research analysts.
The expenditure increased by $5 per cent to $12.3 billion.
Six Zacks' analysts expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has decreased a decline in the international priority sending in the past few years that led the transfer into its Express sending to stagnator.
But the boom in the online storing has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the transfer of land transports increased to 29 per cent, but the operational result was basically due to higher costs for larger packaging and self-assurance.
The Express Unit marked higher income because of higher prices, while the result of higher employment costs in the frame business was increased.
In the premarket chain, about a hour before the opening, the FedEx shares are $3.85, or $2.5 percent, at $ 150.15.
On Thursday, she concluded with 11 per cent loss for the year and 17 per cent under a record hook on 11 June.
On her most expected meeting in the year, Federal Reserves Strategy two days this week sits around a 27-fois Honduras-Mahagoni-Tish to decide whether it is time for the first time to increase the leitzin for almost a decade.
At the end of the two-sixth meeting room, the United States is a changing image.
The map is a reminder that the Fed President Janet L. Yellen and its colleagues should put the economic interests of the country before all other things.
The Central Bank has a duplicate task from the Congress: the maximization of the US employment and the prices are stable here.
But since the great reception, the Fed leaders have recognized that there is a third mandate that is not written: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too close to predict it. It is known on Thursday if the United States is prepared to be decrease by the short-term interest rate that is close to zero since the end of 2008.
Although the majority of the economic data shows that they are stronger, the recent turbulences to the global financial markets could make the forecast representatives of Fed to strengthen this volatility by increasing the interest of federal loans - and it is only a fourth percentage point.
"Openly, the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing they observe", said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief-economist at the Macler Company Stiff Nicolaus & Co.
"I think that if they were looking for an inclination to not increase the interest rate, the increased insecurity around the global market is to continue to justify sufficiently, " she said.
There is no consensus on what the feed will do, which is insecure to the financial market itself.
Another half of the economists asked recently from Bloomberg have predicted an increase in the interest rate this week.
However, the financial markets expect a delay of the feed, with a key indicator, which shows only 30% opportunity to increase.
This decreases in a decline of the share market, if the Fed increases the rate, except that the strategies decline the slaughter by promised that a further increase is far away.
On Thursday, the Dow Jones' Industrial average was 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16.599.85.
The action was resolved by expectations that the Fed policy holds the set in this week, said John Lonski, Chief of Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed had the seats at this time," he said.
If they do it, "we must go in her statement very far to calm the financial markets so that they are not in panic."
Other experts argued that an increase in interest would be based on the financial markets because they would eliminate the insecurity of when the Fed was acting.
Another month ago the Fed seemed to have a good way to increase the rate of 0.25 percent points in this month, the first small step in a long-term strengthening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States.
Yellen had said in the spring and in the spring that in this year, despite the complaints of liberalians, it would be necessary for more economic progress to increase the rate.
Although the creation of jobs was slow in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid in this year.
The unemployment rate is nearly 5,1 % in the last month, which has been lower than seven years and near the level of the Fed as a full job.
Rating has shown signs of recovery.
While the inflation was continuously under the annual target of 2% of the Central Bank, the Fed representatives said that the main ground was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "supports higher interest rates and needs it because of the increase in the labour market", said Ian Shepherdson, Chiefconom at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets over the world were together the end of the last month after China had estimated its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average in May was more than 16% under its maximum, as investors feared that a delay of the Chinese economy would dry the global growth.
The market has been repeated in this month, while the Dow is now nearly 10% below the height of May.
For the Fed representatives, the market turbulences affect the complex calculation when to increase the interests.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks, they would be able to accompany them in this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Notebank.
Now he said that at least one month they will wait to get better effects into the griff.
" There is a lot of insecurity about what the impacts on the US will be, and there are almost no relevant data that describe the developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is no of the main concerns of the feed, therefore it should not be included in its decision-making.
But finally, the Fed Monetary Authority has become world's.
The impact of the Central Bank was enormous in recent years.
The only indication of the former leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "reverse" its monetary expansion, resolved confusions around the globe.
In a world where markets and people's economies are increasingly broken, the Fed representatives are expected to monitor developments not only in other places, but also advise with other central banks and experts to get better understanding for the global economy.
Its decision-making is "more art than science", said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for the ownership management of the Entertainment Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, noted this month, that "the Fed has a history of overactions on financial market movements that seem to be not linked to the economic basis data."
Lacker, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who is launched for a increased interest decisions in 1998/1999 as for example.
A financial crisis in Asia made the Fed to reduce its leaders up to 0.75 percent points in three meetings "in spite of limited recognisable effects on growth in the United States", said Lacker.
A year later, the Fed representatives retreated these distortions.
The Fed should take the first place for the financial stability only during a serious crisis such as the market summarized in 2008, said Adam S. Posen, wives member of the Committee for the Investigation of the Bank of England.
The most recent turbulences are not close to this level, said he.
"They certainly don't want to go into the situation in which she feared an increase in the interests because the markets are on the market", said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until this is changed, I don't think that it should predict the time.

For more refugees today in Germany.
Welcome to prepare a warm welcome, not without the commitment of more honourable helpers.

Brazilian pediatric society Rio Grande promotes food for healthy styles
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS is trying to declare shockingly how important food is during the season. It does this with the presentation of images of babys who are shocked to Brussels, which are shocked with shows of unsuccessful food.
Mother milk consists of a variety of proteins, feeds, vitability and carbon hydrocarbons that gives babys all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
As a result of additional energy demands, pregnancy and young mothers will increase their daily increased calories at about 500 calories per day.
However, new research results pointed out that a higher calorium increase is not the only diagnostic adjustment to mothers.
A present study under the leadership of Robert Waterland, Professor at Baylor University of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy feeding of pregnant women actually relates to the gene of her baby and protects it before the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, unsuccessful food of the child may affect the immune system negatively.
Exemptions for the new Bernire Sport Hall
The Commonwealth Council Bernried approved the construction application for the EUR 2.3 million tear sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The toilet should be more flashed for the solar position.
The plans for the long-reached tournale construction at Bernrijer Sports are forward to step: At the recent community meeting, the constructive request was simplified without large discussions.
Before, the body had, inter alia, decided on an application to an upbuilding legislative "exception" respectable "free" of the valid construction plan.
In the "exception" it was the authorisation for a special form on the roof building.
This will be designed to create a "stateway with non-method first and swimming state".
In the context of the planning, the use of the tent for solar installations is: "We have a wonderful large south together", said Master Josef Steigenberger in the meeting.
In the "free", it was re-education that should be under 10 degrees for energy reasons - otherwise prescribed in the construction plan.
The volume of the hall is significantly reduced.
A "free" was therefore necessary because the construction plan does not allow "exemptions" - by which the Common Council of Bernarers is more restricted in terms of exemption applications.
However, in Turnhallen construction, it is not a re-recurrenced project: "We do not create presentation incidents", says Steigenberger.
The construction of the tournhalls in the sport centre is a Community project of the Community and the SV Bernried.
A total of EUR 2,3 million are calculated in costs.
Subsidies are expected to be supported by the school and width sport.
In the next procedure, the construction application for the 18 x 36 meters of large hall is now submitted to the Country Council.
Clinic PÃ¤ngnberg stands to Schongau
The Hospital Pangnberg's Hospital is to be closed before planned - 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) is a new doctor in the hospital of Schongau.

This presents the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the countrycreen, confirmed by the Country Lady Andrea Jochner.

The rooms exist.
The employees who can't be able to go to Schongau will be offered in Weilheim, so Jochner-Weiss.
The employees were informed about the plans.
The changing has made the advertising of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has been the doctor of Schongauer Clinic since the beginning of the year and has now changed to a private practice in the immediate nearby of the hospital.
When the question who would be to follow the follow-up, Jochner's wisdom came, the name "Fischer" in the game that was ready to declare to take the leadership from 1 October and change with his team to Schongau.
For the house in Schongau, this was a "assessment" and a dissemination of the offer in the area of "Inner Medicin", so Jochner.
Fisher is a specialist for cardiacs and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) is specialized at the internal station on gastroenterological diseases.
For the next two years, fishermen and his team, when the Supervisory Council agreed, should conduct both houses, until the next year the former hospital house of the council, which has still more than 35 beds, be finally closed in PÃ¶pnberg for nearly 140 years.
The farmer had planned this for 2018 when the current sanction of the hospital was completed.
Landestin Jochner, who is also the Chairman of the Board of Oversight, has been able to be used as a accommodation accommodation for asylum users.
"I concluded." As it continues with the real estate, Jochner's law could not say it gives several discussions.
There is now a short time of the Caritas and a daily psychiatrie.
"What best couldn't happen to us, such an opportunity does not come again," so fishers are over the Quasi-out to the lake that was included by the employees "postitive and very comprehensive".
A real perspective for the house in which fishermen work as Chefarzt for over 30 years have not given it.
He was requested by Shongauer colleagues to take the posts of the Medical Director.
The Hospital Pangnberg (e.g., 100 beds) was always threatened by closing in the past decades, the departments were closed, for example, the surgery and the birth aid.

Comparison: This year, 260,000 units will be completed in Germany.
That misses 140,000 apartments.
Refugees are not obliged to live after the first three months of their stay than the asylum requesters.
Many then stood on the accommodation market and settled in the long skins before the accommodations.
According to statistics, however, in the past year less than half of all asylum applicants lived.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only the increased refugee numbers.
The study also produces significant disappearance in the housing policy in the last few years.
Germany has a housing deficit, which will increase from year to year.
Currently, there were about 770,000 living units in the Balement areas, Matthias Sonther, author of the study.
Many professionals, therefore, lived in large cities in WG rooms.
Young adults remained voluntary because of the fleet on the accommodation market for a long time in the "Mama Hotel".
In the major cities, the number of squaremeters per head should be first recovered in the last few years.
To solve the problem, the "social housing" council proposes a new start.
The new encouragement to the social housing is to be re-established.
In this way, it could be rejected on the basic business tax, and the basic tax for promoted housing is slowly expenditure.
Furthermore, it is necessary for attractive tax reimbursement opportunities.
The KfW State Bank's support programme is now good at towns and communities.
A good week after the start was called on Monday with EUR 184 million already more than half of the available EUR 300 million.
Now the project could even be cut off.
Refugees have free lifts: Croatia and Slovenia to Corridor
After Hungary, there is no income, since more refugees choose the way through Croatia.
Zagreb announces to deliver the distances through Slovenia to North without wardens.
It's dangerous, but it's the road.
Croatia wants to understand Slovenia about the establishment of a corredor for refugees.
"I talked to the Slovenian Inland Minister, and if necessary, we will organize a coridor", said the Croatian Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and already belongs to the Schengen Zone.
The EU-Croatian is not a Schengen country.
After the decrease of the Serbian-Unit borders, hundreds of refugees have been cut into Croatia to reach from there to Western Europe.
500 people came over the border at Tovarnik, reports the croatatic television RTL.
Hungary had cut his borders on Sunday.
In addition, new laws that are in force on the same day are practically overwhelming ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary.
Croatia wants to pass the refugees.
The Croatian Minister Zoran Milanovic declared: "You can travel, and we are preparing us to do this."
These people are there, there are women, children and men who want to live and reach something.
However, there were people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police had attacked the first refugees in the Serbia border to the nearby Croatian EU.
The majority of media reports were based on Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came both with the bus and with taxes to the Serbian border city Sid.
Only after their arrival, they would have tried to reach the green borders to Croatia.
In the Kroatian-Serbian borders, refugees did not attack border chambers.
For this, the border stretchs other dangers: there are still severe mines from the Yugoslavian citizen war in the 1990s.
Mine spacers must now create a safe path.
After Hungary, there is little more refugees after closing the borders.
On Thursday, the police counted 366 invasions.
Shortly before the tour on Monday, there was 9380.
The new Hungarian laws introduced the transfer and damage of the border chain as a crime.
In the South Arctic border city, Szeged has therefore been introduced 35 criminal procedures.
The judges threatened prisons up to five years and the departure from the country.
The immigration authorities reported that, on Thursday, the new "transit zones" established to the border was totaled in 94 asylums, almost all of which, in the main transition of RÃ¶szke, almost 93.
Among the requesters 13 families with small children and two older people.
Wednesday morning, 40 refugees were still stopped there.
However, practically no more has a view to obtain asylum in Hungary.
In Hungary, Serbia is a "safe third country".
The rejected asylum applicants should be deleted there.
Before the "Transit zone" in Romania, only few hundreds of refugees were gathered.
In RÃ¶szke, employees started to store this.
They gathered the mould left the ten thousands of people in the last few weeks on the road.
Sperrgitters were decreased and one of the acquiring camps was converted into the border.
For this purpose, no one wanted to express himself.
Austria has reached only few refugees after closing the borders between Serbia and Hungary.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
However, for the 200,000 immigrants, they were still in the country.
In Salzburg, about 1400 people were waiting for travel to Germany.
The movement from there to Germany was completed on Sunday at the instruction of German authorities.
In freelassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived in foot.
Citizens-master went on the borders
"We were employed after the bridge celebration on Sunday with the room, as soon as ten people with travel coffees at the start of the cemetery," says the citizensman of Wernstein Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to go to Passau.
Since Germany was surprised on Sunday, but because of the refugee stream, the train traffic with Austria was surprising, for them in Wernstein concluses," said Stadler, who immediately offered his help, and the streets, together with two other helpers and their cars over the borders in Nae Passau.
Before we had the unexpected guests once, with jause and drinks.
We just said we'll bring them to Pasau with the car.
"It was for us self-conscious," said the stadler in the OÃN conversation.
You were very grateful.
A man didn't take it to deliver a great skin - 100 euros for fire shooting.
"This has been very pleased to us," says the stadler.
On Sunday, the passengers were turned into a regional direction from a ICE towards Pasau to proclaiming it after the short-term period of time that rail movement was established to Germany, but still tried over the borders.
However, before the borders in Wernstein, the regional departure was entered.
In Wernstein, the cross-border border is generally high in the course.
The Bridge Festival linked to the Bayern neighbors on Sunday, the day before a double bridge sports - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bayern from New Church.
That Victor OrbÃ¡n now sends to us other thousands of cigs, is a logical result of a likely policy:
Instead of helping in the region of RÃ¶szke immediately in the establishment of structures to ensure humanity, our federal government has been officially and publicly imposed the position of the Hungary government in the dark crowd of nationalism.
The suffering of this policy is not only the Austrians who are now faced in the border areas with chaotic circumstances.
The refugees must also find that the "good country", which they invited and welcomed, is nothing as another refugee stock.
It will be a great challenge, given the continuing refugee streams and the near winter, to create human conditions for demanders for protection.
And there will be more - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Conrad on the search for 35.000 winter feasts
Konrad has to do all the hands with the refugee submission.
Christian Conrad is used to have his word weight.
The government has used the former powerful rail bank to establish quarters for thousands of refugees.
The Chaos in the first race centre of Traiskirchen has already been obtained in the griff.
"We have no objection anymore in Traiskirchen," he reported about his first success.
The submission of the 20,000 refugees who arrived to Austria on Monday has also been followed without a great clue, Konrad said and loving the organizational "Master Service".
However, the Ministry of Internal Affairs was a "crisisable situation".
Conrad totally calculated with a need of 85,000 quarters in this year.
In order to fill the number, the next weeks must be found more than 35,000 accommodations - 20,000 are required to provide the countries, 15,000 of the covenant.
If it becomes more refugees, we can make it.
"But it's no fass without ground," Konrad said.
He has already conducted a conversation with the head of the country.
They would have assigned him to create quarters for the coming refugees.
"In Obersterreich it works good", said Ferry Mayer.
The former VP Mandator supports Konrad.
Tomorrow it will be given a meeting with Kardinal Christoph SchÃ¶nborn, which will be explained how the Church will help.
The asylum coordinator also sets the ORF action "Help as we".
On the platform, private persons can offer incomplete accommodations.
Moreover, you are hoped of hotels that are empty in winter.
Konrad and Mayer criticized last night the standards for the sublime were "very high".
In urgencys it could not be necessary to maintain a certain height of the main content or size of the surface lights.
For a time period, "Notstandards" should be applied.
In contrast to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Conrad is based on his experience.
I am a older man who is not saying inconservence without any other face.
Convince power is his most important weapons.
Conrad and Mayer did not cause the Republic's costs, as they themselves declared.
They want to increase their number of employees to three to four.
The own quarter search has not been successful.
Konrad wanted to set a container on the Stephans place as a office.
There are, however, problems with approval.
Linz requires a better department
First, no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips-Arena and design Center for the sublime of refugees plants the city Linz.
This is not necessary when the interests are now able to be taken without these measures, Mr Klaus Luger (SP).
However, for the emergency, further positions should be examined on their ability.
The head of the city is critical to the department of refugees within the Federal State.
Other areas also need to contribute here.
Seahoror: "Greens are not ruled"
In a long term of phone with the Bairman Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), the country head of Josef PÃ¼hringer (VP) agreed the further action in the refugee question on Monday.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders are not displaced.
The continued travel of refugees to the Federal Republic is possible.
However, it is now the relevant border controls.
Special travels with refugees to Germany will first not give it.
However, protective demanders would be sent to Germany with regular trends.
The other Member States of the EU requested more solidarity in the refugee question.
What Austria is now re-controlled at its borders, is "a logical consequence" from the action of the Germans.
The next routine is a question of time
The generalization of the "new trade" in Linzer Industry Linzer is officially closed.
In four of the six Stockworks of the office and production building, the officially notified IT Concerns S&T, the rest (2700 quatermeters) is intended to be prevented to young, innovative enterprises from the technology area.
"In the IT the sweet heads are our raw material - and we need to try to work for us", says S&T Chief Hannes Niederhauser.
He can imagine investing in the new trade businesses of startup and then acquiring any.
Soon from the beginning you want to cooperate with the new neighbors - where the Niederhauser says: "The next runtastic is only a question of time".
1.7 million euros were invested in the location by S&T, 3.3 million euros from the Technical Centre, which belongs to a third of the city Linz, the country of South-East and the band (FFG).
The building has been paid from the Linz AG for 60 years to S&T and the techcenters.
30% of the 2700 square meters of the remaining area in the building have already been avoided, for more than 40% to ask it.
Lia-Peroni inhabitant opened the second business in the Arkade
In the new Shop, Fula-Handtaschen stands in the middle of the point.

"But I've been thinking if I should open a load, says Breit.
It was expressed to the decision that the Fula producers who were home in Bologna were the idea of a own location where only their handbags were sold.
"We are the only ones in the large space Linz that sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters, who owned Italian roots.
Your mode interest has received width from her mother in the way.
In most cases, I'm going to be developed and I can show new trends available prices.
Why some women have such a beautiful handtack in swimming, the expert woman can't answer with the last safety.
Maybe it's a beautiful taste of each outfit.
The bruilder of the city of Kall
The Pferds before Donald Trump came from a place where the inhabitants were called.
This property is also linked to the billion, who wants to be the President of the United States.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for the trainer.
Whether he expresses himself foreignly, the journalists urged or reveals knowledge in the international crisis policy - the applicant for the United States Chairman's Chairman is strongly engaged in the election campaign.
And smell it well.
This is also registered in the Palestinian Kallstadt where the majority of the real estate milliarder is recovered.
The New Yorker with the hot flight is a sense of many in the winter village on the winter Street.
Some in the 1200-resident part of the residence are over - twenty ecks with him.
His grandfather came from Kall City in Pfalz: Donald Trump, here in the fight mode.
The Kalltown Simone Wendel turned a movie over Trump.
And what do the villages think about his goal to become the most powerful man of the world?
"I think they find something quiet, but they're not too impressed in their fashion town," says Simone Wendel.
The city of Cold has turned a fascinated documentark over the place and its famous spouses, with which the Ketchup family also includes Heinz.
Trump, who is not known for awareness, comes in "Kings of Kall City" (2014) as well as in words - that he would be sure that he would also be successful if he would live in the city of Call.
He didn't bring it there to the king of the heart.
Although it respects the performance of the family, but also tenderly the view that Trump "is a little a big moul", says Wendel.
At the same time, the name of the sculpture has the city in the circle, "The brullsheet macher" - to high-depth: the employer, she says.
So Trump comes out of the village of the garbage.
The Trump's success history began in 1885, when the later grandfathers moved and opened a local for golden guests in the United States.
The basestein of the real estate center was the first seller in New York.
But the life of the grandfathers was not free of tragic: their desire to return to the home, struck in the Bayer State where the Pfalz was then belonging.
He didn't include Trump because he was first without approval, the director of the Institute for Palestinian History and Population, Roland Paul, had declared the film start.
Trump is the only one of the "illic migrants".
This is in contrast to the following marked words of the follow-up.
He had repeatedly spoken about mexican immigrants in the United States and requested the construction of a border march to decrease illegal immigrants.
"Come the poltert, it is not so sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a far-related trumpet ("The Oma was a birth Trump, the Opa was born Heinz").
The winter in peace looks more distanced to the Americans, "he is always so shocking."
Does he think that Trump comes again?
"I can't imagine that," said the 72-year-old boys.
"He never cares about the city of Kall."
The Pensionstustin Veronika Schramm mentioned as some Kilstadres, that a postcomme of the Heinz family at a visit was something to the church rule, which was generally good.
"I can't imagine from Donald," the 68-year-old boys says.
It's better if he doesn't win the choice, because "he has such radical views, I don't know whether it's good."
If those who had the sake at the time of his grandfathers in the United States would have been like he, "If he would never come there."
"There's more interesting topics than him," says Wintertower Sarah BÃ¼hler.
And as President?
"My President isn't right," she says.
And: "The traubs will also be reif without the President Trump."
Whondel's movie, which was interviewed for the trumpet long, has seen 12 000 kino-gangers, also expected the interest in the United States.
The upperbayer community Ramsau is the first "Reggerdorf".
From the hand of the Vice-President at the German Alpen Agreement, Ludwig Wucherfenig, the 1800-year-old officer in the National Park has received the appointment of Sanften Tourism at midnight.
In Austria there are already 20 "Burggencies"ers.
In the neighbouring country, the Alpen Agreement is responsible for the allocation.
A "Regger village" may have at least 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its surface must be identified as a protective area.

Lana Jebes-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snessana Markoski may have obviously obvious who wins the Bachelor.
The woman, who finally landed at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor, was in the biggest secret.

Sam Wood holds his lips to finale on Thursday
All three women have been lyriced about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense for humor, honor, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be their partners.
However, if the question is set, "If you don't have to get Woods' last Rose?", they could be their answers to the player, who wins the heart of the bachelor.
Jeremy Fellows and Markoski called both fast - except yourself - Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship since the first day.
"In the moment I went to the house and noted (Sarah) and Sam's energy, I felt that they were very compliant, and I thought it all over the show," said Jeez Fellows.
"Sarah is with two feet on the earth, it makes it so fun to be with her", added Markoski.
I saw her together and they've got the right chemistry.
They feel awesome and comfortable ones.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would have been good for a couple.
From her view, Mackay said that the house visit made her clear that Wood "The One" could be.
"When I saw him with my friends and the family, I was obviously clear that this is not just a game - I'm now unpreserved on him," she said.
And when she was asked, whose wood was to choose, if not her, she was awesome.
"I don't know if I can tell it," she said.
I love the remaining girls equally - it's an unfair difference between Snesana and Lana.
The Bachelor is extracted at midnight at 19:30 p.m. on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his transfer to the United States - and there were many other teams who sent questions after his impressed open training day end of the last year.
But Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and trainer Jim Tomsula and looked like a good decision.
Some trainers would have banned Hayne for the rest of the game on the bank when he lost a ring as it did the Aussie-Rugby Liga converging in his first bridge return on Tuesday 20-3 winning against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to return to a punt and also in the swimming game after a violation of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the upkleide cabin after the game.
Instead of chooking his smokes before the rest of the team through the mule, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also strengthened Hayne in his press conference after the game.
The 49 Sport reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by the Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey to forget his dismissed Fang and to care for the next game.
Jarryd Hayne is paved at a point that was rebuilt in the first playshop by the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the start of the Hayne and its massive Australian follow-up for its NFL debte.
Hayne left the game field and later told the Australian Duo Hamish & Andy Radio on 2DayFM 104.1 that he couldn't imagine no worse start in his NFL career,
"This was a thing that comes right now, you're only careful about the next game, and that's it," said Hayne.
Hayne compared the sniper with its original DebÃ¼t in 2007 when a passage in its own in-goal area was leading to a trial for Queensland.

"Bayers shoot, others don't."
"We need to be more dealable."
However, the country policy is not to fall under the table.

Under the pressure of the project critics and the FDP Group, which offers the investor and the secretary crowd, Ralf Berrends from the system-bau business leader in the open: "We have no answer to all questions," he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it's good to meet all the money now.
The ten-two million euro projects are from the debate for months.
Incredibly reactions among merchants who were attended at the meeting are called the pictures and new details on the desired hotel construction.
Roberto Schulz, ocean owner and member of the headquarters' interest in the shareholder, Pro Hieve, complains: "This will be a strike contracting all other buildings."
In addition, he fears as some other project critics that the transport would be strongly increased by the slightly dimension of the installation: "It must be all busloads so that it is calculated", says education.
However, what happens exactly on the good is a hectare of the former guest station, is still open.
There's no employee yet.
"Before we have to present a strict concept," said Ralf Berrends.
Because this was lacking, the construction plans are still variable.
Shillings near Gorillas in Frankfurter Zoo
The Frankfurter Zoo is pleased with his Gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian has brought slills to the world last night.
The skills are rare at Gorillas.
The last in a German Zoo is almost 50 years back and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, namely Zoo.

NHC says 60% opportunities for cyclon south of the Cape Town Islands
The United States Hurricane National Center said a wide pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the Southern Cape Tower Islands, which has a 60 per cent opportunity to develop a tropical tour in the next 48 hours.
Another significantly defined deep pressure system in the middle between the Capverd Islands and the small antilles also has a 60% potential to build a tropical weather tour in the next two days, accompanied the weather experts stationed in Miami.
Google starts double-up campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced a duplication-supporting campaign that was intended to bring $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have run the European Nations, because they are struggling and flying from war.
Google has an insufficient personal approach to announcing the spending call on his blog.
Instead of allowing an advertising to make a manager, Rita Masoud, a Google employee fly with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old, wrote about their personal experiences.
"Their journeys belonged to many dark trains and buses, both hungry, dust, smell and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But since the crisis of refugee and migration has grown in Europe, many people like my family are doubtless of help.
The costs are available to four common organizations that provide assistance for refugees and migrants: doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first global collected costs will be doubled to a value of 5,5 million on google.com/refugeelief to $11 million.
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, widely caused by the four-year-old civil war in Syria, which has passed over 4 million people this year.
Many refugees also from Afghan, Jemen, Iraq and Libya, destroyed by the war.
Report of Yasmeen Abutaleb; processing by Christian Plumb
For easy overwhelming diabetes, weight loss may be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for easy overwhelming persons with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years after a new study.
It is still too early to tell whether overwhelming people with diabetes after weight loss of weight live longer than those who receive non-chirurgy treatment.
"Death data needs a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a expert of weight loss surgery, who wrote a lectile to the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations or adiposite cyrurgy, use different methods to reduce the size of the magens.
They reduce hungers and limit the physical ability to include food.
Over the years, Adiposity operations have proved effectively, but most studies have been conducted in people who are sickly fettleby with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain measure of weight regarding size, shall apply as normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overwhelming, and people with a BMI more than 30 are more than fettleby.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwans Min-Sheng General Hospital data collected in a study since 2007 and compared two types of Adiposita-Chirurgia - Magenbypass and Magen-TV - to medical treatments for type-2 diabetes in people who were easily overwhelming.
The average BMI undertaken by this operation is nearly 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in this study.
However, IMO remained at those who received non-chirurgic diabetes treatments at about 29.
The diabetes disease was completely resolved by 36% of those who were under the surgical invasion and by 28%.
In the medical-related group, in comparison with diabetes, only one percent was solved by the diabetes and, partly, only two percent.
Furthermore, the results of the control of blood pressure, triglyceride and LDL-Cholesterins were better in general in the 'chirurgy' group, found the authors.
The researchers also observed the patients' blue level of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar values during the time.
Hemoglobin A1c is mainly maintained under 7%, write the researchers.
After the operation, the average hemoglobin A1c level of around 9% was around 6%.
However, in the medical therapy group, it remained stabil at about 8 per cent.
But this better "glyquemic control" - as you reflect in the improved hemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, so the leading researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compares the average results of the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the Bypass Cyrurgy Group had lost more weight in comparison with the Gastrectomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), the increased decline in BMI (7.4 against 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1 % vs. 2,1 %) and recorded mostly a complete transmission of diabetes (46.9 % vs. 16.7%).
While the new study does not show survival benefits of the surgery after five years, there are indications from a study of more serious people in Sweden that the operation leads to a longer life, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona, University of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, there were fettleibians who undermined an adiposite operation, about 29 percent less likely to die during 15 years of age - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not demonstrate advantages for survival at the surgery patients, Blackstone said that it is calm for people with a MMI under 35 interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study, because she says that this operation in this lower BMI group is lower," she said, without increased risk of death or renal disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start to take serious weight when the patient was with its BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long until we bring people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that when they have collected these genetic changes that have set their body with fat and diabetes, it is really difficult to change."
Love history plays in the pool
It is a theme that is now confused in Belletristik: A young woman, in schooltimes, is unpleasant and unpleasant, returns the blackness of her youth after years, and it is loved in her.
As well as in recently appeared Roman "We are not so" by Luisa Binder.
In addition to the love stories, the Roman should be especially interesting for Hunspresser readers, because he plays in the long-term and the surrounding regions.

"It's impossible that everyone come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe could not take all refugees, said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East was the real solution.
The Tibeth-Buddhist leader called for the end of violence in the homelands of refugees.
The Dalai Lama said the problem of the sustained refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visits in the United Kingdom in his speech, following the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is ethic studies.
It requested that the interests of humanity should be made under the circumstances given to the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis, but the situation is not appropriate.
"It's impossible that everyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama and Austria's efforts were glorified in addressing the crisis, he stressed that it was just a timely solution.
"Set to care for several thousands of refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you have to think about long-term solutions, such as peace and real development, mainly through education, can be created for these Muslim countries."
Finally, we must consider how the murder is reduced in their countries.
We must reduce the use of violence.
"The application of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama said the problem of violence and also commented George Bush's acts after the terrorism attack of September 11th, and pointed out that the violent reaction of the United States was a chain of uncontrolled events.
After 11 September, I expressed my relief in a letter to President Bush, and I said to him that the way to solve this problem is in violence.
"I know his reasons were good, but he put violence, and it called unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Four times increased in receipt of handdedetect infections by children in the past 4 years
In the United States, we report about a nearly 400% increase in the number of children under eight years of alcoholic defects, so Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of Georgia Poison Center, the cases of receipt of hand-de-infections in children under 12 years of age reported the gift control centres from 3.266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
"Kinds are always more frequent to these products, and unfortunately, a percentage of them goes to the emergency record," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children drink desinfects from the way, while some do it to impress their friends or because of a brave test in social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young desinfects can only drink because of a valuable experience.
Young people have used to mix desinfects with alcoholic water to get a worse drink.
Young children can be closed by attractive tyres of desinfects.
"A child doesn't think that's bad for it," said Lopez.
Many of the most attractive (Hand-deinfects) are those who are completed.
There are desinfects with earthquake, vineyards and persons who are very approximative for children.
Handdededetects contain some between 45 and 95% of alcohol.
Especially in smaller children, few switchers can lead to alcohol verglation.
"It's the highest concentrationd alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the guest call center in the hospital house of Kansas University, Sender Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn't let the whisky shut up, but people let this hand-deinfect drug in the range of children, and when children come from it, then it's a fast possibility to consume much of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four splits from the earthquake infringements in the school, was taken into a notice.
Your blood coal concentration was 179, two times higher than the weight that applies legally to adults, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an insurance art which treated her in the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah laid her words and was not able to go when she came to the emergence.
The doctors watched them overnight in a separate child hospital at the signs of the Hirn-Tspacea, as the girl was fallen by the alcohol and shooted the head, said Ritchey.
"These was very shocking," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijahs mother, CNN.
It could be dead for my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use alcohol free products or desinfects and low hand-defects outside the root of the child.
Additionally, some desinfects were associated with death accidents.
In 2013, two women died in Ontario after the shock of hand-de-de-infected drugs that received a toxic, undeclared addiction.
Employees of health authorities suggested that the product of methanol was obtained, a mortal solution instead of Ethilal coal, which was noted as an active substance.
In January, three students of the fourth class in the state of New York planned to settle their "general" teacher by expressing antibacterial products around the education room", reports a police report.
The teacher is very grateful towards handdedetect infections and slaughtered it out of their room.
The police considered the plan referred to as "consciousness" and disciplinary measures to the school authorities.
Villing shoes: three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old car driver has been easily damaged in the quarter pool between Northring and Herdene.
A 60-year-old shipping car passed on the quaspons in direction of the environmental transportation area, and has been able to be late that two premature vehicles were maintained in the circle.
In the course, he called with his car in the heck of a audio and shooted this vehicle on a ford fiesta that was before.
The inconsistent vehicles were shocked by some 10 000 euros, and the police shares.
The audie of 33-year-olds was no longer prepared and had to be shooted.

Griffiths plays talking about Disharmony
There are disharmonia in Celetic Glasgow, which has been denied spontaneously by Griffiths. This was found that he and his maiden cameras are not under increased control, since they are prepared for the confrontation with the Dutch table leader.
I don't think we feel at pressure, I think that the players are pleased to it.
The lack of title competition in the Scotia football longs the Netherlands - the Boer
The former Ranger-football players and previous national players of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer said that the Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celetic, since there is no title reliability with the rangers.
The Boer, who is currently a messager for Ajax, said, "In Holland they do not show highlights of the Celltic games anymore and why?"
It's because the rangers aren't there.
People are not only talking about the back of the rangers.
They're talking about the old company.
They're talking about both teams together and that's what they're interesting.
There's a lot of shocking in the old film games, and there are not only people in Scotia who want to see these games.
I'll turn back the things, Deila.
RONNY Deila accepted that the Celtic must fight, but the Norwegian chief weird to turn the things around.
Following the distortion against MalmÃ¶ and the following distinction from the Champions League, the shooting against 10-mans from Aberdeen, which now stands clearly on the sight of the table.
But Deila said, "Celtic had already had bad times, and we'll be back."
Now we want to get out soon as soon as possible.
I know, it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or worried about what happens.
We feel that exactly, but we need to continue.
We really need the support of Celtic, because that makes the player better.
It's so important to get together now.
Warburton carefully at January-Transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, which pointed out that he asked a few January-Transfers, Ranger-Boss Mark Warburton is carefully signed in the signing of new arrivals and warned that he did not want to defeat the unit of the Ibrox cards.
The former head of Brentford said, "The January-Transfer window is very different from the summer window."
The players that arrive in the summer have this precesion time to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season.
It's really good.
Sometimes more damages are created by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.

Griffiths are slow to avoid tinecastle
The unforeseen Hive was authorized after he joined a song with angry texts on ex-heart player Rudi Skacels.
The incident was held in a snake in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before a Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a Derby, and it was the sweet of the moment," said the shock and added, "It's sure to say that I don't look back to Tynecastles if it doesn't play for Celetic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee-United Management
Simon Donnelly warns that the province of Duncan United has yet confidence in the management team to turn things back - but it means that the breakdown must end on the game field.
I think Stephen Thompson's trust in us.
We'll get the kids back to the trabe," Donnelly said.
McInnes is pleased to win the Hamilton.
Derek McInnes shows that his manity of Aberdeen was doubtless to fight Hamilton Accies to see a seventh matching liga, which introduced them a front of five points before Celetic on the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooneys the first half-time.
McInnes said, "There is no manage that wins everything, in pokal games or lingers that have not ever won games of this kind."
Labour unemployment in Scotia remains unchanged while it increases in the whole United Kingdom.
The unemployment in Scotia remained unchanged in May to July at 164.000, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom was totally 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
Skotland's unemployment rate of 5,9% was over the UK of 5,5%, as shown by the National Statistics Office.
In the interim period, employment in Scotland was at 12000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2.612.000.
In the course of the quarter, the employment rate for Skotland was 74.0% - a number over the UK average of 73.5%.
The State Secretary for Scotland David Mundell commented the latest numbers and said: "The long-term government plan has set the basic stone for a greater economy."
It is almost one year that Skotland has taken the historical decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.

Why I will be a witness of execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except at a late legal intervention, I will see how a man is taken to death.
If it happens, and I hope that it doesn't happen, I'll sit in an overview gallery in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, when Richard Glossip is executed by the ghost spots.
He asked me to be one of the four official Witnesses at his death.
The invitation has already been the first time in January about his best friend, and even though I was shocked, I was right.
When the day was closer, I began to fear me.
So why should I do it?
I was right because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists can see in the U.S. offices and often more applications are available than places, there is a mass lottery place in order to decide who is chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen, it will be observed without emotiveness.
I can't.
I will sit next to Richard Glossips with a close friend with whom I developed my own relationship during the months with telephone attacks and a two-hour visit.
I like the guy.
We're laughing many times when we talk.
The prison officials say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a Stift to write what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist of Oklahoma accused me on Twitter to abandon my unpartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prison, how he wants, and you get access.
I'm worthy of her.
She emphasized that she "he could make better formulation", but she still thinks that it's wrong what I do.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and written.
He doesn't tell me what I have to write, and I would not do it even if he would do it.
I told him that he can remove me from his list of Witnesses every time.
But he wants a international reporter to write there.
When he dies, he thinks that the public work of movement against death penalty will help.
Kim Bellware, a reporter of Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of Podcasts I've done.
I don't want to go back to all details.
I can't say with safe that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His acts after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty to be a beneficiary of the fact.
But I think there is a strong probability that he's not guilty of the murder.
I believe there is no sufficient evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his instruction is wrong.
And from this perspective I'll see him to die.
I can't claim to be really objective.
It will give other reporters to which you can apply.
What you're gonna get from me is what it means to see a man died unnecessary.
Man after the fired police persecution year to come from the Canning River
The Canning Vale Police was shocked when he killed the man from the Canning River.
A man from Perth, who tried to defeat the police, was followed when he found himself in the swimming and summoned water, just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to "to overlook him to go back to the ice."
The police of Canning Vale was called to a home-friendly breakfast in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they found the suspect, they tried to get out of them in the direction of the Canning River.
But he didn't come too far.
"He stood in the water- and said, 'I'm not coming out, come and get me,' said senior sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too encouraged to make his unit, so he went to a more reliable tactic - "A good police negotiates".
" Sometimes people do a favorite thing to try to get away," said senior sergeant Castledine.
Majesty Flower Ben Cousins offers an uncommon example.
In 2006, Cousins entered his car in the grain to run a alcohol control and then tried to swim through the Swan River.
His efforts were followed, but inspired inhabitantly to the humored planning of a Ben Cousins-Biathlon.
Peter Moody states that Stewards tried to spontaneize him and threaten to end the rent sport
Peter Moody states that Stewards tried to install a spion in his surfaces last year and threatened to stop the rain immediately.
He aimed at the Stewards and the integrity Department of Racing Victoria and pointed out that she had conducted a personal campaign against him with the late Scratching of Lady Tatai because of a rentages treatment, the last strohhalm on midday.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for the rear sport and he himself considered himself in difficult conditions when it went on the positive Kobalt tupper test at Lidaris that he could not explain.
He had been left for 18 months because of the shooting front and didn't want it to "be like too highlighting traubs".
"I had planned to say nothing about it, and I've seen a long time on it, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out again," said Moody.
You know that it's continued.
Sometimes you're reacting, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I would like to spend on the higher head, and I want to want my owners to think I'm looking for my best for them.
If they start thinking, I don't do that, I shouldn't be a trainer anymore.
I have to figure out what I'm doing with my license.
Moody had previously enabled the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the integration department had tried to sponsor its steel.
"For eight months Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart are in a room with a man - I will be named when I was asked - and offered him a job in my surfaces to provide information about what I do in my area," said Moody on Racing.com.
You're obviously thinking I'm a busy.
If this is the case, they should certainly cut up their nests because they tried to take me.
Robert Roulston, eye-president of the RVL, David Moodie, director of RVL and Bernard Saundry, the current CEO of the RVL, were conscious of it at the time and are still today.
Should this make me think it will be personal?
Have the RVL been firm and maybe people are responsible for what in the sector is doing?
I'm bad for the industry?
Are I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people think that I'm out there.
Maybe they're gonna have to take my license and hide me, and I don't have any doubt that what I'm saying, they're gonna think about it now.
But I'm coming at the point where this is wrong, and this makes me awesome.
That's really awesome.
I will exercise the pressure on them and strive to take a decision.
I have the support of my family, and I can go.
The scratching level of the trainer was built with the long-term Kobalt interview at Lidari, and the late scratching led him to say that he could "shoot his license over the table."
Moody, the best known by his preparation of the unclean Black Caviar, called the Rendays Training Rule "speakly", after a packaging or sound was cut on the horses, which was made against the rules.
"It is against the rules of the rensport.
I have to take the full responsibility for it," he said.
"Another of my employee has uncomfortablely put the skin on the skin.
It could be like that yesterday night.
It could be like the whole day last night, what was it.
But it was like that at the breakfast.
Moody could be compared with a three-month disqualifiation for the packing of the reception day. A study of this matter was opened.
It's a wrath.
People who set these rules know nothing about the horse.
"We all see that we need rules, but here you've been too far," said Moody.
Man after driver flight arrested
The police was arrested by a man after a rail driver and then driver flight in Cobram on weekends.
The rail driver was sent to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was taken by a car on the Murray Valley's Autobahn on Saturday morning.
The police said that the driver went on without stop to help the last driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia was the police in Shepparton.
It is presumed that it is accused of driving and delayed assistance and of other transport crimes.
The rad driver, a 40-year-old man from Cobram remains in the hospital, is located in a stable state.
Melbourne-Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy suggests to rivals because of arrests against ring fighters
Melbourne-Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy has called the "Agenda-Setting" of two First League Favorites of NRL.
Sydney Roosters Trainer Trent Robinson said that the Scheedshers have allowed the Storm players "Ring fighters" with his team during the high storm seat in the qualification final in Sydney on Friday.
Brisbane Broncos Wayne Bennett made an uncomfortable note to the Storm Team after his manship the final sege against North Queensland Cowboys at the afternoon. He called the game a "model game" of Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland would not be "be good" in the ring.
Bellamy defended the tack limit of his manity and said she was only concentrated on her "contact".
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading trainers agreed to him at his masterity, as it stated that they were worried to be shocked by the Storm team.
"This always looks out again - I haven't heard that Trent Robinson talked about ring fights when they shooted us 242," said Bellamy on midnight.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything to our defensive system or technology throughout the year, but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tackles to a real point, and that has produced the trend for us.
Trent is now there for three years, and obviously he has a great manner to train. So he is probably not wanting to lose it, so it was a little shock for him.
It's funny how this happens again to this year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of the "smiling football" and reminds his mentor that Bennett St George Illawarra Dragons wins the First League in 2010 with "language" football.
Wayne's talking about smiling football.
He compared his game at the afternoon with our freeday and how exciting it was her game," said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010 St. George was criticized as a long-term team, and Wayne said that he would take care of this.
But now he has a team that can play and that we look slowly, especially his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play when you have this type of players.
He did this speech in 2010, now he wants to play all his types of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like these.
I'm creating stronger confidence because they say these things because they're a little worried to play against us.
6 weeks ago, they didn't think about us when it went about the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game storm against Roosters had a higher result than the game Broncos against Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I have not seen it yet, but what was the result? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two further trials in our game, but is that a great game?
Or are the pauses made and no points of shocking?
It's the game plans for me.
If they're thinking of us, it means that we're still going to meet them in a stage.
The Storm team has freed this weekend, since they have the right to win, or North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronule Sharks on the next afternoon in the AAMI Park. The ticket sale starts from the next service morning.
Serbian with $200,000 kitchen by drug accused
A man who might threaten a long-term punishment because of his trial to come in the ownership of 40 kg of cocaine that was shocked after Queensland has been released against a cup of $200,000.
Marko Maximvid, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Policei found the Drug on the Yacht Solay, which came from South America over Vanuatu and engaged in Coomera in August.
Maximvid was observed how he found his mixed complaints during the Sunday and later at Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found the Drugs in a Toyota Echo.
Despite the possibility of a long-term punishment to have a commercial quantity of cocaine, the lawyer of Macmosvic argued that it was not evidence that he tried to have the whole amount and that in the coffee could have been a harmful reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the flight travel at Maximvich.
He has clear relationships with Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often," he explained the court on midnight.
In the crime case, he lied the police about his residence.
Massimovicâs mother and Stieffathers offered a cost of $200,000 as a security together to achieve its release.
"After reading of the disadvantaged statements of the two people, it is clear that the establishment of a security of $200,000 represents a real financial burden," said the judge Flanagan.
But this is not enough to stop it, not appearing, he warned.

Stevan Hogg's phone used to spend paedophile to ship images
A paedophililer used the phone for a 11-year-old girl to request images of child malnutrition.
Stevan Hogg took the phone of the girl when he was sleeping in a online messenger service, from which he received a number of unexpected images from children sent to him by another user.
The girl waited later and found that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping hogg.
She saw it, found the confused messages and alarmed her mother immediately.
The police careed about it and saw the five images, then analyzed the computers found under the address and discovered "interesting" web research, using the definitions for searching for inadequate images of children.
Hogg then said to the officials that he did it because it would lead to "padophile on the Internet" and then he "predicted to be a policeman to fear it".
Mr. Eilidh Robertson said to the Dummy Sheriff Court: "He said it would be a search - he's sweet to fear people.
He told him that the search was carried out on the computer, but he said that it happened because he wanted to be a policeman to fear paedophile.
He was asked after his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos.
He said he did it to shoot them.
He said he was sick in the head when he drinks, and he said he wanted to see pictures of murder and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "If the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was on the sitter and the wine.
She also saw the inconsistent pictures on the phone and faced the accused.
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused computer and play station used to talk to the girls who were younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared in the sense of the appeal to have taken images of children on the 14 June last year, to disfellowship the stocks of this year and not to be a hearing before the court on 24 March of this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to appear in the Register of Sexual Criminal Criminal, since it could be argued that "no significant sexual elements" are found in his conduct.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael was sentenced until October to receive background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted in this case, but because of hearing to other cases that still exist, it was held in investigation.
It was included in the register of sexual criminals before the date of the judgment.

Meteorologs warn before storr bombs in the southwest of midnight.
The German Water Service (DWD) was shared in Stuttgart, because of a deep pressure area over Western Europe.
The strong depth is the exploder of the Tropen Tower "Henry", which was taken over the Atlantics in the past days from the Bermuda Islands.

The mass makes it: Every two years the autobuilders show their news on the IAA.
2015 is mainly to generate the movement in the compact cars that are currently specially sell.
Cars from the compact class are currently particularly asked: round 28.1% of the new permits are disrupted according to the motor vehicle unit (KBA) alone in August.
This is also reflected on the IAA (Publicity Day 17 to 27 September).
Among all future design vehicles and new super-class and luxury cars are presented in this year in particular many new compact models.
One of the greatest premiums for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be at the beginning of the handlers.
"The Astra is a very important model for us," said Opel Chief Karl-Thomas Newmann on the messe.
He belongs to the brand nuclear.
In order to sell the volume model also well, the new Astra should not be slower for it.
Opel makes an increase under the largest competitive Golf VW, which starts at 17,650 euros.
The current Astra costs 16 990 euros.
The Astra has a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW/100 PS.
Furthermore, the hessen offers additional cellal and benzin motors of 70 kW/95 PS to 147 kW/200 PS, which also contain three-cylinder benzines.
Unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is first just five-towers.
As a second variant, it will be followed in the early year of the combi, which has already been seen on the IAA.
And what will happen next to Astra on the IAA to new compacts?
Renault Megane: Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra concourant megane to the rent.
On the messe, the Megan is only seen as fifth towers in a conventional and emphasising sportive GT version.
In the trade, he comes to the beginning of the next year, then as Combi.
Infiniti: Full new in the segment is the Infiniti Q30.
The Nissan award wants to find his position in the strong growing segment with the new model.
The compact Infiniti is fully entered into the design line of the brand.
The basedell will receive a benzin engine with a performance of at least 90 kW/122 PS.
However, there is also a slight with 80 kW/109 PS or 125 kW/170 PS.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, who celebrates his world prize in Frankfurt.
The model is designed with benzin engines, including a new 1.0 liter turboat engine and a performance of 82 kW/111 PS.
The maximum driving moment is based on manufacturing instructions at 170 Newton (Nm).
Sell start of the Baleno in Europe is in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not totally new but renewed, but the compact class model DS 4 which is to see on the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the educated cytroen citrus mainly at the front party were made up: Here the cowlergrill was resigned again and the changed swimming shoes was equipped with LED technology.
In the internal space, especially the information system was modernized, reduced the number of heads by a tuberculosis screen and integrated Apples CarPlay first.
In addition to the IAA in the compact class, a series of revisions and new variables such as Mercedes A class or Peugeot 308 GTI.
JVA Berlin tab: Fifth squaremeter cells are inhuman
The Federal Constitution Court had given the right to a former prisoner of the Judiciary of Tagel, which was carried out in a too small cell for months.
Because of the infringement of their human affairs, prisoners have basically a right to financial deterioration when they have been brought into too small cells.
This has decided to the Federal Constitution Court in a decision published on midday.
The interested persons may even be hoped of money if only a few days were discarded in the closed spaces (see 1 BvR 1127/14).
In this way, a former prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe succeeded: he was undertaken in the Berlin judiciary hall between June and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square meters of the ground; the toilet was not spacely disappeared.
Then the man who, according to the information of his lawyer, was re-freely in a larger cell again.
His official detention was declared against the country of Berlin because of the unfair detention conditions.
However, the Constitutional Directors highlighted the judgment of the Chamber Court of Berlin, and returned the case to the renewed test.
You see the human being of the man.
Cammergericht now decides on the height of deterioration
Even if, for legal reasons of the questionnaire period, only a few days of prison for the deprivation, it is a compensation duty, said it.
On the other hand, "to fear a salesman of personality's legal protection".
The chamber court must now clarify the amount of money damage.
The Constitutional Directors have already strengthened the rights of criminal prisoners in the past.
Thus, in April, they first spoke to a detention rate, because he was locked into a cell.
Inhumanity is also a decision of 2011 the multispecialisation of a cell without separate toilet.
Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitution Court on the midday afternoon that a prisoner in a parallel accident in November 2009 had been an unreasonable income.
The then claimer was carried out over three months daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the case of Karlsruer.
In the last few weeks, the Berlin prisons have also been in charge of lack of staff.
The prisoners are therefore always being enrolled again 23 hours, the aggressiveness, even for slaughterers, must have already been found because of the shocked situation.
After the court press office, 21 places are not placed in the tent because of illnesses, 19 should be discarded in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We make it"
The migration of refugees is a huge challenge - the federal officer has decided to accept it.
What happens to Germany?
800 000 asylum applicants will come to Germany this year after prognoses of the Federal Minister of Internal Affairs, following the statement of Vizecanzler Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to include a million refugees.
Federal blogger Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated indefinite challenge: "I say again and again: we can create it, and we do it."
What happens to Germany, the following overview is referred to.
According to different prognoses, between 350000 (stimation of the Federal Construction Ministry) and 400000 (stimation of the Pestel Institute) apartments are used annually - even for the next five years.
This is almost double as far as it is built (250000 apartments).
Dramatically, however, the lack of housing spaces is particularly in payable meals: the yearly 60000 to 80000 social accommodations falls out of the meal price connection, and for these special favorable accommodations, refugees will also be obtained.
For this reason, the Federal Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) wants to double the promotion, from now to a billion euros to a billion.
Many too few of the Pestel Institute has to be found: 80 000 social accommodations have to be taken annually and the covenant should make an increase of 6.4 billion per year.
Some of the Scientists and Federal Ministers are that there must also be more tax benefits for investments in the building of the apartment.
According to estimates of the Institute for Labour Market and Professional Research, 55% of the refugees in Germany can be acquired in a long term.
However, the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked after their qualification to help them at the end, Claudia Walter, Project Manager for Integration and Education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, for the integration of refugees, it is crucial that they find work in Germany.
Work is the key for social contacts, for assessment in the acquiring society, but also for the self-value of migrants, Migration researcher Dietrich Trinhardt says.
In Germany, Trinhardt has given a political course: the ban for refugees to recognise work.
While it was previously banned for asylum applicants from up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the resident liability that the asylum applicant limits to a residence place.
In society, as well as because of the expert failure, mostly the view that refugees should be allowed to access to the labour market.
A great deal for the access to the labour market is lacking German knowledge.
There is no sufficient offer for general and professional language courses.
Research also shows that jobs are most often transmitted by personal contacts.
The construction of networks is therefore viewed by Trinhardt of the king's way to work integration.
The Berlin School Manager has found that only few flying parents give their children into the world, estimatedly 10 to 15 percent: "For the developed parents, it is only very important to keep the family together", says Ilja Koschembar, speakers for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Management.
However, to convince the family of the benefits of us, the management of hands is distributed in various languages.
If the need for researchers is strongly increased by the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase educational capacity - at least by allowing more educational schools.
In the countries, students are prepared for education in non-German classes of welcome.
However, they are not always taught by full-educated teachers and teachers, but also, as in Berlin, of teacher forces who have only a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no fault to them, Beate Stoffs say by the Berlin School Management.
The German student work estimates that about 20% of the refugees are going to study in Germany.
In principle, no Federal Asylum applicants or pacifers do not submit the study - the only exception was until Berlin, the internal senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now set his position.
Students voluntary refugees could be facilitated access to high school.
Because refugees with a residence or duty do not receive performance after the asylum application law when they start a study.
The latters are in fact not receiving bathroom, since they do not fall under the circle of baptized persons.
Paved refugees had to live up to four years in Germany to be entitled to be BafÃ¶g, from 1 January 2016 to 15 months of slowing this spane.
However, this financing must also be closed, requested by Krach, Berlin's State Secretary for Science, and the German student work.
The students should get bafÃ¶g immediately.
The Islam will play an important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many the religion is an important part of their identity.
The State should subsequently put the Islam the same rights as they have the churches, and further develop the existing State-Circ law into a new relationship with State-Religiones.
It would also be important for the creation of a Islamic welfare association that cares for the new conventions.
The rights also includes obligations.
Thus, the representatives of the Islam must be ready to work with the State in many areas and make certain control opportunities.
This is also the disposal of being protected against religious fundamentalism.
The President of the Center Council of the Muslim, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday, that religious conflicts could also be engaged in Germany.
Those who wanted to execute such conflicts in Germany "it had immediately their right to pursue here, in Germany," he said in the Bahrian Rundfunk.
He proposed to translate the basic law into Arab.
Integration will be more than today a subject of the whole society.
In order to change the majority of society, the reduction of discrimination and racism will also be increased.
However, Germany has, as a result of European decisions, a anti-discrimination body and a general equality law since a few decades.
However, it is very slowly learning how the NSU murder series showed that the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motivation.
Similar opportunities for all: that migratory organizations and non-governed German groups have already requested and which international agreements, such as the Anti-Russism Convention of Germany, must be reality in the next years if the country remains peacefully and its new citizens and citizens should use their opportunities for all.
Generally, Germany was in a position to give medically expected refugees, says President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"What man power and capacity we do", he said to the daily level.
However, additional money should be flown into the system.
In order to avoid engaging, Montgomery calls for the same access to all competitors with the registration of health cards.
The benefits carried out later could be calculated with the federal countries.
And long-termly it is most fragile to consider so many people with the limited performance catalogue that predicts the asylum application law.
Instead, the doctors make the language barriers especially.
Until now, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has demonstrated that immigrants are worse about their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in doctoral practices, dolmetsher costs should be acquired.
Many refugees, however, would also be helped with more general medical routines in emergency ammunition.
And with another diagnostic view.
Under refugees, it is clearly more unrelated disorders, and in the youth, it is about HIV explanation.
In part, with the other disease images, German doctors come from their training clearly, says Montgomery.
"It isn't so hard to recognise the illness of the physicians."
The Syrians had a high-scale education system, some refugees were even doctors.
In order to practice, however, they should be able to demonstrate their qualifications and to delay the tests again.
At least half of the refugees arrived in Germany, according to estimates of the federal psychotherapeuten chamber (BPtK) is psychologically sick: most suffering under posttraumatic disorder or depression.
In particular, they were refugee skillers, Detrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recent study of TU Munchen states that every fifth Syrian refugee kid is traumated in Germany.
Those who are sick at a posttraumatic loading disorder, interfere with so-called flashbacks with atmosphere, skin, heart race and death pain.
Additional symptoms are sleep and concentration disorders, strong horribleness and emotiveness.
To prevent the chronic symptoms, if necessary for early treatment, Munz declared.
However, only four percent of the psychological refugees have received a psychotherapy.
Although psychologically sick asylum demanders may make a request for psychotherapy, the treatment is almost a few months.
Furthermore, in the social employees, most experts or doctors who are not trained for psychological diseases would decide whether therapy is necessary or not.
This is often leading to missing assessments, says Munz.
Manege calls for dreams
With the new "Leidence" insertion, the Circus Probst returns to the traditions of the circumcision art.
The aim is to move every age group into the banks of fascinating acrobatics, animal clothes and individual Entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst enters the hands on the hill to dream.
"Our suffering is the circus."
"I can't imagine without living my circumcision family," said Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and Juniorchefin.
"Leadity" - under this engine is the current manipulation.
For more than 33 years the circus is in the hands of the family Provst.
So the family is in the blood.
"We are important to get people out of their daily trail and to take them into a entirely different world for two hours," states the 27-year-old Juniorchefin.
"Manegencocktail with World City Flair", says Director Reinhard Probst.
50 cities on the area of about 3,000 km along the tourist can now experience this flat.
The circus program is convinced with talented artists from the world.
The Russian Stoliarov Clown Family is the public with witz and Charme in their banks.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their handwork.
With the heroes of the stomach films, it wants to take the Cuban Duo locker.
Facility and movement - with these words they are identified.
Your humorful art in the mast will be shocking women in the storm.
Unlike numerous lachsalves, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinates with finger painting feelings and flexibility.
Balanced with the inrad on a ball?
There's no problem for He Yuan.
Fascinate and horrible humans.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics as little other and fascinated with their movement.
60 assigned from 12 nations offered diversity in every perspective.
"The animals belong to our family," Stephanies Mother, Brigitte Provst.
Disorders in the situation of circumcision are often subjects in various animal protection organizations.
Stephanie Probst also accepts this position: "If our animals are not good, it's not good to us."
round 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each strike unit.
The "treeping artists", as they are lovely called, will read each desire from the eyes, if possible.
We want to work together with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn't smell, it doesn't want to be in the hands.
So the top command is good for the animals.
Specially on her cebroid Jumbo, a mixture from a ShetlandPonyhengst and a Zebrastote, the family is proud.
The two animals have lived together for eight years and nothing happened.
"But then, soon, our little jumbo was there", says Brigitte Provst.
The cebroid is not yet ready for the hands, but it is the unique mask of the Circus Probst.
So for each visitor, there should be something.
"One is safe," said Stephanie Probst, "we always give our best and are with all the hearts of it."
The Circus Probst enters its ideas from 17 to 20 September daily at 17 and 20 p.m.
On Sunday, the program begins at 11:00 and 16:00 p.m.
Thursday is Family Day, for the proposal at 17 a.m. the prices are reduced.
Moreover, every day the animal view is opened from 10 to 18 hours.
Simbabwes Robert Mugabe holds false speech in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's older leader, went down from the beginning of the year of a podium.
He remained unfaithful, but the video of the case quickly spread about social media.
The opening of Parliament was also understood by appealing by Members of the opposition that they had received an anonymous death threat and they were warned to accompany Mr Mugabe's debate with Buh.
In the past month, they tried him and interrupted him during his speech to the situation of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The speaker of the movement of democratic change (Movement for Democratic Change - MDC) Innocent Gone said that seven opposition-political SMS messages have received on their phones they warned to destroy Mr. Mugabes talk.
"The message comes from a number that will not be displayed, but she has the title 'Tod'," he said journalists after Mugabes talk.
She warns the Members concerned that immunity ends in Parliament and when it leaves the Parliament, its parliamentary immunity is not more effective.
The chairman said that the party conducted by Msvangirai was "inquired" about the dangers for the politicians.
Hewlett package will be reduced to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and recovery efforts in the services of the company.
In this year, HP will be shared in two bursened companies and share the computer and printer business from its rapidly growing enterprises and its service business activities.
The expected semi-building leads to a load of more than 2,7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"This restructuring measures will allow a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise", said Meg Whitman, HP President and Chief Executive, which should lead the unit after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and stronger focused than it is today HP, and we have a wide and deep portfolio of business supporting companies to a new style of business", said Whitman.
As own companies, we are better set before before to satisfy the changed needs of our customers throughout the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion annual summary and "It will be concentrated on the delivery until now inadequate, integrated technology solutions for companies", says a statement of the company.
It distributes a company founded by Stanford University Hewlett and Dave Packard in the 1930s to create electronic installations and called Pallo Alto Garage the "the birth place of the Silicon Valley".
HP has run a massive restructuring to control the delay of traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The measure of HP, the second-second PC manufacturers and one of the largest US Tech companies worldwide, is the latest in this area that is based on the conviction that closely focused companies make better benefits.
FC Arsenal Cappitan Mikel Arteta says that teams before playing Dynamo Zagreb must stand behind the defeated Jack Wilshere
Wenger emphasized Wilshere that it's just September and if his reactivation goes after plan, there's no reason why he can't play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will be safe to at least the next four games for England and, in view of his history, his participation in the next summer in Europe's mastership is still uncertain.
The great tribulation of this current problem is that Wilshere had severely completed the last season after a separate fertility of skin and then returned to his old slowness during the presidence.
"This kind of injury does not threaten the carriage," Wenger said.
It's a skin that didn't heal.
This is not greater.
This was just a accident.
It wasn't connected to his kitchens or to the injuries that he had before.
This may be true of pure medical view, but as wenager also recognized, there is the risk of further injuries, even if a player tries to turn back to the season.
It also develops an unfortunate pattern.
The survey of the First Injuries Ltd represents 23 different diseases of Wilshere since his debout six years ago.
He also played only 65 by Arsenals 157 links in the last five game times.
The larger image for Arsenal is that they were one of the two first League clubs that have generated most of the game day in six of eight times since 2007/08.
Nenger accepts the potential of a demon circle, but Arsenal believes that a improvement in the damage rate will continue during the last season.
"Atimes when you come back from an injury, you have an accidental period, a time in which you have to strengthen your body and win the strength of the fighter," said Wenger.
Jack's enough to overcome this.
I hope his body is stabilized, I am convinced that he's gonna do it and he'll go through a career of the way he wins.
Arsenal begins his Champions League season on midnight against Dinamo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on the midday afternoon, and Wenger has a rotation within the team.
Hector Bellerin and Aaron Ramsey are not going to Croatia, which means that Matthieu Debooky and Arteta should start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Subo Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and the players that it needs to spend a small swimming break," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal is clear preferences to continue by group F, the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to playing places with the greatest threats effect in Europe.
Dynamo has also been denied after 41 games after the "unacceptable" campaign was started in the last season.
The stadium was shocked on Thursday night by a earthquake, measured on the board 3.2.
This year was 10 in Zagreb.
Nevertheless, Arsenal believes that the teachings from the past season with the Champions League capturization against Monaco and remained in the deep hope to lead the agreement to its first European Population Triumph.
"These driving is imminent," Wenger said.
It has never been shocked with Arsenal.
We were very close to this in 2006, but on the other side, I'm enough in business to be realistic.
We're honest, but we're not dreams.
FriendsFest: the Comedy show, which gives us serious lessons about men's friendships
The lack of similar shows in show is obvious, especially in terms of how the need for men to open up has now been more doubtful than you have been, as self-mortals among young men at a 15-year-old hour.
In 2013, it was the main death cause for men in the age of 20 to 45 in Britain, and there are three times more often in men than women.
In order to address the problem, the Against Living Miserably campaign (CALM - campaign against a natural life) 2015 announced as a year of the man to question the culture, the men hinder to see help if they need it.
friendship is the heart room in the fight to maximize this challenge.
A current study in more than 2.000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficient high percentage of friends with "small stimulation", his chances were doubled on genesis.
For those who are not depressive, half a circle of spiritually healthy friends risks of mental problems.
But, of course, you have to have friends to work for friendship.
In the age of the social media communication, with its gravity in the style of substances, the inadequacy of the response is often more important than an important contact.
Our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong, slightly and successful, even if in reality the isolation dominates.
This overwhelming success is dominated by what psychologic values call for extreme values; money, image, social status, everything on costs of intrinsic values - our internal search for personal development and friendship, which is more effective to our spiritual health.
And as a video game finger and a billioner recently explained, money can't really be purchased.
The beauty of friends was that this focus was put on the head.
Each character was not defined by his work, but by his personality, which was a friend by the interaction.
The humor of Joey and Chandlers's common circumstances, moments at football balls in cotton sessels and the slightness of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can talk about it at any time, even though they are often resting, to completely learn their feelings.
As an employee of the phone seal, it explained me: "My role of listening to people who feel depressive and self-domicide has shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
Those who contact us often do not feel able to talk to friends.
The old word "I'm going to be right" has a huge effect, such as the feeling that it will be treated as weak when you are talking about problems openly."
Friends is one of the shows that comes to me when I try to offer longer-crisis mechanisms.
It very clearly presents the small moments of men's friendships.
So much of my objective foreign page status on the phone can also help people at the moment of desertification, which takes a long-term support from a personal family network and friends.
And so, when you visit the Comedy Central Friend Festival with the completely new-building arts for the day's day, why don't you take your friends to a drink in Central Perk.
Or better if you see someone in Starbucks alone, give him a laugh and say hello.
You never know how different your friendship could make.
friends are sent to Comedy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Maria is to help PSG to smell smell
Angel Di Maria celebrates Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his face against MalmÃ¶.
Maria applies to his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to take place to MalmÃ¶.
Here are the game report and the reaction on the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani took course when Paris Saint-Germain began his Champions League Saison with a very comfortable 2-0 winning against MalmÃ¶ in the Prince Park station on Tuesday.
In Mary, less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League DebÃ¼ts was the PSG player who led the French master on the path, but then she passed a number of occasions before they finally increased their pretension as Cavani reached a headballtor in the 61th minute.
With Real Madrid and Schatzjor Donezk also in the Group A, Paris also needs a strong start against the Swedish Master, since they are not only trying to qualificate the K.O. Runs but to improve the path to the fourth finances in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they found the points, there was no class game of Laurent White's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic's chances before the gate. He was later changing in the game against his hometown team and against the agreement with which he started his illustrious career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win home or outside in the Champions League. It's why it's a good start to win 2:0 to cause our opposite problems and to smell, even if there are some things that we still need to perfectize in the course of the season," said White.
"This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I would be sure we have not reached one or two more towers."
After his infringement, Ibrahimovic returned in one of the three changes in the Paris team, which was able to keep a 2:2 indecisive on his own place against the Bordeaux in the First Liga, but he was cut by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentinian Flight Turner was called the man to take PSG to the next stage in Europe when he was taken to Manchester United in the last month, and he said why he entered into Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malmoo defence before he was beautiful to Johan Wiland in the long trail of the network.
But if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, he was disappointed.
MalmoÃ¶, the Celtic was in a play-off to reach this stage, with an appiff with nine national players on the field and was with a fif-man defence and two deeply in the Mediterranean.
But except a shock of Nikola Djurdjic, who overlooked Kevin Trapps Pfosten in the 34th minute, was little in attack.
Instead, PSG has sometimes been opened with some defects and painful defects, not lastly by Ibrahimovic, which was not less than five attempts alone in the first half of the trials and then was set after Cavani had used him after the new start.
However, he demonstrated more sentence when he brought his players into the game, and it was a passage of Ibrahimovic, who transformed Di Maria into a shooting shooting, whose Wiland was overlooked in the 52th minute on the pfost...
The second gate ended shortly after the hour market thanks Cavani. The Uruguayr achieved his sixth saisontor, after Ibrahimovic was shocked a left flanke of Maxwell.

Since then, we have only played in the Swedish Liga which did not have the same level.
The qualification games are not too rich."

Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented 2008 changing to FC Bayern
World and Europe Master Xavi has played since summer 2015 for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Katar
The FC Bayern was apparently a few years ago before the obligation of Spain's Superstar Xavi, who played for the FC Barcelona.
Eight times Spanish master, three times Pocalshier, four times Champions League, two times club meist, two times European master, one time World Master - the title list of Xavi is awesome.
In the summer, the average 35-year-old boys left the FC Barcelona and changed to the al-Sadd Sport Club to Katar.
But in an interview with the Marca, Xavi now engaged that he was already before the 2008 C.E., before the adoption of Barcelona.
"There were told me that Barza wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything then, we're nothing," he said.
And this also recorded the FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was a offer of Bayern."
"Rummenigge wanted to have me."
Remember: In the summer 2008, JÃ¼rgen Klinsmann overlook the FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason that Xavi did not change
However, the changing was not allowed.
And the exhibited man today works for the German register: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "BarÃ§a has taken a treaty under Guardiola and I have played a wonderful EM."
"Pep told me that I wouldn't change that he could not imagine the manner without me."
"That he got me."
Who knows how Bayerns would run with Xavi in 2008/2009.
Xavi was for Barca in the fourth end of the Champions League against the battlers over the whole distance on the race, cut the red from (4:0, 1:1) and celebrated at the end of the king class triumph.
Matt Damon plays Vielfalt in the film created down
Matt Damon faced the African film master Effie Brown during a debate on the diversity and said that it would not be necessary behind the clubs.
During a result of Sunday Night by HBOs Project Greenlight, the experienced player Brown highlighted the need for alternative perspectives, even with regard to a black protagonist in the selected threshold book of the project.
"When we talk about diversity, then do it when the movie is designed, and not at the order of the show," said Damon.
Brown reacted shocked, with political unbelieves, and called "Hoo! Wow. OK" when the comments of The Martian's player were fixed.
Damon and Brown closed the producer colleagues Ben Appleck and Farrelly Brothers to discuss the show-finalists.
"I want to ask people to think about - whoever will always be the government - how they treat the figure of the Harmony," said Brown first.
The only black person, and she is a nut that is shocked by her white accessor.
The producer of Dear White People took place for the finalist Leo Angelos and Christian Brancaccio for the region's rights; Damon replied that their region "in the end could give us something we don't want".
After the debate was exhausted, the social media were explosed before being misleaded over Damons comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni pressed his wrath over the clip by writing "Matt Damon speaks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain its diversity - this is SO WEISS that it hurts."
The twitter won more than 5,000 netweights and 4.000 likes since its publication.
Madams comments come at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the top of the social debate.
After the teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the movement of Black Lives Matter has reached a large country-wide effect and enlarged legislators and authorities to order discriminatory practices against colorable content.
In February the Singer Prince made an emphasis on the movement during the introduction of the named alves of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black life, Alben still have their importance.
In recent times, leaders of the movement Black Lives Matter have published a statement, as a response to the question of the Fox-News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be viewed as a Hass group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love," the leaders said.
Recently, Damon was announced on a list of Entertainers, Producers and Media Mogules to be invited to visit the pope to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West.
If he has accepted the invitation or already found the pope, it's not clear.
"American Ninja Warrior" creating the first Champion
Professional sports and service support Isaac Caldiero was the first athlete who wins Ninja Warrior on Monday night and took the big price of $1 million with home.
The competitive show, which just completed its seventh season, had never experienced a competitive partner who could complete all stages of its prevention parcours.
During the saison finale, there were two men, Caldiero and cameramann Geoff Britten, up to Finale.
At the last task, the kitchen belonged to a 75 feet long seat in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the task within the time when he was the first athlete, which completed the strict phase 4 by American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero ended this challenge full of three seconds, which made him winer.
Caldiero talked with E! News after the hard-wide victory, still under the shock over the winning of the great price of $1 million.
"I mean, it's surprising to think about, I have never paid more than $10,000 or ever for life," said Isaac E! about his cheap money.
As soon as I can't even imagine how this is... the future is unknown.
The leading producer Kent Weed moved to the Hollywood reporter to discuss the final and why Britishs, although he first ended the parcours, did not receive any price payment.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there are more than a finalist, it takes it with the fastest time," Weed said.
How much the money is a wonderful price and life changes, it receives the wonderful graphics.
I don't think he's calling something about it.
He's just been so happy to do what he did.
He received the mass of signs from Fans.
He's such a nice boy and a family parents.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be kicked by someone, I am glad that it is Isaac."
And I think I would feel like Isaac if they had disappeared the roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for a eighth stapel, which will be started in spring 2016.

After receiving the Leadoff battery, Hushes gave a single one to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-Out Walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game which created a single "up the midst" at the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez created his 0-21 success series with the runners in the Scoring position.

No food fruit - Mango contains a lot of sugar
Mangos are exotic and sweet.
But whoever wants to take care of his crazy lines, it will often be distracted from them.
Because Mangos contains relatively much sugar - especially saccharose.
Nevertheless, the exotic fruits are healthy: B vitamins are stolen as well as vitamins E and C., especially Mangos includes a lot of vitamin A and its predominant beta calotin.
Those who eat the fruit, therefore support the visibility, immune system and substance exchange processes in the body.
When buying Mangos should not be sweet or sweet and acceptable.

Hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus is one of the main works that Otmar Alt has made for his Bible.
Klaus Oldpost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
The word was at the beginning?
No, not at the Otmar Old Bible, now appearing with pretty pictures.
At the beginning, the image of Otmar Alt was formulated in 150 reasons by its entire Bible stories on paper and leinwand.
His "speak" with good colors and fantastic forms has received the 75-year-old boys - but no way is equal to "speaking" images.
On the other hand, the subjects adjusted can affect the rightly dark effect.
Over three years Otmar Alt has worked at his Bible project, for which he took a subjective-artist selection from the many theme areas of the "Books All Books".
Resurrections are cycles that are subjects such as crossways, places, orders or paternes.
In this way, he spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther's link with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler's link with its strict point on art books.
And in particular there is the author Klaus Oldpost, who on the basis of the Maleria with the Scriptural publications.
He interpreted the scripture chosen by Otmar Alt and thus today, in the current assembly "translated".
These texts are like verbal mirror of Alts Malerei.
They are accompanied between the original Bible quote of Martin Luther and everywhere a set of the artist, which forms his entire personal thoughts on every situation.
The shooting band has golden letters.
This allows the 75-year-old age to double a deep view in his soul, his emotions.
This is a high measure of intimity.
Emotions were finally solved for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, 1940 in Wernigerode and growing in Berlin, comes from a family who heard the strict protestant shrine orders.
"It's what the education has happened with the shock," Otmar Alt recalls.
"I've tried to work this to bring me back with the Lord's father."
His second concern is to help the art in rapidly living time again to a more value of place: "The use of image worlds is present today by advertising, and it is sound.
The symbolics are disrupted there.
Artists have another joy and desire to show things.
Images always have a secret and are not decorative.
"In this regard, I am a dinosaurer."
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to let the images "infalls" they affect themselves, discover and feel which strength they have: "This image is looking for its opposition".
Klaus Oltepost was held on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt Bible in the Otmar-Earth Foundation, "whoever" was a favorite Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his images."
Alt has not seen the Bible fully, but the important, secret topics for him.
"This was not cooperation at the height of the eyes," said the Ancient Post, "This is about the pictures, the text explains less than."
For Hans MÃ¶hler from Luther-Vergel, this work is an invitation to "develop his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alt's images speak for masters both the (biblic) language of love and the responsibility.
A part of the original paper and lenging images - first is presented in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Otmar-Earth Foundation.

DFB intensive commitment to refugees
The DFB extends its commitment to refugees until 2019, the Federal Liga sets a significant sign at the weekend.

"I think it is for the greatest challenge of our country since the reunion."
"In principle, no one can tell me that it doesn't matter me, I have nothing to do about it."
"This must interest each individual to get this topic into the griff," said the DFB Chief Wolfgang Niersbach.
During the annual meeting with the federal Cancer Angela Merkel, on 23 September in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany.
"I'm the next midnight in the kanzleramt and I'm meeting Mrs. EzoÄuz and the chiefs there."
"It will play a central role in this topic", he announced.
The football can help.
However, the decisive channels have to put the policy into place.
The German football band has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" for four years.
"Besides the Egyptian Braun Foundation, we have assured that this programme continues until 2019," Niersbach explained at the EUFA meeting in St. Julian's/Maala.
Some federalists also support this programme.
In this weekend, the 36 Proiverines will make a clear sign when they are put on the left tricotall instead of the other ordinary sponsor logo (Hermes) the "We Help - # Refugeeswelcome".
"We also want to make clear that everyone should help where and how they can only", said Leverkusens Sport Chief Rudi VÃ¶ller of the "Picture" showing (Third Day) and called the project as "Selbst understanding".
"The refugee dram is everybody, no one can get away."
"We can help football advisers, no, we need our rail force, use our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly," said Hertha Manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffeheim's business manager Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of Liga".
To the EM qualification game against Hungary on Friday, the National Manager of Women's 100 Refugees to Halle/Saale is engaged in the National Army of Women.
Niersbach was called the support of refugees as a "a great Community work of German football".
It was wonderful that all 36 licensing agreements had started their own projects in their places.
It's great that smaller and smaller blood are active there.
The message "1:0 for a Welcome" we issued is living in the football.
"This is of great importance," he said.
In this and next year, the Association will provide 300 000 euros for integration of refugees together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government.
"The ceremonies have already called the whole sum for 2015", reported Niersbach.

"That's important to stand back when you're shocked."
McLaren-emptom pilot Magnussen except shoot ...

Football: BVB without reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfellers in the Tower
In Borussia Dortmund, all the hopes on a competitor of Marco Reus were finally destroyed in the first group game of Europe League.
The national player is missing the table leader of the football liga in Duell with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00/Sky).
"We can't take back on him", said Thomas Tuchel at midnight.
Whether Reus will be back on Sunday in the Federal Liga Game against Levercuzen, the BVB coach opened: "We recall with a return from him to training on Friday."
In view of the high burden of his profession, Tuchel will not only change his skin leaflet on the resus position.
So he announced a change on the tower position.
This is why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of Stammkeeper Roman Burki.
"He trains on a absolute top level," the football teacher lovers the world master.
Whether weddings will be used in the future in all European League games, however, Tuchel was open.
With high probability, he will also be deployed by the second party.

"I think we have a good opportunity to take the title."
Roboter cars: Government wants to presidency for Germany
Germany, after the will of the Federal Government, is to be a change in the car of technological President.
The Federal Kabinett decided at midnight a strategic paper from the House of Ministers of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investment in the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on midnight in Frankfurt at the border of the Automesse IAA from a "new mobility visitor".
The automated and connected driving will increase transport safety and care for less steel, said Dobrindt.
He also wants to discuss the subject with its official colleagues from the G7 States, which are also together with representatives of the industry in the IAA.
The strategic paper of the Ministry of Transport highlights the importance of the mobile broadband construction and a slightly change in digital hearing.
To try new technology, a test trail is currently on the 9th carway in Bayern.
In order to "no additional debt risks", the Federal Government will review the legal framework conditions and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments.
As a result, Germany wants to take about internationally to increase the maximum speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 km.
The Federal Government also wants to introduce a change in the Wiener Convention, which is only a driver to people.
In automaticized drives, the car is driving, the driver will be more and more to passenger.
Technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that cover the environment and process data in seconds fast.
After a study presented by the Economic Minister, high automated driving will be technically possible until 2020.
Nevertheless, without vehicles are expected on public streets "for the first time after 2020".
The value of the driving systems and the high automaticized drive functions on the location of Germany are estimated by the authors of the study for 2025 to about 8,4 billion euros.
"The digital connection of the Pkw can lead to more security and efficiency in road traffic", said the SPD shipping politician SÃ¶ren Bartol.
The question of the accusation of accidents and the security of the personal data of the driver should, however, be clearly clear.
However, German automobiles are still skeptical - more than French or Americans.
A survey of the Forsa Institute on midnight of the AA, in order of the Decra Audit Organization, results that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomy drivers will be carried out in the coming ten years, 32 percent only claimed in 20 years and 31 percent do not believe it.
In France 21 percent of the respondents account for autonomy cars, 33 percent in the United States.
Indeed, the drivers in Germany are not ready to completely leave themselves on a self-driving vehicle.
After receiving the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to delay controls on all roads.
It could always be 15 percent in the flight, 45 percent in the car.
Good every fourth would leave the control under no circumstances.

The village of the DÃ¼ssel will only take part in the individual after every stipulation of the titles of 25 September to 4 October.

"We should orientate," explained the Fifth World Landlists.
The English football national player Luke Shaw from Manchester United has a serious infringement on the right skin.
In Champions League game at the PSV endhoven, the defenseman was attacked and switched after long treatment.

Gaulier feels too old for a child
It is a mixture of very large modern view and a guard graphic box: The designer Jean Paul Gaulti (63) has presented an exhibition in Munchen at midnight.
The height points: creating pockets, which look horriblely humanly thanks to video projections.
They're taking the spectacular creations of the French designer, which, among other things, became the large star of the modescene - and so that he stood men in rock.
"I can't say today that I am the bad child of the skin cotuer because I have white hair."
"Free was possible, here it's true," said Gaultier.
For the visitors of the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From The Sidewalk to the Catwalk) which is to see in the art of the Hypo culture, it is a chance that the Modelor has changed its initial rejection to a view of his person.
In fact, if he had been, he said, "For me, a exhibition was a bit after death," he said.
If you die, you're coming to the museum.
The impressioning collection had already been made in the Canadian Montreal and in Paris Station.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the Director of the Artsthale, Roger Diederen.
It goes about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exponents give a view to the unpredictable work of the man who has written modest history to have never completed a training.
Chronologically, the look is not built, but it is an excellent choreographed whole work, for which a lot of shoes has been used: To fry the powders, for example, a stylist was involved.
14 tonnes of materials, the machines have been carded by the Kurator Thierry-Maxime Loriot to Munchen.
Shortly before the October Festival, there was a special small of it: a leder hose orphit with corsett.
Heydi meets Madonna.
He has always interested in strong women ("Women are weak than men") and for people who are a little different, said Gaultier.
Gauliers' old Teddy is also to see in the exhibition.
It is for the first, visible moderate course of the designer.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in the football), he took his Teddy BHs and clothes, said Gaultier.
With a pop, his parents wouldn't have allowed him.
The design of mode later he taught himself.
He stole model books and saw the designers of other designers as Gaultier was told in Munchen.
I've got it later, but of course I've purchased it.
For his first modern view he didn't have to pay the models.
They didn't understand anything, but they keeped the clamps.
Smuck instead of Gardine - Pluener Spitze as mod-nice
Before it went to the long switch machines and to swim in to make metros.
The stored substances and pictures consisted in large numbers of customers, for example, of the processing of cows and gardens.
This does not work only today, says Andreas Reinhardt, the leader of the modespitze Plauen.
Instead, the mode is again important.
In the early times of the pitze, the model played a greater role, then the home textile industry was slowed - and now it is recovered than Nice.
Reinhardt calls some examples: pitze in Schmuck, accessoires such as bags and regional negotiations.
The so-called Vintage model, which refuses to defeat style pockets, was an increased assignment potential.
Those who do not live in the textile sector in Germany are no longer on the market.
They're already doing half of all contracts with us.
Modespitze Plueen is together with nine other companies member of the Branchen Association Plautener Spitze and Stickereia.
Only they can take the protected label.
In the past 15 years, some 80 percent of the switch were disrupted.
Private business and even the big trade there is almost no longer.
Our products have not yet reached the customers in this way.
The massage machinery is produced in Asian space more widespread and almost expenditure by kits.
Moreover, exports are weak, currently in Russia and the United States.
So there are reasons for new ways.
The Branch Association also tries to point out through environmental consciousness, as Cordula Bauer declared by the Stickperle in Falkenstein: "We lead a quality seal that shows that we are ecological and socially produced."
Reinhardt adds: "This also concerns the materials used".
Diplome designer Ute Schmidt teaches to the Sneeberger Foreign Area of the Western Zwickau High School - at the Faculty for Used Art - and is specialized on Stickerees and Spitzens.
In order to put some competitiveness from Asian space, you must find high-quality and innovative products.
It needs time and courage.
It is a shocking area between the most fresh ideas of designers and the exploitations, especially economicly,â says Schmidt.
Therefore, a existing design is often only easy to keep a customer's share.
A few years ago, the historical snake sneeball designer Kati Reuter renewed the historical sneeball pizza.
Thus the machine puts a few places small kitchens.
The Plater Golden Meeting Master Bianca Hallebach was inspired by this: "I couldn't start with traditional pitzes."
Now she's using the sneeball piece for her sweet.
In an ongoing procedure, the template is in silver.
"My people of the region are identified with the theme Plautener Spitze - young and old," says Reuter.
It also provides to the United States, to Australia and Finland - especially to customers who have lived in places and environments, and who want to be a memorandum.
That's how I see my smuck as the modern messager of the Plauener Spitze.
Disney plant new "Mary Poppins" film
Nevertheless, Disney's new movie of its classic "Mary Poppins".
However, "Entertainment Weekly" is not a new movie, but a type of continuation that plays 20 years after the first film with the magic kids.
It's about the experiences of Nanny's family banks at the time of World Economic crisis in England.
Who plays Poppins over 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclean.
But the government is already firm: Rob Marshall, lastly with "Into the Woods" in China.
Xi starts to open the economy wideer for the world
The economy must be opened up to the outside to promote growth, said President Xi Jinping on Tuesday of a group that has been employed with the landing of the reform.
"China should take place in order to block foreign investments and knowledge and improve the business-based strategies", he said in a conversation at the 16th meeting of the Central Directorate Group for the extension of a comprehensive reform.

After the declaration, a list of negatives is set up which identifys sectors and companies that do not in question for investments.
The system will be tested and improved by test programmes.
The initiative is important since it shows the market a greater role in the allocation of resources, guarantees a legal business area and opens the market, said the statement.
The government will also provide controls on the powers transferred to the companies and ensure that companies decide how they carry out their business.
The statement also stated that China will allow border areas to investigate new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In the context of an offer to open stately controlled sectors, further areas for private investment will be opened.

Furthermore, it will be made more easy for foreigners to request a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimize the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The lawyer's right to ensure its activities and to adopt professional judges and State lawyers was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting also took part in the Prime Minister Li Keqiang and important leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement published after the meeting.
EU wants to double Checksilber greenness in Raubfish
The European Commission wants to double the border values for cocktails in large raubfish rabbits and to encourage consumers to make a significant increase in the nervous rate.
The Foodwatch consumer organization, which provides a corresponding work paper in the EU, criticized the plans: "The risks and side effects of the prevented industrial and environmental policy are being continued fullly with weakness to smaller and small children," said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
In accordance with Wolfschmidt, the border values of the Nerven Guide for Great Fish at the end of the food chain, such as some Haie or Scheme fish from one to two milligrams of cocksilber per kilogram fish.
Great raubfishes, however, have already been so strong with cocksilbers that, on the basis of the still existing limit values, about 50 percent of the fleet should not be sold.
After duplicating the limit values, only 14.5 per cent would be insecure.
In contrast to this installation, the EU, according to Foodwatch, wants to increase the border values in other fishes from now 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of checksilver per kilogram.
Foodwatch called this as "Tryck", because smaller friedfish, like some carps are usually so low that they keep the maximum values planned today.
The decrease in small fish is therefore "a perfide decrease man, which helps the economy alone", explained Wolfschmid.
Checksilber is one of the humans of high-double nitrogen metals, which is very strong over the food chain, especially in raubfish.
The Federal Government therefore warns that "also low amounts can be caused by indigenous damages of the nervous system".
The Federal Environment Ministry declares on its homepage as regards the maximums available, but it is not expected to be a "sancient risk of general population".
Checksilders, especially through carbon disruption in the environment, have been achieved.
The German coal power works covered a written outcome of the Federal Environment Ministry at the Green Day of Green, Annalena Baerbock, more than six tons of Quecksilber in the year, two thirds of the total amounts emited in Germany.
The concentration of cocksilber in fishing around in Elbe, Rhein and Donau was "termly and slowly exceeded", was sent out of the paper in March.
In the past year, Europe's wide warnings for cocksilver in fish were among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RASFF.
