No free news for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian Parliament rejected today the request to decrease the paragraphs referred to in the context of a new criminal law book, based on which the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko was condemned.
The new arrangement that could have been able to evacuate the Deputy Minister of Experience in the second reading of the request to reduce the penalties for economic crimes.
Timoshenko was sentenced in October because of the conclusion of an appropriately participating treaty with Russia on the purchase of gas to seven years of detention.
The sentence is not yet legal, and in December the profession of the judges should be negotiated.
Timoshenko itself called the court as a political rule of the regime, and also in the West, the trial was condemned by the court's prejudiciary.
The application, paragraph 365, which was sentenced to remove the Minister of Experience from the Criminal Act, was supported by 147 Members.
226 votes would have been necessary for its approval.
Libyscher Sieg
The history of Libyan Liberation Camp or Libyan Rebellion already knows their losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is located in a unknown place in the desert, and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners are to define.
Like him in this region, they are blessed in the elections of Islamics, the question is only what - the pleasant or radical.
The National Transition Council was known about the customs law of Scharīa, which now has a view to God.
Libya would be to the country without criminality, because the steel is shortly cut off.
Women should also forget the thoughts of emancipation as fast as possible, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, the society will be joined by the Korean future by mutual tribes.
Shortly - in Libya will rule a order that would be unprecedented to this country and, above all, would be unwanted.
Only - our lifestyle is not even the only and objective one, probably not the best and waste would not agree to the Libyans mentioned.
As you see, it is more comfortable that the moslim fighters have ever helped the unbelieving dogs.
It may be forgiven only the fact that NATO's air attacks are not by any General from America, but by God itself, which has been led to all the power after all success.
The winners in Libyan?
We took only part in a shock, served the interests of the Islam and our politicians in the person of a political associator, without that it had benefited any.
Following the fresh and bad experiences from Afghan and Iraq, we looked better after a military rule of Libyan.
This is how the hipsters are worried - the disappearance of the cross drivers.
But without occupation the black gold to spott prices are the mineral oil companies?
The western can finally be able to protect human rights by the right of his self-defects.
If this does not destroy the sharīa department.
Starting a new crisis year
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of investors.
On Thursday, a statistical storm was needed by Europe.
The individual States published their information on their BIP for the 3. Quartal.
The twenty-fourth economy was grateful in comparison with the Premier, Germany and France.
The obligation market is now all refunds.
Investors are not only in Greece but also in Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
Statistical officials of the European Zone, Germany, Czech Republic and some other European countries published their provisions on economic development in the third quarter.
Germany expected that the GDP was 0.5%, which was 0.4% from France.
Both countries corrected their data for the second quarter, in which Germany marked a higher growth as originally expected (which was 0.3% predicted instead of 0.1%), while France had a slight decline of 0.1% (for original information only said by stagnation).
The Czech economy was 1,5 per cent in this year compared to the previous year.
In comparison with the Prime Minister, however, the Brutto Inlands product was firmed and, according to the Ts. Statistical Office, the trend of growth speed in economic performance.
So the results are worse than the analytics' prognosis.
The most important events:
However, in this year's third quarter compared to the previous year, the Czech economy was 1,5%, compared to the previous quarter.
The German economy in the third quarter was 0.5% according to the provisional and seasonal information.
In the whole euro area and in the EU, the economy marked a growth between July and September against the previous quarter to 0.2%, which corresponds to the expectations of analytics.
The Greek economy was 5,2 per cent compared to the previous year.
The refunds from their 10-year-old State loans increased the value of 28.45%.
The interests of the Italian and Spanish State aid were to their critical borders.
In addition, Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries start to feel problems...
The revenue in Czech State loan is less than 4%, even though the situation is decreased in the region.
In Germany, votes will be made to the ECB to be believers of the last institution.
The Czechs were qualified for Euro
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has measured the most serious task of the whole season!
Thanks to a good-building Torvart and a beautiful gate of Petr Jiráček, they won in Montenegro 1:0.
With a great portion, the Czech football could defend its luxurious pretension of home game and will never be missing at European mastership again.
IHNED.cz followed the rising game in an executive reporting.
We have a first half-time in the first half of the year and a riesenporation luck in the second.
The Czech selection also settled by the end of the homemanship, a brilliant śech's and the herd of the day Jiraček in Montenegro rightly blessed 1:0 and thus resolved her ticket for the football-EM.
As a result of the precise defence game of the Czech Republic, the Montenegrors have just been under pressure in the second half-time.
The pechs of the party were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who shocked two channels.
The Czech election will also be mixed in Europe's masterships, and it is also happy that the home football has a premium of about 200 million.
From the first minute, a battleball was played right.
Both teams combined long-term and, in particular, have been played on the media lines.
In the second half-time, the press of the homemanship remained excited, and the sharp exams from the twenty-first decline were successfully distorted by the Czechic distortion.
Iranian students are ready to die for the nuclear programme of their country.
They were a living shield.
Some hundreds of high school students formed a living shield around a nuclear object in Iran.
With this spirit, they wanted to demonstrate their support for the nuclear programme of their country before a possible Israeli attack.
Students had prayed on Tuesday before the object and then proclaimed the death to the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students of the university in Iranian Isfahan formed a living shield around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan, which is processed in Uran on Tuesday.
They wanted to do so that they were willing to protect the nuclear programme of their country, if they needed to protect their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has recently set out in its report, which the Irani seemed to have not long received its efforts towards a nuclear weapons.
In Israel also speaks of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear plants.
Students had prayed to complexly on midday before the arrival and then proclaimed the death to the United States and Israel.
In the case of a attack which was intended to impose the Iranian atomic programme widely, the Israeli press would, as a result of the centre of Isfahan, also the nuclear-related plant in the Natan's objective.
The food card of a fat sweet child: it doesn't eat for dinner bret
More than a third of the children from 9 to 13 have overweight problems, with 9% of all students and 5% of all children.
Today’s surveys show - adipped children are mostly from families with unsuccessful lifestyle.
So again shows how important it is for the healthy development of a person, the environment in which he wakes up and the examples that give him.
On the Tissue of Adipous children, wear products are often more often on the table than in families where normal children live.
More than 19 percent of the overwhelming children had poems on the Sunday of the Declaration in the Motto "Adiposity is no accident" at nightbrot.
In families with Dickerchen, the sport is not just about the favorite jobs, but also the majority of today's students - only 15 percent responded that their parents found at least once in the week for active movement.
Question under 900 children
The survey was held last year against the end of the school year, and about 900 children from basic schools were asked in all the Czechs.
This was already the second year of the "Adiposity is not an accident", supported by the general hospital and the Unilever Society.
For now, more than 12 thousand students participated in the project from 4 and 8 classes.
Insecure costs and lack of movement in the family are essential factors responsible for the terrible number of children with overweight or even feed.
"After half of the children asked, for example, five times on the day, in the breakfast-width bedroom-meetend broth - one of the main provisions for a healthy food," said one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast and breakfast for dinner bret
Experts indicate that relative difficulties, such as the regular breakfast period of the family, are important for the healthy development of a child.
But in Czech only 23 percent of the school families.
And - in most families, everybody's buses for himself alone.
The worst thing was that it was not to be shocked in every ten family.
The breakfast applies to the basic stone of healthy daily food.
The investigation test, among others, led to the day that overwhelming children are consuming a lot of immoral trees in the family.
And almost everybody - without view on weight - drinks sweet limonades every day (70 percent)
While more than 40% of the children in question are sporting, but only less than half of their parents do it - only 15%.
Put your own menu together
Another part of the survey allowed the selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools), which were offered by appetit and opinion of their own food plans.
"The Czechian children to predict from 12 to 15 in puncto Food is far away from the ideal of a healthy food.
Among their favorite breakfast, many meat sweet skins, meat snakes, and natural sweet sweet sweet.
"Alarming is especially the great popularity of sweet limonades", is stressed in the final report on this survey.
At midnight, so the main direction, sweated tits just before birds.
The fruit of the fruits could not almost be, but also the popularity of fish and vegetables as a dinner was very small.
Health assistance
At the same time, the survey also showed that children are ready to change their habits when they get the right information.
In many cases, "Adiposity is not accidental," the checking group of the investigators who were subjected to the questionnaire, "Adiposity is not accidental", was indicated in the results of the project, in many cases, a significant transfer of preferences to the principles of healthy food.
This was, for example, the sweet limos where many children began to give the main priority of water.
The children also crossed a lot of open birds or fish as the main direction of the day and were ready to eat less sweet or sweet food.
To tell professionals - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the leading article about how to learn stylists, I thought that this was a bit too much for the beginning.
I didn't know what's going on.
Declarations of three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar about how it runs "in the place".
It's gonna be worse.
Be closer to the test, so much more information and practical tasks are before us.
But even if the course happens on Saturday and Sunday, he is completely engaged.
This time we discussed with director Alena (the course does not share a single man), as a woman, who has no ideally proportionated figure.
And these are most of us.
The one has a too short hals, the others are one of young figures without ordinary curves and other are molecules.
It is something of the styleist to cook the wide sleeves optically, extend the skin or to switch the necessary curves.
We also find tips like a woman type like Jennifer Lopez - so with a large bus, large half and slightly size - good and graphic bed, without being too provocative.
If, for example, the difference between size and harvests is so large that the rock or the hose does not really pass, at least one piece should be cut into measure.
This will not be worthy, because good sit clothing is simplely unpayable.
In such a massed rock you feel much better than in one of the stages that are always too high and cut in the size, etc.
Children's figures can be allowed to take clothes with fat, buildings, applications, strikes or refurbing.
With this amount of information and figure types, I'm glad I have a whole week of time to leave me all right through the head.
And yet, I am afraid that it is not almost to create in view of the household.
Each of the coursers was allocated to a promise for which it was intended to deal with suitable outfits - day clothing and evening robbery.
In this way, we should take into account the current appearance to the model of the corresponding star and its figure type.
I want to get Miranda Kerr to know you maybe from the Victoria's secret.
In the inside I jump, because this is much better for me than to use Brinny Spears or Christina Aguilera, which in the past few years have been taking to the hundred kilos (a good, this is a bit over) or also the young Selena Gomez.
The clothes should be disabled from magazines or search, express, and then edit graphicly.
In the "Moodboard", as the whole result is called, our entire personal style and our relationship with graphic dimension should be expressed.
Indeed, it is very important to think about the graphic side of the tyling.
The stormist is not only physical, but also designs the so-called product page in the newspapers (for example, Trend-towels, mentels, etc.).
This told us the Stylist and Designer Mario Kameník.
But that's just on Sunday.
That means that a stylist must have a good overview.
The sabbath meeting complemented with figure types was equal to three visitors from the sector:
by the Stylist Jan Pokorný, the modern creator Jakub Polanka and the model photograph Ben Renč.
Jakub recalled us that Mode Illusion is and that should be a stylist to use this.
And the enabled stylist was able to work in a different way with a single clothing room.
The magnificent word is variable.
For example, you can take a shirt coat, like a T-shirt or a mantel, but you can also put it on the naked body, shoot it and put it into it as clothes.
It is enough to put the smells or the rags high and the entire look looks very different.
"True so," he stressed.
But most of me came the following counsel: "If you should know the rules perfectly."
"And you should hurt them," said Jakub.
Finally, I will find out why we must smoke all these teachings, what we can combine with what, and why, even if in modern newspapers you are often seeing all the other.
From moderations to smile.
Thanks to the Photograph Ben I now know that a stylist has had to have prepared much more clothing options than he last photos.
So you must be prepared for a fashion store with ten sides (slip ten outfits) to style at least fiveteen.
And it is also that clothing on the photo in combination with other Accessoires seems very different than in reality.
So all of this must be accepted when the outfit is designed.
This image and style, including half of the success, confirmed us also Jan Pokorný.
There's only a time for Madonna to see a not just brilliant songman, made a world star from the image and marketing.
In Czech, the services of a styleist are more reserved.
Also known personalities keep this often for exited money (the main case is that I bring something, how I see it is secondary).
And if someone leaves us to style, then we should recognize that he or she will strike us with great probability to spend a very different (picture) size than he or she really needs.
Then you're only needing to switch up in order to make sure that the boulevardpresse writes to the corresponding promi, etc.
Jan and Mario put us on Sunday to believe that a stylist is only focused on the mode, and then the outfit "building" needed.
In his work, he must communicate with the people he stood, and he must be a tragic psychologist.
Assess people without offering themselves and standing at his opinion.
"If we ordered some manager to sit their clothes and to add good pieces, then we can't embrace you all the pain and say - my God, that's horrible."
"There must be found at least a few loving things to which you recommend what you can bring", says Mario.
He also showed us very concretely, which must hold on such a "platheshe" called.
So that's a key that you're using the size and in which you're taking all the properties necessary.
Besides such clear things, such as shoes, shoes to remove hair, or safe nails, they also contain instruments such as a nylonfad (by helping the stylist to photograph products such as hands or garments), special clips, with which clothes are obtained behind, if it is too large (the sleeves or other clothes are understood so that the substance does not go) and obviously visit.
In order to hear not only, but also to try something practical, we learned how to put the shoes correctly.
Also, when photographing in the shop where the footsteps are easier, you can damage the shooting shooting, shoot the outside.
Our clothes and we clothes...
You can't even touch the shoes with the shoes so that you don't hurt them.
So you really have to be sent.
Mario enjoyed me by loving my "creation" without restrictions.
This is not just my strength.
All this was only the brochel of what we had to hear at the second weekend end course.
One has become clear in this way - to styling at professional level, isn't child game.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal rent either by America
Revision
The originally sorglose driving is by a series of completely preventable, diletane errors to the routeway.
However, it has been possible to fill the ambitions largely, but what is the use of this if there is no joy to do a little more.
Soon before he came to the Ladentique, the new part was covered with the subtitle "The Run" high expectations.
But he talked to move a piece back to a new dimension of the Year Game series "Need for Speed" and he seemed to be not only one of many action plays.
We were also nervous how to defeat the adjusted passengers, where the main protagonist rises from the car and continues to foot.
But as you're already injured with NFS, it's finally much different than you expected.
Secure - potentially, it's right to engaged Arkade costs, but in total the game of some overwhelming errors, which are present in this series more or less than a few years.
So there are no more errors, but more signs of an incomprehensive fault of the game developers in principle.
The abendment starts very good.
The first time you will enter the history of which the main figure Jack has certain personal characters; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal act or by the United States.
In San Francisco, so on the west coast, you're on Lencrad, with the task to be first in New York.
The fundamental idea contains a whole range of interesting elements.
The whole route is divided in ten steps and in more than 50 different rains.
This means that every wave is extended to other roads, and that the individual steps occur in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don't have the impression that the game would always offer the equal.
Some environments are still well viewed, although the technical level of graphics does not depend on the previous parts of the series.
So there's no world movement.
But the driving through the deserts, by the landscape or above by the deeply disappeared landscape was very acceptable.
Towards and again, untypical elements bring a little displacement into the individual costs.
In the desert, for example, it is surprised by a desert that is strongly limited to the vision.
In the mountains again, you must be fully able to observe that you are not protected by a lawin.
On the other hand, the individual costs are well built.
Just a few, but they're rich.
One time so you try to overcome the number of enemy (in principle, a classical ransom), then you have to take time (classical wages against the stoppuhr), then a personal dual is expected with a single contractor.
And it's still lacking the police who wants to mass the whole thing.
A news is a passenger in which Jack leaves the car.
This is more about some interactive animations in which Jack fly before someone and where the player needs to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
However, it is surprising that there are much less passengers in the game than you would be expected (concrete only three).
Finally, this is most advantageous because this element has at least no opportunity to be slow - it belongs to the context mentioned above to the elements that make the game more slower.
The driving model rose in the footsteps of the previous parts.
This means, from today's point of view, it does not depend on trees, otherwise it could not be said that it would be bad.
Those who are looking for realistic simulations need to look at different parts.
But an action-loaded resin will also continue to be very right, although you can find better in competition.
It's all right until there.
Real problems are only seen after a certain time.
On the contrary to the bicycle model, the collision model is not completely O.K.
From a game of this kind is little expected that there are complicated deformations and collisions, but if you are practitioning no object knowing how the car is, then obviously it's not all right.
typical example: In close shopping or driving cars "strippet" in some places, the other cars are only easy, in other, nearly identical situations, but you're coming to the slaughter and turning pirates.
Or the cart is equal to the shoot.
Thanks to the restart system, it does not make it anymore, and it's not always bad.
The restarts are so solved: if you have total damage or far beyond the path, then a game returns to the last point of maintenance of the trails.
Only - in every rent you have only five restarts.
If you're exploded her, everything's going out of front...
So the restarts are more than one of the helpers, for the case that something doesn't happen, but that shouldn't be left.
Sometimes, however, it is not helping the restart, but it helps nothing else than learning the critical section from the head.
It is unacceptable that the same things often happen to the same places.
Some curves, for example, need to be conducted in a very specific way, otherwise not.
Otherwise, on the corresponding place of "vivil" cars, it is always in the same configuration, unlike if you come as first or five seconds before or a minute later.
This is especially in situations when you see that the tangent goes in front of a playing two cars, but until it comes there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to run or brem.
And it is unlikely when you get there, everything is so designed that it is always close to this situation before your neck.
The contractors have further benefits.
In the whole game there are some places where you will always be obtained in the same place from the same enemy and also here without look at the time.
The most crazy thing is to end the game on the long bridge that happens in opposition.
The constraint must clearly overcome a devil here.
And when he's just a while before, then he takes a view of, of course, that's how he starts to run his own car a few times in the garbage.
Clar - you want to make the game easier and emphasis, but this is so clear that it's quick to lose the joy in the game.
And this is harmful, because despite the simpler drive model, the game is totally maintained right and also loaded as actions that you almost don't know where one is.
And in principle, it's different, what "fault" is - the concept with 50 unique routes, the arrangement of costs in a way that it can not be long-term, or something else...
A inhabited idea is also the switch of cars in the course of the rents.
You can't see the tank devices on the road, because just here you can change the car, although in most cases the car is sufficient to you just have.
The cars are divided in three categories.
Sport cars are good for the urban areas, the strong American limousins for the simple cars and exotic super-sports for the technical drivers, for example, to the Serpentine in the mountain.
Hand in hand with the game history is also the task mode (requirements) - so the wages in the individual locations that you know from the history.
There is not only medailles but also experience points for the own profile, which is commonly for the tasks (defits) and the history.
In order to reach the higher driver level, different objects must be closed: start from the car to the backward for the profile.
This is simultaneously linked to the online autolog, which compares the results made by other players, and also provides for further collective functions.
One of the other incomprehensive skins is a situation in the last time of the history.
Indeed, here you go in a U-Bahn tunnel (minuteways), where you are raised on the dark sides (minuteways).
On the Tacho View quotes between 150 and 200 km/h (minute ways), but there comes at once from the bottom of a U and leads a compromiss to Schrott.
In our editor, we'll still be striving about whether it was a blackout of the player or whether the authors keep us so busy.
The technical page is nothing overwhelming, but at least the visual total impression is right in most cases and even brilliant.
It is worse that in some slowly moments the image holistic frequency becomes slower and this is very dramatic.
However, this concerns rather the accidents with greater numbers of participants, where one of the continued FPSs does not use anything.
The tonning is so far as O.K. and the sound track is sweet.
In order to talk to a scale as far as possible young publishers, a sound track in there was "of any thing" - but who's buying a game already because of the music?!
The total impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are most mixed.
If the game would not fail by the total unnecessary errors mentioned, we could be able to observe with the Brustton of the conviction that The Run is the best part of NFS in the last few years.
But that's how the game works somewhere unfortunate.
A classic enjoyment for you, but you should be prepared for this error with the power of aircraft shops in the eyes.

Vicenova:
The Czechs have the call of negative and Euroskeptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has felt the balance among the individual institutions."
I wouldn't expect that such a hard war was broken."
"It will be five, six years old, until the residences were entered, and all have been resigned to their new role", began Milena Vicenova, Tschechian embassy at the European Union, rightly put their discussion at the Juristical Faculty.
As they seriously take the moto " comprehensive and openly over Europe", it already showed in the first part of their talk, in which they had been able to describe the individual bodies of the EU and their mutual relations to such an overviewable and comprehensive way that some of the legal factors of the university of Karls could soon be affected.
Ms. Vicenov also welcomed the new permanent President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy:
"In the beginning he was criticized that he was to be unexpected - a green official who has not grown such a role, but I have to say that it's all shut up the breath as he well accepted the thing.
"He is a person who has finished listening patiently to seventy Member States, to communicate with them and who has particularly clear ideas about how it should continue with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for External Affairs and Security Policy then explained as an answer to the question: Who is this, actually the European Union? what number I call?", therefore, as an important step to enhance EU policy towards States such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us our oil-dood quarter.
Ms. Vicenová also urged the agenda, according to which the European Union lived, to remember and to live in a close future.
The Czech Presidency of two years ago called it successful.
The Czechs would have measured the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also held the Summit for Eastern Partnership.
The case of the Government during the presidency, it was called a great Negativum, which has dealt with the image of the Czech Republic.
Czech Republic in the EU has to do all the hands now.
With the words of the messenger, it was not only to the presidency, but also to the following crisis that has not yet been surprised until now.
And there is still a need to be approved by the EU's seven-year budget, which makes the matter so much more complicated because of today's economic situation.
If it will be a slight and disadvantaged budget, which economic priorities, which countries are more and less promoted - all of this is now on the agenda.
The messanger also reminds her own slogan with which she came to Brussels: "Only understand about Europe".
"If I don't like anything, then there are green crowds, foreign words and specialists that no one understands.
As citizens, how I really should know whether in Brussels it is really cruel or round and different large bananas, or if someone really wants to prohibit us the quarter.
It would also be pleased to use the EU's land to obtain more Czechs in European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds
In view of the EU's Ombudsman, the Czechs are called to be Euroskeptics, which are more negative than the positive sides of the matter.
Indeed, the weak delegation of Czechs in European institutions is worse.
Thus many factors are responsibilities, including the refusal of our candidates, whose incapacity to write motivation letters and not lastly the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she also expressed the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, as well as V4.
"Cree to me if a Poland or Hungary comes to me and a slowake is near me, then the Francois says to me: "Hello, what are you shutting together with the heads - this is your V4 again?" and it makes a very sweet mine.
Mrs Vicenove, in the future, the EU is expecting to have strong rules for the budgetary policy of Member States.
As much more real than a 'European Federation', it looks at the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
"We have the countries of the euro zone and the countries outside the euro area.
"We have the Schengen room and we already have the institution of a improved cooperation."
"In the first time, it was said that only countries should cooperate with which they want and those who do not want to be quiet."
"They will give more institutions of such institutions, which finally goes out of a strong "Europe of different speeds"," Ms. Vicenova expects.
In this regard, she also acknowledged the role of the Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuyes in implementing the principle, in accordance with all the topics of the EU with effect on all Member States and not only by the countries of the euro area.
Brand History:
The Innovator IBM enters its existence in the second century.
If you are looking for a suitable word that the IBM's strategy characterizes the most accurate characterized, then this would be the word "Langeliness".
For the wide publicity, IBM is the synonym of technological revolution, you know it as modern companies, although since its creation has already been established a century.
The basis for this long life has already been her first chief – the Visionary Thomas J. Watson Sen.
Soon he put the slogan to solve a number of global problems when people are ready to think a little.
His slogan "Think" was so marked to play the life of the future guingers (and simultaneously to the title of the vast internal magazines that were started to be issued at IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of the business culture prepared by Waters.
"For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous movement in direction towards the future.
IBM survived and, therefore, was successful in the whole century, because it remained faithful to his principles and did not be afraid to change all the other ring sums.
This allows us to transform technologies, business and society during our first century.
We hope we can create more in the next hundred years," said Samuel J. Palmisano, today's director of the company from Jubilaum.

Watson has already employed social responsibilities in the three-third years of his employees - in similar way, as the employee Baśa in the Czechoslowakei: IBM was a vacation paid as one of the first American employees, an insurance by the employees more elegant units than workshops, and a surprising relocation system for the best newers and handlers.
Similarly, IBM's long-term relationships are also excited with its customers.
The company had been generous in Talendar Promotion - as one of the first enterprises worldwide, IBM blew any discrimination, and was able to look out.
In accordance with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan, which Palmisan is changed at the IBM's sight in the next year of a woman - from Virginia Romatty.
It has been about thirty years at IBM, until then she took the position of the Vetrieb, Marketing and Strategy Chef.
IBM has grown in the past few future strategies and innovations.
No wonders - there are no ideas enough, there is almost a half million employees in the company.
A institution with good call
Your unfair position in business guarantees the company a strong image and this after inside and outside.
"In the beginning, IBM had the concept of a institution than a blue technological enterprises", said the economist professor of Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Canter.
"IBM is no technology enterprises, but a company helps resolve business problems using technologies", adds George Colony from Consultating Company Forrester Research.
As the company itself emphasizes, it is a difference to be presented on the market or to form it directly by this presence.
IBM - in the States of their logos called "Big Blue" is grown to one of the largest companies of the world in a century.
It is one of the most diversified technology enterprises - IBM developed hardware and software, infrastructures, hosting and consultation services in an incredible product width - from servers to nano technology.
IBM has the majority of patents and five of its employees with the Nobel price.
For example, bank automobiles, credit cards, financial wave, strike code or even the discs.
With approximately $220 billion, IBM has been the second largest technologie enterprises (such as after Apple), which has been overlooked the first time since 1996 Microsoft.
Previous view
Not all products and innovations found the shock of customers today - unfortunately, for example, have tried with the own operating system OS/2, the online service Prodigy or also the IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on the previous movement, so you should not be emotionally binding to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore IBM has no problem to build its basic machines on different platforms - and if they do not work to leave them again.
On the contrary to the Microsoft player, which is in principle with its operating system Windows.
Successful technology
The profits of IBM are largely involved in services, software and hardwares at each time.
In 1990, Hardware was represented with more than 50% of the most strongest share.
Since 2000, IBM has made little profits in the value of $15 billion, but in the same time, it was $58 billion in the purchase of new technology.
In these investments, IBM continues after 2008 when the current financial crisis was the first time as a storm over the world.
The IBM also remained faithful to his first Chief Thomas J. Watson, who increased its investment level in the large economic crisis.
It seems that the company IBM is inevitablely exceeding today's crisis.
The value of IBM shares increased by 2008 by 120 per cent and the resettlement of the company continued to grow.
The IBM company log says: everything can change - only the values are not.
It should therefore be expected that this flexible guigant is also the next crisis.
IBM history: from shoes to world-wide flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines) founded over a hundred years ago had a rightly complex name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was only 1924 - originally a mark name for a delay in Canada and South America.
The basic stone for the later society IBM was the fusion of four companies whose history was rewarded until the 80th century.
They include technologies, such as the famous cards for registration of the start and end of the work.
Charles Ranlett Flint, who had also been in the Supervisory Council until 1930.
And it was Flint who established the chief of the competitor company Thomas J. Watson to help him the company's leadership.
This leader even put the founders of IBM in the shadows - based on Watson's ideas until today the unacceptable culture and identity of the company.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, starting as the name has been, with the manufacture and the driving of all possible machines for the trade - from wood and swimming swimming machines, to the box.
In the first four decades in which Watson led the company, he doubled its shares to nine million dollars and expanded the company after and after all the continents.
Watson was so inconsistent for the company that he was sit in the chief for all fourty years, then he was dissolved from his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
The IBM began working on the development of art intellectuality and also developed the first programing language.
In the 1960s, technicians and computers of NASA's IBM helped flights to lead to all - to Mercur and Saturn and in 1969 also the famous human flight to the moon.
In addition, IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture, the number of IBM system/360.
A classic PC that determined the computer standard at that time came in 1981 under the name IBM 5150 on the market.
Twenty years later, IBM announced his computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, and otherwise, she purchased the advisory part of the Price Water Coopers company and involved a higher value in the business with consulting services and services.
The Strategy, which is paying IBM in the past three years, is the concept "Smarter Planet".
It is intended to fully implement technologies in areas that have not yet been planned, for example to improve the situation in the transport and in the city management.
In the trade sector, IBM introduced the "Smarter Commerce" platform that would help the handlers to lead to the whole commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in Czech.
Shortly 1932 IBM founded a delay in the current Czechslovakia, as a first country in the Middle-East and Eastern Europe.
Today IBM is a strategic outsourcing centre in Brussels, among others.
The Central for Middle and Eastern Europe is located in Praga, and there is also a top research team of the world level, which is the technology of voting.
Darina Rychtáová about its unfaithful gates:
Iveta, you can keep this slee, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rychtáova (53) says - now it's close!
After her wife Josef Rychtá (53) was become the protector of Iveta Bartošova (45), Darina remained the hope that Josef was waiting from his rosed dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patientity, and for the further life it has made clear rules.
"Joseph can go home, but not more than my partner," said D. Rychtáóva.
When Darina Rychtáṣṭova of the Single I. Bartošova offered refugee in their own house, you wouldn't have been in dream as it appears to your husband.
When Iveta turned out to her drought 30 days and returned to the śíčany, Josef went along with him.
He even known that he loved them.
With the time called Darina, yeah, it seems even if she wanted to turn back with her unfaithful man - but now she finally gave him the pass.
Rychytan is wrong with whom his wife sleeps
If Iveta Bartochová should leave in the future, then he will receive no open arms home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, then I will not leave him."
"But not as a loved, disappointed old shoes, but as a man to whom I have a certain bond," Mrs. Rychtáṣṭova replied; but she also said that she has already been emotionally separated from him and best on mutual responsibilities.
The condition that Darina has locked him the door, Josef has brought him with a dignity until now.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'm staying together with Iveta, nothing changes."
"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect it."
"The company continues to run, I care about the repairs, the garden, the basement, I make the purchase."
"My Darina has me very normally, only we do not share the bed," said J. Rychtáś (the Blatt) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he doesn't want to prevent them.
"We don't sleep with each other, so it's not me if she has a friend or who it is.
I'm clear that this is my fault, I loved me in Iveta, and therefore I take any responsibility.
The worst women injuries: How is it with you?
If the men are invited to call some typical women's injuries, they will soon protect some of them from the smell.
Love Women, can you recognise again in the following lines where we leave a few unsettled revues that let men get the blood into the Adrens?
Securities
Do they want to be shopping?
Should you buy at least one hair weekly?
Do you like to buy and can it be a little more at actions?
Then it's probably really about a weakness in your case.
Some women are at least conscious of it and try to keep their purchase loss halfways under control.
But hand on the heart, which woman already seems to swim by searching for a good sit-sized up-level only through a clothing business and not to try all of them (in all possible color combinations) in the box?
Even if the purchase is a hobby for most women, for men it is often the clean hell.
You know, they're gonna think about how many times she's told her husband - you're gonna be more liked to be outside...
Permanent inadequacy
"Don't I be too tick?"
"I should take at least five kilos - I'm going to start joking or making gymnastic?"
"I'm going to get you?"
Does that happen to them?
Yeah?
Then you must also be part of women who are regularly grateful of how they look.
This does not mean that you should leave, but many men react allergicly when their wife's appearance constantly hurts her appearance.
The stronger sex is unique - with the increased frequencies of complaints are always more than women.
Order and cleanness at first place
It's a fight against wind moulds.
Lay the window, flows and stairs, shooting the waves - and this is at least two times in the week.
Shut up with her partner because he's shocking again on the sweet shoes, you shoot the kids, because the shocked shoes is back and the glass door has a shock of fingers at the living room, where the police makes so much swimming?
If you suffer under this kind of "Devianz", then you should know that you can overcome nothing and the order and cleanness in family life is not first place.
This unprecedented cleaning filling may finally harm the mutual relationships and, above all, the peace in the family.
Tags
"Smiths of turbulents come in the wheat corb."
"Do you really want to take the old sucks tomorrow?"
"A naked hand tuck is not just on the footsteps."
If your partner is exhibited such a tirad, you should not be wondering that this brings him to the palm.
Well, it's not bad, but they just want to do what's his order.
If the men know that, then the women may not need to smoke so much.
Classic and Tratsch
Some women smell and sweet, where they are cut behind or cut down or smiling shoes.
Women are now focused on relationships, so they are pleased to discuss such issues, such as - who, where, with whom, why and why.
Even if each of us have a little harmless class and trace on shopping.
Hand on your heart - it's probably all women own.
However, this is not to change with classists the greatest calibrators who are not holy and no one, who are probably all in their environment and represents a significant risk for women's collectives.
Yagr and Preáček help Philadelphia with their assistants to win
The Eishockey Tower Jaromír Yagr had two assistants in the Monday game with a large part of the 5,3-See of Philadelphia on the iron in Carolina, and is re-productive Czechic players in the NHL.
As a result of the overview of the ninety-year-old Eishockeystars, there was two cases of Clude Giroux, who added an assistantness and was called to the best player of the matchs.
Two assistants in the same game also signed Yagr's player Jakub Voráček.
Yagr observed after the game journalists, he had Giroux a great night prophecy.
"After the game, I'm telling him that he's a hattrick today."
I had some feelings."
"It and again overcome such a feeling," Yagr explained, after which Giroux action had reached a gate at the first shoot of the Flyers.
A few later, the second traffer also had "one Czechian scene".
Preáček struggled behind the gate of the Hurricane and put it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
A second prior to the post of the first third, the home player Patrick Dwyer reached a Short-Hander, but the second third belonged to the Flyers again.
Concrete Giroux.
In cooperation with Yagr, he reached his third quarter, and then Wayne Simmonds led his shoes to the fourth gate.
"I love it to play with him."
"I don't want to say he is the best player of the liga, but he will belong to the best three," Yagr acknowledged his centers.
"I wouldn't be in life that I would play together with a eishockey player as with him."
"I'm so happy."
"I'm shutting my game on me."
"All the years in the NHL, my players put their game on me and now turned the smell towards me," Yagr smuggled.
Carolina made a game to the Drama - through the trapper of Tuma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who was sent out of a crime shooting, came to a gate.
But Matt Read prevented any further complication in which he was in overwhelming two against a success.
"Assigned prongers still acted in our area."
"He learned the pocket, I took driving up and (Read) moved to remove phoses."
"I tried to meet him and I am glad that it's shut up", wrote Preáček the last part of the party from his view.
With this victory, Philadelphia was placed on the spot of the Eastern Conference.
The Tschechian players of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček were injured in the game against Buffalo and, in the second third, screamed because of an injury on the top body.
The Candians also learned their leadership in the Penalty shoot 2:3.
One of the committees could not change Tomáš Plekanec.
More than the lost points paind the train of the homemanship the high conditioning defects in the defence - the game was just finished with five players.
"It's bad."
"We just played with a experienced player at the end, the rest were young players."
"But there is nothing to do so we need to end up," said Jacques Martin.
"As every channel, we had nothing to do with the other."
"We had to make the game easier and take the pocket out of our third."
There was still reservations," said P. K. Subban, one of the players.
The Tchechian Torust Ondśej Pavelect shocked thirty shoes from Tampa Bay and took part in the 5:2 seat over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the Jet, who completed a series of five shoes, had five different shoes.
Development of travel prices since 1989
By 1989 only five government travel offices were allowed in the event of CKM, Recrea and Autotourist.
The travel offices then sold only travels to the socialist Eastern Block countries, which were currently selected in the west.
And so Czechian tourists travel to the East Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - the DDR), in the Soviet Union (Sotsi on the half of the Crim on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary at the Balaton.
A light exemption was the period from 1962 to 1972, when you were able to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia entered a foreign course, and therefore the journeys were strongly restricted to Yugoslavia.
A great paradox of socialist times was that there was no one eligible citizens of the Eastern Block (and also the Czechslowakens) to travel free in the context of the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of ŠSSR wanted to travel to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he needed such a letter of invitation, otherwise individual travels could not be possible.
Soon the travel offices also offered travels to the western, but they had to purchase huge skins or even pass in the bed sack before the travel office, or at least have "good known" in the travel office.
That's how it wasn't done for a long time.
The so-called adjustment - the condition of a travel in the West - was only distributed "politically reliable" people - the others were not going to travel.
In fact, the Czech Republican currency was not freely overwhelming currency, so it would have not been possible to get the necessary financial resources (which currency) for a travel to the western.
The vast majority of the Czechs therefore carried out their holidays in the country, no wonder that the Czechs purchased several weekend houses and dates - a habit that is up to this day.
The same revolution of 1989 followed a re-evolution of the Czechs on the foot.
While a vacation in the DDR or Bulgaria had been the measure of all things, the Czechs past 4.5 million in the past year of their foreign holidays in countries of the whole world.
A magnificent paradox, which is not yet aware of today, is the fact that you were not able to travel in the current popular vacation country of Czech - Croatia until 1989, because it was part of the current Yugoslavia.
As since the beginning of the last century, the obligation of the responsibilities was taken to the nearby Western European countries, which renewed a great wave of short visits, especially after Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Czechslovakias could not just get enough from their travels to the West, everyone wanted to have been there at least a few days.
Thus, the Czech holidays were living at travellers to Paris in the park, because whoever had already had the money for a accommodation in the hotel or in a pension.
A typical feature at foreign journeys of Czech was then one with conservation, beer and duration, etc. full packed copper room.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the twenty-sixth Czechic Crone - our tourists finally could purchase the Western currency.
Our level of life and this also increased the average rates in 1997, which was another important moment.
With the increased demands of travel, travel offices began to regularly prepare traveling after 1997 by charter flights, which was incredibly able to treat quantitative discussions, compared to the past.
Finally, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, had already unreasonable payment traffic with all the high-developed countries in the world, which made the journey easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of the "post-center" travel movement in 2000, thanks to the high demand of the first direct flight to a exotic country - to Thailand.
Sither flights every year direct charter flights with Czechese passengers in far away sunlands; this year, it is direct from Czech 12 exotic destinations.
To the 100th Czechs every year travel to exotic countries!
Another important moment in the epoch that marked our "post revolutionary" development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States made the visa obligations for Czechian tourists, which finally engaged our country in the world's high-developed countries.
In 2008 the Czechs first passed over half of their holidays in the foreign (50.3%) and gave them the first time in their history for the only holiday stay, including the costs in the holiday place more than 15 cm. CZK per head.
The main Assembly is to find a new chairman - again threatens a patent.
Soon about five months ago, the Czech football did not have a chairman and threatens that the followers of Ivan Hašek will not even be known after the extraordinary main meeting on Thursday in Nymbuk.
Until today, there is no agreement on which election regulation should be chosen.
And without this, no vote on the three potential followers is possible.
Three interests want to manage the Czech football - Jindčich Rajchl, Miroslav Pella and Tomáš Paclík.
In June Hašek returned from his function, when he asked his colleagues to find some and a strong personality that could lead to the football in the future.
Only - in the time of Hašek, the old crowns reaffirmed the two associations chambers that can't be on a common candidate.
This showed slight and clear on 16 September when the new Chairman should be selected.
The delegates of the main Assembly had come to the People's House in the Prayer Quartal Smichov, because the negotiation had not resulted, and it was not only about the choice itself.
Indeed, some of them were not able to have the right to be in the full assembly - only the post-representative representatives or also the officials who have a full force.
At the same time, at least part, a agreement was reached, including the recommendation of the State and Law Institute, which is not an independence in the opinion of a full power-based delegation.
However, the strictness towards the election order continues to be accepted.
The Executive Committee also did not have any clarity to the matter at which meetings - unlike ordinary or extraordinary - are in principle nothing else in the agenda.
Even if the views on the election several times changed - the neuralgical point remained the same.
The question is: how should you go in 3th round to avoid a pat situation?
"The point of struggle relates to the question whether to be taken in accordance with the statute or whether a whole model is to be found", stated Dušan Svoboda, one of the three stakeholders of the FAśR, who are in the management of the Professionsball.
According to an overwhelming model, the third round of this candidate, which receives the largest percentual support in the room for which it is candidated.
Mothers are willing to accept the compromise that the candidate is assigned to receiving the higher number of votes from two rooms.
The Czech side reiterates the condition that the winner receives at this percentage of styms at least one secondary level.
"And the two fronts have no sense any more, this mode would ask the whole two chamber concept", understands Svoboda's expenses of the marine side, which is at the best moment, not to add the election order, but to choose, according to a valid sentence.
It is surprising to Tomáš Paclík, even though it is claimed that the suppressional election regulation of all candidates is most likely to be taken by Pella.
"My desire is that the most widely selected after the date."
"In order to not be invented innocent substitution variables, as in the last meeting," the owner (the football club) Victoria Plześ explained, who was first candidated and circled in his opinions, especially against Pelta.
But it's still optimistic.
In Nymbuk, he believes that the candidates will also cooperate constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the National Manager for the football-EM today would be safely contributed to swallowing the farmers."
"When the football is only on the euphoric wave, then the ready for cooperation is larger", means Jablonec official, who shares the greatest experiences of all three adeptes, and this is both at professional and regional level.
Rajchl is worse there.
"I hope to agree, but the situation is unfortunately. "
"This is nothing between the people of evil and mood, but there are some efforts to "allow" the rules for their own purposes.
"There is not excluded by a renewed blocking at the main meeting."
"But I hope that the healthy human mind finally sees", said Rajchl.
Only - a lot of time to accept all sides is not left.
Some negotiations should be played directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether football generation will be completely complete to the qualification game.
The charter flight, which, among other Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl to Podgorice, would not start in Praga for a technical disaster and, as you were looking for a substitution variable, as a part of the executive committee still to the location of the barrige game.
Finally, the meeting on the ministerial level is decisive for which it is intended to come at midnight.
Josef Dobeš, Minister for Schools, Youth and Learning, would like to move the shared parties in the largest sports partnership of the country.
Indeed, it is much on the game: public applications, the confidence of the Czech football, and also the leading main gap of STV, which will lead to the Czech Sport in accordance with the financial problems of Sazka.
Pacific is in the struggle for the position of the Chairman, because he does not see appropriate candidates
If Tomáš Paclík, the chief of the footballers before the extraordinary main Assembly, could have made a strong candidate who had completed all his views on the new Chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAśR), would never have taken place in the fight for this pitting position.
"If I gave it a good advertiser, I would fight for him and reject the choice."
"But in the current situation, it was not possible to find such an adeptee," said Pacific.
The main foundation for Pacific to go with Miroslav Pella and Jindčich Rajchl, therefore, is to prevent the appropriate preferences of the choice, Pella, at the top of the FAśR.
Pacific also stressed that, in the case of his victory, he is only in mind of the function of the Chairman, that is, until 2013, until the end of the General Assembly.
In the position of the Chairman, he would like to see a learning top manager that has not yet been cut into the football.
"I have talked personally about some of the people in question."
"To believe that some say to me they did not want to identify with the Czech football.
"Solch views would like to change", he moved.
In most cases, Pacific is able to link Pelta's with the President of the Pillner of the Central Coal Group, Roman Berbr, a man with controversial call that applies behind the cultures as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to influence delegated votes on major congregations.
For Pacific, it is unacceptable for this reason that Pelta had the position of the President.
"In his victory, the today's condition would be conservated, and in the Czech football it wasn't going to pass."
"The support by Berbr, a clever businessman, is doubled to the football," emphasized Pacific.
He also argued that Pelta's name had fallen in a corruption case before some time in connection with telephone hearings.
"I don't know what a victory of Pelta should bring to the (t.e.) football."
"And as we would be in the eye of the EUFA and FIFA," said Palík, whose previous exhibition, "he will sell the Pillner football club if Pella will be chaired," but it's still a little left.
If Pacific would be blessed at Thursday, however, he could present a future cooperation with Pella.
He also thinks of another candidate - Rajchl, who supported the Pacific before the main congregation in October, which ended with a Fiasko.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to which I would go."
"He has great ability."
"I could show him well, for example, as the Chief of the National Employment."
"For I don't believe he was able to lead the association as a manager."
"I do not put my nase in matters where I do not understand anything," said Paclick, who was careful in September that he was replaced by the Scheed Directorate Commission with Luśk Macela on the sight of Dagmar Damkova.
Pacific itself succeeds that he feels the role of the President of the Association.
And it is about his ability to lead private companies, since last summer, he is also head of Pilsen, who has celebrated the first triumph in the Liga with his support in May.
"I have the power to change something in the football million and to contribute to a certain culture of this."
"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups that tend to affect discipliners and professional committees, which seems to be in current situations," Pacific pointed out that no healing from his antipathy, for example towards the Head of Spirta Daniel Kśetínský.
As one of his priorities, he looked at the establishment of the relationships between the FAṣṭR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the assistance to the political sponsor policy, that more money from the lottery tax is flowing in the sport.
"This is one of the decisive things that the new Chairman should take place."
"If it comes to control plays of happiness, how political parties declare, I understand their arguments, but then they must also be clamped and clearly telling where the money goes", he said.
His link to the Pillner Club also does not look as a handicap, although he himself stresses, the Chairman of the FAōR should be "transparence".
Pelta again is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl with the Dukla Prayer.
"This is not just ideal."
"But my opinion does not mean much to transfer my shares in the Pillner Club to a third person to return back for a half years," said Pacific.
Pella promised new positions of the FAśR to exclude a Pat situation in the future.
Two days before the main Assembly of the football Association, one of the candidates spoke to the President, Miroslav Pella, will make himself strong in the case of his choice that the FAṣṭR will receive new statues that will be excluded in the future on the rule of choice of previously agreed.
The official of Jablonec is reliable before the Nymbuk nymbuk nymbuk nymbuk's negotiations and believes that the election campaign will be safely renewed in a possible success of the Czech election.
Pelta had promised that before the non-exercised election in September, he wanted to concentrate on the national authorities and the profit of financial resources in the case of his election.
He just decided to participate in the last moment before the last meeting, and so he wanted to help the two-month pause to defend his proposals about the guide of the football and present in a broader context.
"Only at all levels are the football, they are indulgent and therefore expected that the Chairman is known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is the highest time that the association is leaded to someone, is the man who is particularly connected to the Jablonecer club, but who also acted in Sparta and in the Executive Committee for many years.
He also believes that he has enough experiences to lead to the Czech football.
He is convinced that the Euphorie is responsible for today's problems with the choice, which was dominated at times by Ivan Hašek.
"The leaders were approved at the Headquarters in June, which were not as perfect as they were all accepted.
If they had not allowed various discussions, we had already been a chairman from September,” said Pelta.
In addition to the revision of the most important document of the civilian organization, he used as a lock for the delegates.
"If I'd be chairman, then I'm taking it personally and I'm willing to take personal responsibility if it doesn't hurt."
"This is a principle matter without which he can't be", says Pella.
In addition, he does not try to limit himself to his contractors.
Soon before he had announced that he could represent a cooperation with Jindčich Rajchl that he recognises for his legal education and knows well that his opposite would be his first vice-president.
Also, Tomáš Paclík wasn't shocking for a long time, which left no sweet fadens on Pella.
In the football, he moves over a year and can already be shown by certain successes."
"But his attacks were decreased and many were shocked by his election campaign."
"There are now many doubts of his true character," he addressed his opposers, who probably remain faithful to his proclamations that he has already expressed in September.
His opinion is that his strongest weapons are the knowledge of the football from the lower game classs, until the nationality.
And this should be Czechish footballs.
"I would also try to end all the affairs - from the Bohemian Cause, to the posts of the corruption kandal last year."
"Please then, I would spend on negotiations with the private and public sector to ensure sufficient financial resources for the whole football," said the candidate s.TK.
Thus he also promised that his access to the twenty-five ball would not mean personal sanctions.
"I should be aware of the content of the work of all employees once," he said in direction of Strahov, where it understood nervousity because of the long anarchie.
Despite the present catastrophic scenarios that join the main congregation, he believes that the delegates are not going to Nymbuk on Thursday.
"If you really should be the only strict point, how you choose in the third round, then we'll go through it."
"The football needs credibility and the wins only when he finally has a new leader," Pella remains two days before the possible day of his functionary career's best.
Rajchl promises to start working hard under him
If the previous Chairman Jindčich Rajchl should be selected at the main meeting on Thursday to the new Chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, this would likely be the laune of many people in the Association.
Rajchl promises to start working hard in the case of his choice.
He wants to introduce system changes and responsible for members of the Executive Committee for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the case of Bohemians to improve the relationship with the EUFA and FIFA, to bring more money into the football, and to continue to work that Ivan Hašek began before.
"The Chairman, I want to spend the football as a whole."
Starting from the international contacts to EUFA and FIFA, through the national selection, the professional football, towards the performance ball for young people."
"I don't want to say that I want to do everything alone," said Rajchl in the conversation for ¶TK.
"I am a team player and I would therefore like to distribute the competences in the Executive Committee so that each member is a certain area."
And I will distribute hard tasks so that the football will be forwarded in each segment with milk strips."
Moreover, many would not just be comfortable because they, instead of criticize the work of others, should now really start working hard now," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, it has not yet been considered to candidate.
"for me it is known that I work for 20 hours on day."
"And I have to know that it makes sense and that people stand behind me who do not cut a knife between the skins and any step I ask", he said as a statement why he has delayed.
"My people told me that I don't have to stop because others would do it."
"This is confidence that you can't play," he said.
It also motivates him to continue to work that he started under Hašek.
"In two years, we have worked a large part of work, and I don't just want to get away."
"It's been started processes that were probably just in a few years and I would just see that she stopped someone," he said, and he expressed his concerns that for the case the other candidate - Miroslav Pella would choose to return the situation in the times before Haschek.
"I believe in systematic action, and this is something that Mirec Pella doesn't bring."
"Besides him, mostly people who would do so the football that he would only be selected there."
I must be able to predict some, but not that I'm partial."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want football for all, because then it's all good and not only the chosen," said Rajchl.
He also opposes the statement that he is only a Chairman of Czechs.
"Only if some people say the opposite, I really have to do the best possible for mare."
"For example, it is time to overcome whether the link should not be shared in a Czechian and Moriar part, whose winners will then get up to the first liga."
"And it couldn't happen that only three marine clubs today play in the liga, which is especially a problem for young players in mare," says Rajchl.
Because also the Chief of the Pillner Club Tomáš Paclík has joined the function of the Chairman, Rajchl does not believe to evaluate his opportunities to be chosen.
"I am promising a strong support in the Czech room, which has chosen me to their present President and now recognizes that clear successes are behind me," Rajchl replied, which also seeks the allocation of zig million chrones for unfair contracts, the agreement of televisory contracts and the negotiations on the Lotterie Act as a success.
On the other hand, it is the responsibilities that the association is not at a single point.
While he says from Pelta, "he is previously disqualificated to help the Czech football to new confidence," he holds the second rivals - Pacific for a strong candidate that really offered the football.
"Nobody can ask that he did a great job in Piles in only one year."
"If he was elected, then he would certainly continue the things that Ivan Hašek has led and also the personal condition in the Commission would not be to change basically."
He would not certainly want to give the things to his favors," Rajchl judges about his rivals.
Europe's best Pools
Spring in blue
From Julia Stanek
Plants in Ufo-Optics, Prunkpools in Budapest: who travels through Europe can experience its blue wonders - and after a city tour or a change, the murdered skins in spudel trees.
A book shows where Wellness is in the water most beautiful.
When Iris Meder went to search travel in the past half a year, one in her bathroom was not missing.
Returned on the water, she looked high in artificially shocked balls, smiling marmor poulters that were waiting at the board, and surprised by acribically restored young sleeves.
Having filled a bath, she took it into her notebook - with aware details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools learned architectural historian Meder in this way - and now put it in their book of "Badefreity" in its just appearance: people's swimming halls in Munchen, historical bathrooms in the blackwald, "Hardcore beton builders" in Taunus.
Through 13 countries, she traveled to the most extreme farms in Mediterranean: in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and everywhere in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a real Badeculture Enthusiasm.
With sports, she doesn't have much on the hot, says Meder - only in the water is different.
Nevertheless, swimmphans have to be discovered with blue cachel and chlorge stain, while Jogger can take the devastating duft of fifty trees or pleasant bird witchers in the park.
"I asked me a day, why the powders really have to be so angry," they say in Vienna.
"And I began to collect beautiful boats."
Water surface double architecture
Plastics in the spring bath and atheric sauna-oils - the wellness factor in baths is so large that all the sense are sweet, so meder.
And when the manufacturers have made up the efforts, the swings can be a real eye shock: "Instead of a footland, you have got a water surface on the grounds."
"He is aware, but reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubles optically: high cotton, swimming cakes, spring bridge.
The small formatting band "Badefreuden" offers knowledge on 190 pages about the historical and cultural history of wellness - but in particular it makes it lust to a pleasant in blue.
Remarkable exemplaries found the pool sammler meder in Hungary with their research.
In addition to the 100 years of old Szechenyi bathroom in Budapest, they found a nitrate water in an emergency cart height (hedgebad in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath, whose baths are filled with alcalized water, and are located in a flavory building (Varosi Termalforde in Yaszbereny).
Instead, spectacular views offer many swimming farms in Switzerland and Austria: While you have the whole city in the eye, you can view the swimming arberberg in St. Anton and: there is a window where you can observe the skin on the ski camp.
The most extremely pool design may be expected to be bathrooms in the long field: The Aquadome Occidental looks like a right in the Alpen Ufo.
From three to top open shoes it is in winter, while in the background, the mountains of the Oriente swimming in the heavens.
Alhambra in Black Wald
Not in any swimming powder, the pool sammler was growing in the snake of clor in the nase.
Many thermal bottles rise to Swefel, in the Arpád bath in the Hungarian Bekescsaba, it is so strong to heiz oil that you're not believed to be located in a health bath.
The grain comes from the alkali-hydrocarbon hydrocarbon water, which is almost black and its slick is clothing on the skin when you can swim into the skin - a Wellness experience of the special type.
However, Iris Meder was also shocked at her search for beautiful bathrooms: When she wanted to visit the free and sunbad in the Tschech Bad Luhatschowitz, she found an outstanding terrain.
The 1902 Architecte Dušan Jurkovic created Bad was closed here.
When meder saw a shocked window of the red-wheeled young-style buildings, she saw how unwait was broken between the streams.
However, the fall was affected in a magnificent swimming pool in the black wood: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three construction phases have already been behind this bathroom; discovery can not only be found only Neromanic elements that are in the time of its establishment in 1844, but also a Maurice Hall in the Alhambra style added to 1900.
Since the 1995 careful modernization, the Palais thermal has been the favorite bathroom of the Pool-Cenerine Iris Meder, and it is not only because it was originally out of the black wood.
"It's already a performance to swim so different construction styles to such a great unit," said Meder.
With such a palace, the smoking in the thermal pool is clearly only the next case.
Advanced Speculation
German bank allows to switch raw material business
From Christian Teevs
The German Bank has its business with agricultural products?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has employed a working group to check the consequences of the speculation for the poor world.
In January the Concert will then take consequences.
Hamburg -
For the federal citizens, the matter is clear: 84 per cent of the Germans find it not acceptable that banks with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or mass are shown.
Two thirds of the questionnaires are required to increase the German Bank and other credit institutions from this business because it causes the problems of the doctors of the world.
This is the result of a Forsa investigation under the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch Middle October.
The author Harald Schumann shows that the laws on the world's raw material burdens take the prices into the height and therefore the banks have a debt to the world's hunger problem.
The campaign of consumer protectors is directed against German Bank Chief Josef Ackermann, even if large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are similar.
Originally, raw material laws were thought to decrease handlers against price changes.
However, the majority of experts agree that the zoockers have settled from offers and demands, and make their benefits on the costs of the doctors.
Unlike the United States Concurrents, Ackermann reacted to the criticism: he promised to review the precursors and said that no business was valued to put the good call of German banks on the game.
According to the information of SPIEGEL ONLINE, a international working group currently examines the preserves of the Foodwatch report.
To the end of the year the test will be concluded, then the results will be presented to the director of the German Bank, as well as the recommendation for the implementation of this.
By the end of January, the bank's spectrums will then inform the consequences of the bank.
Finally, a reduction of the raw material business may be, or even the complete decrease.
Ackermann bastels on his image
Foodwatch Chief Thilo Bode welcomed the message, but also confirmed its criticism in the financial sector: "The laws on increased prices of food are particularly drastic, how unregarding banks today damage the general well-being."
Ackermann is now a top bankenlobbyist, especially in the obligation.
"The German bank must strike all the installations from its portfolio where money for fees is used on food prices," said Bode.
"If Mr. Ackermann goes for hunger or for the call of the German Bank."
The view of Ackermann is surprising to the first view, but it is clear that the concerting wants to give a perfect image a few months before his departure from the office.
On Monday, the German Bank announced that the Head of State would not be changed to the Supervisory Board.
With a decline of the surrounded agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And to make possible invasions, he needs little to smile - so he would finally do his followers.
Each second would declare Rohstoff plants
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure up on the manager.
For now, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, the floor issued a survey for which the Institute Forsa asked on 7 and 8 November 1001 people.
Only 11% of them are in the case of legitimate offering the German Bank availability for food prices.
Many banking researchers would also have personal consequences when they learn that their bank is involved in such businesses: each second would, according to the survey, declare all installations in which money is flowing into the Rohstoff Speculation.
43 per cent of the recognises of such banks would have been attributed to 49 per cent to think about proclaiming their account and to change their account into another institution.
21h house in Vienna
The Converted Pavillon
From Ingebor Wiensowski
A architecture history with heights, depths and happy End: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavillon of Brussels in 1958 was covered in Vienna, standing empty and green.
Now he will be reopened as an exhibition house.
When heat by modern post-floor architecture, of clear forms, glass halls, sweeping swimming pools and new materials that are typically for the faith in the technical progress, then the Austrian pavillon of the Architecte Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels World Exhibition in 1958 is an excellent and famous example.
The Grand Prix d'Architecture was then obtained for its easier and slightly active steel-class construction.
The construction is applicable to the Millenstone Time Architecture until today.
He made the architects so known that the next world exhibition Pavillon was built by Austria.
With his legendary BMW-4ercylinder house in Munchen, he was finally famous internationally.
His as a timely exhibition planned pavillon had been established after the world exhibition in the Swiss garden at the Southern Vienna, rebuilding and opening a museum of the 20th century - the "20th house" was called it.
The building was suitable but not space and technically as a museum - no walls for the hands of the art, no good climate.
However, it was used so long until the temporary art in Vienna received a new house.
Since 2001, the building was empty and has been more and more.
Now the Architect Adolf Crischanitz has built the pavillon, now he is called "21 House" and is used in the future as a museum for temporary art.
The Belvedere Museum, which belongs to the house, opens the first exhibition - a case of luck in every perspective.
Used the new start of Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became a new director of the Austrian Galerie Belvedere 2007.
Husslein-Arco, promoted artsthistorin with attractive carriage, etc., in the youth as an iron artist, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as the foundation director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, made the reconstruction in political and mental protection, which offered public resources and private sponsor payers and established the use.
Besides the presence, the works of the shooter Fritz Wotruba should be issued from the same foundation, a coffee and a bookload should be given, and a office house had to be built.
Strength supervision, small level
For the implementation, the crisis was the ideal condition.
Not only because he turned and enlarged Joseph Olbrich's session in Wien and won the competition, but because he studied at the technological University of Wien and the pavillon was a "unnecessary important place" for him, where he had seen the exhibitions.
He knew the ur-project, and he knew the problems of the building that lost in his translation to Vienna and its use of greatness and flexibility.
The building was "a energy smooth", says Crischanitz.
The window profiles of the glassfassade were used, slight-forced glass glass glass and replaced the glass towels by special security glass.
The bridge steamers have been strengthened or replaced, and the asylum-completed cuts have been sanized.
Two undergrounds brought places for the new use, a cut light grain between the house and the road ensures the lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new construction, but still the slightly swimming pupil.
The original foreign doors have remained, the house has been cast in the old red red blue color of red protection.
And the cinema is even exactly as he was previously.
And that's all under strict supervision of the thinking authority and with a small state.
"Of you have to find a material that is good and suitable, and also filled with the Denkmal Protection Office", says Crisis and spend on a slow ground in the underground.
In spite of all channels, problems and reconstructions, the building is flexible and easy to stay.
Unfortunately, it had been with the pavillon, "the one from Brussels," has recently said a typical "Drop-in-the-City history".
So a architecture was "forever on the wrong place" and, however, wants to "wear a right consciousness".
In this case, however, the 21th house is not the wrong place, because it is a city-building case: for the Swiss garden, the entirely newly planned "Huptbahnhofquarter", with offices and households.
And there may be another lucky case: the 21th house could be strengthened by another crisis-bau, because the Sammler Francesca of Habsburg has purchased the Berlin temporary Kunsthalle, and, as you hear, it has already been negotiated with the city for a neighborhood location in the Swiss garden.
Rail plant Winter Crisis package in millions higher
The rail has developed a crisis plan to prevent sugar accidents in winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
That costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related additives and passes, German trains reported more than 70 million euros in this year.
The "image" allocation previously reported on a concerted crisis plan, with a total of EUR 300 million to 2015.
This aims to achieve better availability of vehicles and swimming networks in extreme shifts.
It is planned, among other things, to double the internal and external employees for the removal of neighbouring on rail stations and trains to 16.000 people.
Goal is to free trains up to the start of operation and 90% of the swimming snake and ice snakes within 4 to 5 hours.
Two months ago, Bahn-Chef Rüdiger Grube had also been warned in this winter after a spectrum with government and industry before additive accidents and late.
In the past winter, the trains had significant problems in the personal transport, as it was lacking in reserves, among others, in difficult weather conditions.
Thus many new regional trains have been expected for years to authorize the rail station.
Furthermore, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trends.
The rail has also been able to make a lot of years that they have to make a clearly frequencies review of the ICE axis after an ICE in the Köln main station was broken.
German Bank pays millions of punishment in the United States
After the Tumult to Chief Josef Ackermann comes new income from the United States: the German bank needs to pay a million bus.
If the problems for the German bank were not yet enough, the sectors are still in the United States: the Frankfurt Institute is paying for a comparison of $145 million (106 million), in order to accommodate strictness because of the pledge of five large social banks during the financial crisis.
It's about sales of hypotheken papers.
The financial market regulator NCUA proposes a whole range of large banks to have carried out the company banks with false discussions on the purchase of financial products; they would have played the risks.
Such papers have been strongly lost during the financial crisis and the banks were deeply deep.
"We are satisfied that we could solve the topic without having the parties to take the court", said a German bank talker in New York.
The bank did not have a duty to compare with the comparison.
This applies also to the citi-group which obliged to pay $20.5 million.
The NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the income of the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (CNUA) is responsible for the US Society Banks and is launched to protect customer facilities.
The NCUA is trying to replace the emerged milliarity of damages.
The now closed comparisons are the first of their type.
In the summer JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs, the regulator had also been declared.
The fragrant hypotheke papers are so-called Mortgage-backed securities.
They are based on households.
When the US Imperial Blase was placed in 2007, this was a variety of financial enterprises.
In September 2008, at the level of the financial crisis, the US Investment Bank Lehman Brothers was killed.
Even if the events have been back for a few years, the banks today in the United States have a huge wind.
Investmenters and supervisory authorities have struggled in numerous cases to obtain re-advisory or misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has solved the biggest wave.
It offers 18 international large banks to have transferred two state financing fans Mae and Freddie Mac in Hypotheken businesses in the volume of around $200 billion.
The German Bank also needs to be covered by the FHFA, which is about several businesses in value of total $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The Supervisory Authority requires that the Frankfurts are just for "substantial losses" without calling for a precise amount.
The German Bank had reaffirmed the demands as a slow decree and declared to want to swallow.
Warren Buffett increases with 10 billion in IBM
Financial guru Buffett invests strongly in IT enterprises IBM.
Since March, he purchased shares in value of more than ten billion dollars.
The large American investor Warren Buffett had always explained not to invest in IT and computer companies, since the long-term development of the company was only badly prognosed.
But now he read the business reports of IBM and changed his opinion on investments in the sector.
He has already understood that IBM provides mainly services and provide computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment in Warren Buffett is applicable as a shock in the financial world.
As a result, the IT original IBM should now be called "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett now enthusiasmed in the US CNBC state that he has purchased IBM actions in value of $10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus risen to one of the largest IBM's shareholders with a share of 5,5%.
Buffett said that even IBM had not been aware of something of the commitment.
He loving the management, which had been made in the economic crisis even for ordinary profits.
"They have done a great job," said Buffet to the strategy.
IBM has been set on the lucrative IT services, such as the operation of account centres.
The more than 100 years of old computer pioner also offers software and advice, as well as performance company computers.
Buffett had been more measuring technology companies.
He says he only investes in business, whose business he also understands.
Instead, Buffet took place nearly at a fraud train, with a machine manufacturer or machine manufacturer.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway has about 80 own daughter companys also shared in a range of large concerts such as Coca-Cola or the Munich Re, the former Munich back.
In the 1960s, the 81-year-olds had adopted the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and built them with pleasant investments to one of the most valuable enterprises of the world.
But it's his lifestyle.
He is therefore a cultural figure for innumerable investors in the world.
His almost unreasonable sense for money service has introduced the "Orakel of Omaha".
The IBM's activity was predominantly increased in a percentage after advertising Buffet investment.
"Big Blue", as also called IBM, is a total of $220 billion in the barse and is counted together with Apple and Microsoft to the most valuable technology companies in the world.
With Microsoft, this said Buffett, but he didn't want to get up.
Because Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is cruel
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Celle", Turkeyn media doubts in the German legal state.
A newspaper speaks of a "blue ideology", which now lives again.
The murder of eight tourists and a Greek smaller employee in the years 2000 to 2006 had a legal extremist background.
This message is reacted with fear and concern in Turkey and in the German population in Germany.
Because for many German turks, there is a long-termly believed scene: since the burning events in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has no similar violence against Turkey.
However, that there is foreign feminine in Germany, it has never been questioned.
However, the discovered right extremist network reveals the extents of which the size is not long-term.
"When the blue ideology live again?" titled the internet output of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
However, the newspaper "Sabah" emphasizes that one of the murders should have been a V-man of the Constitutional Protection, and is concerned that German authorities could also be engaged in the legal radiical sum.
The Turkish community reacted in Germany: she recalled the weekend with a guard in front of the Brandenburg Tor to the victims of racial violence.
First two weeks ago, the Turkish community in Berlin had thought together with German and Turkish politicians in a fifty-year-old anniversary of the German Covenant.
In pleasant colors, the one was inspired as a history of success.
As a listener, the reporting of some Turkish media: "Deutish Gift to Fiftiere" is the record of a article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the foundations of the murder series.
In addition, the German export of the "Christian Society" cannot be taken to take this thankful connection.
"It's starting to shut up," says the title of the columns of Ahmet Kulahci.
He emphasizes that people were murdered, paying taxes and making an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
It is also critical in the German Internet flights that the police's approach and its later advisory followers are discussed.
Why the German authorities haven't already been assaulted to search for suspects in legal extreme circles, the authors are wonderful.
Some show themselves at least rhetoric to drastic means: "If the migrants continue to be shocked here, there is nothing else than self-defence and weapons."
"This will probably be the best self-protection."
"For the goodness of the declaration and compatibility of the punishment of the whole network, the internal peace in Germany is very strong", writes "Selen".
What does it mean, if the internal peace is in danger in Germany, the appeal of males and solvents in the ninety years.
The photo of the Branding Rain of Solingen is deeply vulnerated in German and Turkey's memory.
Because no other event showed the living Turkishs here more clearly that there is a cruel threat, and the Germans that mis confidence and distance may be in the right violence.
However, the proposals raised our feelings on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat past errors
In the Turkish press, mainly, the error of German policy was understood: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of dinners.
After the fire attack of Solingen, he sent a telegram to the Turkish presidents, but was on the festivity of Köln by his Minister of Foreign Affairs, Klaus Kinkel, which was then counted in his speech how many expenditure were cutting the torches.
Only as the value of a person is calculated after the amount of its taxes.
The current reporting of the Turkeyn media again shows how deep the infidelity of many German turbulents is in the huge legal state.
In addition to the efforts of a comprehensive declaration and reevaluation of the extreme right terrorism in Germany, it is necessary to open words.
The Scandal Bank of the Zürisee
The most desperate European bank is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS went to the financial crisis nearly to bank-road, and it was ill from a crisis to the next.
Now you're going to put it a German.
That's how Axel Weber wasn't thinking about it.
After his spectacular department from the Federal Bank, he was announced in July 2013 that he would have an unexpected and lucrative carriage nearly a new job: the Swiss Governing Council President of the Great Bank UBS, an unexpected and unexpected carriage.
Axel Weber was publicly pleased, loving the Switzerland whether their beauty and the UBS were obtained by their new solidarity and made friendly comments on the future colleagues.
"The UBS has done the Turnround."
"I am pleased to cooperate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grobel."
But in September it was clear that everything would be different.
An UBS handler in London had crossed all bank security systems and shooted around 1,7 billion euros.
The UBS Head of State, Oswald Grubel, had to go, not only in Switzerland's famous bankers.
The UBS Administrative Council also applies as an appeal - and all of us ask, when will Axel Weber finally come?
It was noted that Weber could consult the bank from February 2012.
And the Council's presidency has already been overlooked in May - not only in 2013, as the bank was informed on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, it's hard.
He is not a banker, more economic prosecutor and notes, and has certainly been necessary for a processing period.
He then takes the responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has reaffirmed the title "Best Scandal Bank Europes" for a while.
Because the UBS is a larger - up to recently she was the largest owner of the world - and otherwise painted by a skandal in the next one for years.
Nothing, so it seems to be, the first time the Swedish bank remains so proud.
It started in the financial crisis.
By 2007, the UBS had an excellent call.
The image of the disappeared and solid but also buried Swiss owners had combined with ambitious objectives: she also wanted to become a whole large number in the investment banking.
Thus, the UBS 2007 managed 1,6 billion dollars more money-making customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, she was expressed as an investment bank in the link of the largest banks in the world.
That made it impression.
The only banker and later long-year bank professor in Zurich Hans Geiger said, "My students have always set the UBS as a pattern of good bank."
"But today's view is wondering, how could I just be so angry?"
He was struggling.
In 2007, it was obviously clear that something was part of the UBS.
In the middle of the year, head of the head, Peter Wuffli, was surprisingly returned to it, which became high-intelligent and also generic bankers.
A few months later, he was shocked why he was gone.
The bank's investment part was shocked with sub-pre-papiers and had to record billions.
In order to debt this, the UBS announced an increase in the capital of 13 billion Frances.
For this, she found investors, however, which some of the skins had soon been shocked before: an intransparent Asian state fund from Singapore and a Arab State Fund that had lost their name once.
But that was just the first thing.
In April 2008, it was worse.
The Bank had to announce new billion losses, Mr Marcel Osple, President of the Governing Council, 2006, and the Switzerland's second most paid administrative Council.
In October 2008 the disaster followed: the UBS was in view of their error investments in the financial crisis before the slaughter and had to be saved by the State.
The National Bank has purchased the UBS for zig billion of difficulty papers that the Swedish Employee Association gave six billion Frances for a slow-scale change rate that could be a central bank.
The whole Switzerland was shocked - because she noted how dramatic it is for a small country when it hides so large banks.
Finally, the UBS Budget Summit was more than five times large as Swiss’s economic performance (see graph).
"We couldn't ever save the UBS," she says bankn researcher.
The first disaster closed the second.
Shortly a few months ago, the UBS was funded in the tax trading with the United States, and was willing to give the data available customers who could have left taxes with the bank.
She also agreed to a payment of $780 million - as a reimbursement of unfair profits from these businesses and punishment.
In this regard, the UBS was known more or less open to help the tax interaction.
At the same time, she lost something that has been in the competition for rich customers: the nimbus of the loss of her capital.
After the skandal, the Swiss bank secret was not the same.
The retreat was followed by the Head and President of the Governing Council.
And the exodus of customers.
In this way, the bank had lost their credibility in two central business areas within less months: the investment banking through the speculations of losses and the ownership management through the aid to tax interaction.
And just when something more quiet, just as you thought, now the UBS will get back to it, as follows this unselfish handler history: a single handler hide 1,7 billion euros before the bank notices that something's driving.
And it will be obvious: with the risk management in investment banking it is obviously not yet.
"In the case of Adoboli, the risk control has changed too little", says Martin Janssen, Economic and Financial Profesor at the Bank Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial situation of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem of the UBS is that it does not have the risk controls".
It was exactly the idea of the swiss bankers had happened long ago to the gardens of the great ownerships of the world: there was no too large risks to make money security - the Alpen Republic also wanted to join the world.
The Swiss banks' treasures were the symbol for unforeseen confidence, such as Lindt and Springli for special shocklade.
The UBS Centrale in Zurich is only a bit greater to the clinic of the Swiss private bank.
Soon the situation is classic.
The bank has its headquarters on the Züicher Railway Streets, which leads directly to the Zurich Sea, which is rounded by the Swiss mountain hills.
The buildings here are clear, the ladder houses belong to the highest in Europe.
Youths like Tiffany are found here between Swiss traditional businesses such as the Conference Sprüngli.
For centuries, the Swiss banks are located here: from the National Bank over the palace of the Swiss to the elite private banks like Juliaus Bär.
The UBS receiving room is involved in a serious drought door.
The walls are wearing the seawaves, since they are swimming lederssels, along with the bank logo, a large switch to "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has both Swiss large banks, UBS and credit Suisse, but somewhat slowed - or surprised how the chief of a Swiss private bank finds.
He would not like to read his name in the newspaper, but finally makes it, as all Swiss bankers, also with the two large banks businesses.
The UBS has become too large, especially in the investment bank, where the Angelsachsen had also been expanded.
The Swissers wouldn't say anything anymore there.
"And if, they've been adaptationd to the Angelsachsen."
In fact, it was the relevant investment banking, which changed the UBS, which was the first high profits and then the debate: No European Finance Institute has lost so much money as the Swiss Great Bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was visible.
"Another million of that night the government coalition of the small seven million countries decided the greatest rescue action in the history of her nation," writes the author Lukas Hassig in his book "The UBS-Crash".
Up to 68 billion Franco or around 45 billion euros, politicians were allowed to save the large bank in front of the bank route.
How could it happen?
You talk to Swiss bankers, so you see the problem in particular in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss large banks were closed to a violent concert.
It was a bank that was already too large to the Fusion for the Swedish Switzerland - and was still grown.
As a result, the two different UBS banks complemented: a rich but sleeping bank with the main point of ability management in Zurich and a warm but more internationalized.
The internationalized investment banks were so favourable to a lot of money, with which they could turn a huge root.
Two names are associated with this increase of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 of the UBS, and Marcel Ospel, then President of the Governing Council.
"I always thought Wuffli and Osple were a dream team," said banken researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high-speaking, discreet, which understands much of models and statistics, and Ospel, the bottle man who has worked up from the bank teacher to the top."
But Ospel left the end on Wuffli.
And at the end, Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
Clearly, injury came before the case.
The UBS employees are clearly reminded of the leadership meetings, on which Concernchef Wuffli was always re-experiencing the same parole: the Goldman Sachs shooted from the throne.
The American Bank was the most powerful land investment bank.
She carried out the "League Tables", the ring lists that documented the success of the banks at that time.
That's what the UBS wanted to get up.
A few steps you've been happy.
In the carriage business and in the share trade, she played fully above.
However, enterprises advisers who have been employed have a weakness: in international interest business, in the "Fixed Income" language, there is a huge distance to the largest banks.
UBS has leaks in American hypothecarbons.
To close this shooting, UBS entered himself in an absent that she almost costed the existence.
Unfortunately after growth, both the bank itself, as well as one of its founded hedge funds in American sub-stations.
They developed to a huge machine that packed the value papers on American hypothekine crops and extended, but also had risks.
Even as other banks have long been looking for the expansion.
"In the summer 2007, when the US real estate market was in Flammen, the UBS has purchased there", said banken experts.
So large the Euphorie, so deeply the case.
A manager had to go after the other than making the attempts harder than thought.
Posts at the UBS were switch and are safe until today.
Whoever leads the big bank now has a job nearly impossible.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank that has been deleted to all the nearby business models.
Bank researchers have already a idea: finally with the investment banking, concentration on the property management, return to the Swiss roots.
That's all the way the bank will not go.
But the investment bank has to be shocked, so much is clear now.
On Thursday, the new bank chief Sergio Hermotti will propose his future strategy.
In fact, the 51-year-old Swiss was just a transitional solution when the bank was surprisingly trended by transitors green.
In the meantime, he was able to conduct the business of the UBS and shared the bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the Investment Bank to the position in the middle of the ninety years.
It's 3500 places.
But that's not going to be rich.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What do you want her to get money?
That's the questions that Axel Weber is safe now.
He's only saying he's going to find a apartment with his wife once in Zurich.
Next year.

Intelligent forces are wide in cities
Many places apply seed forces as "unfortunate birds": but from the cities, the high-intelligent animals are not allowed to leave long.
The ones who want to spend the others very quickly: the forces belong to the city image for centuries, but in many communities, the complaints of residential complaints are made through dreck and large of the animals.
This is not a means against the "problem birds" until now.
Seven forces weren't getting out of the cities, experts said at the first sympathy in East African League.
There were experts from the whole federal area on possible ways.
You are looking for alternatives in the citys
Natural protectioners also returned the problems in cities to the agriculture flow of the particularly protected seed forces: the chemical use in the agricultural industry increased the traditional living spaces.
The jagd, growing construction and the cases of typical breast trees made the birds difficult the life.
The powers are under natural protection.
The large colonies with more than 600 brown couples are in the Western Southeast, in the northwest of Jever, the depth and asim in bremen and in empty.
In 2005, a restrainted project on the massive killing of powers in the landcraft for Negativ slaughter lines had been carried out.
Critics were called the fish of animals in birds and the shock with shocks were particularly brutal.
"The normal disappearance, the grain, brings nothing", has found the city and landscape planned Werner shopers from empty.
Instead of splitting water or falling trees, often have unwanted consequences, said also the environmental experts Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals smile, large colonies slow up and distribute themselves to other places."
Feeding is only possible for exception of hospitals, age houses or schools.
"We have to live with them, we don't get them away."
Without the Umland, the problem was not resolved in the cities, Mr Wolfgang Kelner said from empty.
It is likely to be a combination of animals' plants from sensitive housing areas and logging offers to reset them to other places.
"Infotafels instead of chat skins," however, the psychologists and ethnologists Uta Maria Jürgens had been for a very common interference with the animals: "A pickel in the face can finally make us the best self-conscious."
Jürgen was found in Schleswig-Holstein to the Ascheberger Force Teaching, in which he was able to inform the bishop about the life of high-intelligent seed forces.
The project is already adopted by tourists.
Also to the criticism of the birds, Jürgen had a own view: "There is all the amounts of communications that have to say much."
The intelligence and availability of the animals are legendary: seed powers are not only used in order to come to a lecker drink, but put their own tool even.
Conduct researchers at the university Cambridge tested four seed powers as far as the intellectuality of the birds is available.
In a experiment, the birds learned rapidly that they had to bring a stone to a shooting in order to achieve such a skin wheel.
Without a lot of training, they seekly recognized what size and shape they needed to have a stone to put the platform together.
In a second trial, the efficient forces had to solve a more clever problem.
The researchers had plated a small eyemerge with a mood wheel.
The birds could not reach their legs with the snake.
However, the researchers had put their dragons on them.
Thus, all four animals formed a hake, with the help they switched the egg-merce on the griff out of the roof.
Three of the four seed powers were even on anfieb.

Mass thickness at a personal level
Incredibly, Peter Englinds begins a new book "Brightness and shame. One story of the First World War, in nineteen slopes," with a long list of main persons who go to heart.
Here is a tip how you can go: close this page carefully and make it to your bookmarks.
You will know these people in English very well. And these main persons will be working as your GPS, as a light tour in these few moments, in which you are like English men and women in the nebule of the war and lost your illusions.
Peter Englind is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretariat of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Price for Literature.
He wrote an innocent book that he does not describe as "a work of the anti-story."
There are only few large names, major contracts or famous shocks. There are no posters, reasoning reporters or discussions on tactics and equipment.
It's less than one book about what happened, but it's more than "A book about how it was." It's about "Smotions, impressions, experiences and stimulations".
"Beauty and shame" almost the war trials of 20 more or less inconsistent men and women on both sides of the war, from schools and botanics to mountains, doctors, hospital cars and officers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some will be deceived or died to war captured, lost membership.
Each of these lives reflects like the vocabulary clergs in a church, some come up while solving others.
The English book depends on the usual skilled books.
It also corrects the idea that the First World War has been only the promised position war on the Western front.
"Beauty and sharp" flows with experts on other war views: the Alpen, the Balkan, the Eastfront, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
On the soldiers in this book, bird crowd falls, a celebrated Christmas among the piramids in Egypt, Tsets are a unsolvable problem.
This is almost from the beginning to a moved book.
The war overcomes the life of these people like a natural disaster, such as a hurrican catrina who smile to Cordit.
You think you're a woman who's home with her children and canon fires in the television. Do you stay or take the flight?
Who's coming?
Someone understands what happens or why this war will actually lead.
"Filt facts", says, "become with confusions, acceptances, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiration theories, dreams, alpsome rooms and gratitudes."
"Beauty and shame" follows individuals like Florence Farmborugh, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German shipman.
Their stories were mainly taken memories, letters and other material already published.
Your life reports can be horrible or enormous, but they are extremely living in English in the assembly of small moments in detail.
Many of them act for lack and help.
In the history of a German school girl, he said, "Please, overall replacement."
"From coffee, false aluminium, false radiergummi, paper associations, wooden head."
He speaks more of the replacement in Germany.
He describes "Fleece made from a pressed trip and backed in a hammelfet (and lastly served with a false skin from wood), Tabak, which was made out of wooded roots and shooted shoes, which were cleaned with wood."
There was, as he noted, "837 registered foods that were allowed in the production of wildlife, registered 511 coffee sugar products".
Some stories act on honor and tappiness.
One American acknowledges his own threshold to wildness and says about the war: "It is feeling that, despite all this is what was intended for men to sit in the slope, with the nightbroad or the beast, and a cigarette and a wisky in the hand, and as a deep civilization, and as it does not give it barbary behind the own strengthened and shocked shock. "
On the other hand, a British soldier recognises that he probably dies and no one takes anxiety or will take care of it.
"If you take away from the thinking of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that this happens before a public", he wrote.
Instead, it is so terrified as "un condemned man in the secret."
Other observations are conducted by the old Europe, which is different and about new types of terrorism.
"The conflict has grown increasingly to an economic constraint," Englind writes, "a war between the factories."
He begins to arrive in what he calls "a new species in the Bestatiarium of the young century": "The word used and ideologically convinced masses murderer in the measure that slaughter, while he sits after a desktop."
People are conducted in an unpredicted way and there are also free behaviors like heroism.
Englind addresses soldiers who were active to move in a prostitute with sexual disease to depart from the front service.
"The great expression that can be found in the trade with the Gonokokes, because soldiers purchased and smiled on their genitals, in hope to come to the hospital's home," he wrote.
"They who were really desired shouted him in the eyes, which leaded to the rest of their life blind."
In this translation from the Swedish Peter Graves, Englinds Poesie is sweet, but it is unreasonable and perfect to his human task.
Independences of small scenes, he starts the way the war "in one way uncontrolable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hair."
People start to ask why their leaders are going to fight them.
The best books over the First World War were mostly false than Paul Fussells "Great War and Modern Memory" or Romane like Erich Maria Remarques "Im Westen nothing new" than large shooting books.
Englinds band is involved in an unconventionable ruhmeshalle.
His book has the most excited end of which I read it in a speech book.
I don't give it anymore.
But it's like he would have shooted us with his book with the main persons before the nase and shooted with a slipper.
After a preceding failure, a minute planned transaction
Hundreds of police officials were involved, some of them had an approximation.
We decided for Monday night, because at that time there are little people in the Zucotti Park.
The operation was held secret and only few high-range officials were informed. All others believed that they were starting to participate in a practice.
President Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence stressed the fact that the operation had full challenges.
The incidents of last weeks such as the use of Pfefferspray against Protestors, which disrupts the rules of the cernate, and the householders have made a huge increase in public sympathies, were no longer to repeat.
And so the police action was carried out to remove Protestors from the Zuccotti Park after two weeks of planning and training.
The officers had prepared this by watching how orders were handled in other cities.
A catastrophic process was held with a view to Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
The officers strengthened the so-called chaos training - measures to combat terrorism, which also includes the rapid loss of a large number of police officials - to concentrate on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit was located on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The command to get into the park came "in the last minute," said someone who is trusting with the command, which said for a declaration as "exercising".
"The few police that were involved in my knowledge did not know that it went about the Zuccotti Park," said someone who wanted to remain anonym.
"The only ones who knew it was about the Zuccotti Park were the high-ranging officials of the resort."
A reason for the secret was a lesson that had learned the city.
On October 14, the officers wanted to spend the park, but then they returned when hundreds of protesters came together after they had learned from these plans.
The officers of various police units were involved in the operation of the Sunday, including hundreds of employees from the whole city, which are normally employed in high criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day, many people enter and start in the park, almost like Pendler, so that 1 hour in the night is a good time to join.
"It was appropriate to do this when the smallest number of people stand in the park," he said.
Reservation vehicles with jupiter lamps and sound speakers were ready before the drive on the Pike Slip and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the previously signed news that triggered from the voice speakers seem to be threatened by many protesters.
When the public officials entered their blue windjacks in the park, many protesters simply cooked their things together and left the place.
The police said that until 1:45 hours, there would be no zeal to give the protesters time to pack her hair and good together.
Other teams of officials were seen how they gathered in the area in order to access, the arrests should be required in the park.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, speaker of the President of the police, said that this happened to their own security.
But many journalists said they wanted to stop watching the police action in the park, and they said that the officers were very excited.
Mr. Browne said that TV cars would have been able to make on the Western side of the Park photos.
When the police moved in the direction of West through the great interchange to personal things of the Protestors, including coppers, art straights and murders with clothes, followed their employees of the city's defence that was left.
Some protesters, who refused to go, were shocked outside. Images from this appeared shortly on the Internet.
A main tank of protesters was close to the kitchen area of the park in the center of the park position.
Some barriers built and the police continued to put their methodic arrests.
About 10 people in the shock centre of the ladder went together to their arms.
And two people held themselves on trees, said Mr. Kelly.
The officers of the Catastrophe Protection Officer were called to disable them.
As Mr. Kelly said, there were no arrests in the park until 3:30 p.m.
The residence was closed after 75 minutes after the police.
Mr. Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
The majority of the arrests, as he said, was due to "uncertain occupation and resistance against a arrest".
The most predominant official was Joseph J. Espose, head of the Division, the highest uniformized official of the Division.
Phil T. Pulaski, Head of Criminal Officers, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly, "not the operation", as Mr. Browne said.
The second group of officials on the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
In the Cortlandt Street, a road block north of the park, and in the Pine Street, a block on the south, barricans were created.
It could be observed as the circle of these positions from the police continued to go around the Zuccotti Park.
On a place, it was observed as several officials, many of them with protective paintings, people walk outside.
About 28 people were located in the northern environment.
Some of the most violent actions of the night found in the south of the park.
At 5:00 p.m. on the south of the Pine Street a protester on the jail of a police vehicle and other demonstrators left the air out of a police bus.
There was a lot of sperrhols in a place.
At the end, a officer and a protester came to the hospital.
Training the employee will be accompanied by dismissing the city
The workshop, which has lost the job in the last month, plants for hundreds of students who have lost their job at midnight, as the releases resulting in their unreasonable impact on the schools that teach poor students were not necessary and discriminatory.
The complaint is likely the last possibility that the Community, the Council of Justice 37, is still open in its efforts to make the discharges back.
Sixty-sixty school assistants, care coordinators and other employees who were belonging to the worst payers of the city and lost their work on 7 October, the employee leaders described a political rush that the access to a health fund that had been undertaken by the working groups should be closed in the last year.
These accused were dismissed by the authorities.
On a hearing of the city Council, Dennis M. Walcott, Director of Schools, said in the last month, the exemptions were part of the budget that were adopted in June.
A member of the city Council turned back and explained that in the budget there was nothing more specific that workers would be left for school aid.
Tonight, it will be given a press conference on which the income of the Supreme Court in Manhattan is formally announced.
The complaint will enter Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the city as a complaint and count eight dismissed employees as firms who are the whole city's fabric or Latin American women, such as most of the helpers who have lost their work.
Elizabeth Thomas, a speaker of the Ministry of Justice of the city, said that the city did not stand the clamp and could therefore not be commented on their individual auditions.
According to a New York Times project, the workshop has focused on the number of school releases in the poor villages of the city to support an inequalizer treatment. It says that poor schools would have lost more helpers since they were chronically funded.
She claims that, while there were no leaves on Staten Island and only few disbursements in the upper East Side or TribeCa schools, 17 school helpers in the district 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn have lost and 46 helpers were displaced in the districts 8 and 9 in South Bronx.
With the determination of the loss of five of eight school helpers in Harlem 36, where 68 per cent of the students lived in poverty, the complaint states: "This is no neighbourhood of visitors who can organize costs to get budget shortages."
P.S.: The 36th district was slow to 3,26% this year. In addition, money lost when the city changed its calculation method for extra financing for each poor school record.
The company also claims that the leaders of High Schools were conducted through the language in a memo, which approved the discharge of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the acting, even if "excess" in the United States generally describes the changing of a teacher from the content list of a school in a pool available worker paid by the central place.
"Sixty-sixty-four-coordinators were dismissed, not overcome", said the draft.
Mission Ending, Congress is ready to understand Libya
Lastly it seems like the Republicans and Democratics in Washington to understand the situations in Libya.
All that was necessary was the success of the Revolt, the arrest and murder of the long-year Diktator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of the American infringement.
On Thursday, the Senate's International Relations Committee decides a resolution which is the Chairman John Kerry (Massachussetts) together with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Amorrman (Connecticut), which is honored by Libya for the successful rebellion and the US-American troops for their "Mut".
"This resolution respects the sovereign people of Libyan who have started rebuilding their country," said Kerry.
"He is a confirmation of supporting its democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may be innocent, but until now nothing was simply in the Libyan debate.
This summer, lawyers of both parties and the White House strive to select a series of resolutions for approval or misconduct the role of the US military in the Libyan Mission of NATO.
In June Kerry and McCain proposed a resolution which approved the restricted use of the US military forces in Libya.
The law was dismissed by a wide group of both parties and has not been voted.
On the same day, however, this law went in the Senate, and the Chamber also agreed a decision on the reducing of the money for American operations in Libya.
Thus, the US mission was in a kind of legislative fire - with a congress that was sufficient to criticize Obama's action within the mission, but not sufficiently angry to finally get out of the grounds under his feet.
Then the indecisiveness of the convention was taken from the events.
Tripolis was killed in August under the libyan rebelles and Gaddafi on 20 October.
The NATO Mission officially ended on October 31th.
Now the Senate may have been ready to deal with.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "gratefuls the people of Libyan for their huge courage and outstanding duration in their self-determination" and "the men and women of the United States military and their coalition partners, supporting military operations in Libya, for their extraordinary courage and professionality."
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States to a successful and unrelated transition in Libyan to democracy".
If the new measures will be fully supported by the Agency for Foreign Relations, or will they hear the legislators how it has done June?
The latter sentences on the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the Spitzen-Republicator of the Committee.
Lugars speaker said on Monday that he has not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Capitol, this week is to vote on a constitutional amendment, which calls for a balanced budget, a top priority nearly every conventional period of the Republicns and some democrats.
The measures under the direction of the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change of the budget or another area which comes to vote at the Senate or Congress at the time.
Other legislators have since now tried to make their amendments to vote, although they have often tried enough.
Good change is only one of 68 constitutional changes presented by this Congress, including a whole band width of the topics.
Some are doubled - the same law has been presented to both the Congress and the Senate - the others are simply declining to each other.
There is only 15 versions of the balance budget change in the Senate and another twenty-third that would be "controlled expenditure".
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their contractors - especially the committees in the Republicans who want to oppose their life course - the possibility that they have a "verified" measure.
The budget control law adopted in August requires both Senate and Congress to vote on a change in the budget compensation.
In March 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution which supports the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that the members of the Congress are able to present, while the Republic of José E. Serran (New York) wants to reduce the limitation of two offices of the President.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) proposed a number of amendments which guarantee the right to good education and health.
An amendment prohibited by a council under the same sex is as a change that is subject to the breaking of fabrics is always reversing.
Some legislators also want to allow the abrogation of federal laws if the two-thirds of the States are rejected.
As the Member States proposed amendments, as soon as fast as they move as in the past years.
In 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 such amendments in 110th Congress 66.
The time is allowed in comparison with the previous 1990s in which members regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, thus the numbers available by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment to be added - on 27th - was ratified in 1992, but indeed it was already proposed to the Congress in 1789.
Gifford's first television interview after the attack
Ten months after a weaponed man was shocked on them during a election event in Tucson, the Republicnian Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) was on Monday at the national television. She sang only to Broadway-Stuck "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to come back to the Congress was greater than the one to return.
When she went together with Diane Sawyer in the ABC news "20/20", they took part in words and needed help to go.
The sending showed the serious slow recovery of the damage that the ball that shared its shadows, the left side of their brain, and has established her head from front to behind.
Three months ago, she was surprised to return to the Congress to triumphing her voice for a debt break.
In her first television interview after the attack in January, when six people killed and 13 were blessed, Gifford laughed, laughed and blood - and described their geneticness as "swimming".
When Sawyer asked how she feeled, Gifford (41): "Gann good."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a unique "20/20" specialist who was recorded short before the publication of the new book of the wife: "Gabby: a story about courage and hope".
The special follows Gifford's care since the attack of 8 January.
In videos that Kelly had recorded in the first weeks, you see her in the hospital bed, with a shocked head and a long shock over the murder.
She can only have one or two fingers if her husband encourages her.
Months later, Giffords sits in a roll store while therapy shows how they perform simple movements.
A nickle with the head.
A sugar with the lips.
And then, their first words, "What."
After a few days, Giffords fly another word: "Toast". You want to change your breakfast.
Videos played in the ABC show show that music played an important role in Gifford's genesis: It looks like the congress members are sing with Cyndi Laupers "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Pettys "Free Fallin".
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords said that he can't remember two hours daily with therapy.
Her husband said that he had read a article of Gifford on 12 March about the attack when she interrupted him and first asked the six people who were killed during the attack.
The smooth shooting Jared Lee Loughner sits in a prison in Missouri and will be healing medically while he is waiting for his negotiations.
"Many people died," Gifford's Sawyer said.
"Carter, heart, heart."
In the course of her wife, Kelly Sawyer told her, "I was taken."
"So I would say, Gabby, you didn't have been shocked," said Kelly.
You've only been found.
And you'll get it, and you'll get back to you and you'll return more stronger than ever before.
Trumps make more suffering than respect
The event was a Wall Street Gala, which collected millions of dollars for unforeseen veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about flexibility, frozening and loss.
On a mark, hundreds of soldiers, matroses, pilots and maritimes were assembled around him.
The amount in black smokings standed up and applauded.
"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the spending action in the early year.
A rangy military officer on the Gala, which was observed by the chief and then President, was observed by the Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced as kids," the officer wrote in a email.
I'm sure the organizations have done it well.
I know.
But it was not respect, not really.
The opposite impressions illustrate the serious relationship between military and most distanced, sometimes amazing American publicity.
The troops will be overcome with Lob for their victims.
But the Lob has his price, tells services.
The public is growing as you were the people in Uniform suffering.
"We were no way victims," said General Brigade Sean B. MacFarland, who defended the troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghan.
"But it seems to be the only way of supporting those who are to press us in the role of unfortunate souls."
The theme is extremely sensitive for military leaders who want to appear to be unacceptable or in the conflict with the public that they serve.
They also recognized that the wrath, the returning armies in the past years of Vietnam war, was worse.
As a result, discussions on suffering in the style and privates between war veterinaries are placed.
After his two sons returned to the battle with the Marines, the Colonel A.D. Mark Cancian warned them before that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would be viewed with a feeling of honour, since they were shocking rebels and traveling to exotic places.
Others would ask whether a "weaponable veteran is hidden under the surface", said Cancian, who had been fighting in Iraq and took a higher state post in Washington after his return.
During his work search, he said that some of the questionnaires asked whether he was able to stay back after his return from the battle to the pressure of a requested post in Washington.
"If you speak about your service, you should keep the negative impressions," Cancian explained his sons.
The lack of light of the military causes part in the lack of interest of the Americans in the war.
A country that has little experience with the military and only a few benefits in the wars in Iraq and Afghan, will be a country of struggle, just rare than loving.
"We are as a nation not more than military heritage as it was absolutely normal in the Second World War," said Leutnant General David Barno a.D., who defended the U.S. Trumps in Afghanistan.
Instead, the loving of the politicians and the public is mostly focused on the suffering of a service members.
Trumps find recognition for the number of attacks they have brought, the number of friends that they have lost, or for the weight of their injuries.
Military is the growing pressure to struggle in assault
In this week, a major hearing decides whether 28 women and men are accused of non-accepting in a crime before the Military Court.
If it doesn't happen, hundreds of customers are ready for the next hearing.
Oberge free Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old, and in the 11 week she was pregnant when she was forced by a soldier college.
It was in October 2008 and she just returned to her castle in Miramar north of San Diego from the dinner with a friend when she met a men's colleague, who took a 12-pack bird with herself.
He asked her if he had to join them to a drink in her room.
"My alarm glasses went," said Lyman.
But the Technics strike out their minds.
I thought, "What, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I had heard on my cup's feelings."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man went behind her, pressed her down and forced her, guarded her.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other former military plans were awaiting a process with a historical hearing in Arlington, Virginia, where a complaint was decided whether it was approved before the former Minister of Defence, Robert Gates and his defence, Donald Rumsfeld, for the court.
The complaint states that Gates and Rumsfeld have not been subject to the widely assaulted crime within the military and under the violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February of Susan Burke, a law envoyed at Washington, D.C., entitled the complainant of 17 claims, which raised at 28 months: 25 women and three men, who claimed all that they were inflicted by soldiers colleagues or sexually misused, and that the army was condemned to condemn, condemn it or to provide appropriate legal practice after the attacks.
Burke says she follows the top army, since the problem begins there.
"The army is built here architectically," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in the position to shoot the culture's reward? The leadership."
Burke also says that she has contacted nearly 400 other survivors since February, many of them could be part of future cards.
Your strategy: Instead of putting all skins into a corb, they will, if necessary, reach a lot of further cuts in order to maintain the pressure.
The defence team, designated by the Federal Prosecutor Neil MacBride, has requested a complaint to be sent.
The Acts of the Court, which are presenting Newsweek, are fully implemented by the Defence Strategy, in the main sense of the fact that military soldiers cannot be accused of the present or previous soldiers for violations to which it has been held in the forces of the Forces.
Based on a law of the Supreme Court of 1950, which is mentioned by the Feres Doctor, the Government does not impede for injury accompanied by soldiers in the active service.
"The absolute damage occurred during the Military Service of the Chairman," said the document.
The Defence Ministry rejects every comment to this story.
The things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are not yet allowed to serve in the fight, the distinction is only in the name: modern wars have only rarely clear fronts.
Even in Iraq as in Afghan, soldiers' teams play increasingly important roles, especially in contact with inhuman women in war areas.
The result: between these two wars, 150 soldiers died, two thirds of them in combating.
It's time that the military is modernized, says Burke.
And she's not alone in their fight, but three other pieces other than her are dependent.
At the Yale Law School, Veterans' legal Services Clinic provides a composition against the four most important military rakes for the promotion of a feminine atmosphere.
Independently, the communal Vietnam veterans of America is a complaint against the military in which it is concentrated on the diagnosis "Persistence Destruction" which has been offered for a licensed sacrifice to resolve them from the service - a common action, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, her group was enriched against the Veterans Administration (e.g.: War Veterinary Management) in which it provides its discriminatory practices in their conduct with performance requirements for persons who indicate that they should be sexually misused in the service.
Nine laws were submitted by a mixing of senators and representatives of both parties to the Conference which offers a number of content points.
According to the 2010 Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (t.e.: Office for Prevention and Advertising Sexual Abuse) of the Ministry of Defence was shown 3.158 sexual failures.
However, most of the missiles are not reported and, after their own estimation, this number takes into account about 13.5% of the estimated 19.000 cases in which it comes per year.
The report, published in March, also investigated the Criminal Survey rates: in 2010, 20% of the most investigated cases in the army were in court, only half of the civil law.
The claimers in Burke's case describe their attacks only the first series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the absolute assault of the military police less than one hour after the crash.
In this night, as she says, she was requested 11 times to tell the details of her assault a whole range of police, doctors and commanders.
She was found in her bed, the blood of her anxiety, who stood from a cut to his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge, and during this hearing she was asked after the sex she had had with her friend.
Six people said to be characterized in the name of the mutilative murder, which was finally released.
"I remember the day when the judgment was read," says Lyman.
"I thought I would use the shoes, I smile out of the court hall."
"He brought me to the psychiatric department and I remembered that when I came back, I said to my commander, "This was not his procedure. It was my procedure."
Lyman was requested to visit a military syriter who finally diagnosed a personality degradation and declared it for non-service.
In January 2010, she was unreasonable, so that no support was received.
Whether the complaint, which has submitted Lyman and the other candidates, is pure speculation, says John Turley, Professor of Law Science at George Washington Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes: "I think they should be forward."
What is between them and a sentence, this doctrine is criticized since it has been asked for the first time.
I'm a critic of the fire doctrin.
The army has a decade behind, because they do not have the same emphasis and the same shock that brings up a detachment.
He adds, "The opportunities are against them, but it's important for them that they try it."
These things will only change when good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing does not follow their way, Burke, the applicant of the applicant, starts with hundreds of other customers for future cases.
"We will fight the military in this regard until it comes to reform," she says.
Or until we die, what always comes as the first.
Walls have eyes: How Researchers are looking at Facebook
Before he became the new face of the legal extremism in Europe, Anders Berring Brevik was only one of many people who sent their anti-immigration reduction online.
On Monday, Breivik was able to have started an amok round in Norway in July, with 77 people killed, his first public hearing before the court.
Although Breivik could have treated alone, he is not alone in the Cyberspace: he has passed a lot of time to his attack before his computer and has struck with some of the millions of nationalists who support the legal extreme groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find more about these people.
But how do you find her?
This is easy - you just have to log in Facebook.
"We have found that it was not hard to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the principal author of a recent report of the British idea manufacture DEMOS about the digital population in Europe.
Facebook's hiding personal data is so encyclopædiac, Bartlett says that researchers simply need to use the advertising tool of the page to determine their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - as it makes marketers for years.
Bartlett Team found a half million fans of the right extreme groups in Europe and then seeks to associate with an ads, but instead of connecting a new band or a new diet product, the Adds users called for a survey in which after their educational status, their attitude to violence and the assessment of their own future were asked.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to ask more than 10,000 members of the extremely right parties in 11 European countries - without having to leave their office once.
"It's a right new research method," Bartlett says.
Some of the results are little surprising. Online supporters are usually young, men and hungry about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising rotation, "they who combine their online activeism with an offline activityism are more conscious, democratic and less violent than those who are sits behind their computer screens."
DEMOs work is only an example of how Facebook will become a new warm tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideal manufactures, medical researchers and policy sciencers use the site to study everything, from health issues to social barriers such as "Likes", text news and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users that add a average of three contents per day, Facebook's "datasupernova" generates a research tree that increased nearly 800% of the scientific works on the title in the last five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study people by this page that are normally not reached with his clipboard on the street.
"If you had previously tried to ask people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to first informe the party and the party had never been granted access to them," says Bartlett.
"Free Facebook goes all of this - you're going directly to them."
Others say that the page offers an opportunity to identify and solve social health problems.
A current study by Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and its colleagues found that students who discussed their full discussion on Facebook are more stronger to drinking problems than students who are about this topic.
Moreno suggests that equal students, for example, living advisers, monitor the page and help a student if they post too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos Ko-Actor and Chief of Child Health, Beravior and Development Institute in Seattle of Washington Post.
"We have found a possibility to identify dangerous children that wouldn't be found otherwise."
Facebook also constantly engages the data of his own population.
The data team of the page has created statistics on the status and date of relation, the participation of the election to the 2010 election and a national happiness index (in the main line of information that only has access to Facebook - master of digital freedom has long known that the page should make its large base for others available to research courses).
But the users of Facebook know that the page watchs whether they want it or not. To play a friend that has been removed from thousands of miles, you will allow the page to deliver their own personal data.
But what if the users of Facebook become part of a survey from which they don't ever know anything?
While researchers have strict directives as they gather their data offline, online is all allowed.
"I don't believe that many users have thought the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociolog at London Knowledge Lab, to a study from 2006 where he studied the public pages of students on Facebook.
"What she's about, it's only about her and her friends."
Then there is still the question of the methodology.
Even offline is no guarantee that a researcher is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the information are true in a user profile and contributions.
"What you say on Facebook and what you're doing outside Facebook, it's two very different things," says Selwyn.
As a result, Selwyn thinks, though his years as technology researchers, that a clipboard and a stift are still the best research tools that everyone can use.
"No replacement is to go out into the real world and to speak with real people," he says.
"Social research must take care of the social - and every number of social life is still offline."
"Inhuman": Other assembly Brevik appears for the first time before a public court
Anders Berring Breivik, a man who stood two amokings in Norway, whose death in this summer, 77 people were killed, described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" fighter.
"I'm a military commander in the Norwegian rebellion movement and a norwegian temple leader," he said before a court hall with over 500 people.
"I am inclined to the court, since you have received your mandate of organizations, supporting hasidians and because it is supported by multiculturalism."
"I recognize the laws, but I am not guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monolog, as "Breivik did not want to give the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views."
For the same reason, he refused Breivik, who made a preceding speech, the permission of appealing to the members of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered that the police Breivik had 12 further weeks in investigation, and he had no access to the media for four weeks. He said that the authorities will be controlled accurately by all visits and the whole corespondence over eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and families of the victims took part in the hearing.
Some came to hope to see Breivik in the eyes, others wanted to confirm that he was left behind the locks and the rigel.
Everyone took part in the goal that everything goes out of the way.
"I thought he works cold and inhuman," said a survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian sender NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it's going to be a part after I saw the suspect and heard."
Breivik took a dark path and a blue claw and acted quiet and professional during the whole hearing. He looked at journalists and survivors in the eyes when he treated and left the building.
Despite the strange indication of Breiviks, he would be part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge came to the conclusion that he wasn't spiritual sick and said that there was no evidence for him that he had complicated.
Some may seem that the attacks of 22 July seemed to be the work of a individual extremist and not the group of radikers.
But does this automatically facilitate the crazy and confusion that still feels a whole nation?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he didn't do it," said the family of a victim.
"It would be so easier if he did it."
7 Lectures of the interview with the murdered Steve Jobs, shown this week in a theater
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, and thereafter the technology was a great modern founder.
However, what Apple-Fans may find in the most recently discovered jobs interview, which has been discovered in this week special film prescriptions on the important markets, is how much this creative head-making and jobs understood.
He certainly was a designer, a dreamer and its own hippie, but he was also an acribical organizationr who was able to build diagrams - a man who believed that many business leaders suffered of "a disease of the thought", "as a very great 90% of the work... [aber] there is a huge amount of handwork art between a wonderful idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of Fachidiotes" about the breakdown of the computer, and he was more than one hour with jobs, where they conducted one of the rare, exhaustive discussions.
At that time, as a 10 years ago, jobs were taken from Apple. And he worked hard at his new computer company NeXT, and was pleased at the wide acceptance of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringley's interview was used in fachidiotes, he said that the copy of the interview was missing in delivery.
First after Job's death, a complete VHS copy was found in the garage of the director.
This easyly revised film material forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The lost interview", which comes to the Landmark Theatre.
For someone who knows that he has adopted an extensive interview, Jobs appears quite surprising in the review of its technological philosophy and business strategies.
And unbelievable.
In the course of the interview, there are four times more pauses between questions and answers - 10 to 15 seconds in which jobs clearly decline his thoughts and work for accuracy.
There are also moments in which Jobs' perfectionism comes to days when it seems to be indulgently reacting to the questions of Cringely and appealing to him, making it more faster to the topics or side treatments of greater importance.
Before the time of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, the Loserne Interview appears to be insecurely extensive if you evaluate jobs, what other companies do correctly or wrongly and its own vision towards the future of the computer.
It's a thing to read posthume estimations of the carriere Jobs. But Jobs here to see as the sweet dreamers that are on the slope to great quality is something very different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision how to be and what should be.
Shortly after he did this, he went out and did it.
A fast view of seven remarkable sequences of the lost interview:
How he learned to lead a company:
"When the whole year of business, I always ask, "Why do you do things?" and the answer you always get is, "Oh, that's how easy it will be done."
Nobody knows why he's doing what he's doing, no one's really thinking about things.
I found it.
Jobs continues to rationalize the booking at Apple.
It was noted how the costs were registered - mostly you started with "standard costs", which were covered by simply polluting and then adapted to "exciting" - developed a automaticized manufacture that ensured that business costs could be set up to the smallest.
How the Pope was born:
Jobs tells us about the "Blue Box", which he built with Steve Wozniak, a device that could be engaged in the telephone society and lead to telephone conversations.
Over the device has already been written much, but job's inquiry when he describes the blue Box as an act of self-permission, it is switching.
It describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a switch phone, operating a call and then connected to a different network, while it is as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things half a twenty-four times around the globus and when you broke into the phone, there was a minute later out in the phone,” said Jobs.
"We were young and we learned that we could build something to control the billions of dollars of infrastructure in the whole world."
We both did not know much, but we could build this little thing that can control a giant thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think that it would be given without them apple.
Jobs continues to talk about a glorious strike, the wozniak and he closed when they called through the Blue Box in the Vatican and wanted to talk to the pope, while they were so well able to observe Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic Heritage were called in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomates, the two of them had to leave before the Pope itself came on the phone.
How he loved himself in the technology (and not prepared Bill Hewlett):
In the age of 12 years, when he searched for replacements to build a frequency number, he searched for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone phone, Jobs received a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
"This had a remarkable impact on me. It was the only company I had seen in the age and it formed my views of what was a company and how good it was treating his employees."
Later, one of the HP employees, who visited the research works of the company in Palo Alto, he saw "the first desktop computer that was ever produced".
He was so big as a copper, had a small screen with a brunscher rohre, and I loved me in him.
I would write to HP as adolescents to upward clothes and to this machine and programs for them.
How to improve innovations:
Many times in the interview, Jobs talks about how to find new products.
Soon in his career, when he built a few plates, he was requested to build the whole computer.
He worked with a payment duration of only 30 days and had to develop both the construction and the delivery of the prepared devices.
Later at Apple, he recalled the problems he had in the development of a computer museum:
"I remembered the arguments... she shouted me that it would take five years [in building a mouse that would cost $300] and I stood out, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later we had a mouse that we could build for $15. It was unbelievable.
About large enterprises:
For a long time before he left Apple again, Jobs saw the ways that so many industrial engineers went with their visions in stolpers and lost control over their shares.
"Do you work with IBM or Xerox, so do you make a better coper or printer, then and?"
They have the monopy, so the company is not successful.
Sells and marketing makes it more successful, so [as far as such people], which finally lead the companies and the product with which people are taken from the decision-making.
The gene of product which has led to this monopolation will be destroyed by people who have no concept on good products, such as bad products, - the workart is necessary.
That happened to Xerox...
Xerox could have had all the computer industry.
You could have been ten times greater, if Microsoft could be the 1990s...
You've been able to shoot the shock of the victory.
About innovation as art form:
"It's all the many handwork artists between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this wonderful idea, it changes and grows."
A lot of learning about his fenomena.
You have to make votes, certain things that you can't, but electronics, glass, robots, manufacturers.
You have to notice 5000 things, these concepts, and they're bringing them all together...
Finally, it goes out of the smell, it goes out of trying to get together with the best testimony that people have created, and then try to bring these things together with what you do.
Picasso said to copy good artists, sweeping wonderful artists.
We're always unclean in the steel of great ideas.
It was part of what Macintosh made great, that the people who work there, musicer, tears, artists, zoologens, historians, were at least the best computer scientists of the world.
If it wasn't the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas divert with enemy of health laws as a court case
On the day on which the Supreme Court gathered after the doors closed to discuss the politically participating question, whether a threat to the health laws of President Obama was heard, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, took part in a dinner that was discussed by the Bureau that the case was taken before the court.
The incident was held on Thursday when all nine judges were attended to a discussion to consult the requests.
One of the cases to be treated was a complaint that has taken 26 States against the wide reform of healthcare, which was decided last year by the Congress, a law which was a word for the conservative aktivists throughout the United States.
The judges agreed to the hearing, and indeed, in March, a substantial discussion is expected to be a 5 1/2-style-based basis, which would probably be encouraging the 2012 Presidency campaign, which will be full of the date in which the Court of Justice is announced.
The lawyer, which is before the court and claimed that the law is to strike, will probably be Paul Clement, a general lawyer under the government of George W. Bush.
Clements Canzlei, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the nearly two twenty companies who supported the annual dinner of the federal society, a old group that was the defence of conservative law principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the economic associations, the National Federation of Independent Business that fights the law.
Another sponsor was the Pharmaciegigant Pfizer Inc., who has been financially involved in the result of the process.
The dinner found a few hours after the court had consulted the case in a Washington hotel.
Service, among others, had Mitch McConnell, the Head of the Republic of Senate and a declared enemy of health reforms.
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges visit the events of the federal society for years.
And this does not abuse moral rules.
Indeed, the judges are free of the Code of Conduction which regulates the acts of the nice Federal Directors.
If it is, they would probably fall under the principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge may participate in the meetings of the benefits of the law and other organizations, whereas the judge may not be a guest of such events, speaker, honor, or programme."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the cancers involved in the case and to a company with a massive financial interest in this way to warn moral and government activists.
"The breach with moral and the opposite to the code of the laws of some judges, the court holds the same rules that apply to all other federal leaders," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a civil law movement in the United States.
"The judges won and advised during a beneficiary meeting with lawyers with disabilities in the court."
Their appearance and support of a spending action for this event are subject to any access to non-partiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little attention to critics who say they would be easy to judicial matters with groups that lead to the agenda, such as federalist society.
And the wife of Thomas Ginni is a famous conservative activist.
However, the conservators pointed out that it was judge Elena Kagan, who had a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general lawyer under the Obama government, when the first infringements of law were in the court in the first instance.
Their critics stripped Kagan to turn away from the case's hearing because of the predictability, because they are too engaged in the defence of the law to be unprecedented.
Kagan doesn't make a number of things to do this.
Bueing is a record of $18 billion in the country
Aeroport company Emirate orders 50 two-great aircrafts from the type Boeing 777 with a option on 20 other aircraft.
Moreover, Boeing sixs Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a business value of more than 1 billion dollars.
It's really a rare message that a company gets a contract over 50 pieces of its products.
But it is a great business when the company of the Boeing Co manufacturer is and the list price for these 50 flights is totally in a record sum of $18 billion.
As well as the contractor of Boeing is: the Middle East, a growing goldmine of future aircraft.
In a prognose that was published on Monday, the Chicagon company estimates that airlines from the Middle East in the coming 20 years required 2.520 flights in value of $450 billion.
Boeing announced its greatest task at the weekend of all times for commercial aircraft, measured by the value of the order: 50 2nd Bueing 777 Jets.
The Hammer Office came from the aircraft Emirates from Dubai.
The aircraft has also announced that Boeing was 2011 on the Dubai aircraft, a option on the purchase of 20 other aircraft that allows to increase the total list price of $26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing Oman Air sixs Boeing 787-8, which is called Dreamliner, which significantly improves the benzine consumption and the comfort of passengers.
The list price for six of these aircrafts is at more than 1 billion dollars.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, Börsen Fachman of Morningstar.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many aircraft companies in the Middle East are in possession of oil producing countries.
Thus, they have not only the money to pay the aircraft, but many more is an increase in the oil price, which usually damages the airlines, since this is one of their largest cost points, not so harmful as the country has a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend less than other airlines to shoot or move aircraft orders when the oil prices increased, Dihora said.
"He has a natural insurance," he said.
The order of Emirates confirms the management position of Boeing on the market for large space flights and helps to keep the Airbus Concourn SAS in shock, which attacks the precaution with the A350.
Boeings wins on the aircraft will be announced four months after the Airbus, you would move the introduction of the largest A350, which is directly competitive with the 777-300ER.
It was unable to win more trusts after the customers had requested a higher profit and rique extent.
The Bueing Acts increased up to $1.5% at $67.94.
Sister of the Mexican President loses a apparent choice in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon states that the drug leaders supported Fausto Vallejo from the PRI in the rent towards the guest posts.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon seemed to have lost their claim on the office of the Governor of Muchoacan during the violent state ships, and she said on Monday that drug chairmans had influenced the rent for one of their enemy.
According to the provisional results, Fausto Vallejo has winned the rent around the governors in the Western State by the institutional party of Revolution.
"The invasion of the organized crime during the whole election process and especially on the strict day is alarming, not only for Michoacan but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview a day after the election on Sunday.
"You threatened our candidates, our employees in the surveys... you have put election boxes to build road blocks ... and people are employed to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI registered seven decades in Mexico until they lost the Presidency in 2000.
But they are trying to return and the victory in Michoacan is a important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes a victory in the presidency election in July.
Vallejo seems to have just shocked Claderon, which had still conducted in the investigations before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate of the conservative party Action National PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left democratic Revolution Party PRD, who is still an official governance, came on place Drei, a serious shock for the divided and unpleasant left leadership for the Presidency event 2012.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the provisional results.
Vallejo, former citizensman of the capital city of Morelia, lies connections with drugs and depends on other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has been controlled for a long time of drug cards that have specialized Marihuana, Heroin and Amphetamine.
It is the homeland of President Calderon and he has chosen Michoacan to start a military offence against drug chairmans in December 2006.
Violence still continues.
A PAN citizensman was killed a week before the election during a election meeting for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates are extinct from the local elections.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, unlike the elections today in Michoacan.
The man, who will be the first president of the presidentship, is Enrique Pena Nieto, who was grateful to Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think that this victory can see us strongly in the next year."
ADB grants Asia to aid in the saving of the euro zone
The Asian Development Bank (Asian Development Bank, ADB) calls on India and China to support the salvation of the euro zone in its serious debt crisis to prevent a long-term distance that will be broken by the growth of Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, Director of ADB's Headquarters in Manila, said that the two of the rapidly growing economics in the world had to do "all in your power" in order to accelerate the recovery of the currency block, either by the international currency fund or by direct mutual agreements.
He warned the BRIC countries (Brace, Russia, India, China), the "exceptless" of the difficulties in Europe, and said that the financial support for European leadership and European resources was to help Asia to avoid a long-term convergence of the global economy.
"We all sit in the same boat."
"It is also every helpful who can help Europe from this crisis," he said the Financial Times in an interview at the rand of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected until a certain degree, but it's not immune."
"If China and India can so help, then with all the resources."
The European Monetary Union has been a serious debt crisis in the last few months.
In recent days, Italy's interest costs were dangerous and the Prime Ministers have been returned from Italy and Greece.
The severe debt crisis in Europe is afraid that the global economy could slow in recession and lead to calls for the leading weak countries to support the euro zone.
Mr Nag said that each Asian support will be analyzed by the IWF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of Bonds of the EU Relief Fund, the European Financial Stabilisation Facility (EFSF) - offered the European partners to a greater negotiation force in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Trade Minister, said that "Inland will do everything that is in his power" to help the euro zone, since its economy now leads to exports and to extract foreign capital flows.
"Nobody wants to keep the euro zone instable and turbulent," he said.
"We have great challenges and we need to get a high level of growth."
"It's no option, it's a task, for where otherwise we find work for millions of young men and women."
Others argued that developing economies such as India do not have an event to help the rich Europeans if they themselves face large economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, Professor at the United States Brown University, said that it would be very politically difficult to sell the 1,2 billion people in India to help Europe, from which more than 800 million of $2 or less than living on the day.
"Whenever they will find that the Greeks are going to be in pension with 50 feasts and spend feasts on the beach, then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, Director of the World Economic Forum, asked the same reason why India's reservations should be used to maintain the numerous and well-bearing employees in Greece, infringement in jobs, losses such as rail trains.
Mr Nag said that the crisis in the euro zone will have "signified domino effects" on the whole Asian.
The ADB's prognosis with an economic growth of 7.5 per cent in Asia for 2011 is now threatening "the risk of dismissing" because of the threatening risk of Europe.
He said that the delicate weight markets should create "Crise Plans" to protect themselves for a distance and a significant capital migration of their words.
Drug warnings from the Pentagon before possible inputs in defence
The Defence Minister Leon Panetta held the conference on Monday when he warned that automatic budget disadvantages would uncertainly deficiencise national security, so he solved a financial reaction from the halls of the Pentecost to the war positions in Afghanistan and the civil flight countries.
The Pentagon already considers the costs of $450 billion during the coming decade, but it is fearing that further costs of $600 billion or more will be necessary if the conference is not able to achieve the expenditure.
"The impacts of these turbulents would be encouraging to the Ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to the Republican Senator John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a shipping of the conference in the achievement of a budget agreement, which will lead to a such assignment, would lead to 23% general burdens and a stop of numerous new projects.
"If a high struggle, performed in such an unexpected way, most of our ship and construction projects would not be implemented - you can't buy three neighbors of a ship or building - and other modernization efforts seriously damage", wrote Panetta to the senators.
"We would also be able to share us unvoluntaryly from a majority of our civilian personnel and, as the reduction would be applied so fast, we should allow civilians to achieve the goal with a safety of limited probability. "
"This change would destroy the faith of those who receive our military and seriously damage our alarm preparation."
The struggles were finally gathered,” said Panetta.
"When the war-time contingents in the anti-terrorism fight were not directly affected by the imposement, the severe invasion in the basic budget would affect the war force afternoon", warned Panetta.
"Personal settings were shorted, which would lead to delays in the settings and settings that support the war."
"The staff's holders would have shortened, which leads to late payments to war timers and would be cut off legal and political support."
The two senators answered Panetta 10 days ago and requested further details about the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of the Ministry of Defence would lead to a rapid decline of the United States as the leading military force of the world."
"We are closely against this dramatic act," the Senators said in a common statement on Monday when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is an outcome with which we can't live, and it's certainly nothing that you should be able to overcome us."
"The imposing is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and their entry should not be allowed."
Whether Paneta's letter and the new warnings of the senators will be increased by pressure on a compromise in the budget or strengthening the demands to remove the pentagon of turtle remains expected.
Panetta has increasedly expressed the possibilities, although he had been able to collect experiences with the budget in the Congress and in the White House before he came to the beach of the Pentecost, and he knows that he faces serious decisions.
On a press conference last week, the Minister of Defence was a deep picture, which could be predicted - an army with a shoe but without nuclear.
"It's a ship without matrosen."
"It's a brigade without munition."
"It's an air weapons weapons without sufficiently buried pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, a army of the castles, buildings and bombs, without sufficiently debt soldiers, which are able to fill the mission," said Panetta in his opening talk in Pentagon.
"It's a war which lacks it to moral and alarm preparation and which is not able to take it with potential enemies."
"You can actually be a foolish."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta introduced new details as "significate operational risks: delays in crisis times, conflicts and disasters, serious limitations of our global use and inclusiveness, which leads to an inacceptable risk in future war operations".
And Panetta said that some of the greatest defence projects could fall to the victim, including those who were already tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the fighter F35 Joint Stike Fighter, a planned new bomb flight, the next generation of ballist U-boats, the new littoral Combat Ship and the new ground fighting vehicle, the army and the marine, to replace the Humvee.
If you stop the further development and test of F35, this would result in the next 10 years until 80 billion dollars, but the preferenties say that it is an important step to be rebuilding, so that possible risks can be benefited from China and other enemy.
How to embrace a lie
A view of the current slaughter lines shows how carefully and widely are dispersed slogans and lies in daily life.
The Presidency Chamber of the Republican, Herman Cain, is working to make the accused of sexual appeal to many women, and both sides are opposed to the lies.
The leadership of the Penn State is accused of my mine, since it was able to retain reports after which a pensioned football trainer boys has sexually misused.
Last week, an open microphone was acknowledged when the French president Nikolas Sarkozy was claimed to the American President Barack Obama that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a lie.
Like destroying carrières and struggling countries.
The New York Congress Deputy and the Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner were angry when he had circumcisions, which were very fast opposed by uncommon evidence.
The previous Presidency candidate John Edwards is accused of the crimes in the campaign financed in relation to the discussion of an extraordinary business.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it has forgotten the media surrounded by President Bill Clinton when he lied during his second official period in the Oval Office on his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
History about sculptures in the school and at college tests are widely spread.
There were incidents in which teachers had provided the test responses to their own performance reviews.
Mentors who should teach the opposition, send a message that lies and smells are good.
How many explanations are we experienced?
Like studies, we lie each day between 10 and 200 times.
But many of these lies are as an emergency.
Another study shows that foreigners are opposed three times in the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
True to recognise or "Lumbling" is an important thing to learn for each person, and this is both of personal and professional reasons.
Because of a social game, such as Scharaden, where it is the goal to call you, it is the detriment of a severe knowledge that is based on scientific data that have been collected during the past six decades of universities, which carried out extensive research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physics.
A result of the research is that most old myths were distracted from the lie.
Lie to see one in the eyes.
They're wearing, smell, smelling, and not always calling.
However, it is not possible to conclude that these lies are hard to discover and to distract them.
A gentleman of lies can turn to the truth by learning something about the structure of the defence, the sweet face expressions, the question and the Timing.
I have been able to investigate the scientific results of the comprehensive and steady growing area of distortion for several years and it is clear that the elimination of an exclusion is a modern ability that is easy to learn and help us to be entitled in our complex world, especially if the establishment or question of persons or negotiations or management belongs to their own professional responsibility.
Good lies are very good to evaluate others whose interest is to spend and to control their own emotions, and they feel intuitively how they are treated by others.
Thanks to the research, the extreme people lie more often than introverted people, that men often "self-shaped" lies as women whose lies are more lies - in general they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people are less often angry than unmarried persons (and the lies they tell are mostly "fair lies").
We also know that if a person has been deceived as a wicked one, others feel less guilty to lie this person.
How do you understand if someone lies?
As first by observing the normal behavior of this person.
This is called "Baselining", the initial position.
It provides a reference point to the later evaluation of changes.
Watch the situation, the laugh, the stimulal quality of their trial person.
You should better know when a person normally triples with the foot, so that they do not accuse him to injustice when he triggers with the foot during a meeting.
Then take care of adverse addictions and irreversible behaviors.
Consider these advertisements as alarm glass that are terrible, not as a evidence of distortion.
Those who embrace, may be shocking if they try to remember their story. Perhaps they can show their feet in the direction of the door or spend in direction, change their position in a significant way or show a "speaking after the setting," this deep, relaxing switch and changing in the position when all hard questions are over.
The questions are often wrongly signaled that a seting discussion is about only to keep the view after the settings.
Besides, take care of the language of your trying person.
Scott Peterson's exhibiter is famous when he used the past form when he said that his killed wife was still alive and a national search for her.
Favorable people can also use a distance language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeat a cleft question in general.
The most commonly discovered signs are subtil.
Some people use "qualifiing language" when they answer a clever question: "Now... to tell you the truth ... as far as it is known to me ... according to the best knowledge and conscience."
The answer is more effective than guarding, often shocking the alarms.
There is no magician to discover lies, but you can learn abilities that are possible for distortion.
Thanks to these abilities, every one can become more rare for the victim of entrepreneurs, both in private and professional life.
Transformed plan of oil pipeline is processed after danger by delayed US authorisation
A few days after the Obama government threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline of Canada in the Golf of Mexico, which increased the workshops and at the same time swallowed environmental protection, it is trying to re-establish the Pipeline project to re-establish the project so that you can return to normality.
TransCanada said on Monday night that the planned pipeline will be killed from the environmentally sensitive area of the sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the parliamental building of Nebraska.
Alex Parabax of TransCanada said that the company is still reliable, which is finally approved by the pipeline, even with another history.
This was the case after an announcement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the past week after a decision on federal approval for the project, until the new event is checked, which is the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala acquire, a large subwater service.
"This is a step forward," said the Republicn Lee Terry, a Republican of Nebraska, against Fox News.
The new environment review, which has been ordered by the Foreign Minister, may take a decision up to 2013, after the elections in the coming year, even if the officials lie that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama explained in a written statement that the decision was a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and said to support it.
The 1700-mile pipeline was connected to the Golf of Mexico.
She would pump 700,000 barrel oil per day from the Alberta province to the raffineries in Texas.
The Pipeline should go through six States.
Environmental protectioners hate them, but they love the job markets, because they believe that the Pipeline makes 20,000 jobs.
However, the legislators Nebraskas, which are against the plan, derogate the laws to oblige a derogation from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala acquire, a main source of drinking water and despower.
The current study on the impact of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project had just a little impact on the environment, but the source of energy economy indicates that the main examinator of the Ministry has requested a separate area of the review procedure, which focused on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist who was established by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was 2008 by Hillary Clinton, was in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether an undertaking employed to carry out the original study was an inadequate choice since it is connected to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused of being a little kid of fear
A New York family states that the Disco-Diva Patti LaBelle had got an accident in the lobby of her Manhattan buildings that had been in fear of her little daughter.
The Tirade of the "Lady Marmalade" speaker made the 18 months old Genevieve Monk so fear that they suffered from "reasoned personality changes, sleeping" and "reasoned fear against foreigners", said their family before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on 10 November last year when the workshop Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, was a child farmer, and Genevieve wanted to attack a family flight.
While Kevin Monk bought the car, Roseanna Monk went with the pocket and Genevieve on the arm into the lobby building at the Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she keeped near the door and stopped her daughter for a moment.
"Another one looked behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes," and I went to take her back to the arm," she said.
LaBelle encouraged the pregnant woman to smile.
"He said in a aggressive sound, "You should not leave your daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I said to her, "I don't care what you're saying or thinking."
She was angry and started to shut up - she used the F word and the A word and became very...
She had a glass water in the hand, and she began to smell water from the flat on me.
She said Genevieve would have become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "See what you've done with my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBelle turned up on the mother who still stood Genevieve on the arm, and had to keep up from their guiding and to a waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The baby cryed so much that it had to be delivered, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family asked for apologize, but no answer was received.
The lawyer and representative did not respond to calls for an opinion.
The complaint is based on a not closely specific damage, but the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis, said that he does not take account of the honour and the family plan, the money they get, the child cancer aid.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take the responsibility for her behavior," said Davids.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely inacceptable, especially if it is put to a child farmer towards the day that takes 18 months old baby on the arm."
Climate climate visions raise the economy
In the first year, in the Government of Mario López Valdez, the unemployment and black work in Sinaloa increased while foreign investments turned back and the economy was stable.
The 2011 economic history of Sinaloas will be remembered. It is the first year in Mario López Valdez, who is called himself as the initiative of the Wanderer, and great hopes on the economic growth, is at the government. However, the climate dimensions can not be the speech of growth, but the most important economic indicators are deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February have not only caused losses in millions of agricultural, but also the growth of the state economy in closely limits, and in the first fourth year, an overall decline of economic activity was of 3,6% mainly to the historical decrease of agricultural development to 31,16%, which has been decreased on further economic sectors.
According to a report issued by the Council of Mexico for Rural Sustentable on the impact of the Frost, 582.000 hectares of agricultural use of lands, which were completely destroyed by 78.03% and the remaining 21.07% were partly destroyed.
In the first fourth year, the unemployment rate of unemployment in the Mexican State continued to increase the unemployment in the Mexican State. In the first 40th year, the National Institute of Statistics y Geography observed a rapid increase in labour unemployment, since from January to March 55 053 people had no employment, which corresponds to 4,53% of the enterprises. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate increased from 5,28% and from July to 6,19% of which 74,000 unemployed in Sinaloa, which were more than 18 969 people in the first quarter year.
Decrease liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa in the year is back to several factors. The Economist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dekan of the Faculty for Economic and Social Sciences of the Autonome University (UAS), comments on the policy of public institutions indirectly explains the growing unemployment.
"What we now observe is an increase in the unemployment that has to do with several factors, and, among others, the flexibility losses on the market by means of the legislation adopted to combat the currency of money in the Congress, because for those who are prohibited to get $, it is not easy to let them work for investing or using something else," he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that the growing unemployment also involves a demographical factor.
"The number of persons who have left the country to search for work in the foreign country, especially in the United States, have been left, which is to return to the income problems and, on the other hand, because there is difficulty to find work. These people remain here and are looking for the jobs that can increase unemployment," he said.
Black work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is still more difficult when you take into account the high part of black work, which includes INEGI 60.38% of the employees in the country who are working without paying into the social insurance cases.
Labour unemployment and black work are the lowest losses in Mexico, in accordance with the statistics of the Institute of Mexico del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Insurance Statute) and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Prevision (Regissions for Labour and Social Care in Mexico).
The average month income of workers in Sinaloa was until September 5352 Pesos, which is much less than the average public average of 7375 pesos.
ADI decline
In addition to the decrease of economic activity and the growing unemployment, in 2011, the strongest decline of foreign direct investment (ADI) in the last ten years is registered. According to the Secretaria de Economyia (State Economic Authority) ADI from January to June 630 597, which is 87.74 per cent compared to the $5.143 312 for the same period.
The Government Economy Development Secretariat (Economic Development Authority) is a total investment of 17 280 000 Peso in 2011, which is before all enterprises from the Territory Sector.
Debts
In view of the economic crisis, the country's government requested a credit in July at the National Congress of 3,000 000 Peso, which should be invested in the reactivation of the economy in infrastructure projects in the 18 communities.
Reactions
For the representatives of the entrepreneurship, Mario López's first government vulnerability was obvious.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the Câmara National de la Industry de la Transformation (National Chamber of Training Industry in Mexico) conveyed in 2011 that no effort was made to harmonize the views of the different sectors, including the country government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very powerful in this year. It must be hard to re-start the land that was lost in this year and we have to do twice in 2012. The efforts of all and in particular the progress of the well-organized government team are not sufficiently agreed to each other," he stated.
Late economic development
Loredo López expressed that events, as the Frost at the beginning of the year, slowed and delayed the economic development of the country.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, e.g. of the Frost. One of the most important effects is a short economy that is not sufficiently moved to re-use a economic dynamic that could produce a admissible flow of processes, products and services, so we will end the year far beyond our expectations."
Redefinition of vocational
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, Chairman of the Confederation Patronal de la Republic of Mexico (Mexicos) in Sinaloa, explained that the State should be given more dynamical activities.
"In general, we have observed that it was worked. We believe it is necessary to develop a long-term programme for re-determining economic profession and lines of the country, because it is important to activate all material and human resources Sinaloas," he said.
There's a lot to do
The Chairman of Coparmex stressed how important it is to develop a future perspective that brings the efforts of the government in better pools.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas, but the economic development has been advanced, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he explained.
He stressed that the current state force has made progress in the government.
"There are areas for which you can say that the government has been more treated, which I can say is that it was worked and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work before her", he said.
Prison by 8 kg Marihuana
For five years of prison and 100 days, a population of Navolato was convicted for the possession of eight kilos of Marihuana.
The State Authority of the Republic announced that the drug closing officer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a crime against the public health, here the certain possession of Marihuana.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I Act, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by mexican militarys at the supervision of the Cypriano Valdez road against the guard post No. 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug driver was in a white car where he stood a black stone in a box in the car and on the car, a small rucksack, where the militarys found eight kilos and 23 grams of Marihuana.
For this reason, the enquired product was sent to the judiciary of the district and the punishment remains in the full position.
Debts for construction work
The social manufacturers for migrants are in the programs Habbitat, Rescate de Spacios Públicas and 3x1 risks to be completed because of missing resources or only with great delay, Miguel Angel López Miranda said.
The head of the city's Social Development Authority explained that, although the construction programmes have already been continued, they are now in danger, since the Government has not paid the resources that the three programmes have exceeded 11 million weights.
He said that the overall investment in these three programs was almost 50 million peso, from which 25% goes to the State; until now only the Federation and the Community had been taxed on the construction funds, whereas a delay of the construction end was expected.
"12 million are supposed to be taxed, and although the year is over, they didn't give us a horse, and that, although they had to pay us a part in July," he said. "To be not too late, we've already started with the construction work, and they've been long-term, but we need the money."
He hoped that under the government of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State had not comply with its obligations, as the community had to take up a credit of seven million at the beginning of that government.
"It was so that in the last legislative period, because the State had not sufficient economic resources, and the programmes continued and we had to provide the resources that the State had not made to participate in these programmes in this year."
While the State authorities were obligation to pay these resources, he commented that the Minister for Administration and Finance was requested to accelerate administrative work and pay as soon as possible.
"After 12 million, they have to be taxed, and although the year is over, they didn't give us a cattle."
The Court authorises the transition to the digital television in Mexico for 2015
The transformation of similar to digital signals belongs to the most important changes in the last years of the world.
The Supreme Court of Justice of Mexico (SCJN) showed that the Constitution records contained by the Senate and the Deputy against the Pressidian Lace should be introduced, and the force to maintain similar signs on digital signals from 2021 to 2015, because of the lack of eight votes required for enforcement.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court of Justice, Juan Silva Meza, was the view that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed its responsibilities when he discovered the legislative decree with details on the switch on the terrestrial digital view.
This Decision was rejected by the Constitutional Strategy called by the Senate, since it did not receive the necessary majority of eight votes, so that the Court may decide on constitutionality or non-constitutionality.
In the project for the composition developed by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed to explain the Constitution Dedekre for the Constitution, as for which the radio and the television on regulations the Federal Commission of Telecommunications (Coffee) (Federal Commission for Telecommunication in Mexico) is responsible for which the Legislative Dedekt would oppose the Hierarchyan principles and the preservation of laws.
For the project only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero itself.
With this argument, both the Senator and the Deputy Chamber of Constitution claims against the Deputy of the Legislative Deputy, and the Minister Sánchez Cordero had no longer accepted the legislative decree and introduced all activities to establish digital transfer.
The Council also rejected the complaint submitted by the Deputy Chamber without taking place in the debate on the project, which also was responsible by Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In its contribution, the President expressed that it was not agreed with the arguments of the project, but in the sense that the Government of the country should not regulate the measures to take the public administration, with general rules.
"I also don't believe that if you would do this, it would affect the independence of the regulatory body", she also recalled that the planning of strategic policies, such as the telecommunication sector, is responsible for constitutional reasons for the central government, because it leads to state affairs.
The replacement of similar signals by digital is one of the most important changes that have occurred throughout the world in recent years, and it influences the improved use of the radio power spectrum, a increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The shift of the conversion, she said, was an impact of the use of digitalization, which is a decision in public interest, not only in technical perspectives, "involves economic, social, political and security aspects".
These matters, stressed, "If the operation of the whole system, in accordance with the principle of the economic leadership by the State, they included a group of features that have the Constitution in the hands of the central national government."
It recalled that many countries have already done the digital conversion by the government, although they had high-specificized institutions.
It is not possible to conclude that the government would enter into the competences of the Congress, because the laws adopted by the legislative legislation would hold".
The possibility of counting the stims in Michoacán is taken into consideration
According to the details of PREP, the difference between the first and the second place in the choice of the gubernur is about 27%, where 879 votes of total 6074 have not yet been paid.
In Michoacán's elections, the possibility of individual explanation of the stimm table is a reality, as in accordance with the data issued by the program de resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP) the difference between the first and second place of the gubernors is about 27%, while 879 votes of total 6074 have not yet been calculated.
In this regard, the President of the General Council of the Institute Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Angeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that the election office had adopted a number of arrangements for harmonization of the local rules with the Government's reforms in election matters in the past November.
It should be remembered that Michoacán, nor his political Constitution, nor his election law, nor his law, nor his election law had adapted the reforms adopted by the Congress, so that they had not entered into force at this election round.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional complaint submitted by the local legislative and judged the voice of the Ombudsman towards the Constitution reforms as "invalid and legal", since it did not have the right to "decide or a veto."
María de los Angeles Llanderal explained the possibility of individual votes that by adopting the Directives by the General Council of IEM, the local election authority could now be part of or fully counting the stimulus.
Thus, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more of the elected packages may not be paid to the results of the protocols; the vote number and calculation protocol is not attracted or is not in possession of the Chairman of the Electoral Committee or there are clear errors or amendments in the protocols.
Furthermore, the total explanation of the entirely completed election appearances may result when there is a distinction between the mobile winner and the one who is on the second place, which is equal or less than one percent, prescribed at the beginning of the meeting, is a express request of the Chairman of Coalition, which is the second candidate.
The vote can also be achieved in its entirety when a express request of a representative of the Party whose second candidate has become a second-party is excluded. In this case, the election package would be issued by a partial payment.
It is estimated that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation, where, according to PREP, the difference between the first and second place is almost 0.16%, although the votes of 129 are not yet calculated by a total of 923 election protocols.

In the mid-day education of the new Italian government
The designed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, is tomorrow with the President of Italy to propose this new government that has led to the crisis that Italy has led to the border of the Economic Summit.
The designed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, is tomorrow with the President of Italy to propose this new government that has led to the crisis that Italy has led to the border of the Economic Summit.
A message from the presidency was announced that the Monti called on Sunday would meet with the President of the State, Jorgio Napolitano, to confirm the government training.
It will be concluded that it will be a majority of a cabinet collected from Technokrates, although it is not clear, when the new Minister will come to his office.
Monti said he would present the President of the State the results of the discussions with the political parties on government training.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to be completed with these difficult times", said the former Commissioner of the EU to journalists.
Monti has not expressly confirmed the government training, but its comments show that the obstacles are overwhelming.
The "Rahmen is now well hidden", he added.
Monti has made it in less than three days to form a government, which is much less time than normal, while it fights Italy against a political and financial crisis that has led to the costs of debts in an uncertain amount.
The new government, conducted by the former commissariat Monti, must adopt a strong sphere package requested by the European politicians to re-established confidence in Italy.
The pressure on oil, which is on Monti, still increased by the deteriorate market position, as a result of the Italian State taxes for 10 years, with 7 per cent of interests, which corresponds to the position of Greece and Ireland to call the European Saving Screen.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian Industry Association Conf industry, shared the press after a meeting with Monte, with: "We said we would support this government according to all powers."
We believe that this government is the last opportunity that Italy comes out of this emergency situation.
The success events of Montis were significantly increased by the support of the PDL party of Silvio Berlusconi, which had to be returned after the crisis on Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are intended to make good results", said Angelino Alfano, secretariat of the Mediterranean.
The support of the PDL, the largest party of Italy, is essential, since many of its members have been expressed against a majority of the technological governments, which are just the Monti.
Support by Parliament
The new Government of Monti needs a strong parliamentary support to implement the possibly unpleasant speech measures.
Reverse against its efforts or the restraints of reform could again affect a deterioration of the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks indicates that a false Montis is a disaster, also a press.
Monti began on Monday with its debates with political parties, workshops and entrepreneurs and youth organizations.
The service provider shall be closed.
Monti was appointed this Sunday of Napolitano, who, as a response to the crisis, set a extremely rapid government exchange in Gang.
Following recent discussions against the end of the last week, as known as Berlusconi would return, the costs of the Italian states were re-equity of critical borders resulting in insecurity of the success of the new Minister.
An Italian savings with a State debt of EUR 1.8 billion would be too much for the current EU savings scheme.
Monti said that his government should continue to the following elections that would be held in 2013, although the predicts that the politicians would only give him time to implement reforms instead of providing elections.
Monti expressed that he would like to take politicians in his box, but the major parties have a view that this should only be from technicians, a reference to their concerns in view of the procedure laid down by the press of the financial markets.
Political sources point out that mutual injustices and inconsistence between the parties make complicated the participation of persons from political life.

In addition, experiences with the Spanish Fury in complex divorce games at Eurocup and the football world masterships.

The Pentett entered Costa Rica in his tour to celebrate his twenty-year-old existence.
"To play in Costa Rica is a dream that is realized."
In the exclusive conversation with Viva, the Basist Jeff Ament von Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give it on Sunday at the National Stadium one of its best concerts.
More than 20 years were expected, but the band assures that they have a dream when they play in Costa Rica.
The assurance of the Basist and Co-funder of the group, Jeff Ament, gave Viva last week from Brazil a exclusive interview.
The band is located in the South America's part of its tour to celebrate its twenty-year-old existence and on Sunday 20, they make their only stop in Central America.
To this day, they take place from 19.30 a.m. in the National Stadium together with the The X band from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You read a outcome from the conversation to find its complete post in the online output of La Nation.
For your coarcan fans, a dream is made when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what this means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that also realizes for us.
It's just the second time we play in South and Mediterranean, and it's been great until now.
I've been just once for a vacation in Costa Rica. It's a beautiful country that we're going to stay there for a few days.
For us, it's funny to bring our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are totally given. You experience the days before the concert.
What do you say your most excited fans?
Thank you for staying on our side all these years.
We used almost 21 years until we came to Costa Rica.
Some people even think that your concert will become the greatest show of the year.
Isn't it a little pressure from your visit?
Some of the most beautiful shows we have included in the last 21 years have been found in the last two weeks.
We've played a few Rises shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that those who made us good for this concert in Costa Rica.
Indeed, we have a lust to play there.
We love this country, we're pleased to surveilla and are deceased by the dschungel. For this, Costa Rica belongs to the best countries of the world.
How have you learned Costa Rica and his waves to surfen?
Many of our friends are Surfer and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo where the waves are simply unproposed.
My friends have always traveled to the surf to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. With Mexico, they are the wonderful areas of surfing. In this way, we have learned about people who love the surfen.
With a view of the tour you have offered riesen show with many songs.
What plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there, we're not going to make any borders.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and wide repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I believe this is partly because we have nine plates and can play more than 120 songs. Everybody likes another song, so that the decision we play each other is not easy.
If we haven't played two or three songs in the repertoire, we can get our concentration better and they surprise us because they call us the reasons for remembering why these songs have fallen to us. On the other hand, they could be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I believe, so also for the public.
With this tour you celebrate your 20-year-old history.
If you look back, are you hard to believe your success?
Yeah, total.
First, I believe that no one of us has imagined to play in a great rock band, and that's also over 20 years. It works like a dream.
We also put on these blessings and find it great, too, to make music together now.
We like and are encouraged to make music.
We have a chance to go to the place of the world that we always wanted to visit.
The things couldn't be better.
What does it mean to have active participation in the birthtime of the grung?
It has always been a honour to belong to this group of big bands.
We are well enjoyed with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and worthless when a movement from a group of friends comes from.
A band is out of a city, but it's already uncommon when five or ten groups come from the same city simultaneously.
We are proud of it and we feel honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we're still playing together.
In the last year we were on a festival with Alice in Chains and Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on her tour. We are still happy to be with them all and it is honored to be part of this deceased Seattle Sound.
It is also very uncomfortable that a band as your band has remained together with the same musicians so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) had been with us 13 years ago. It's just a lot more time than many bands.
First of all, I believe that we all are happy to be in life and also to care for each other.
We are all close friends, because they have opened musical ways that each individual gives the freedom to experimentate.
One trusts the other and the music, it couldn't be better to go.
Your relationship with the spirit has not always been easy. On the other hand, you could always do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we have grown has made it easier to find a balance.
We make sure not to be too often on Tournee, because it's too easy to lose this game with rich people that love your music.
As long as you think that people have come because of the music, you remember that you have the music and what they've called in life, you have to be a famous rock star, and that's never interested in us.
What memories do you have to your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we've written very good songs and at first it was great.
We were a band that never had issued a plate until the death of Andy (Androw Woods) for three years.
We were sweet about having been used as long as. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who built the band with us. When I hear a song or photos, I think about what was for an unbelieving man Andy and how he brought me to laugh. It was always a joy to go to work together, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person, and we missed him.
The domestic band Las Robertas is responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Do you think you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and then the band asked for opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups, and this band was pleasant to us. So we're going to see what Las Robertas can live. This will be quiet.
Why do you always change the text of Yellow Ledbetter when you play?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I don't know.
He sing him, and I think he sing the first thing to him.
From whom you have been influenced as a basist?
From so many+
For the first ones I got, they belong to Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
It's so many that I could talk about the basists that I got.
How did Pearl Jam have been able to keep the gangs live, although this isn't a modern appearance?
I think we're not all feeling very close to the word of Grunge.
When I think about it, I'm going to get the bands that I mentioned before, for example, Mudhoney, Soundgard, Nirvana and all the others who get up at the same time. If they are still important today, I'll find it great because it's good to hear this music and make bands like Mudhoney now better music than ever before.
At first her music was dark, now she's more positive.
Why?
This is interesting because I believe there are a few songs on the new album that can be easier, but there are also other songs like The Find or Just Breathe, which are covered as a very dark song, although they have some positive.
To the two, the tears came to me when I heard like Ed she played, it's very dark.
I think if you're older and something traumatic happens in your life, for example, if you lose a family member or a friend - you're going to influence your art creatures and your music and these two songs clearly for me.
But I am also thinking that you can be a happy man and even do dark music.

Alejandro Aguinaga, a member of the Congress and his personal doctor, said to the television that Fujimori had been investigated for three days in the Peruvian hospital Instituto National de Medicines Neoplásicas to determine the reason for his pain and loss of muscle in the lower body members.
Aguinaga commented that his view of Fujimorri could be inflicted for humanitarian reasons, but he did not want it because he was innocent for him.
He was operated four times of twin cancer and has lost 18 kg weight, and further diseases such as a serious erosive gastritis, a cyst in the skin skin, nierstones, blood pressure and transfusion problems were included in the skin.
Fujimori is located in the National Police Special Operations Directorate since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years of prison for the murder of 25 persons by the Peruvian army who was homely employed during his government period.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
Official regulations, as stated by the Uruguayn President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs, starts on Tuesday, in order to extend the trade between two countries and address political issues of the region
Mujica is the next midday with its mexican official Felipe Calderón, which will be the point of the Ukrainian president of its explaned terminal plans with politicians, business leaders and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayrs living in Mexico.
The discussion of both Presidents in the city of Guadalajara "approximately is the exchange of information on all policies between the two countries", announced the President of the South America country on his website.
According to local media, Mujica searched for the support of Calderon in relation to the case with France, when the French government head Nicolas Sarkozy was placed on the G20 summit in Cannes, the South American country on a list of tax paradise.
In his discours, Sarkozy threatened to exclude the countries still as tax paradise from the international community, which was rejected by Uruguay and made an application to his posters in the European country.
Since November, Mexico has been the G20 Presidency, a group of the most powerful level and industrial countries of the world. Since January this year, a Agreement on the exchange of tax information on the prevention of double meeting with the South America country.
In recent years, the Uruguay Government has tried to accelerate the concretization of agreements on the exchange of tax information in order to be eliminated from the "green list" of the OECD organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which are not all international standards for cooperation in fiscal matters.
A free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay, which has contributed to a growing trade exchange between the two countries since 2004.
The snuffle installer includes the third size of "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been struggling for the saving of Princess Peach from the clues of the bad bowzer for 25 years, but until now he never in three dimensions: "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the love of the girl in Stereo Technology.
The game that this month comes to the load themes of all the world has been assembled from the beginning to the properties of the tragable konsole named 3DS that can be played without a special bridge threedimensional.
"Marrio is the figure that must say how the stereoskopy works without brill", assured Omar Alvarez, responsible for the specialized print in Spain in the design of the video game in Madrid.
Alvarez explained that "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first video game of Nintendo, which has been developed from the beginning to this console", because until now they were successful items such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" adjustments already existing title.
The speaker of Nintendo stressed that, although it's three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D country" is a "exciting" video game that allows a fast, flexible game.
Alvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" two games received in one: the first part is "speak," to start the less shipped users.
Then the experts can turn to the different game levels that are always more difficult to do a "wide round".
Furthermore, users may, in real time, choose between a "agressive D" or one that is only the depth of the action. In order to overcome obstacles, without being victims of the "optical effects", however, must always be played threedimensional.
This super Marios flight in the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a tragable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo declines the fans of the Saga and repeats the success receipt of the last expenditure: The worst installer must overcome with dangerous platforms to free the princess Peach.
However, the player is in news with movements, environment, closures and enemies - and a "speakable" Luigi.
Colom offices for the delivery of Portillos to the United States
The President of Guatemala, Alvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday, that he would allow the extradition of the former Governors Alfonso Portillo to respond to the constitution of $70 million in the United States.
This ends the process on the request of the United States to extract Porillo so that it can be sent before it.
In a press conference, the Columbia confirmed its decision based on the independence of the Judiciary and the Government, taking into account that a complete court had already sent the extradition.
He pointed out that during his Government he did not meditate in court decisions and gave all the contracts to which he was informed.
Out of Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquin will be extracted for murder and serious body injury, Edgar Esterada Morales and Victor Esterada Paredes, both for drug traffic.
The Columbia's action is a government act which follows when all legal and constitutional entities are exempted to condemn the former President of the Statute (2000-2004).
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Porillo must be delivered when its statute is declared in Guatemala and guaranteed its human rights.
Portillo was released for the submission of 120 million Quetzales in the Ministry of Defence during his period of government, and this negotiation was predicted for the delivery, but the Minister residued and resigned the case to the new.
Trinijove has helped 6000 young people from the social exclusion
The organization was called to prevent the marginalization of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of life of the social aid organization Trinijove have resulted in important results: in this fourty-year years, 6000 young people have been supported by the social exclusion to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, hundreds of jobs created for this social group are created.
Last year, at a event in the former work buildings of Fabra i Coats, over 300 people participated, there was a balance.
Trinijove was called to help young people with low education, without work, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginality in 1986.
At the strict party in Sant Andreu, numerous responsibilities of institutions and institutions who have cooperated with the Agreement in these 25 years.
The participation of political representatives in various directions to the election camps was the inpartiality of the work done by Trinijove.
In addition to the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonome Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas and his preacher Jord Pujol took part in the festivals of the former Socialist Education Minister Ernest Maragall and the former citizensman and currently left-Green townrat Ricard Goma.
The large room of Fabra i Coats also visited the current Catalogue Minister for Sociales and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of the Social Work of Spain La Caxia, Jaume Lanaspa.
But he stressed that Trinijove was called in very difficult times and that today's times are not less complex, but he added that the work done until now "is a good basis".
For the Presidents of the Generalitate, Trinijove is an example that is aware of fighting against difficult circumstances and has a hope in difficult times.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the agreement and the work he does," he explained.
A placed house, in which the Riesen party was registered, was skilled
The householders had placed 11 of 13 apartments in the building at the street Balmes No 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve householders left the building afternoon without resistance.
Everything pointed out that the alpine rooms of the neighbors of the house No 51 have found a end on the street Balmes.
Twelve people were volunteerly left on midday the building that they had held illegally and organized huge festivals that had carried out neighborhood to destruction.
After the residence, the gateway was changed to avoid similar situation.
"The access will be controlled from now," the house manager confirmed.
The householders, who had placed 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest of the buildings - took the entire electrical facilities and part of the water supply. In addition, they used the walls and left all kinds of milk, especially doses with alcoholic drinks.
In the three lower stages, great party was celebrated, which duration up to two days and conducted the midders to disappear.
Besides the building there is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also damaged it.
Her ownster, Maria Pantinat, declared Europe Press that her business would return to 80% since the beginning of the household.
Discothek's owners pointed out that the householders made their unlawful competition because they sold the drinks to three euros, while they cost 10 euros in the discotheque.
Moreover, the owner of the free-time local was shown by the neighbors because of relaxation, while, according to their statement of the crowds, the visitors of the disk, but the householders, and in particular the guests of the festivals that were organized there, and the neighbouring neighbors were always more and longer in the last few weeks.
The responsibilities of the Discothec stated that the appropriation was so large that they agreed with the owner of the building to pay for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana also confirmed that in recent weeks they received more complaints from the neighbors.
The President of the PP (Partido Popular - Volkspartii) in the city Council of Barcelona, Alberto Fernández Díaz, requested the building immediately, and the problems of the civilian community, as well as the reception of the city garden.
He explained that before the summer, only one edition of the building had been placed, but in the last few months the householders were predicted in all the stages of the building and almost all the apartments were predicted. In some cases it was even shocked.
In this sense, he added that "It is necessary to put an end to the imprisonment and to interfere against the associational acts in the building."
Last night, another building was stolen in the city garden Nou Barris by the Catalonia police.
At 15.30 p.m. the police approached the Montral Street No. 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed how four people wanted to enter the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
The architects are agreed with the barriers on the honourary with the description.
The 16th Towers surveys the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the middle of the 1980s, as a high point of the disappeared Corporation Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its resignation on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona City.
He was even compared in numbers with the Central Park of New York.
With the start of the CMB in 1987, the park was back to the top level of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia belongs to the few who are not extended to the north-South direction, but to the top (gears) and below (Meer).
Collserolas' training as natural park plays with this idea.
As an example, the Central Park had no longer served, but Yellowstone with wild sweats in the role of the Yogibar.
So far, when the city was in September a rise book of 16 competitions, for more accessors to Collserola.
Uncertainly, a door refers to the concept of a park.
Anyway, it's like, or someone's planned to put the tower on the country.
The question is: Collserola, Park or Berg?
The description is not only from organizational view, but also in terms of reflection on the city, the conversation in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a recursive theme that can recur on the two members of this old box, which are covered in the depth.
And this is precisely the substance for one of the rare agreements between what three architects from Barcelona think about, and some university professors who have seen themselves on the project.
Michael Roldán, Daniel Model and Marta Bayona: The description is appropriate.
For Roldán "is necessary", after attacking the coast about the "Front on the mountain", as far as the discours of Ildefons Cerda, which was not exhausted over the green clouds.
"It should come from the principle that Barcelona's biggest park is.
Among other things, because he's good.
Collserola is more complex," Urges the architect, for which the title "Tore of Collserola" is a "lexical case" in itself: it should not be "represented as adjustments to a park, but as a restriction of areas where to be treated".
Model, like Roldán and Bayona with urban development experience, considers the proposal as a "intelligent challenge", which "also dangers".
The risks resulting in the "insecurity that brings up a public space today" after the experiences from the 1980s, which had their "skinsing" in the field of the Forum.
The first concern is the own limitation of what can be built.
"All things to limit always means to determine the next step," it is to overcome him, i.e..
"They must think about new urban planning instruments, because the current [as part of the General Metropolitano Plan (PGM)] can lead to a real disaster."
Model, who is closer to the question, means simplifying the page of Collserola, which is in direction to Vallesana, "supported as a park, which is not in the direction of Barcelona," and, for pure topographic reasons.
Model recalls that there is already a study from the Patronat de Collserola that should not "shoot on the shooting ears", although it is grateful to the city management that she gave his body the opportunity to interact on this project "in the first moment".
He also notes that near the mountain is the city of the letter that allows it to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "certainness" whether this technical profile is the multidisciplinary team called in life ("as the right," he says, "We should be a tool".
Bayona states that the answer to the question in the subscription of this article is complex, since a global view of Collserola was missing: "There were 16 competitions in the currency", he says, "to the axes of the mountain sea, but there is no length perspective that the area considers in its entirety."
This has resulted at least in his case that he participates in the 16 competitions.
On the other hand, the program and definition of a project for a port would be collected with the architecture of the gate.
Indeed, the city should ensure that the strikes are equipped directly over the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length, which depends on a weak transition between the city and the green zones.
Casino forbids Jonas Larrazábal, who is free
After 72 days, Sweden freed the volunteer of the Casino Red the brother of the Citizensman of Monterrey from the process which will lead to him because of a massive press.
After 72 days of prison, Manuel Jonas Larrazábal will be released, after the official of the Casino Red, before the second criminal court of the district, which has led to the process against the brother of Monterey's civil minister because of pressure.
Following the attack on the casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, owner of the Casino Red, a number of photos and videos where Manuel Jonás is to see him, which may lead to pay a money sum, so that the city management authorizes the secret operation of the reward house.
After the punishment, the State Authority opened a criminal procedure against the brother of the panistmanman who was arrested on 2 September for 30 days.
After four hours with the official of the Public Minister 3 in Delitos Patrimonial, he was placed in the Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Antiguo capital Barrio de la capital.
In this place, he remained 49 days after a second prison order, after the officers of the Public Minister had rejected the crimes because of the detention and organized crimes.
On October 19, he was transferred to Caderyta's arrest because he probably had the owner of the Casino Red with about a million pesos. However, he left only a few hours in the Mediterranean Security Trade, as murder threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the court proceedings as an insurance of the city prison of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, the secretariat of the Second Criminal Court of the district, Jorge Yánez, made him a sentence regulation, which stated that the investigation of almost two months later provides sufficient evidence to speak to Jonas for the payment of 1.5 million Pesos to the representatives of the Wedneshouse to open this opposite.
This Monday, the author of Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gómez, the Judge José Luis Pecina, invited the brother of the citizens to take the punishment for the next hour.
During the judiciary, Ramiro Arias asked the officer of the Court of Justice, García Gómez, whether he had denied the damage and whom the owner of the committee had expressed his forgiveness, but the lawyer returned the name.
According to the case of 197/2011, Jonas Larrazábal is free to speak, and, as follows, no punishment against the process is required, and no punishment is required.
Larrazabal Bretton was immediately set on free foot after the hearing of the author of the house against 15.50 p.m.
The judiciary, Jorge Yánez, went to the urban prison of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonas that he was freely spoken and to put his case on the dossiers.
He also informed him about the appropriate order for immediate freeze.
The Secretariat Dionisio Pérez Yacome is known about the accident where the government secretariat Francisco Blake and other seven people lived.
The Secretariat of Communications and Transports - SCT (Secretariat for Communication and Transport in Mexico) reported that the results of the accidents in which the government secretariat Francisco Blake Mora and other seven people lived, showing that the slaughter was directed against the ground, without that the pilot could lead a emergency.
In a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Yacome, Secretariat for Communication and Transport confirmed that the pilot had been confirmed before the starting, the conditions of warning were appropriate for the flight.
"The expert's content that the propeller floors had a contact with trees in 25 meters high, with the shooter losing the shooting, seems to indicate that helikopter had had several ground contacts."
He also explained that the Hubschrauder was built for 19 instances, so that he complied with all the conditions for the transport of the staff.
He also said that the investigations in the area where the machine had been discovered were not found Hub-crawling.
"A flights were not found at other places, which was the whole structure.
The slaughter was built for 19 instances, as it complied with all the conditions for the person's transport.
The area is covered by 7 to 30 degrees.
Today, it is priority to obtain the results of research as soon as possible, but these several months may, perhaps even one year.
On the other hand, Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Aeropuertos and Services Auxiliares (Secretariat for Aviation and Help Services in Mexico), firmed that the President of the State of Mayor had fled with a flight speed and the aircraft was slowly delayed.
"This information strengthens the acceptance that it was a normal aircraft operation at the time of the appeal."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Perez Yacome, took six relevant points that should be taken into account during the study:
View flight:
In accordance with the standards, it was a flight in accordance with the rules of the vision flight, which means that the unit should have been sufficiently viewed during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM constituted appropriate shift conditions at the start. During the continued flight on the border area between Mexico and Mexico, some deep light clouds were covered.
Selected flights:
It is possible that the manage has chosen a lower area in direction to the Cuernavaca Tal because of the clouds.
Introduction:
The main coordinates and the last radar record of the Hubschrauber agreed to. Maybe it had no control loss of the aircraft, nor a derogation of the flight route.
Residue of the rest of the flight in a limited area:
The information available to this day showed that the swimming shock was shocked from a direct and slower direction.
The template of the disappeared aircraft makes it possible that the swimming snake was shocked with its unreasoned structure on the ground.
No instructions on Brand or Explosion:
The rest of the flight offers an accident on the ground, nor closure on brand or on explosion.
The last research results indicated on several ground contacts.
The aircrafts were found at 9200 feet above the sea level, and the floor was shocked and a seven to three-year degrees was shocked.
The photos show the sequence in which the shooter probably went to break.
Some information shows that the slaughter could have had a number of ground contacts.
After a minimised search on a zone that was discovered by the accident, no aircraft could be found, which increased the acceptance of the unexpected aircraft structure against the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol to detect the gene for fertility
The Social Insurance Office of Mexico leads to a research project to detect the gene for fertility in children and adolescents supported by specialists of IPN.
The Instituto Mexicono del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Insurance Statute of Mexico) announced that it was a research project to discover the gene for fativity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetic of Features in Childness and Youth" which should be found with overweight.
Michael Cruz López, Head of the Medical Research Unit in Bioquímica (the Department for Medical Research, Biochemia, Headquarters of Biochemia) at the Clinic Hospital of Specialities of the Centre of Medico National Center of the 21th century stated that a interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, food specialists and social workers was established.
This team is supported by specialists and students of post-graduated studies at the National Institute of Health (INSP) and at the Centre for Investigation and Studies Avanzados (Cinvestav) of the National Political Institute (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interestors can come to the sports places of the IMSS in Mexico, where every Saturday at 8.00 p.m. tests are performed with children and adolescents.
He pointed out that the research on the sports site of Cuauhtemoc (West of the Federal State of Mexico) began and continued on the sport site of Nezahualcoyolt (the west of Mexico).
If the target of 500 to 600 researchers has been achieved, the study is continued on the sports place of Independence (south of the capital centre) and ended by Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He explained that the purpose of the study was the knowledge of the factors and the role of the genetics in connection with the development of fativity and the identification of risk factors of mexican children and adolescents to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
Within the World Diabetes’ Day, he stated that three thousand children and adolescents should be filled with comprehensive understanding and with the supervision of their parents’s foodstuffs.
You will also ask questions about their physical activity and their family diseases in order to control risk factors that may have diabetes or renal insufficiency.
He increased the measurement of research persons (length, size, thickness), its blood pressure and blood values such as the glucose level, triglycerid, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (use of the identification of genes in relation to fativity in the age of children).
Cruz López emphasized that this study would be carried out on the concern of the health personnel on the alarming increase of young people.
"The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in only six years, the percentage of fettlebig kids increased by 77% and by the girls with fativity has been 47%. The overweight has also been dramatically increased," stated the IMSS specialist.
He acknowledged that the search for genetic brands was found because the genetic history of the people of Mexico was different from the other people.
He acknowledged that a (e) Mexicoan (in) average of 65% of Indian and American, 30% of European and 5% of African displacement is reflected in the genes related to diabetes and overweight.
In general, he declared that the genetics of fatness were pressed in the incapacity to destroy the overwhelming of the energy taken to us, so that it was put into the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefits for the investigators were conducted in a comprehensive investigation of the children in which they would find whether they were a degree of overweight or fativity.
It would even investigate the event of dark skin varieties in the naked and in the internal arm (acanthosis), which indicates the probability of substance change disorders and diabetes in the pre-state.
All information would be treated confidently and communicated by the doctors in writing. The doctors explain all the results of the age and propose changes in the life system that are appropriate to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three fundamental factors responsible for overwhelming, fatigue and other chronic diseases: the lack of movement, which means the lack of movement every day, the most time of the day before the television and the use of transport, instead of walking short ways.
The high calorium invasion, which means an increased consumption of sugared drinks and coal hydrocarbons (Tamales, bread, pizza, Hamburger, etc.), and the genetics to be analyzed in this research project.
Asphalt of UNAM prevents slaughterers
Rafael Herrera, researchers at the University of Mexican Chemistry UNAM developed with polymers modified asphaltes to make the mixing more resistable to weather conditions and temperature changes
If the signs from the road bar, it would not be necessary to repair about 2000,000 swimming pools when the rain time at the UNAM University of Metropolitana del Valle de Mexico (State area of the Tals of Mexico), Rafael Herrera Nájera, researchers at the University of Chemistry (FQ) warned and safely warned that if the exhibition and maintenance of the slaughter, the number of slaughters are significantly reduced or even fully avoided.
In his presentation of the "Slaughter from technical vision", which he took to the chemical of the International Year, he knew that the laboratory for which he is responsible develops with polymers modified asphaltes to produce similar mixtures, which, however, represents a greater mechanical resistance in higher and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera said that this kind of modified asphaltes should be used in areas of extremely warm climate, such as in some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behaviour of the road ballet and to prevent the event of slaughterers.
He explained that the asphalt - the most severe part of the earth oil - is a coal water connection, one of which has a high molecular weight - the asphalts mentioned asphaltes - and the other part - are low - the malthens mentioned ashes.
Azolelastic behavior of the asphalt means that this is in high temperatures of almost 180 °C as a liquidity, with 120 °C it is very flexibility and almost 50°C, while it is blue at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt is not equal to the roads, but changes one day in depending on the shift conditions and temperature changes," the Chemistry reported.
The researcher of the FQ noted that the streets of Mexico-stadt had mostly been a flexible street ballot, which was set out of six materials, including the last three asphalts.
Between the top shoes, a shock of asphalt, which was covered from small, in asphalt and then fitted stones.
Each stone of this skin is assembled in asphalt.
If the vehicles are continued and generated by the forces, this switch allows a good power distribution on the road.
"If it would be modified asphalt, the forces would be better distributed", said the Chemistry engineer.
"Over the snake," he said, "when a last shoe that is called a trag shoe that consists of stones, that is, from sand, which was also assembled in Asphalt.
As this switch is in contact with the vehicle trails, they need a greater mechanical power than the switch and they must purify.
The majority of the forces are accepted and distributed to this road day, where the tractor needs to be maintained, and the material from which it exists, is necessary.
Weather conditions, especially temperature and temperature changes, are further important factors to take into account, in front of all things, the water," he said, "if it affects the behaviour of the behaviour.
When the shooting is shocked, water enters into the shoe and only gets difficult. This causes an indication of all the shoes of the road ballet, and then the appearance of slaughterers.
When a slagloch comes out, he said, "It will first be cut the shock, while the slaughter will only be affected, but the damage is not soon, but it is a process that should be maintained by appropriate maintenance programs."
The member of the National System of Investigators (National Research Systems Mexico) stated that the vehicle charge is a further important cause for the emergence of slaughterers, and therefore the thickness should always be in relation to the vehicle charge and should be assured that the ruling should be maintained for the prevention of frequencies drivers.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there were still many research works that were waiting for, for example, on asphalt emulsions that were already on the market in other countries, with which the slaughter was simply and without applying high temperatures.
What lacked the candidate of the Valle to be the new Columbia Miss?
Analysis of the factors that resulted in the fact that Melina Ramírez Serna did not receive the chrone of Miss Columbia.
El Valle receives his 14th missile.
Once again, Valle del Cauca was empty in the delivery of the Krone for Miss Columbian.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied to stand on the winner podium, to set up a silver crone and the band that she expressed as a new Columbia.
With the result of Cartagena, where Mrs Atlantico took the chrone and the cedar, the Department is already on 14 missiles and Melina on the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, which had closed the Crone. The declared Missiles: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domingguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Lea Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Conna Pindo (1990), Patricia Roberto (1993), Lorena Aljua (Galdela 2000), Orena Altalena (Gartalina) (Garfalena).
The great question, which many today, is: What was lacking?
Because the result corresponds to the decline of a great favorite that showed that she had everything available to be the new Colombian Miss. Nevertheless, she was chosen to the Queen of the Police and Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, title that also received the Beauty King Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and took the crown of Miss Columbia with her home.
The first factor, which is essential for the decision of the Jury to remind her to the first miss, is that she did not convince the answer to the question "What book has influenced you most and why?", which she was put by Martín Murillo Gómez by the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca answered the questionnaire:
"I read much, I believe very much in the literature, I think it's a kind of civilization, finally I believe that the book that made for my childhood the most strongest "The little prince" is a right deep book.
Today, I read 'Schuld and Sühne'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I just read a book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book, which is the 'leaderships'.
An answer that was on a little opposite, first because of the term “sik civilizing” and second, because she did not have explained concretely how it had influenced every way of her called book.
But after the end of the ceremony, Melina explained to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, what must happen.
And for all people, please read a little 'The little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the favorite of El Valle is burned.
A journalist from Bogota pointed out that the fact that she was the favorites that had received all the cases in advance all the prices (Gastronomie Competition Oster, public vote on the best handed cost and reina Madre), "the other candidates were inevitable, which stressed the Queen's Queen, which was therefore not able to explain on the wood."
And this was the first idea of the bathroom at the beach of Hilton's hotel and their two surroundings at the celebration.
Although she was safe with both, she lacked the strength and the sweet that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantic were able to look.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the "Como en house" program at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina has been enhanced for misconduct is that the candidate who wins most prices during the competition will eventually not be king.
Moreover, Vale went to the end of the press from the way - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jury about their interests in social work, which is finally the key of the national beauty competition.
It will be reasoned that two days before the collection of the international Jury Lucy Doughty, they searched for a woman who joined themselves in the social affairs of their country.
"The beauty is not enough for a Miss Columbia only. You must be shocking on the body and focusing on the social reputation that she had already worked before the competitive participation in projects," she explained.
It will also be shown that Valle had sinned with its defects of the grain and fibrose that you noticed in the magnificent, but this is contrary, because the jury chose it as a candidate for ‘natural beauty’ with a healthy body, good food habits and responsible physical work.
The trainer of the Queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, shows that Melina did not have the best body that it was better, "but her problem with the fibrose in the bottle that was honestly not to notice for me, pressed their number of points on the last day."
The journalist Guido Hoyos, from the Kromos magazine, believes that the error of the woman from Valle del Cauca had been the surgery attacks she had been understood.
"The operations are okay, but Vale didn't know how they should make it right.
Their body has never been their strong side, and this place had to pay them."
Because this price, who is forgiving the first time from the National Beauty Competition, was a green predict that should be true in the night. It was said that Raymundo Melina had given a comfort to not let it come in the Genuss of the Cross.
Not even if it is true or not, the fact is that Melina has come to its year of rule, not as Queen, but as princess, a position which you offer is the opportunity to represent the National Beauty Competition Columbias in one of the international competition.
However, she will be one of the Queens, who had come to the history, despite her overwhelming invasion for Cartagena.
So was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lophoskopist from Cali went to the story as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
Last November, a lophoskopist of the State Authority's investigation unit (CTI) from Cali was confirmed as the man who was the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armada Revolutionaryias de Colombia - Revolutionary forces of Colombia) by comparing the finger pressures.
From the seven lophoskopists in the CTI division, Eliazar González was working this week with a man from Puerto Tejada from 21 years of criminal investigation.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Choko, where he often had to leave himself in the dschungel five days, to reach the place where the bodies he should identify.
2000, he settled after Valle over and after completion of the necessary courses, he specialized on the lophoscopie, which is the investigation of the skin, which was issued, i.e. the hands and footages.
In the week of the use of Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was noted to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big one waited for him.
On Friday night, he flyed in the swimming pool of Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that the suspect was that one of the oldest guerrillas of the world could be able to take the ten-finger printer plate of Guillermo León Sáenz (of its actual name).
However, when he reached with the investigator the place in which the body was found, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, because this was not less than the forms he saw in the mass media.
He didn't have bart, was like a farmer of the area, didn't have a brill and was very dignified.
But the finger bridges do not lie.
Armed with a luxury, tinta, a plant class and a thick lamp compared to the finger pulses of the body with which on the printing plate.
He had seen the right thing, it was "Alfonso Cano".
On the same evening, the man of Puerto Tejada was responsible for the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzzon, to report that it was actually the head of the FARC.
Search for the search
It was very important for a dactylope from Sijín in Cali that was shared by President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the use of "cano".
Many people don't know our job.
Daktyloscopie is a exact science without error rate that may be a key factor in solving a crime.
Lophoskopists are not only identifiing bodys, supporting investigations in murder and rape and confirm the identity of the persons arrested.
In their prison, many criminals have false evidence papers or have no.
We'll take the finger bridges to find them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to shoot a part of a house with a shooting shooting wall, since the shooting was shocked in this place with his hand when he was shocked out a safe with a shock and money.
"When are difficult, because their surfaces are inadequate for the delay of fingers, but in this case we could take the impression of the whole hand and the criminal who had participated in several traces," he remembered.
With the finger presss, the murderers can also be loaded or painted.
Before short, a dead was discovered by snaps flanks.
In the investigation, a family member could be suspicioned, and indeed, a finger pressure agreed to the fleet.
Although this does not guarantee that it is about the murder, he will be linked to the place where the crime was started.
A CTI non-dacticist declared that "the finger pulses with chemical or physical reagents would be taken from the object."
When it appears, a plant cell or a band is used for mix.
Then the expressions are sent to Asif, that is the bank of infringement data, or at the standard of persons.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without proof papers", explained the CTI experts.
He said he wasn't all like it would be shown in the SCI TV series.
Just as it's not all gold that brillies, it's not all that you're drawing up, a finger impression.
However, it may be used when it is carried out a corresponding comparison.
The 'recommendations' calls for the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrates were rolled together on the succotti plate.
A majority came to the residence order and changed his location in a nearby park.
The members of the movement Ocupy Wall Street requested the New York authorities to find out when they tried again to join the Manhatten plate after they were buried from the place in the morning grain and tried to put another place on the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrates wanted to access to the Zuccotti plate, where they were able to make the "recommendations" the renewed cells in this place. During the time, a other part of the movement to the residence order and made a park in the northern city where it came to nine prisons.
"Our idea is that if the court doesn't allow us to camp on the place, we're assembling to another place and the battle with legal means to go back to the back, with seat-in and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the speakers of the movement "Ocupy Wall Street".
Bray concluded that the response of the "recommendations" to the place of its clamps, which was directly ordered by Michael Bloomberg, the Chief of New York, was before the court, where the judge Lucy Billings made a order that prohibited the violent location of the place and the demonstrators accepted the ceiling.
The "recommendations" also placed a new park that is connected to the crossing of the central Canal Street and the 6xth Avenue near the invasion of the Holland Tunnel, New York and New Jersey, and is the property of the Trinity Church.
They were able to stop the place at least one hour, but then the police came and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray couldn't give exact numbers. He assured the news agent Efe that he also saw several journalists with hands.
The organization assures that hundreds of people had been found in this place where a religious leaders had also been engaged as a sign of their support for the members of the movement and to communicate with the police.
In addition, the Succotti plate is closed in the expectation of a requested consultation still adopted for this service day, and for which the legality of the places in the morning green is to be analyzed.
Some of the demonstrates who were embarrassed by the place took photos of this kind of order and distributed them. They even gave them some police who waited for the place, which had resulted in "one small confusions" as Bray reported, who showed that some police were shocked by demonstrators.
The direct instruction prohibits the authorities to shoot members of Occupy Wall Street from the place, as well as the application of "the places adopted after the stipulation and prohibiting the demonstrates to return to the park with their cells and other things they had already been used."
Citizens Broomberg clearly states that the new opening of the place for public traffic and demonstrators was due to this arrangement. The demonstrators pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to resume again with cells and sleeps on this place.
The Citizensman defended personally the placement of the Succotti plate which was carried out in the morning grain, where almost 200 people were arrested, and that was decided because the demonstrates were "deleted to the right".
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to relocate the place, because it had changed in a place where people did not come to demonstration, but to break the laws and in some cases to add other people to harm, because "also some business had been threatened" and the inhabitants asked "to the quality of their life".
"The residence in the morning green was easier and shows that Bloomberg is interested in the protection of financial interests and not in the protection of the interests of North America workers," added the speaker of the movement that the Citizensman acknowledged "not respect the freedom of press".
The responsibilities of "Occupy Wall Street" informed that they thought to organize "great action" for Thursday, together with community organizations and organizations to remember the two months that the Protests have already been held since 17 September.
Pamela Anderson is in the TV Christmas show the young woman Maria
With Michael Bublé and other Canadian famous audience, she will be held in the TV program "It's a Russell Peter's Christmas" on 1 December.
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was the Assistant Tim Allens in "Home Improvement", a saving room in "Baywatch", Caninchen at "Playboy", the wife of the Rockmusiker Tommy Lee, and now the shopping players and models will be the young woman of the Canadian TV.
The private television CTV has known today that Anderson, together with the "crooner" (Balladens speakers) Michael Bubllé and other Canadian hostings on 1 December in the TV program "It's a Russell Peter's Christmas" and will have a special young woman Maria's life.
CTV today distributed pictures from the television program, in Anderson, the also for the distribution of a own pornos in the Internet, where she along with her former husband, the slaughter of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears - as a boyfriend Maria with a shoe in the shooting that Jesus is to be shown.
In the scene, Peters appears to be a famous Canadian committee of the Indian, who recently worked as a modern at the post "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" of Charlie Sheen, as a child of Jesus.
The Christmas program of CTV is not only on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian Single Bubllé, the Argentinian model in Buenos Aires, and the contrast is not far away.
Currently, Bubllé was called the North American Kim Kardashian as a "hour".
Japan will be reborn after earthquake
The GDP increases up to 1,5% thanks to the domestic consumption and ends the spirit of the free case from March at the beginning of March
Since March last, Japan's economy was paralyzed, which is still in the process of the destructive earthquake, which has entered into an atomic crisis, and the worst disaster that Japan had experienced in the second World War.
The first estimates of the government in Tokyo estimated the damage of $30,000,000, which seems to be decreased, despite the difficult world economy.
After three quarters of time, the information on the Bruto Inland Product was finally made to conclude this chapter: the GDP was up to 1,5% compared to the previous quarter and up to 6% of the quotas calculated at the year.
The value measured in the second quarter in Japan begins in March 2012 also means the fastest growth from January to March 2010.
The rebuilding may, in part, be declared by the machine sale for the reconstruction of areas degraded by the earthquake and the following Tsunami.
Indeed, undertakings increased their investment by 1,1% compared to the decline of 0.9% for capital installations registered from January to March, the first decline after six months of unsuccessful access.
However, the real change of the Japanese economy is not only based on key-based disorders that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructures.
In particular, Japan is expected by the development of the internal consumption, which currently represents 60% of the Japanese BIP.
This variable increased up to 1%, affected by growing expenditure for vehicles, travels and free-time jobs.
The Yen Style
Tokio has agreed to the internal market after the Yen - the Japanese currency - is in one of the "floor-floor-floor-foods" of the investors who are in front of the euro zone's debt crisis and the four-prognoses for the U.S.A., a privileg, which is like a Grabstone on the accounts of the export companies.
With a more deterioration currency, the products in the foreign are a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of the large technology producers.
For example, Toyota and Sony returned their weak business results from July to September to the notation of Yen.
While the markets continue to spend the EU's peripheral countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains careful.
"It must take care of the continuing risks, for example, of the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the overlaps in Thailand and the rapid evaluation of Yen," said the State Secretary for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa last night.
The perspectives are not really very humble.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) declared that most Member States had shown clearer signs for the delay of economic development in September.
The indicator, which predisposes the channels of the world economy, showed that the biggest economic potential would have taken the brems.
Because he closed to four tenth to 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The euro zone is even below this average value, which is at 100, after it is cut by eightteen points to 99.13 points.
Athen can reverse doubts
Papadimos says that the sperm measures would be adopted, but the conservatives will not be signed in writing agreements.
With the peripheral risk prices of the peripheral countries and the broad insecurity of Greece continues to be in the labyrinth that is the large European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consonance" of the new Greek transitional government is a reaction to the pressure from Brussels as a real conviction of political forces, it is slowly understood by facts.
During the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, last night showed that there were no alternatives to the structure reforms and that hundreds of days may be too short for their implementation, assured the leaders of the conservative Party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, that he supported the new spars and, in any case, his call for new elections to be taken back to the scheduled date of February 19th.
"The most important task of this government is the implementation of the decisions taken at the Summit of October 26," said Papadimos last night to open a parliamentary debate, which will be reached tomorrow with the new Government's trust vote.
The first initiatives are a package with 24 programmes for employment, reform of the discipline law for officials and new measures against tax interference.
Nevertheless, Samras reports the doubts in his position: "We have obligation to support the transitional government, but otherwise nothing."
The conservative leader had to decline a step closely with its challenge of the EU and the FMI, the institution that the 8000 million, the atmosphere urgently needed, has clearly shown that he would not have an obligation to clarify the fulfillment of the sperm measures.
But the European Commission, which has still been irritated because of the impact of the poker game with the Papandreu Referendum last night, has not been reiterated on its request: the economic aid would not be signed if the new government and leaders of the most Greek Greek Party would not sign a clear written agreement as soon as possible.
The speaker of the Economic Ministry, Amadeu Altafaj, declared that the inspectors of the Troika "soonly" returned to Athen to speak to the new government, "what for the payment of the sixth section" in high of 8000 million euros, although there is no final date.
The Greek kneel has still for a while.
"These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen emphasized the Spain's "prehering" position regarding this type of funding
Spain “the world has a priority position in the role of smaller finances”.
The Queen of Spain recalled last two decades that Spain has developed the second expenditure for this international cooperation in the last two decades, which "Women" is based on a "instruction for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for the whole humanity on the basis of confidence in humans".
The Queen's fiveth World Summit in Valladolid yesterday was convinced that it was "no doubt" that this kind of business would be "explicitly unnecessary" to achieve the Millennium Goals by the United Nations until 2015, and "in particular the target of the number of persons who have to live with income of less than one dollar a day, so under the "amusement limit".
Spain "speaks also" at the expansion of the beneficiary network "towards the last edge of the world and leads to this task responsiblely", noted the Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will be taken by the Summit to Thursday, "the creation of new capacity and better opportunities for the doctors, and in particular for women" as the primary beneficiary of these loans are guaranteed.
"We have signed many successes" and "we have a lot of challenges towards".
The Supple on Small Cross is not only a forum for debates, but also a platform for "third basic objectives".
The Queen stated that it would be aimed to have access to these financial services until the end of 2015 175 million families to the financial services and that 10 million of these budgets will be exceededing the poverty limits.
The concept of the small crowd is in Spain and the rest of the world on the way launched by Muhammad Yunus for years, which the Queen Sofia is a "act of justice and recognition".
The father of this financing instrument described it as a "excited idealist, who wrote the fight against poverty" and whose work has been known for 15 years when the Queen's travels to Bangladesh to learn the loan money strategy.
A year later, the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings at the Lake Beat Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. All of us have "to be able to observe a continuous development", the Queen, whose commitment to this project was introduced as a "familianoberhead" in Valladolid and as "First speaker of the Poor" last night.
Finally, the Queen Sofia finished their debate by an animating the attendants to participate in the debate and to find solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethics order"
The Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "ethic order" for the whole democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was an error to bind development aid at the time of economic booms, which is a "term obligation".
Jiménez was the view that the small crowd is a "premature and strict policy on the eradication of poverty", and that the governments of the industrial states should now work "more than" in solidarity criteria, and should not allow the solidarity of the crisis to be sacrificed.
For Spain, the smaller credit is one of the "the most important forms of development aid".
The State Secretariat for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, declared "the success", "marginalized" people, "the always standing before the doors closed" and the citizensman of Valladolid, France Javier León de la Riva, called the presences in a city, the "super Tower, cast by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to choose the EU's Chairpersons as a result of the general scheme.
The first day of the Conference of Christian Democratics (CDU on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, took place for Angela Merkel, Kansler and Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, without real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the programme, but has been implemented in the beginning, in particular in order to provide sufficient responsibilities to the activeists, which the Government's policy today and perhaps Italy as a lax.
The European Commission's Presidential proposal was almost unilaterally adopted by the Bureau.
Under 1001 delegates, only nine votes were voted, and ten were the vote.
The several minutes long-term Ovation, which had fallen on the basis of their interventions first Angela Merkel and some hours later Wolfgang Schauble, had no doubt on the three European financial ministers.
The main ideas of the Cancers - as well as the requests - are the following slogans: the answer to the crisis is not less, but more Europe.
It is not only because Europe's peace means, but also 'no million jobs are directly dependent on the euro'.
For the officers, "the time for an interruption in Europe."
This could be expressed by enhancing the amendment of the Lisbon Treaty on the budgetary policy of countries in the euro area, but it could also be a view to the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general timetable allocation."
This is, however, one of the proposals adopted by the Congress which were clearly Wolfgang Schauble Pate.
Of course, it's just little likely that the 47 are fast towards this revolution: the Great Britain is rejecting the matter, and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is the same view.
However, the milk stone is covered.
The delegates also rejected the proposal for a country of ECB in a excessive majority, in accordance with the flexibility of the individual economy, which apparently constituted a decrease in the position of Germany.
Consequently, the candidates in the framework of the climate within their party have strengthened the reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but have not been trying to win their congress on the costs of the "cleans" or the European countries who are in difficulty who would immediately criticize the arrogant Germany.
As far as the European appeal of the importance of the German-France friendship, Angela Merkel France does not call on the plan.
Not at least directly.
Because this remembers Leipzig two centuries ago, in the midst of a blue battle.
Factly one of the most deceased injury of the Napoleon army.
What represents fraud in nurses?
After family aid, UMP and the government are now attacked.
Nicolas Sarkozy will take place on Tuesday 15 November in Bordeaux, to visit a family aid case and to provide a talk on it, which has always been back from 2007 - the subject of the fight against social fraud and the economic dependance of the State.
In order to accompany this attack, which is intended to submit the economy in a illness test, on the other hand, however, it is not less preserved for a axis of the right presidency campaign, the majority will focus on workers' reports.
First with budgetary objectives: the Government aims to introduce a fourth quarter quarter before taking into account a hospital report on employees in the private sector.
A good German means that a nursed worker would lose the reward of four days without authorisation of the specific company, therefore at least 15% of its monthly income.
A measure that threatens the shadow to reproach in the daily period "Les Echos" but would help to bring $280 million.
And the more symbolic characters came into with another age: the State officials to place an unprofit carennial day in disease cases (there is there for them, in contrast to the three karendays in the private sector, no carenz duration).
While these issues are in the debate, the majority also decreased the topics of fraud, which are now engaged in the malnutrition associated with labour absent.
"Controlls will be more important, and moreover, they will be funded, if this is requested," warned Xavier Betrand on Sunday, 13 November before the rTL microphone.
As well as in other cases, the effects of this report in relation to the reality of predominant acts in the field of nursing are a little unproportional.
This is, in fact, already since 2002 the object of permanent observance, as well as political offences, which have led to the most common fruits.
The Frenchs are not more sick than people in other places in Europe.
However, we will first disagree with the country-wide numbers.
According to the country hospital CNAM, more than EUR 237 million were paid in 2006.
As regards the Economic Research and Documentation Institute of Health, daily deductions in 2008 were EUR 11,3 billion to 5% of health expenditure.
In this amount 46% of maternity losses and labour accidents and 54% of illness leaves, which is 6.2 billion euros.
And then 2,5% health expenditure.
In 2010, the Frenchs faced 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study of the Alma Consulting Group averaged only 14.5 hospital days.
A measured value that declares certain differences: another, in 2007 by Monster.com, the website for carriage planning, showed that 75% of the 40.000 inquired French employees had not been taken a single day of hospital.
Another study, present by the hospital insurance, reveals that 37% of illness reports in 2010 were shorter than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and a month, 15% between one and three months and 11% of them.
In comparison with their neighbors, French workers are therefore not more than employees in the different places of unemployment.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers of the French, State Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global decline rates (for sickness or otherwise) were oscilled, while in France between 10 and 11% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% to 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud of nurses represents a disappearing low share in black work.
With regard to the fraud, only a weak exma is reached here.
The strengthening of the legislation since 2002 makes it possible that there are systematic controls in disease reports exceeding 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (occupied high school for technicians and intellectual training) has found under 1.5 million controls that 13% of the 285,000 experienced, short-term reports heavyly in 37.050 cases were unjust or too long.
In the systematicly controlled disease cases of more than 45 days, at least 1,2 million 11% were "passed or unjusted" cases heavy 132,000.
In total, this is the case of 164,000 "unfair" cases of several millions of employees who have applied a hospital report.
A point representing only a weak abbreviation in respect of those of the black work.
According to the UMP, Dominica Tian, a reporter in July on this issue represents 9 to 15 billion euro tax profit cases a year, i.e. more than the total costs of daily loans, and therefore significantly more than the defraude in the last callers.
Papdemos: Greece should introduce a new adjustment plan
Greece needs a new adjustment programme for its economy.
This had announced on Monday 14 November of the Prime Minister Lucas Papademos before the Parliament in addition to the fact that his Government was not sufficient to achieve this task by the Union for hundreds of days.
"In order to continue to enhance the economy, we need to support our European partners and a new programme for budget adjustment", the Governing Chief stated in its first public talk at the opening of the debate on the confidence of Parliament at midday.
The implementation of the decisions taken on 27 October was the "the headquarters" of the new Government, as the participation of the country within the Eurozone has been added.
Indeed, Mr Papademos has planned to reduce the State deficit of the country to the 9% of the brutal domestic product from today to the end of the year, after that in 2010, 10,6% and 15,7% in 2009.
The rights reject the new spans.
Antonis Samras, the head of the right flight, had granted his approval to the already approved maturity measures in respect of an attempt to be income from the debt crisis, but predicted that his party would not be prepared to purchase an additional spamation.
"We will not vote for new measures", he said with a new deputy Assembly of its Party.
However, he was willing to declare the requirements of reducing budget deficit and debts, as well as the fight against abuse, which would be bound to the economic restructuring.
Olli Rehn, the Commissariat of the EU, who had prevented that IWF and the EU had not freed the necessary loans of 8 billion euros without written guarantees of all parties on their support of the planned maturity, responded that his word would be sufficient and that it would not be signed under the pressure of ooh.
Euthanasia and joined freedom must be legalized, so an expert body
Canadians live in refusal of the death, as provided by a report of the Kingdom Society of Canada
The body stated that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked together with painful treatment to prepare the best pain-free disorders, and that also depended on cancer cases.
The Canadian society lives in a refusal against death.
Only 9% of Canadians are actually allowed to talk to their doctor about conditions in which they want to die and have disposal for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of a substantive report of the Kingdom Society of Canada, which was involved in the six experts linked to various areas, including Ethics, Law and Medicine.
This body recommends that the Government amend the criminal law in order to allow joined suicide and Eutanasia where this election is taken, even for patients who are considered to be able to take such decision.
As a result, experts share a recent survey of the independent society of EIU which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the earthquake.
Although Canada has planned on 10th round, the study notes that "the medical disease of death in Canada has produced a culture that has feared the subject of death."
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to painful resources, so inform us of the experts appointed by the Kingdom Society of Canada.
And despite the major desire of Canadians to die home, however, 68.6% of these in the hospital.
From the whole country, the rate of death was higher than 86% in the hospital house in Quebec.
In the serious issue of Eutanasia and joint suicide, the advisers of the report on conclusions that the position of the federal government, which has already endorsed, have no amendments to the Criminal Act on Eutanasia and a joint suicide.
Now, however, there is no evidence that such discrimination would be in their application, such as the practice of Eutanasia or the accompanying suicide of non-competentious or non-acceptable persons.
On the contrary, more cases of such transmissions are seen in countries where Euthanasia and the joint suicide are not legalized, such as last night Jocelyn Downie, the secretariat of the report, confirmed in a teleconference.
"Euthansia is practitioned in Canada, where she is clearly illegal."
"Another joint suicide is practitioned in Canada, although this is clearly illegal", says Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians proposed the Euthanasia
We forgot that, according to an Angus Reid Reid investigation in 2010, 85% of the Canadians had been swept in favour of Euthanasia, since they are the view that they will allow people to smell their suffering at the end of their life.
And 66% believe that the content of a legitimacy of Eutania has no consequence to tell the message that life of older or lower people is less value.
As regards those who have already practied a joined suicide, the applicants feel that they should not be sentenced in criminal law.
With regard to the maintenance or vision of the resources in patients, the situation is less clearly, as the report providers.
They also in their recommendation registered that the criminal law should be indicated that the restraint of the funds for which a legal refusal has been proposed should not apply as criminal.
The expert body also calls for the task of the health experts to respect the resources at the end of life, and it should be afraid without criminal persecution.
The body declared that Governments, institutions of health care and doctors had cooperated in terms of painful treatment in order to provide the best painful means, and that is also out of cancer cases.
Lastly, the body calls for consideration at least in respect of the funds already used in the Canadian institutions for healthcare illnesses or lively declining measures, as these were to reduce physical pain and to affect the same procedures.
Reserves of other experts
Some experts on the legal area of health have already provided preserves on the conclusions of the expert report of the Kingdom Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschanmps, health-care specialist, has called the position of the reporting experts, among other things "extrem", as this is the Eutanasie practice in nurses in the end phase.
"This opens the challenges for a situation where each one who is life-free and older than 18 is to ask another person to help him at his self-mortality," says RA Descamps, who saw a collection of the report last night.
RA Descamps also emphasizes the rapporteurs to put the individual's own responsibility on all other values involved in the social impact of society.
But, as he says, give it "Redlines and obligations in a society".
Margaret Saturville, a specialist for health rights, has also expressed the conclusions of the report which it has referred to as "Pro-Euthanasie-Manifest".
Margaret Samrville, the member of the Kingdom Society of Canada, is particularly doubtful about the reports on non-proliferation of miscarriages in certain countries where Euthanasia and joint suicide are legalized, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The king of Jordan calls President Assad to shut up
Damaskus plans a "complott" to
Syria is an isolator
Partisans Baschar al-Assads have demonstrated last night before the authorities of the Authen Minister.
The diplomatic pressure on the Syrian Baschar al-Assads, which, however, is enhanced by Russia's support and a "complott" opposed to the country, has been strengthened last time.
Two days before the Syrian Liga through the Arab Liga, the European Union has decreased its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring countries of Syria, had made place for a departure from President Assad.
King Abdullah II. From Jordan on the eve of the former Arab Prime Minister, the President of Baschar al-Assad had requested his officer to put down in Syria, in which the fourty civilians and members of the government were already killed.
"There Baschar the interest of his country in his heart, so he would come out, but it should also create the necessary conditions for a new time of Syrian political life," says the king of Jordan, Nearland Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
The Turkish diplomate chief Ahmet Davidoglu, on the other hand, declared that since the beginning of the year the Syrian regime had not been successfully encouraging the Turkish communications survey.
"They in the Middle East who are not in peace with their people and are not able to be satisfied must go," he replied on Syria, the neighbouring country, to which Turkey takes a steady standing.
The United States welcomed the "reforcing consensus against Assad and the powers of the Syrian regime" in accordance with the decisions of the Arab Liga and of the European Union.
"International Community, the United States, the EU, the Arab Liga and countries such as Turkey have attacked a sound that has always been intensified in Syria," observes Mark Toner, a speaker of the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government power in the region of Dar'a in South Syria have been dead, so the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights OSDH declared.
Two other civilians, according to this NGO, had lived in the struggling city of Homs.
The Syrian Origin Trade Minister Walid al-Mullim, on a press conference, was viewed that the country's taxes were on the end of the crisis."
On the other hand, he reacts with emphasis on the decision of the Arab Liga, Damascus from his tasks, which means his evaluation after a " dangerous step".
"Don't submit Syria," he added under the participation, "the complots that would fail against Syria".
According to the decision on the suspension of Syria, the Arab Liga is currently investigating a "studio mechanism for civilians" and wished to release 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers in the country.
The French Minister of Authentication, Alan Juppee, also expressed himself in favour of the release of UNO observers in order to be protected by civilians before the pressures of the regime, following him in his "Parlania".
The Lega's audience-planned new Assembly is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan decided on 2 November, but in particular the strict, apparently displaced military wars from the armed cities and the release of demonstrates.
The Russian Authenic Minister Sergej Lawrow last night set the decision of the Arab Liga as "unjust" to make up aware of possible sanctions against Damascus, although China had already called for the implementation of the crisis development plan.

Monti demands the markets to patient and Italy to sacrifice
Mario Monteni, the future Italian government head, has asked the markets a little more time to build its stage and implement a program that requires "Opfer" to re-establish the lost creditability of Berlusconi during the last months.
Last night, the former Commissioner of the EU had held a negotiation with the political parties before the present meeting of workshops and workers.
It was his task to call a cabinet to Parliament, which is relatively strict from external technicians.
"Monti spoke of a major programme with a series of victims," says Francesco Nucara, one of the many smaller parliamentary groups who participated in the meetings, after he met with the official President of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Parliament, had, on the other hand, hoped that Mario Monti would make a vote to Parliament until Friday to ensure that the new Government has sufficient support.
The debates will be gathered in the presentation of a strict list submitted by Mr Monti, which will certainly be reached by a duty of ministers to the Head of State, Jergio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented that the strict nervousity of the Börsen and obligation markets requested their time.
In a democracy, there are certain deadlines to prepare a government and a government programme, he pointed out that it was "certain that the markets will be durable and comprehensive."
His order by the Presidents was welcomed by the markets, but the distress was renewed, especially after an unexpected industrial decline in the euro zone in September.
The officer of the Prime Minister had to establish a stage of existing technicians, although he had emphasized, to join the "politicers" also.
The new government should only be estimated until 2013, the date of the next Parliament's choice.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the President of the Chamber, the new Government should receive the evidence of confidence of Parliament until Friday.
Mr Monti has been obliged to work in all urgencys in the sense of the objective to make Italy as a "excited protagonist" in Europe.
A speaker of the European Commissioner Olli Rehn highlighted that "if our diagnosis against the Italian economy itself does not change, taking into account the new government."
The EU, which is convinced that Rome has its goal of the budgetary balance in 2013, despite the springlands covered in these last months, has requested, in particular, new illnesses.
Emma Marcegaglia,"Chefin des Chefs" Italy, who is meeting on Monti, also provides the need for economic recovery, and a country that has no growth to respect deficiencies."
Mr Monti, who is known for his skills and its independence as the Commission of the EU (1994-2004) is for a "epoking exchange" Italys after 17 years of "Berlusconismus"; the "Professor" symbolizes the "require of confidence" and a "other Italy" in the Leiture.
The great unknown one is the length of his stables.
President Napolitano would like to prevent the elections made by Italy from April 2012 to 200 billion euros of State obligations.
Russian researchers help the Iranian nuclear energy programme
A Russian scientist, Wyatscheslaw Danilenko, helped Iran to develop a nuclear weapons sponsor, thus confirmed on Monday a specialized, American NGO on nuclear risks.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS is based on the result of the recent report of the International Atomic Security Agency of AIEA and other documents from this UNO Agency to identify this scientist.
Last week, the IAEA had communicated its "principal concern" due to a "powered military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme.
According to the initial study of the IAEA documents, the ISIS born 1934 had apparently worked since the beginning of the 1960s over three decades in a Soviet Military Nuclear Centre in Tschejabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds generated by explosion.
1989 or 1991 he was going to leave the center to establish a company in Kiew which produces "Nano-Diamants".
The economic difficulties of his company had led him in 1995 to contact Iran's message in Ukraine.
Before his return to Russia, he has taken place in an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
The IAEA's last report stated that the Iranian development" of a nuclear presumption system is supported by the work of a foreign experts who had not only been involved in this technology but also on how a member of the Agency has shared its entire professional career on this technology directly in the military energy programme of its origin."
Anti-Islamic crimes and crimes have increased by 50%
Muslim crimes and crimes increased by 2009 to 2010, where other racial or religiously motivated violence crimes, according to the FBI statistics published at Monday at the same time, have been easy to return or only have been low.
According to these data, the total number of crimes prohibited against muslims from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010 had increased by 49% in 2010, with 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a decline of 4% against Jewish criminals and a global increase of 14% to anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hassmovitive crimes" has increased in very weak Maśe on 6.628 cases, including 47.3% by racial differences and 20% by religious differences of motivating criminals, such as the FBI.
"After a decrease in 2009, it is unfair to see these crimes and crimes again growing", the Human Rights Organization highlighted."The increase of anti-Islamian violence is particularly significant,” added the organization in a Communication.
"Human Rights First had long-term emphasized that violence against muslims should be considered to be considered as serious legislation against human rights," added Paul Legendre, responsible for the organization.
"The American Government can and should do more to combat these crimes," he further estimated that this could be implemented by improving the political situation against the "has crimes".
The "has crime" in the American Federal Law is a heritage from the era of the fight against civil rights.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther Kings to punish violence against race, skin color, religion or abuse, and now also include sexual perpetrations.
Twitter changes the platform and shades more Facebook
The Microblogging website Twitter has introduced changes on Monday in the presentation of its platform to enable its users in particular to observe the activities of those who follow their entries, which allows the service to be more different from Facebook.
The new tab "Activities" and a other "Name" makes better readily follow-up to the activities of other "Twitter", the Internet users whose messages you follow and follow your messages.
This allows us to discover whether they can follow their messages whether they are subscribed to new contributions, some messages, etc.
This new Twitter messagebot was tested before its general Internet distribution on Monday" in August at a low percentage of users', and the Twitter speaker Carolyn Penner acknowledged before the French Press Agency AFP.
Twitter was for its little instinctive functionality, including something elsterically amazing wordlaut (RT for the reference recurrence of the contributions of another person). followfriday to recommend following another user's happiness, thus opens a more wide public with a more comparable manuscript to the of the large public Facebook and Google+ networks.
In the network, users discussed with the help of certain "Tweets" via Internet about this innovation.
"This is inutile, strict and too much Facebook", writes @jemb123.
"The function" activity will help me follow some elements of my flux Twitters better", rewarded @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a 'Goldene Budgetary Rule' in the Constitution
The Government of the Great Social Democratic/Christian Coalition in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include a 'Goldene Budgetary Rule' in the Constitution to reduce public deficit and also a possible degradation of rating agencies in the Top of Austria (AAA).
It was the Social Democratic Officer Werner Faymann, who had announced this decision on the outcome of the Council of Ministers, although the public Austrian State debt is 74.6%, so it is noted that 60% of the criteria set by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debt level of countries such as Italy, Greece and Spain.
"If Austria don't cut the payability of AAA+ on AA+, we should pay more than three billion euros each year," said Michael Spindelegger, Vice-Cansler and Christian Democratic Democratic Minister.
Austria also calls for the Brussels Summit of the Euro Zone Member States on 26 October: the heads of State and Government had then requested the reducing of public deficit until the end of 2012 and a return to public balance in the Constitution or by adopting a equal law.
The measures taken here by the Austrian Government compared to the German model, since Germany was the first European country which had included such a "regule" in the Constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should be reduced to 0.75% of the brutal domestic product (BIP), and from 2017 the structural budget deficit of the State should not exceed 0.35% of the GDP, in spite of which regional countries should be compared to the Community budgets.
In 2020/21, it is intended to affect budgetary debt under the 60% criteria set by the Maastricht Agreement.
Starker Yen
Noda threatens a new intervention on monetary markets
The Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese official would re-interview the monetary markets if Yen should continue to increase.
"If we have a excessive volatility" in the changing course of Yen, we will also intervene as we did last time," Mr. Noda said in Senate.
On Thursday, the Yen was once close to the historical level, which the Japanese authorities had forced to intervention on October 31.
At that time, Tokyo had sold massive Yen against $1,000 to pay the Japanese duty value, which is to tax a new record value since 1945 against the dollar.
However, Yen has been regularly increased in this, baptized by buyers of investors who consider the Yen as "floor value" in these insecure times of global economic abuse and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar is falling on Tuesday under 77 yen, the euro is stolen under the symbolic milk of 105 Yen near the levels that the last intervention had triggered.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the $ 120 Yen noted more than 160 Yen.
This stroke fire of the japanese committee harms the exports of the archipelles, since it condemns the costs of the "Made in Japan" producers and reduces the income of Japanese companies from the foreign, as they are covered in country-reducing.
"Japan fights after the earthquake and the tsunami on March 11th, which has destroyed the Tohoku region, for its reconstruction," said Mr. Noda, who fears that the Yen's smooth could already kill the weak resurrection in the Keime.
The third economic world has gained the growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter to the first time in this year thanks to the spent-export increase and the consumption of the "plambed" budgets by the disaster.
However, the Prime Minister estimates that the smoking of Yen does not reflect the economic fundly Japans.
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, on the other hand, has opened a second-day meeting of the Bank of Japan on Tuesday, in order to take all remarkable measures to enhance the Yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, the representative Governor of the Institute, noted that the BJ has already introduced "approximate pieces" to read reliablely that no additional currencies should be expected at midnight.
At the end of October, the Bank had increased its State obligations purchase by 5,000 billion Yen (47 billion euros) to cut the 55,000 billion Yen (519 billion euros), which had been used for several purchases of financial titles to exceed the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Invasion fast in the height, burns make backsets
The risk of the debt crisis is uncertainly defined by the European identification numbers.
In spite of the office of the new government heads in Greece and Italy, as well as the best growth rates in France and Germany increased the rates of the defeated countries.
The burns, which are still concerned about the stability of the euro zone, also decreased this Sunday, on November 15, a little more in negative fils.
In Paris, the CAC lost at 10 a.m. at 1,4% and lost 3.064 points.
The dax in Frankfurt returned to 0.4%, London to 0.1%.
"On the basis of the new expenditure regarding the rates of State grants in which the global share markets continue to provide a part of their recent profits in difficulties.
"The capital leds are nervous and are very well conscious of the risk of shoot," says Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG marketets, referred to by the press agent Reuters.
The Börss in Tokyo, which, on the renewed fear of the market operators, in terms of capacity in Europe, had closed with a debt crisis of 0.7%.
""Japan has directed his eyes on Europe as the rest of the world, and the trade moves on a limited variation corridor, as long as investors have not evidence that the situation has stabilized", estimates Mitsushi Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This recovery of concerns about the future of the euro zone has damaged the unixed consumption that continues to be on the service day.
The euro moves from half months at its lower level.
On 10 p.m. the European Valuta was 1.3570 Dollar value, and it has therefore resulted in 0.4%.
According to the Börsenmakers, the CDU, a party of the Officer Angela Merkel, who was assembled at the Monday at the Congress, was returned to a request, especially for the possibility of the European Union in difficult countries to go out of the Euro Zone, without leaving the European Union.
The Italian and Spanish rates are far below the 6% green.
The Italian and Spain loans remain at a very threatening level.
This Sunday morning, the costs of Italian obligations were at 6,85%, which were 6.2% of the Spanish titles.
These trends of interest rates in the Southern countries, but also in France, continue to close the fears of investors.
The future Italian government, Mario Monteni, requested more time from the markets to restore the situation threatened by debt charge in Italy.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, has confirmed, on the other hand, the implementation of the decisions taken by the Euro Zone Summit on 27 October.
Spain is in the visibility of the markets, as the election of Parliament is held on Sunday in the country.
The interestshere ("expread") between the German and Spanish 10-year-old obligations have, however, reached a new historic high.
In expectation of growth rates in the euro zone
Statistically, France has registered a economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, which was a little better than 0.3% expected.
However, the InSEE Statistical Office had revised the lowness of the second quarter, with a minimum of 0.1% of the brutal domestic product (BIP) instead of a stagnation.
Indeed, it is the fourth quarter that the economic experts worried mostly.
Germany had to decrease a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first higher calculation of the whole euro zone will be expected at 11 p.m. in which the EU Commission warns before the risk of a renewed recession.
Energy Policy:
Facts should be blessed over dogs
There is a question that cannot be treated on the basis of short-term reviews or because of emotions, this is certainly the energy policy.
Availability and costs of electricity affects directly the purchase power and the competitiveness of the companies.
It is convenient to take an election meeting on this subject and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only take fruit when it examines the whole economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The Frenchs should based their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although seven billion people are on this planet, the demographic evolution has a duplication of electricity demand until 2050, there is no need to refusal to a large part of the world population to a vital element.
At the same time, we must smooth the relief of fossil resources in order to continue to produce continuously electricity without reducing the necessary need for greenhouse gas emissions, forgetting a subject that is gone from the environmental debate to combat climate irregularities.
The accident of Fukushima does not change this parameter.
Germany therefore continued to be isolated in its decision to reject nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium that undermines its decision of the need to find a substitutive source, nor in Switzerland that is just in mind to build nuclear powers of the last generation.
The Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, continue to follow their projects with a decision.
The United States have decided to join a new unit after Fukushima in their park by restarting the work of the Trie Mile Island, which has been suspended after the nuclear accident.
However, even if the German model directed to renewable energy sources is available as a model, the reality of the discurso is opposed.
The election in Berlin will be in the form of a defence of the electricity price, an enhanced energy dependence increased by the increased decline of import gases, especially from Russia, a increase in the CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal.
The totality of these unfortunate effects will be marked within less than months.
The Denmark case gives an appeal to think.
Denmark is one of the most intensive users of coal and gas, which is used with wind energy, and because of its CO2 emissions and its electricity prices, on the other hand, 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average value.
Thanks to the ability of our energy policy, our neighbors pay a 40% higher electricity calculation in contrast to our French budget.
Since the energy prices in the globalized economy represent a key role of competitiveness as well as an industrial stability plant on national grounds, the French companies have a benefit from the most favorable electricity in Europe.
Each significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore be a strong increase in the energy price, which will be readily read by the sincere explanations on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of the purchasing power to illusion.
Inquiries show that the price is a price, which is also unprecedented to pay the large majority of French people, as well as to how they can recognise the resistance to the principle of these energy sources.
We ensure that the energy policy of our country has enabled it to build an industrial trend with 125.00 direct and 40,000 induced jobs.
As a result of its strong export characters, it brings a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises to international markets and makes it a number of jobs in creators.
If France decided to increase the nuclear power, a major part of these SMEs would fall to victims and the annual 6 billion euros in investment and nuclear energy export would be more cumulative.
What electricity would be able to operate for sixty-year-old EPR when the decline of its producers is planned?
In order to solve the energy coherence, we must consider that there is little like a demon work a wonderful means for generating electricity.
The company developed by Areva, CO2 arms solutions to use nuclear power and renewable energy are complementing energy sources.
The highest security level is an absolute imperative for the nuclear power.
In France, we have carried out a security authority that has already undertaken compromise and transparent controls in existing works, such as the construction in Flamanville.
The working teams who have made a name because of their professionality are just to be seen by the security proposal.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents.
Only one, even though in three Mile Islands, is income under normal operation conditions, so he lost no consequences for human and environment.
In Tschernobyl, the drama was rebuilt by the reactor construction and indeed injured human faults.
In Fukushima some seems to forget that the accident of two natural disasters has never been called, which caused the death of several ten thousands.
The nuclear industry will also take its teachings out of this accident as they had done according to the two previously.
As a fruit of this action, as well as the cooperation of the security authorities of French and German operators and constructions of nuclear power works, the EPR makes a draft which allows him to resist to such phenomena.
As it is considered as a desirable value among the electronic technicians, a building in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by reading free stations to travel to the leading position in the unexpected nuclear development.
It is unreasonable and legitimate to search for the best energy book for our country, but it would be unresponsive to allow emotions, dogmen and parties to dominate a debate that also determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is Immigration Last or chance for the economy?
The immigration policy carried out under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized by old angles - the transfer of police, courts and administrative bodies because of one of the numbers subjected to the policy, the compatibility of this policy with the status of a "Landa of Human Rights", as it itself stated in France.
Recently, the appointment of foreign students had expressed the weekly views that the Ministry of Internal Affairs had proclaimed (see Libration of 23 May) that France had no talent, murder or Kelner needed from the foreign."
But this policy was only rarely analyzed by the economic perspective.
Indeed, this theme is an extensive consensus between the right and the left.
From the right side, the tone of Jacques Chirac was attacked in 1976, which stated that "900,000 unemployed people, including more than 2 million immigrated workers, should not be a problem for a country", from the left side by Michel Rocard, which was described in 1990, France could not take the whole poverty of the world."
A unique difference consists of the grain of green swimming movement
The fear of the national earth invasion by the Poland horns of clampers was shared by both right and left in 2005.
From the two camps, the immigrants were deemed to be the last for the economy and the French society.
The only difference is in the degree of the employee movement that you are deserved towards immigrants.
Francois Holland is limited in its programme on banks that point to partnership development allows to solve our "migration problems".
This idea of immigration as a problem may affect the choices, but it is economically costly.
Like the economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent work that combined the latest knowledge of immigration (Exceptive people: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 S.), exists a broad consensus among the specialists regarding the positive impact of immigrants's economic growth, loss and jobs in immigration countries.
Limiting immigration would reduce growth and damage the labour market situation.
The fears against the impact of migrants are based on the idea that these threats to the domestic workers, especially the less qualified, are to replace them by exercising their pressures on their wages.
However, the experience shows that immigrants are indeed more complete than the domestic salary workers, since they are employing difficulty professionals in sectors that are inevitably incompatible with the workplace.
The smaller qualified immigrant works in sectors that travel in domestic salary workers, who are qualified among immigrants, in dynamic sectors where training is not coherent to the job offer.
Positive Lohne effect
Similarly, a surgery would have difficulties to work in a country where a lack of assaultists, this complementarity also affects a positive effect of immigrant access to residents and national labour market situation.
John Peri has calculated this way that an increase of 1% of the immigrant fluctuation increases a combinated, long-term increase in real solutions between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And that without taking into account the fact that the diversity of the ideas made by immigrants is perceived and the economic growth (a high part of immigrant immigrants under American nobel prices; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net to social systems, in the European countries almost 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that a person who is inmigrated to Germany in a age of 30 years includes a net amount (minus expenditure) of the EUR 150,000 over the average of its lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished to join his mandates the lack of snippets" with the dents ".
However, these adverse denses, which should be decreased by immigrants, have achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has created democracy, and now remains to develop European democracy.
Democracy is a valuable good; also a remarkable good.
The European Continent should be able to remind himself of whom, after its introduction in the Athen, had been held over the 20th century over the tragedies of the First World War, the Totalism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece.
Some have certainly believed that it was rich to exercise the moral law, but in a way that could be the most direct way to obtain democracy every time over their enemies.
It was known from Napoleon to the small, that it was a character of the spiritkeeping.
The general election law, which represents the necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient for this, and may also be well-being for the "Strong instrument" as it expressed at that time by the Republican philosoph Etienne Vacherot.
No, democracy requires more: a public area, a public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of violence, training, clarification, economic and social community spirit, law practice.
The crisis in Europe, where we are, is an economic crisis, but it is also a very and most political and democracy crisis.
The change of the Greek Fair-Falsch-Referendum had, in this regard, doublely covered characters: once the need for a strong return of the policy, on the other hand, but also those of the concerning feeling of their inconsistence, their inconsistence.
This ambivalence should be considered overwhelmed.
It is true that the frontlines of the democratic fight today have been displaced, and that the Republicn soldiers, or at least most of them, do not live in the right direction.
We have nothing to win to deal with a success of the internal referencedum, which has been organized in dependence of the needs and in a rolled series.
A appearance to the European single manager or a swift with related eyes in the empty of the nationalist retreat: a great choice for the citizens of the State!
No, we want to have a hake, but a collective task, from full law, declared and steadfast, a choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - there is no longer anywhere to end the record - since there is only one crisis, and it is dominated in Europe.
It is all Europe, which is the dictate of the markets and the rating agencies, which leads to its earnest power and its lack of solidarity.
It's all Europe that has been encouraged at the international level.
It is concerned about the transmission of sovereignty in Europe - it is all Europe who lose his sovereignty, and thus each of the nations with him.
The urgency is to reverse the leadership of the European project.
Because it is located in the whole, whether Europeans reduce the last of their debts, free from the markets and can build a future through investments.
The expansion from the crisis has made decisions at European level, which can not be liked without total democracy, without safely bringing us to destruction.
After this proposal of Jacques Delors and the Socialists have been fighting long-termly, everyone today takes the European Economic Guide.
It's understood.
But without political integration and a greater democracy, as they propose citizens, would be a renewed tolerance and another gas.
We need to take a new stage of Europe's construction.
To leave the Republic in France, the fact that the Republic was to create the Republicns.
The revolution of interests alone could not provide sufficiently here.
It remains valid.
We need to form a better integrated Europe at the economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a politically politically democratic Europe, a truly European sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Uncontact" Chip cards will be generally used
The World Messe for Chipcards opens its tower on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in optimistic position.
The 2011 Eurosmart had to end with an increase in the 11% global sales of microprocessor cards (EC cards, SIM cards), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most attractive segment is the uncontact technology, which allows payments in public transports or compensation of purchase by making the card to a read device.
Over the one year ago, 320 million solds should be sold to the world 460 million uncontaminated chip cards this year!
Their market share should continue to increase (580 million units expected) in 2012 and represent more than 10% of the global Chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe wins with regard to the uncontact payment on grounds after the Asian Pacific region has been overlooked.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals are accepted.
In France, the starts are more important: only 400,000 uncontact vis cards have been distributed.
However, consumer markets make a smooth.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCards this year.
To overcome the speed of speed, the banks now need to pay their customers with these cards.
"Third large French financial institutions have forced themselves to join their customers in the future systematically bank cards belonging to a chip", states Gérard Neèboy, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
Bank test payment by phone
However, this is only a first step on the way to pay the future: the mobile phone.
A lowest percentage of the devices is equipped with the NFC technology required to implement these transactions (Near Field Communication).
"They have been able to forgive."
"and they should learn a real global development at least next year."
"We recall in 2012 with the sale of 80 to 120 million world units," says Marc Bertin, Chairman of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the initiative.
The Agricole Credit has announced last night the start of a test cycle in Caen, which will expire from December to June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees should be equipped with a capsule that allows free contact payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And last night the Generale Society had prepared the marketing of a offer that allows its customers to contact free payment via phone.
Terrorist frontier is understood from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is threatened by the relationship between Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram Sect.
The long-term relations between the terrorism group al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Sect Boko Haram seem to be confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Vice-Auyeminister Abdelkarded Messahel himself confirmed that Algier had achieved consciousness.
"The way to conduct both organizations and the relationships of secret services expressed a clear cooperation", he explained without further details.
Paris seems to make a similar analysis.
The investigations on the introduction of two French in the Niger held in January have been promoted by days.
Antoine de Léocor and Vincent Delory, in a restaurant in Niamey of attendants of the Aqmi, are to be killed at the same time as several of their departments on one operation performed by the French special units.
French and Nigerian investigators want to find several telephone chips that belonged to terrorists.
Terrorist acid
The analysis of the telephone calls leads to several contact partners stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI) the investigators, in particular the numbers of two talking partners, are interested in the investigators: a number leads to a Nigerian who has long-term in Mayduguri, a city in the north of Nigeria, which has held Boko Haram's vige; the other leads to a man who is close to the Aqmi and the Seats.
"This is a progress, however, you must expect clearly more investment before you can talk to an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"But it's thoughtable."
"Their years have been known that the sects of financial and intellectual support of Authen and that this is increasingly active," the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo decreased.
In these last months, these "subsidy services" were always more attracted in their course, as well as the discussions and the operational modes of Boko Harem, which now increased the addition of self-mortals, and the use of permanently complex spring substances, which have the same document as those used by Aqmi.
In order to start at Washington, the International Community has spent pressure on Abuja since this time to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have considered the grouping in fact a long time on the Community of illuminates, which should not be given a particular attention.
Speed Success
In Mayduguri in 2002, Boko Haram founded in a mosque, a school, and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Joseph - which means so much as "the western education is a damage" - follows the creation of a Islamic Emirat in the northern Nigerian Islamic Emirates.
In this unmediate region, the concentration has rapidly achieved success.
It policys and calls for strict compliance with the scratch, while its member aktivists in the struggle against the ungodly central government.
Attivists have first churches, bars and authorities in the visitor.
2009, the aktivists of Boko Haram were particularly active with their increased attacks against the Commissioners.
However, the reaction of Abuja is as commonly indifferented.
The army rounds the city, it is 800 dead.
The Mohammed Joseph taken in prison is killed in prison.
As a result, the seats will be radicular and leave their high-burgs in the north.
Last Christmas she was known to an attack in Jos, who asked 80 people to live, soon to another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram will be attributed to the accusation of a self-defended insured police headquarter in Abuja - the first of his type.
In August, the United Nations's local seat is a priority international goal.
The education of a terrorism axis in Africa, which is intended to lead from Mauretania to Somalia from all security experts.
While the Aqmi Mali and the Niger have taken the Somaliaers of al-Shabaab in Kenia, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the centre of the continent.
Last week, Alain Juppé has warned and was willing to share all the instructions.'
The world's council of the Republican Presidency candidates
Middle Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry reappraises in simplification and unknowledge about China, Iraq, as well as Israel's assistance.
Can a crisis-case American a complex world with easy to say: leads to adverse ideas?
If you listen to the Republican Presidency candidates so, the electioners could almost be impressed.
Since a few days, Middle Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their partners have repeated their statements and their statements regarding the Authen policy, traditionally republical strict point.
About China, Iran and Israel's help - often not understood - slogans.
The name of the "Grand Old Party" at the highest course, Romany, threatened Chinas to dig before the WTO and to defend the "producing manipulation" to the subject in a United States that is slowed by reducing all industrial sectors to Asia on the most important ones.
He said, "It's going to walk when this is to imply the introduction of a trade war."
John Huntsman, former messangers in China under Obama and the only candidate who seemed to have a vision of the Auoean policy, has just been cut the air on his emotions.
He had called to a handful but constructive conversation interchange with Peking (e.g. the current standing of Obamas).
But Huntsman will not be heard because he is able to spend in the deep of the opinion questions.
Reagan's Eben Image
Romney had also promised military strikes against Iran, if the sanctions should be abolished for the stopping of the nuclear programme.
"If I'd be chosen, I'll order Iran's content," he was sweet.
"If Obama re-selected, they get the bomb."
In addition, he promised Israel's strengthened military assistance and claimed Obama to remain responsible for this partner against commitments.
The employer Herman Cain, the second plated candidate, provides a decent knowledge of accounts to look.
Soon he called on to give the Chinese military threat to counteract because Peking's attempt to develop a nuclear weapons' - and it seemed to leave the fact that China has already been in the possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
The Technical Gouverneur Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military struggles against Iran, is on the other hand to be ready to take the American army in Mexico against drug cards.
The restraint undertaken by Obama 2009 on folter-measures against muma terrorismists was also encouraged by Cain, Perry and the candidation Michele Bachmann.
It is far away from John McCain, the Republic of the Republic of 2008, a audience political weight.
The current Presidency contracts, Reagan also have made simple ideas and even wins the cold war.
They call out that also Obama is an amateur and water had to give in his wine what was the subject of antiterror.
They hold right to the lack of his native conversation with the Iran, the special decline of his "Jungs" from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which also introduced the call of the weaknesses.
However, this impairment is not very unreasonable.
The population is higher than the positive balance of the national security of Obama, which has been excluded by Bin Laden.
Since Iraq, it is awaited by military interventions that lead to disappointment.
And Obama was more surprised by arguing that America should be rebuilt in economically to spend his leadership position into a new life.
North Stream, New Tower to Russian Gas in Europe
The North Stream Gasfer Guide, which runs on the east side of the East Sea and connects the Western Europe directly to Russia, was set into operation.
It has to provide gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas prom wanted to do this event with glance and Gloria.
Over 500 loaded guests, including four heads of State and Government, have the last service day at the East Sea Coast under the orchester switch and the involvement of the new gas supply North Stream, which are directly connected to Russia and Germany under the sea level.
The German officer Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medwedew, French Prime Minister François Filon, and his official Mark Rutte from the Netherlands, symbolically turned the tax of the Ventil, which transports Russian gas into the Western European network.
With the new gas management, 27.5 billion additional Russian gass are to be delivered to the Sankt Petersburg area with Mecklenburg pools in Western Europe.
A second guiding that allows a total delivery of 55 billion cubicmeters of gas - the equivalent of the total consumption of French - is to be completed at the end of 2012.
And you can already join the possibility of building a third leadership on other roads.
For Gazprom, the temporary and point-to-point finishes this huge building as a victory.
The project was strongly struggled in Poland and the Baltic States.
Indeed, the North Stream Pipeline will allow direct gas delivery to Germany, with the avoidance of any transaction by third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on the landway.
For this reason, these two countries lose a few of their powers: it will now be more difficult to perform pressure on Russia by threatening the access to Western European markets.
Warschau, in the most intensely involved in the debate, was not back to compare the North Stream Pipeline with a "new German-sowietic package" in connection with the university between Hitler and Stalin, in 1939, in Poland.
This means that the theme is politically sensitive.
Western Europe has gained a higher supply security through the promotion of this Russian project.
However, this is on costs of reintegration of European energy, since the project has struck a break between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has been finished in a few years to implement its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, Western countries that have strong gas consumption and their gas conditions to neighbour.
"This gas management is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new art that connects us in an organic way", confirmed François Filon in the involvement of the gas management by showing the importance of the large gas contracts as well as of political and economic sides.
All this declares the wide laugh of the many gasprom managers represented in Lubmin.
The construction of this gas management is also an extraordinary technology.
The underwater drive consists of a steel with a betonum measurement which it is intended to protect before ships cancers.
She's staying on the sea ground, in about 200 meters deep.
With their construction, mineral fields were to be evacuated from the Second World War.
"Ewa hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed." Jens Muller, speaker of the North Stream Society, accompanied.
Furthermore, enhanced measures for the protection of the Fauna and Flora were to be taken.
The drive is a long skin of metal, hard like 242 eggs that is cut over the entire length through nothing: nor by ventiles, nor garage stations.
The Swedish board was planned before the Coast of Sweden, but the project responsibilities have taken the distance because the Swedish were poorly concerned to see a Russian State society on a permanent way to seize its costs.
"In the case of a havary, we shoot the gas through less than one minute," precise Jens Muller.
In the case of a skin, the gas that is located in the gas guide is therefore escaped in the air.
However, this case is considered by the buildings only little likely, as Swiss has been estimated to be a responsibilities of a leak by 100,000 years.
The public supervision of the gas supply shall be assured by a underwater robber which is controlled by an marine ship, as well as by a device that circle within the gas supply.
It has the shape of a cigarre, mixing a metro of diameter, is introduced into the inside of the ring and continues to move through the gas pressure.
After three full days of the continued movement by conducting a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides exact information about the possible deformation of the metal at its arrival.
The gas management was designed to operate for 50 years without having to be subjected to the smallest repair.
The gas circle is completely guaranteed by pressure.
This covers 200 bars at the access, 100 bars to the exit site.
Five companies have joined their forces to carry out this project.
However, the management remains in the hand of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the share.
Furthermore, the German companies E. ON and BASF (i.e., 15,5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunia and the French company group GDF Suez (i.e. to 9%).
These five companies have established a company community called North Stream, which has been employed with the construction and operation of gas supply.
She has her sit in Switzerland, where tax is particularly favorable.
Gazprom has prevented the whole capacity of gas transport, such as the extendable twenty-year treaty.
"Gazprom is paying for the total capacity, even as the real transporting gas is deleted", precise Jens Müller.
The financing of the gas management construction was 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The whole work costs should be at 7.4 billion euros for both main guidelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment sum was 240 million.
The minority shareholders, however, are sure to recover their funds, as the gas prom is only the risk of debt.
The gas guide is accompanied to a sand, with kitchen controlled coast strike at Lubmin from the East Sea.
The 4.5 meters high Ventile are the gas output speeds.
Sensors meant pressure, temperature and other identification numbers of the incompatible gas before it is transferred to the German gas guide.
Since Tuesday, this terminal is delivered with a million cubic meters of Russian gas per hour.
In full capacity, this would be 3 million cubits per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a market notebook.
A Italian company called into life for about fifty years ago, Moleskine now wants to provide a new style to write.
It has a fleet of abenteues to be made with the writing hours in the appearance.
The Moleskine's notes book is easily recognisable, with its black, rectangular inband, his gummiband, the egg color pages, as upsets over time.
The Moleskine Notebook, however, has been established in 1997.
The Italian company mode, which has its seat in Milan, decided to bring a different design book on the market.
Maria Sebregondi, who was then expert of the company, is employed with the marketing of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an elderly produced production technology, called Mole Skin (Maulwurfshut), which is called a tree wollack, which is used for the use of powder bottles.
This kind of notebook was very requested by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has left a old and almost forgotten object that took place in the 20th century as Iono preguardist artist," explained Mary Sebregondi, who is now more Marken responsible for mode.
Success is involved.
Among 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% and are employed with a paragraph of 12.7 million pieces.
This is far away from the production of the first years where only 3.000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine occurs the Italian borders and is carried out in 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to provide a phantom image of the buyer, as the notebook also engages students and experts.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitical, cultural and offensive customers.
The small, Italian company, which was in its early 12 employees, is now employed by more than 100 employees and has more than two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company departs its notes in booking, on internet portals such as Fnac, in small butics of the city centres and understands to implement his identity.
"We are followed to the timegeist and his new writing needs, although e-mails are in place", explained Mary Sebregondi.
This cultural character is accompanied by the development of the Moleskine Company: recently, the Marke launched an exhibition named "Detour (Umweg)" in the architects and artists.
In August, the company also took a link to Leoparden patterns on the market on the film festival in Locarno.
Moleskine benefited from his success and this cultural age and understood to diversify its products: balls, terminal calendars, ballers, computer holes... The brand covers the entire band width of articles.
Success that brings the Neider to the plan: In April 2006, the SG Capital Europe's Investment Fund was purchased by the Holy Syntegra Capital, and thus made a new chapter in the history of Moleskine company.
Why does the unemployment rate remain at such high levels?
About 19% of the disabled persons are looking for a job.
Today the "15-week of work for disabilities" begins.
Despite the targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rates for disabled persons are still doubled as the average average: 19% of the unemployment of the total population is 9%.
Intuitive?
"No, so Eric Blanchet emphasizes the Director-General of the Association Adapt, which directs the "What the work for disabilities".
"The progress achieved within fifty years are significant."
"After the unemployment rate was not doubled, but three times so high."
"There is still a lot of things to do."
However, it must be said that for disabled unemployment, many obstacles continue to be continued before they get a job.
The elders are often known: 37% are older than 50 years (17% in average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them have no abstract and only 10,000 disabled students among 2,3 million students with higher education.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very wide: 53% in persons with disabilities against 38% in total.
In short, there are so many criteria that cause a renewed labour increase and which are the "concerning of the problem", so Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, a association that has helped the companies to purchase disadvantaged contractors in 1992.
So much to the sweet brems.
Keep the unexpected speaking, the spiritkeepings that are certain, but slowly continued.
A study carried out in April by the IMS Interpreter for the magazine La City, which the questionned managers have "a weak knowledge level relating to disabilities", which "transpresented" is "for persons in roles, psychological or intellectual minority".
The result is that private enterprises with more than 20 employees have still a wide way to achieve the target of 6% retailed contracts set out in a 1987 legislation.
These last numbers, from 2008, refer to a quota of 2,6%.
"We are now at 3%", reports Peter Blanc, Director-General of Agefiph, the organization who is employed, to take contributions from companies who mislead this law.
The proof: The number 'paymenting' centres have also reduced the amount of the payed amounts between 2007 and 2011, and the payment rate of 59.000 to 46.000 (and 606 to 480 million euros).
"The law of 2005, which provides contributions to increases, creates a strong pressure on the companies, explained Peter Blanc."
"But this improvement also expresses a real knowledge, especially in the largest companies groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the employees between 20 and 49 employees are undertaken, but 82% of employees with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What for a luck"
Before they were ready to offer the "Blue Service Managers (20:45), Eden Hazard and George's Leekens did not pursue their joy that they had brought the friendship game to them.
It would be too far to say that it had given a secret understanding between them, but the image speaks symbolic bands.
Site on the side of the Viewer Podium of the city of France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard had been able to smile good and please peace.
Five months after the temperamental spirit of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian national trainer had not been a lover regarding his person.
"I'm very satisfied with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to look forward," firms the shooting legs on the side of it.
What does the contrast between his show in club and national elf," It is a unit that justifys everything."
"In Lille, I'm talking about what's not the case in Belgium."
"There is time for me to go to the start."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, a free day against Romania in terms of the Matth against France, to finally frozen."
However, without leaveing the note of the "comfort".
The French nationality has been fired since the age of seven years, and his overwhelming field trails led between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This contributes to enhancement of the "unique" characters of this engagement.
Soviel in advance: "Mathieu (Debooky), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there."
"We've just walked through the way."
"Let them have to play means great luck!"
Leekens read on the other side with goodness "Stolz".
"The Holiness, a Galamatch."
"Stolz" also turns - in its property as "shore" - to confirm that France" has become a very high level, and that is little more than one year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Blanc has done a good job", he encouraged.
Although Belgium is missing in the next European mastership, the technician looks very well to share the flight with the blue (the French National Elf) ... and the direction of Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgian comes out of here," he stressed.
"We are planning a thing, the players are ambitioned, they're hungry."
"They will look at it at the previous games." The game is involved in France.
Portugal very confidence
The português office of Paul Bento views the retreat against Bosnia (22:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
In the game, two offices failed the ability.
"In the end of these 90 minutes we'll be a happy mansion and especially a happy country."
Paul Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no lowest flow of doubt that "La Selectciao", its national elf, for which he is responsible for the European Meeting since September 2010, will be qualified for 2012.
In fact, there are only 90 minutes of happiness for Portugal.
But there's a match to play, and to keep a enemy, that's Bosnian.
In view of the game (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the desires have not yet been fallen.
Portugal dominated more than a hour clearly the party, but the manage was not able to press the so important steel that had taken the pressure of her.
"This is a good result, however, that causes a certain risk, since we have not achieved a foreigner."
However, in their slightly shocking city de la Luz in Lisbon, the portugues are convinced to spend before a public, which should also be on the game, even if the party has been announced as "serely knapp", said the optimistic but clear Bento.
"We expect a very nice match, however, are perfectly convinced that the overhand can win", explained the 42-year-old Portuguese trainer.
"We still have a 50% opportunity to be involved in the Europe Meeting 2012", however, the followers of Carlos Queiroz.
The uncertainty on Friday in Bosnia forces the portugues to achieve and win a gate.
An indecision may already be sufficient to the bosniers who also need a gate.
"This is a good result, however, that causes a certain risk, since we have not achieved a foreigner", regrets Bento.
"We are present against a manage that has high technical quality and has many individual qualitys," he added.
As in Zenica, the portugues had been proposed to run the maximum pressure on the bosnier at the beginning to "no time to think."
A good idea, under the condition of being implemented this time.
