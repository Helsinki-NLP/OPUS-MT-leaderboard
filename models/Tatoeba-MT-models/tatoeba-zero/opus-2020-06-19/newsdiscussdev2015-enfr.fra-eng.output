It looks like it's a typical rumby club.
In an English university, maybe...
Nothing to see with the rumby clubs I know in NZ.
But that doesn't justify anything, right?
Of course not, but the premise that says it's known in the rushby is all of the...
Yes, we are not interromping the prayers of the musulmans and we are not cut the nail of someone during the drinking games (except if it is part of the game), but we are effectively pending in black for some of the nights dismissed.
I never played a drink game based on the Nazi theme.
Yeeha and Ride the Bus suffice.
I left a similar comment on the previous article because the language and the feelings expressed in the first year's prospect of students were very typical.
That says, this new information does not give me any doubt that they go far beyond the Misogyan mixtures and the blows under the imprisonment of the alcohol that are often associated with university rumby teams.
The incident with the Muslim students shows that they try to produce the maximum.
You really don't know anything to the rumby clubs.
But let's go, why let your damages and your stereotypes hinder the facts?
I think that the LSE Rúbi team is cut from old students from these schools for which the ruby of competition is a tradition.
Otherwise, old kids of the private.
Issues of very different environments than those playing in rumby in NZ, very different attitudes.
So, are the "misogyne funerals" acceptable?
It seems to be the rouby club of my university, I have never seen racial behavior, but the nucleus courses through the campus, the flight, the smuggling of goods and the misogynia were all part of the game.
Absolutely not.
I'm sorry I didn't have explained it in my last comment.
You can see it otherwise: tell you your own body itself is partly composed of this ancient water.
I'm going to win in seenity.
ancestral, therefore, also this interstellary cloud (eight, not traditional:)
@lux You haven't read the article: a small half of your skin water has over 4,6 billion years...
Yes, it can be a good thing when even considering that the fleet of the stairs has a medium more than 2,3 billion years of age, that is not so bad that
A sacred feet of nails to disasters and refrigerators of any pool that predicts the end of the oceans and water resources, while this water has always existed.
An unreasonable evidence that heat has been stopped 20 years ago (see the remarkable work of Serge Ferry financed by Total and Areva).
@manon too: What is a evidence of heating stopped?
I don't see the link.
I think Manon Troppo's comment is irone.
And for the second degree and the irony you have as a signaling?
So you do not understand a great thing about ecological problems.
It is not a question for the "katastrophists" as you are saying to worry about the destruction of the oceans but rather than the reduction of human water reserves (you know the milk water that represents less than 1% of the total water reserves on our planet).
And then more generally, it is not the most threatening climate refrigeration for our species, but especially the reduction of small or not renewable resources (gas, oil, rare metals) which support our more golden life modes.
As regards the study you quote and which you are doing the generous efforts to quote the source, it is naturally little doubt of the validity of the conclusion.
With regard to the soft water problems, I raise you the French are far from being concerned xD Then you have to stop considering the ecology as a fat dogm, the ozone swimming smell is being slowly referring to you (e.g. 100% to 2050 at the current rythm).
ecology yes, religiously dogmatic and irrelevant ecology, not thanks.
"And it must stop considering ecology as a fatal dogma, the ozone shooting is being able to refer calmly." Yes, finally it is not like it was a spontaneous movement that would not come from nothing.
@martin: I just want to specify that climate warming is a need for because if we escape CO2 too much our land is going to be like Venus.
A steel that through the oxygen action will capture the heat without released it and which in a swimming circle will accelerate the switch process explicitly.
Have someone seen direct action until now?
Or the lower sign indicated that 10 000 good men would come to the ground to plant trees and to do what a green army should be done, what could it be?
It's not me!
In the small brain of Abbott, maybe send the RAAF to the Middle East is its version of a direct action.
We're going to go back, that's sure.
When are they going to get out of the village's idiot?
The latest revelations that vegetation would consume 16 % of CO2 more than any climate model permits give priority to replantation.
It is not logical because CO2 is the food of plants that are most abundant in nature, and it is necessary to preserve the flower throughout the world.
It seems that this scientist fact has never been put on the plate.
Have you seen the green army somewhere?
Don't do anything, dear government.
CO2 levels increased from 280 ppm to 400 ppm and the rate is increased, your argument of plant food is only a falling distraction.
And before you start your blue against the wall Dooms, the most abundant green is not CO2, but nitrogen and sufre.
The most abundant of the biogenerated materials may be carbon, but it doesn't mean that it is the most abundant grain, so Silverhead's argument is fatal and worth being ridiculized.
Direct Action is a thick, because nothing can happen again.
The LandCare budget has been severely reduced, and this money is now expendied by the Green Army.
The problem is that instead of investing the money where it was most profitable, it is now invested where he will receive the most advertising to bring the liberals back to the marginal electors.
Your contribution, on the contrary, takes the price of ignorance, good champion.
SilverHead, when there are too many CO2 in the air, plants perform less than photosynthesis and contain less nutrients.
That means that animals and people must eat them in a much greater amount to benefit from their nutritional benefits.
The fact that this deputy is pueral is a clearness.
To date, it has not presented academic strict certificate that prevents the discharge of rules of XVIIe.
Indeed, it is incomprehensible to him and not Tevenoud, even though the AN Regulation is not a fiscal treaty.
That this lady in the whole case is not to his honor, it appears especially as the historical.
If Mitterrand had sent all those who pronounced Mitran...
I remember that during the debate on the feminization of the names, the "Academia" was offended: "I'll tell Mrs. the guard or guard of the Sceau" (which has never been employed by a woman).
Awesome!
"Political Alliance."
The swimming bag, the back corner of the Republic, the margot of the operating tangents, the illusion table, etc...
But the aren costs gladiators, people who take real risks, good grace, bad grace.
Qd the Phallocratic Umpiste sit on the label and Parliamentary regulation by turning to the + elementary civility in false ways, sanctions apply to him "the quality" for its partisan heading and the misuse of the political allies.
The behaviour of this Member is not normal or worthy of his position.
It makes a provocation to talk about him.
As far as he was unknown, he can now be honoured to be known as it is known for all cancer of a primary class.
The academy is good and the Members are sensitive to the pocket...
U.P. should be able to solve its internal problems and stop producing coacs and scandale.
The Academy has a good deal, especially when it is done to tell him what she doesn't say.
This deputy is a colleague in full adolescence crisis, which makes a provocation and whose fellow believers, in delegation, will see the Principal to cancelle the colleague hours.
and by defending it on the basis of a text they have not even read!
Women did not even represent 15 per cent of the signatories of the UMP tribe.
Mr. Judge, I call two experts that a few thousands of years separate.
That's why I like to pass time with the animals.
The joy they feel when they play is so clear and attractive.
Dogs, dauphins, otaries, horses, they do all stupid things for the simple joy that they're looking for them.
On the contrary, it seems that we had the majority of our 80 years to work, move us and make the shops.
What strange phase we have reached - we are able to multiply by two of our life periods, but we are going to pass the majority in the poor.
How did we come here?
Thanks to the illusion that is anthropomorphism.
The game is a metal communication.
Come on.
It's always a illusion.
Furthermore, the "communication" requires a shared symbol system.
A hard concept for you, maybe?
I think the concept of inter-specific communication is not compatible with your faith.
That's true.
I can see when a dog wants to play and I can communicate to the dog I would like to play – basic body language.
After that, there is a variable that indicates whether the game is a course, a object to go to search, etc.
It's not difficult and there's no anthropopomorphism – even though I'm welcomed to the idea that we're seeing a lot of conneries on animals that are in the course of playing, while they're just on communicating.
Perhaps the game is not just "utilized" (that may be, or not), it is just something that exists.
For example, David Graeber is the opinion that " There is a principle of play on the basis of any physical reality."
"If he had learned at the school that a woman is not an object, he might not have been violented." Maybe yes, hope makes life...
Thank you for giving you the opportunity to live, to be healthy and today to answer a article when you have to drink the information without reacting to you just 15 years ago.
In general, I am not against ideas, and I would even tend to be sufficiently encouraging by those who seem to be fooled first.
But when you see what many have held from their school education, especially among the most likely public to make women aggressions, my enthusiasm does not find the least start of an abortion point.
"The public is the most likely to make women attacks" would like to know a little more.
Or instead, no, it's good, we understand.
And yes, the reality doesn't always feel the rock, even though it does not match forcely to your thought schemes.
It is true that the dore youth of Neuilly and other beautiful neighbors do not listen much in class.
She prefers playing on her iphone6.
Evry's unarmed youth too!
If the reactions weren't reacted, Twitter would no longer propose to follow Le Pen and Sarko in the first choice.
I have learned nothing from all this at the school and I never violated anyone (and it's not in my intentions).
Do I think I'm lucky?
Unless I had parents to teach me some values....
The family-society is the learning of social life.
How to take the reading of life when we can't read?
Do young socialists go to bathroom schools to teach women's equality?
It would be more effective than make moral mounts on Twitter, but it should be out of beautiful neighbors...
Grow this campaign.
They're null all over, but to give moral lessons, it's still the best.
Everything looks like a photonic, but I want to see the bread in a cape.
There's a blue here on the fact to use his bread.
The article of this week isn't going to be a mole.
It's not the time to make smells around the bread, man!
A little sensitivity!
You have done a double word game with the word "naan" to refer to a grandma.
60 books for this?
It would not even be filled with a 90-year-old age in a retrait home.
How do we pay more, less in the seat?
Because the quality of experience is not necessarily measured to weight or number of heats, as the quality of a film or part is not determined by its length.
Yes, I agree with you.
But why should good food be served in parts that would not even satisfy a mine?
It has no sense, and it's just a delegated policy to buy you more plates.
Of course, it should not be like that.
The Sportsman in Seasalter at least is a very good restaurant where the parts and prices are both reasonably high.
You pay more because you've still hungry after several mini plates.
More you pay money, more you have chances to receive a part of a child with art in your seat.
At least they made the effort to put nappes.
So when I want to go to a decent restaurant in York, you're telling me I'd have to go to a restaurant in London.
Maybe you should try one of the many other (excellent) restaurants in York before decided that London is the only place on Earth where you can develop good plates?
Is Manif for everyone only a Catholic and Muslim movement.
Yes, that's good: a kind of assembly of homophobes.
But it's not just that.
There are also athies and humanists who do not want modern systems of "children manufacturing".
A child should not be high in a battery or manufactured by a technological device.
Battery driving?
From where you get this out.
And if you contest any technical intervention in the "fabrication", you must claim the prohibition of the PMA for historical pairs, that would be the worth of coherence.
I also surprised that the manif claims "for all" has not yet this logical return to its attractive catalogue.
It is precise that these are not the only Catholics that express: the other religions also, Jews, Muslims, Protestants.
This was put, it is even useful to remember that these different churches have been opposed to all the developments of the society: in 1865 (and I am joining G.
Kauffmann) an eve, Mr. Dupanloup was violently insured against the will of the gvt to grant girls to school just as "the family defence".
We're always in the same scheme.
And more recently, the same channels have run into the expansion of civilization and the destruction of the family when the school has become mixed.
This is the credit that you can grant to the positions of these people.
Don't need to be catho to identify the marketing of winds and kids...
This is in the right line of the decade of Western civilization, more and more contested by others!
For me, freedom stops to the ones of others: yes, at the recognition of homosexual couples who have the right to love both others.
But not tolerate that the child is a mixable object.
And this is also valid for GPA hesters.
I can't just love this guy, nor recognize his results.
If he had a better control of the ballon and knew that he could be a more popular player.
Furthermore, I am sure that any other attacker, in addition to Heskey, who plays so many matches for England, will cumulate a number of objectives.
Imagine how many targets Peter Crouch would have marked if you had given him more than 42 selections in national team...
I can't be in dealing with, at least not Categoricly:) Because this article speaks of the purposes he has marked, I will not talk to other things he brings, especially to ManUtd (which RvP, Mata, Kagawa did not bring or bring anything), but maybe that it would be another reason for which he has winned much more often than, let us say, Peter Crouch.
Botham77 hoddle1 October 07 October 2014 12h48 Recommendation 119 It's in the way to criticize Rooney at this time so you can forgive you to do it too.
This says it is good to take into account that since he signed with Manchester City in August 2011, Aguero marked 56 goals and makes 23 decisional passes in 93 matches.
At the same time, Wayne Rooney marked 59 targets and makes 32 decisional passes in 96 matches.
So many people will have to find another apology to take it to our Wazza because its field statistics are excellent.
Moreover, "Wazza" is a good reason to ridiculize it.
I am obliged to ask me whether you really look at the foot or if you think that Peter Crouch A) would be worth both selections that Rooney and B) would mark as much goals if he had so many selections.
I really don't understand where the criticism of Rooney's capacity as a footballer comes.
The hardest, it is to be regularly selected in the country's team for 13 years, and to continue...
Are you seriously comparing the football qualitys of Wayne Rooney to Peter Crouch?
Do you do this without blagueing?
There are really people completely on the mass.
Please also note for your government that Rooney has not always been the pre-center machine for English purposes during its carriage in the English team.
Instead of that, he played the previous retirement, the role of Beardsley/Sheringham.
He played behind players such as Michael Owen, Mr. Crouch that we mentioned above, Jermain Defoe, and more recently Daniel Sturridge.
You've forced to write this in blaguing.
In a country where the weapons port is tolerated and in a state where 71 per cent of people have a weapon, I find it totally szyzofren and paradoxical as a way to process.
And even those of this school are not just in all agreements with the U.S. weapons port permit!
the use of crayon is always self-suicided.
Stop the kitchen: the girl's 5-year-old.
How many kids play with facial guns at this age of our home?
Is that in fact the murderers in power for the same thing?
Although the weapons port is in the United States Constitution and that this is strongly influenced by the country's culture, I do not believe that rich children are sensitively different from ours.
A little good sense and reason to care.
It's a disappointing process!
You're cut back!
Information on this different fact is insufficient to assess whether this little girl really has, or not, premices in the gust of the morbide.
Should we get out of the principle that a series of killer can't have a strange behaviour at the age of 5 years?
If people need a psychiatric monitoring, it's more toughers of this school than the students!
That parents get their kids out there: it's in danger!
Completely agreed.
Those who manage this school are clearly ill.
Your reaction is the most relevant.
Alabama is not the most representative state of the United States, but is actually part of it.
What an incomprehensible country!
His relative youth?
These blue clouds that men have nothing to do with a entrepreneur!
What did Alan Sugar or Richard Branson bring to their car?
In their first photos, Lord Sugar took a long sweet bathroom, and Sir Richard Branson had a rolled ball.
I can't come too much because I've never seen this, but everything seems so angry and without soul.
I don't think that's what he wanted to say.
Maybe it's wrong.
But what's it seems depressing!
You've got me down.
I would have thought that a major knowledge of the English would be an outcome for business.
I ask what Mr. Bjayou do these days.
Maybe he said "ostracting", he wanted to mean "alternance".
That would be logical.
No, I thought it was what he could mean, but ostracting has not always a sense.
In the worst, if all candidates lived like Carmen Miranda and that Sugar had a green cost, it could be progressed that their intention was to obsolete it.
But here, no.
It seems to have been corrected – strange. Maybe the whole phrase has been invented!
It's not strange.
Haha, who knows what he could say?
Really nothing, but someone wanted to quote something...
So yes, the word used in the article was well “ostracting” which would not absolutely mean anything.
The rate of shock in the United States has still slowed, some 6%.
It has never been seen since 2001.
The prices of the essence are low in all States.
American economy, with Obama, continues to strengthen.
Who's better say?
You have a very short view...
Their economy becomes "soutenable"?
To live there at this time, I will say that the United States will approach little exploitation as inequalities become poor.
The political system is literally intended by the financing of election campaigns.
Racial tensions, police violence, mass incarceration are wide that it is not imagined in Europe but Americans keep an unbelievable optimism in the future of their country and their country!
To when?
This is the main question.
A few days ago, the English financial environment said that France was lost.
Now, it's the Americ that's on his roof.
Happy, there will always be the UK to save the world.
Another one of these articles that simply forget the essential.
The United States economy consumption level is not more sustainable...
Debts and tickets shouldn't even give the change...
On the basis of the expansion of earth resources and the growing needs of the rest of the planet.
And strongly the weakest and poorest, a very large majority of citizens, will "beat" or instead die.
I can't blame this Farrage.
Will the Labour finally understand that his cynical and delegated policy importing competenced voters from the foreign makes him still lost support for him?
Maybe I don't think.
Multiculturalism and diversity must continue forward to any price.
LOL was to enjoy our American masters and continued their cold war with Russia.
Honest performance of Labour, Ed Milliband is in the mouse, it plays 617 votes.
How much Clacton 11 % for Labour – shocking, really shocking.
Everyone is known more or less than the massive immigration policy of the Blair government was designed “to throw the right nest in diversity”.
The Labour provides partial election, the Tories lost the partial election in safe seat against lkip = Have you spoken of your fight against reality with a therapy?
I think that this is the same multiculturalism that leads to this return of the handle, the wing has been very far since the end of the war, and I think it will now divide in another sense.
Have you spoken about your fight against reality with a therapy?
Lol - Security Labour Sea, a difference of 617 votes.
It's depressing Jack, you know, I know, everyone who's not in the deni.
Of course, the Torries saw well worse, but for the Labour, it's a winner in the Pyrrhus.
Find the word "Victoire" in any context, and you will see that when it is used in a argumentary way against the word "defeated", it wins the battle!
I agree, Jack, it's a victory, but she's maigre.
The Labour had to win at least a few thousands of votes.
If they store a performance like that in a safe seat, can you honestly imagine the majority to bring them back?
Personally, I'm a little interesting who wins in 2015 as long as the Lib Dems are not here.
You clearly do not understand how our parliamentary democracy works, right?
Yes, I know the glass of Canada, Groenland and the north of Russia slowly.
On the contrary, I wonder if Venus's alignement and March etc should not be considered too?
Generally the Earth is more “pateous” or malleable than you imagine.
Is that what?
A few small perplexities.
Wylie, on the other hand, speaks of a 'excellent simple mechanism: with the disappearing of the glass that swims on the earthquake, the pressure on the snake is relaxed, what gives/donning (a) a shock to the magma (b) production by facilitating its access to the surface??
In any case, it is the "scale cut" or the facilitation of the access to the soil surface (more or less) localized.
It is difficult to distinguish the cause of the effect and inverse Quant to climate heat, it seems aware of focusing on its effects on our environment, which is already quite complex.
Does this volcanism have a very friendly effect on our environment?
Is there no effect on our climate, future, or past warming?
Is Prudence not it anymore?
When complexity is not aware of simplification, let us apply this simple and observe.
Yes, but also, when he's doing night, we're seeing less good.
Hello, the end of the last glass period was also accompanied by a stronger systemic activity, in particular in the “active” mountain chain where on the extreme continental parts of Canada, Scandinavia.
Cordialement CB
It is too often ignored that the earthquake flows on the magma and that the only moon passage is to take or drop from some 30 to 60 cm, in different ways, after its passage to the Zenith, as it does for the ocean waters.
What gives it that the slowing of the textile plates, as well as the marges, is more or less facilitated by this swimming forest, so much more than the polar calottes are aligned by the source of the glass, which therefore causes a change of land balances to the equator, as the volume of the earth remains constant.
I am pleased of this "human", speaking about the Supreme of Nature and his self-declared commander, to be ridiculed by his stupid action on the environment which has created it and which has become so separated that has become nocive and itself and in this environment.
And all this is to remain the top commander of this nature that exceeds it in the organization of its own fishers, through an inventation that is to find all the ways possible to dominate its next, one of the other, because of the cooperation, the money.
The earthquake is not on the magma, but on the earthquake, which is constituted of solid rock.
I personally find it impossible to look at it.
Pretensive and arrogant.
That remembers me Ascent of Man de Bronowski.
Live the next part.
Beautiful story Wild1
Instead, I remembered a totally generous series of 2002 called Ape-man.
One of the best documentary series I've never seen.
Strangely, almost nobody remembers it now.
Don't worry you've never been over the first impression.
Your loss...
"Glaves, our far away" You should look at this passage again.
Or read about evolution.
Super program Thanks Brian
I'm almost sure that the "Humanity History" documentary has already been performed several times, they will always go to Ethiopia (evidently)
Oh there I don't support this boy, Brian, "air thousands" Cox, who goes to Ethiopia to try to make bike eyes before a brain in a mouth.
And his narration...
It must be hard for you, obliged to look at Coxy.
Maybe there's a group of support for you, says it.
I agree, everything is presented in a way I can understand.
I loved the program, wonderfully filmed.
Does Marcel Gauchet represent a marxist bossol?
Effectively, this is the individuality that predicts today.
It is therefore necessary to be himself, in itself, not in line.
Certainly, but Descartes is also located at the time of individuality event, and his intellectual question expresses this event.
But at that time, it is just the prims that appear, today individualism structures the whole society, educated or not, cultivated or not, rich or poor...
We're good in the individualism of "mass"!!
Without doing an inpassable horizon, there is no parent with the carthesian movement to examine what we are receiving to believe, what is thinking of itself.
More than rebellion, the doubt is fecond.
Fair of Foucault a Revolutionary is absurdity.
Many xxx library are referring to it and claim it.
His psychiatrist work has produced a anti-reform!
By presenting the problem at the level of his paranoid name, he blocked any progress and reflection on the reality of fool.
And I introduced the most reducing and reactionary vision: the behaviorism.
The left is absolutely right about this point and to be anti-conformist, it is fighting against this discerbation.
We call Marcel Gauchet to be a defender of the order.
Great idea!
Be beautiful and rebellious, ask for ones...
Black and sweet, to the other.
Besides and robots, they understand the most followers of those who see rebelle in their sight.
In any case, thanks to his complainant polemics to put Marcel Gauchet, this humanist and continuing patient, and, as far as pedagogically lighting.
David Cameron supports the increase in the land of the inheritance tax
How many other budget cuts will be needed to pay the social benefits of this rich person?
Dave the robot will well increase its net value once he will not be in power.
Business Councils, allocations, consultation costs, a series of best-sollers written by a nigger on the 'serial policy' – it will be 100 pounds once it had been left.
Obviously, he doesn't want to have an income on heritage.
Wouldn't it be the same lie as at the last election?
And the most rich are those who certainly pay less inheritance taxes thanks to super-payed accounts and tax evasion programmes.
This has all the signs of a Empire declining where heritage kills innovation.
He'll be 100 pounds once he'd pass the weapon left.
Whatever.
It will probably propose to increase the floor to 1 million £, which is well depending on what you say it's good.
What was your position when the Labour doubled the floor to 6500,000 for pairs?
Do you also think that Brown thinked only of his own heritage, or are you just a tribalist without brain?
We haven't chosen it last time, we had a coalition at the place.
You couldn't allow him to lie only if we had elected it to power.
As the rest of us, "Dave" will not die "normally".
The climate change and the imminent exhibition will end it, him and the other of his acabitate.
His “ riches ” will be so unnecessary as that of the other and will not save him nor his children.
Unable income is a social benefit, especially in a country where government debt exceeded 10,000 000 000 000 000 £.
We must all be imposed to pay the essential services and pay the debt.
I agree with you Exdionys.
I don't say that the doctrine of discipline is unnecessary, of course, I just say that it is insufficient to compensate some natural "insufficients".
Unreasonable declaration for the math professor that she was!
As what...
Better recruiting and improving the teachers this is a qualitative approach.
However, the French political class does not know any other approach than quantitative.
There were 2 possible answers, the first would be the selection of teachers in accordance with their ability to provide knowledge => reform of recruitment modalities.
In +, she hate children because it doesn't understand them.
Not understood, she does not know how to act or react to work well => She is reduced to establish a challenge relationship that makes all suffering in pure loss => should be 1 training with skills to teach.
A job that's learning, surely.
But pedagogy is mainly an art, natural arrangement and vocation before being a technology.
Working on and with humans is not making car parts.
Pedagogy does not go in equation even when we are a math professed!
"education sciences" cannot compensate a lack of natural attitudes.
What lacks now, just now, is a real vocation in the bcp of those who embrace the professionals
If donations exist, pedagogy (I prefer doactic disciplinary) allows those who have less tendencies to do not wrong.
There are ways to address a more effective issue.
The real unknown today is the students whose 2/3 say to us: Learning does not serve anything I already know what I think.
A Slate article describes well the chaotic situation of this income.
Regretton the Old Standard Schools of Institutors..
She finished at 3 hours of morning from this week, but she starts at midnight.
If this is possible for its time's employment.
Oh, I didn't know that, thank you.
It doesn't matter with me!
It's a few years that his emission starts at midnight.
We have this thing called iplair, which allows us to listen to the request emissions when we want it!
The Internet is so amazing, isn't it?
I don't have iPlayer on my phone and with a maximum download speed of 4 MB at me, I can't really listen to radio emissions no longer.
I have a type usb adapter from my SKY box and which is connected to the Internet but listening to the radio on my TV has seemed too complicated.
Yeah, I think I'm wrong at the time, I had to hear Richard Lester about 3 hours.
Although it are men on Radio 2, they could at least put a woman in their antena time when one of the men is in vacation or sick, at least it would be pleased to people.
They should start off from Jeremy Vine.
His emissions are all sensitively declared in the debate, and it would be better on a chain like LBC.
The lack of DJ women in the day, where no of the regular animators, from Chris Evans on the morning at Simon May's emission at the return of the job, isn't a woman
That's five emissions.
So which (of these five) is the most likely to be changed.
Shenan knows it very well, but he doesn't say anything - for the moment.
Steve Wright is the semi-detailed one of those times.
Jeremy Vine may be sent to the offices as a real journalist, but dinner keeps the glass air of a Daily Mail radio.
I think he's quiet, waiting for the current team's sleeves, or it's going to get up.
I was born in Soisse in 1950!
Too late?
It's normal that these people vote FN.
For 40 years, we have both the same parties that are aligned to the power and make the keys of the country to the other as less good as they have not taken it.
The campaigns are very poor, quite poor than the banlieues with the isolation.
We need to do a km to find a cinema, a bar, a gymnase, a theatre.
But as they don't burn, they're not attacking, not treating, they're not interested in political men...
But thank you don't talk about a division where you haven't lived.
Yes, Doclocal, they're under men, sociology is good to think about them.
They have the rate of absentism and early alcoholism too high...
The NF prospers on human beasts, inculture and ignorance as it says that there is still a huge potential of growth, they really need to be bad to not have done better...
Today, the NFF is particularly prospered on poverty, fear of daily, the one of the other and the feeling of no perspective.
But yes, you're right!
That crazy humanity.
Happy that there are people like you, intelligent, worshiped and erouted to save the honor.
They've been looking for him.

That's what happens
Who are they?
"forgetted" in fact there is less than resources => lower funds.
This is the comment I left on twitter (@priya963) Listen, you can't just add and mix), women must be integrated in the development process.
What I mean here is that in many developing countries, existing standards are subjected to, such as child guard and social-producing roles.
This allows to recognize that women can work in the economic area and that's super - it's necessary.
But it is not possible without recognising the fact that women will have a double floor, i.e. they will be waiting for the work while continuing to fill their social-reproductive role.
I'm not convinced to my sister.
Economy and benefits do not recognize gender roles.
The money talks, and if a sex isn't at the height, next!
The benefits are shocked from your life.
What are you doing, what's the advantage and what you have to offer?
The benefits cause heroism and education of children.
If it was a crime, the companies would listen.
Employers will never employ women from 20 to 45 years of age.
Good say my sister.
It is very difficult that nobody speaks of the social work not paid in this article.
In some countries, the value of non-employed social work (of the largest part of women) must be equal to 50% of GDP.
The non-paid social work is not sufficiently supported and is sub-valued (not speaking about the fact that men do not do enough), but it allows us to operate and maintain our work.
The unpayed social work is also an important reason for many women are incapable of finding a real "economic emancipation" outside their home...
Thanks for all your comments - for returning to Mskayadee, how can we take into account the responsibilities taken by women in a disproportionate manner when women are taking gender integration projects?
A very practical article.
I'm sure he will help many people who have to “cook a case. ”
Tigre is not Russian, it's only the Western propaganda.
Chinese are only responsible for the current situation and would be better to sit at the negotiations table.
The right to self-determination tigre and the Russian soldiers are simply performing near the border, planned long-term exercises before the current situation.
In addition, tigre has no anti-air mixture in its possession.
Free the Tigristan!
You did my day!
Oh, yeah, you're.
He's just coming back to me the same kind of idea.
This is a pretext all found to weaken a few separaters to annex China.
If Siberia is in China, China is in Siberia.
It's just time to repair this anomalie.
Why is an article on a tigre, wonderful and real risk of extinction finally transformed into a betely leading article against Poland?
What's going on to do the dents?
So this is not a shell on the tiger of Siberia, but a shelter on the suites of a Poutine's com operation.
When both the media are exposed, it is also exposed to the ironium even to the critical.
The permanent victim ritual of the Soviet-Poutinian sympathisant.
Holland had also taken the weight with his chameau without crying to the anti-France composite.
From our learner Alain Bougrain-Dubourg, the Sacred Protector of the Great Russia was personally and physically involved in the reintroduction of this tigre.
In any case he understanded everything, he's bared...
That Hollande's doing basher, that's something.
First of all, it seemed to be a horrible idea.
But, on the basis of the article, it seems that it is both a response to a real problem - the dent subsidies of emergency - and effectively.
So it's difficult to find something to redire.
And if only 53% of this sample were broken before, and 73% afterwards, it's a little empty sense of parentalism.
After all, there's no inconvenience to broke the dents!
The complaints seem to be related to the fact that they are targeted to the unemployers and that this confirms a negative stereotype.
But if this would be exact, then it's not a justified critical.
Belinda Smith, from the Canterbury Regional Health Committee, said that the Ministry was concerned about the number of emergency dent subsidies offered by the Working Department and Revenue from the Ministry of Social Development to youth unemployed.
On a mediatic plan, there would be better channels to implement it, I think.
But he seemed reasonably well thinking.
There is an inconvenience in the fact that the dents are broken.
If you broke them after having wine, it may hurt the emnamel skin.
If your teeth brown is old and strict, she can cut the genius and cause inflammation.
And I remember a emission on the book Guiness of the records where someone tried to cut the dents the most long, and the judges Guiness had been very unconsequent to do this because of the negative effects of a frequent and long-term dent brochure.
At first, it is very pleasant.
It seems to be an experimental design.
The simple fact that voluntary for this study will change the habits of participants who knew that the brochure of dents would be studied.
This is why most of the behavioral studies include things such as twicele, witness groups, etc.
There is no way to reject these results on the programme itself.
Assuming that these texts are sent to each youth in the social advantages, there are two things different from the test: 1) This is not volunteers, and 2) they do not return information about when they broke or blowing tooths (related results by people who give their results on the basis of the perceived expectations).
Is there any effects at the epigenetic level?
Studies (Pr Lyonnet) showed that the maternal environment (including uterus) could have effects on genetic patrimonie, not in the genome, but in the expression of genes, and that these heritage treaties could be transmitted to the next generation.
Does the uterus grief affect this phenomenon?
The nidation itself seems to be a kind of grain.
There are consequences likely, but as long as we do not want to be kidnapped from a perfect clone of itself, is it a problem priority?
I think it's going beyond the reasonable limit.
The desire of maternity and parentity must not be able to go far, without possibly addressing the issue of ethical, risk, mother and child.
Not the physician is not all powerful, it's not unlimited, and it's evil and painful to accept that all women will not have it, or children they want to have.
It has nothing, absolutely nothing, to see with the tran
But let people, women, others, have their body, their idea of love that can go to risk take and manage your little tests alone, all in your small pants alone.
from their "conference" this magic sack to have this wonderful moment of pregnancy.
Why would I keep it steady in my coffee-fort if it can still give love.
The current ethriced circumstances make the FRYDMAN carefully on his communication, but if it was accepted to reflect, "on" was acknowledged that it is only the skin and not the genetic material that is involved.
What you're going to consider as a argument against : cf here these reactions all men curiosely....
Marjane, all organ don't know anything.
I have been a plasma donor for years, this is not totally known.
I was registered as a sleeve-doer donor (I have never been selected because the selection is very strict and it is understood for the recipient and for the donor), that is a real operation.
Now as a man, I would not allow to judge in a sense or another to take part in this gift, but I will listen to the women to speak.
@Margane: Indeed, this has nothing of anointed, and it strengthens the love act that it implies.
Give a king to a member of his family who needs nothing of an anoin, and that's done!
Please, don't have any Messsi v Ronaldo combinations.
It's low.
I agree, we don't need this.
Overall, there's no more competition...
Ronaldo is the best athlete.
Messi is the best footballer.
The sport has become a Yoyo club.
They're too good for the Second, but they don't have Liga's standard.
Rivaldo was not part of the winner team.
Thank you for correcting me.
But Rivaldo well played for the Sports before going to Barcelona.
Ronaldo, who continues to do everything to fight all the purpose records of Real Madrid, this season to be able to return to Old Trafford this year with quiet conscience...
I'm worried to believe it.
I think Ronaldo will put a term to his career at Santiago Bernebeu.
I think you want to talk about the stage of the international oil investment society?
I looked at him on a shit connection so I can't tell you big-chose if Valencia was well defended and without ownership, they were worth winning.

A complete article signed by the young researcher Amandine Marshall, “On the origins of the momization”, but illustrated, was published in the Archeology magazine last September 524.
It's good to have arguments to confirm and give what is happening intuitively.
It's not surprising that before making complicated it makes it simple.

Hello and thank you for your tickets.
He was like to read me a few years ago that a black child's mother had been discovered in the current Libya and that this discovery had opened new horizons, including geographical and temporary horizons (I think I remember the mother was about 1000 years old to the first African mothers).
Do you have information about this?
Thank you for the progress.
She's a little sweet reading.
It may not be modern contaminations.
Is the desert at the time not less far than now?
Why don't you imagine plants like cannabis swimming around where there is only sand now?
We knew the song.
And there is enough that a scientist of Europe confirms, without any evidence, that it is a scientific truth: the Egyptians and the Africans today have never invented anything in their own home.
But the song does not tell us who are the inventors of African Inventions in Africa.
If it isn't and always "of his wicked debts".
You should read the article.
This is an article issued by neo-life market cups and preaching against the mobility of persons and for the mobility of goods.
I think there are other people at Ebola and on which the Spanish Government lies to us, not giving bad images and protecting tourism.
Today, I would like to believe that tourism is the last of their concerns.
But they could remain silent to avoid a general panic.
I would like to believe the same thing about tourism, but the governments of law in particular (e.g. the Spanish and the United Kingdom) tend to protect business interests instead of people.
Please stop calling your local MP and claiming the lack of transparency.
Although I think that the government here is only a band of connards, good and corrupt, as Madrid is not a very tourist place, I doubt that it is their largest concern.
What are you waiting for?
(Whoever respects and compassion I have for nurse and colleagues), because tourism is one of the only things that allow millions of people to keep the head out of water, I would say yes, it's important.
If they were absolutely repatriated by missionaries, I don't see why they couldn't send them to an airline and cure them in a field hospital, rather than in the capital, for example.
Rajoy was assigned to defeat the Spanish health services by privatising the nationalized hospitals in Madrid, which was its power base, until the courts were interrupted.
It's nothing but a right-to-legal public relationships supporting Cameron, and I think it's wrong with the next elections.
To be fair towards Cameron (I know that this is not easy here) socially he is far from his right and would find his place towards the religious crowds of right in America.
Now he must sing the hospital lounges that he had before down to try to achieve his goal that is to protect Spanish tourists.
I'm sorry, but you can't really compare the Tories or any other European party of the right to the Spanish right.
That's the cases, believe me.
The Spanish government is a lie about almost everything about it.
It's not like someone could accuse you to repay the informed rumors.
So you have tankful evidence to support this idea?
This Guardian section calls the comments are free.
Thank you, Mr. Suiot.
Without the work at the centre of production and economy with its rights and guarantees, there will be no way out.
Great but especially fascinating reactions on the forum.
Many TPE patrons seem to read The World to take the time to condemn Pr's proposals.
Let's go on the anti-intelligence of the environmental era.
A Legal Professor at the University of France seems to be not able to know the labour market except if it is Nobel economic price and proposes to completely liberalize it
It was so better before, it was true when Dr. Villermen found the work of the children of 8 years of age 10 hours per day when the Canuts had been shocked because of a collective convention signed.
Oh, the good old time...
Your reaction is so fascinating by your misconsciousness of the TPE patron manager!
His household is not to know the right in all his men, but to manage and produce.
Four manual amounts inscribed on my juvenile salary ballot, more than 100 information today!
This is an example, for example, can be quoted more, which illustrates the permanent flux of contractuals, taxed without measure of consequences, and which enhance the small business.
Your paper would have been very useful if you had written it as a experts and not as a Sorbon client.
In order to order the arch-result argument of the French Labour Code in relation to herbete, a serious university would be extended into Swiss texts and would compare the number of official texts, then the comments (the absence of the last ones that could mean that Swiss laws are more comprehensible than ours).
By comments in a Code, which is working or not, it is intended for the jurisprudence, in particular...
And yes, in France, there is still a judge who is responsible for applying the laws when a employee is licensed, for example....
Who's complicated?
Do you find that law rules (legal law, law, conventions, contracts) are in the field of unsuccessable barriers and trade?

For each article on Ai Weiwei I recently read, you are part of the first three comments of its popularity.
Come on, let's go.
Let's see more, the choice is not missing in the world of art.
If China can produce new artists who aren't porters of the Communist Party, the world will be interested.
Yes, GhenisCan is probably a Chinese government troll.
I think that China has produced a lot of good contemporary artists.
Those who are Communist Government's ports are not appreciated in Western, and those who are not talking doors are not well connected as Ii Weiwei.
For those among you who think that the art of Ai Weiwei is a kind of fraud, this is what you rate.
Thank you for this, you're coming to ruin my breakfast.
I'm sorry, but it was necessary to exhibit it at all prices (not to make a bad word game).
It's the man who shuts old ceramics and calls it from art, right?
There's the art, and then there's vandalism trying to get attention.
The real artists make the difference.

KARSENTY DEMISSION This master is unfair to take an electional mandate the extremists of any border (including sionists) must be put off
Philippe Karsenty and his ridiculous theories of the complete, who valued him a number of judicial convictions, are horrible to Israel and to the matrix of Neuilly.
He's not representing either one or another.
Philippe Karsenty took his battle against the truth alone, in marginal.
WHAT RESSEMBLE ASSEMBLE
What do you have to do with the Mayor of Neuilly against Philipe Karsenty, who tried to blame a journalist and his family, and who publicly calls for attacking this urbanist?
Forgiveness of crime?
Don't I find Neuilly on my card?
Is this a new administration that holds these new privileges??
This type requires care, as well as Ulcan Chelli, both in the theory of the anti-jude/anti-Israel complex and whose resorts are perfectly identical to those of their most furious detractors.
As many people believe in any political decision, the hand of the “semiists” (the term of which the sense has tendencies to disappear from the fact of its abuse), these two there, as the LDJ or still the CRIF, believe in any critical, even banal, an abject anti-simism that is not without remembering the darkest hours of our history, because it is still feconned by the ventricle of my good woman would be believed to return to Russia of the 19th century!).
Note that the unbelievablely stupid theories of Karsenty on Charles Enderlin's reporting are still more stupid than those on September 11th.
And God knows that the theories of the Complex on September 11 are a well-beat beast.
And this type has political responsibilities, which is extremely worried.
To specify my analogy with the theory of the complex of 11 September, it is discussed about a cognitive depreciation on the way to discuss the subject.
All overwhelmed by a completely frozen truth, with too much time, spent too much money to spend it, it is insupportable to the adaptation of this theory to defeat it (e.g. in the case of extreme religions).
A logic and inelectable flee before, the end justifys all the means, even the lie, which is a comble, but like it does not seem to ruin the mission of the questionnaire.
You suggest to take attention and not put everyone in the same cart, but that's what you do for September 11th.
There is still a floor of questions without answers for this event, and Bush/Cheney/Saudians/consorts seem to be not pressed to answer it.
There are effectively very fascinated theories, but official theory is also, at least a few points.
Oh, nothing's funny now...
Health NGOs and public health talks found that the results of the study are widely favoured by their sensibilisation efforts.
And of course, they will need more subsidies to follow!!
As the fact of smoking was socially accepted 50 years ago and now it is recognised for what it really is, alcohol will also know its time of judgment where the real damage that it causes in our society will be exposed.
More than waiting that everyone attacks me now...
All right, it's easy to say things like "excluding alcohol consumption is grown", but what (one more) demands, is to give real facts.
Sorry if you consider this as a attack - will you drink a drink and develop?
It's better to risk this instead of putting my mental health in danger by abstending me.
The Government ends the joy when it costs money.
Here are other alarmist advice based on unreasonable statistics.
Two mediums per day is at least a low level of alcohol consumption, and the first quote seems to indicate that it increases the risk of many cancers, but the second means that it is a more or less dangerous amount.
Maybe the Cancer Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council should be concerted (from one or two vessels, but especially not three) and gives us a figure on which they are agreed - that it is justified or not.
Now, we're going to tax them back, like the smokers!
They do it already - soon it will be the herb!
My father didn't drink and smoke, and cancer brought him to 64 years of age.
So I'll continue to drink my two red bottles on the lunch and the same night (and the other nights when my wife is not here).
Why is it that the Cancer Council encourages children to go in places where alcohol is serving is a old today that the Cancer Council delibly ignored.
What is not linked to a risk of cancer today?
Recipients do not touch cancer - they eat anything but are not good company.
Requins can take cancer to skin cancer.
Charlie Whiting's incompatibility is a recurrent subject for many years.
Remember to run when we can fly and reciprocally.
Completely agreed.
Whiting is the Blessed-oui yi of Bernie.
To them two, they destroyed the F1 in security pretext.
Let's hope he's shooting better than Schumi or at least worse Wendlinger applies his accident in 1994.
Absolutely agreed with you, but attention to point 1: is not the F1, but the circle of which has refused to advance the department to not swear the TV-distribution creatures.
Very exact, +1
I just want to want a quick and fast rebuilt in Jules Bianchi!
Brazil 2003, Europe, 2007, the accidents that failed to occur between deployment and f1 greenhouses have been unprecedented warnings.
We knew that one day would happen, and Jacques Lafite, in particular, said it for years.
How can the course organization and the FIA have allowed these manuals without the safety of car?
I can't accept that the risks of the household or the fault inevitable are invoked when it has not been prevented.
Or this accident was it.
It should even mean, that there was a yellow dragon, which does not only mean “interdiction to overcome in the area” but has for the first purpose of signaling a danger.
It's not horrible, it's happy for the family that should be before the TV.
Even under yellow dragon, pilots will just lift up the feet.
In changed conditions, virginy can be much more slower the next tour and the pilot, believed to arrive with sufficient margin, may even have “slow” speed in comparison with normal rythm.
But, well, we're caused in the empty there, as long as the images are not seen, we're not gonna be able to make an opinion.
I don't see what this changes.
Is there a blessed?
According to the CBC, no damage has been reported.
The CBC showed the info this morning before it happens, and what makes me ask what caused the slaughter.
It is difficult to believe that there are still jobs where 24 hours to hold.
I don't think there are people blessed because Canada is almost empty.
Perhaps there are animals blessed like skins, layer ratons, etc.
I hope it's ironia.
Some Vancouver parties have the strongest population density in North America, and Toronto's aglomeration accounts at least six million people.
In Saskatchewan's campaign, trains do not disappear as a magnificent, and these types of trains often cross low urban areas.
Almost every Canadian city is passed through a iron road line, and trains are very often deployed in a day.
Furthermore, as water courses often follow in the regions where there are lakes, rivers or oceans, they also walk in deeply poor places, because people always want to live near the water.
Thus, the whole rail traffic crosses the center of a city because it was a central element of the original construction of the road lines here.
You may have tried to be funny, but there is a great potential for rail disasters in Canada.
Mansbridge made a report about this last night, really shocking.
Of course you didn't read the article on the destroy and explosion of a train in a town of Quebec that made 47 dead?
In fact, you have some reason.
The city of Vancouver was a port city well before the fertile road.
This says, when the fertile roads were built, they passed through the centre of the established communities because it was the direct and central road.
Maybe employees of the National Railway Society should be held at the next Conference on dangerous products in Calgary in Canada on 2 and 3 December 2014.
CN employees are long formed in the transport of dangerous products.
This article, as many comments, makes the contrary to the primary religious question: a religion is a revealed truth and for his believers he will not be able to exist other truths.
All the problem is here, and the exeges of the theologists do only strengthen this fact, unless it is good to speak about the sex of angels?
"God said, that's good, that's bad" > It's not compatible with democracy, it's called the dictature (variant: theocracy).
It's a leader (the Islamic country but not an importantness): "But without religion, how do you want to keep the people?"
In other words, obey to the currency rabbin imam pastor and do your prayers, that will be better!

Yes, that's what Voltaire and others thought, don't Robespierer in a certain way trying to build a worship of the Supreme.
But our oligarchy also has its cultures: the euro's strong ( instead pale at this time ) or the free market (passively supported by the State when he needs to fly ) , etc .
Great ideas of religious surgery.
Yes, but especially where there was no distinction between religious and profane.
Where rational emerges, the religious is at the rider and is expressed in sword.
The religion is born as ideological support of the State, and the gods put in the service of ambitions even if it has also brought forms of contesting.
The theology discovered between fidelity in the form of revelation and adaptation to the air of time did not doubt.
Fanaticism is often described as a bad interpretation of the "sacred texts".
This does not resist to the consideration of these texts that are expressly appealed to the hatred of the wrongman.
Instead, they are the moderate religious (and happily the many of them) who "left badly" texts and not only consider what is about humanism and common values in all humanity, acts and different believers.
For me, fanatism is the beast and wicked application of passages of the sacred texts out of their context.
Thus, some verses of the Coran calling for killing "infidelity", "hypocrites", "judeans" or "Christs" are incomprehensible and therefore unacceptable if some above or lower verses are not read that these executions are justified only in cases where the musulmans are attacked, killed, and in the situation of legitimate defence.
on Yves Petit : "as regards the "foulard" is well a religious prescription that makes today almost unununity in the "savings".
There are idiots all over there.
The only positive point to take from this is that it has caused a general condemnation.

A insulting of our intellectuality, that's what he gave us!
If you decoll your eyes of the television for a moment, you would see that Australia has a rich cultural heritage, starting by paintings in greens and on stones made by its Indian people and that are still a source of inspiration for modern artists today.
And then there is the Opera of Sydney and a national opera company that produced wonderful songers such as Joan Sutherland and Nellie Melba.
The australian cinema produced films such as The History of the Kelly Gang, Mad Max and Gallipoli.
The notable Australians includes Errorl Flynn, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Heath Ledger, Geoffrey Rush and Cate Blanchett.
The only thing that injures your intellectuality is you and your ignorance.
Russell Crowe is New Zealand, and the Bee Gees were English.

The presentation of the hypocritical responsibilities suggested in the article without having to go to the explicitly designation of separateties is in the Otanese line of the World that does not hesitate to reverse facts and responsibilities to maintain the fault of the neonazis pro-European natives who are courageously faced with the wicked Russians.

WHAT THE ROMANY!
Alleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Hongrie!
And I say this as a Roman citizen.
Transylvania, with a woman of Hungary origin, on the other hand.
That says, I can't support Piturca's team, they're not representing me.
Piturca is a member of the established powers that has not stopped denixing the Roman football to the patitic level he has reached now.
They formed a network that produced the "Coperative", which decided before the beginning of the season what team would bring the championnat, which teams would go to Europe, which would be released, and who bled the money to its grade, mainly by sale of players who were well under-sized.
Gica Popescu, the former captain of Barcelona, did business with the above-mentioned agents, and tried to avoid paying taxes (e.g. a million euros), then paid them, but apparently he was not advised by his lawyers, refused to grant his mistakes to the court (which would be awarded without punishment), and therefore he took three years and half in prison.
The process also valued the prison to Becali brothers, four owners of the club, Mihai Stoica steaua manager, and Popescu, for infringements in connection with football.
George Becali also cleanss a punishment for trying to swim (and then desilure the facts) a team to fight us (CFR Cluj) in the last match of the Championnat, to win the title and return the jackpot of the Championship Link.
The team he tried to sudore was our neighbors in Cluj, University.
We won 1-0 in their stage, a result that allowed us to be the first Cluj champions while they were released.
I'm always saving this moment.
In the dismissing of this corruption attempt, Piturca, among others, was signed as a false witness of a document that taught that the money that the police had confined to Cluj was in relation to a field sale.
So this poor man who is not educated, stupid, tricky and mentor isn't representing me, and he's never gonna do it.

To conclude that the "socialist" patronym of this government appears to me as a insult in the memory of Jaurès or Mendeus France.
Have we read here a article of the enclosed canard?
A unemployment can remain a few months without the news of its agency, but it must continue to search for jobs through its own means.
It is learned that controls have allowed to raise people who were more than half of the unemployment.
We therefore ask how the control of people that we have never seen can be done.
The sanctions are asked to be a radiation for someone who has no access to employment or unemployment.
And if it can be admitted that this reform will allow more radius, what will it help recruitments.
"A unemployment can remain a few months without the news of its agency, but it must continue to search for jobs by its own means." Effectively, it's horrible.
The question should be addressed, why are these countries in the EU while the authorities are clearly unable to defend the equal ideas of Europe?
Isn't it like if Spanish or Italian authorities had made great-chose about racism in the foot?
Should we cut them from the EU?
The EU was only economic and should remain.
The purpose is not to be a 'Pension Police'.
EU is a peaceful project.
She has no sense on an economic plan.
This is probably the reason why Great Britain will soon leave the EU: it is the most inequalizer society in Europe.
What's the equality?
Eastern Europe teams are constantly having the corrupted mafia arbitrates that is EUFA.
The best solution would be that the whole East leaves this lucrative organization fore and created the seen.
At least we'll look at the football.
This anti-racism is only a screen to cover injustice and corruption!
No, it's not true.
Instead, monetary and commercial exchanges.
European equality ideas?
So what is wrong with Europe to let the United Kingdom entering?
Uefa should appeal them to have joined Blatter's commodity and his men.
This happens all over a few years, and I'm not exaggerated.
Shoot from the Guardian two or three days ago:
Does he hope to get rid of small symmetric phrases, just the story of incoming the polemic?
Whatever it is, it's a fact that every small event toward peace there's, there's and there are people who have been employed to shoot oil on the fire.
The decoration would be to say that the Western States are against a "Palestian State", which they are pro-Israel, and that it only explains that these States have never done anything against the Israeli State.
The decoration was to say that to solve the Israeli-Palestian issue, it would be necessary to act against the super-weapon-weapon-weapon-weapon-weapon-weapon-destructor-building State.
In 1945, instead of creating a Jewish state in Palestine from an Arab population that wasn't for nothing in the Shoah, he was more reasonable to guide the Baviera of his German people (which they were guilty of the Shoah) to replace them by the surviving Jews.
It would have been justice, Germans had nothing to claim, and Europe would have maintained millions of educated, entrepreneurs and dynamic inhabitants.
Mr., take the example of the Western Sahara colonization...
That Marocco is the colonialist, it's a proof!
But, as for Israel, it must also ask the History, its allies and his supports to interview truths.
In any case, the colonialism has never been altruist, we agree.
Then stop your pirates to support Israel as a colonist.
The Galle has been colonized by the Romans, but now there is no discrimination between the descendants of the Romans, Gaulois or others.
In Palestinian there is a discrimination based on origins.
Furthermore, the Israeli State is defined as the one of a "judean multitude" whose non-Jewish non-Jewish could be part of.
The Israeli State discriminates the non-Jewish, from which the content.
Conclusion: To solve the conflict, it is necessary to break with the Jewish and non-Jewish sionism.
In Maghreb, even some people were baptized on behalf of their first status by this salvator civilization!
Two realities that must stop ignoreing.
First, the European sionist project (coloncing Palestinian approximation) involved in deposing the Palestinians, and therefore it was an intrinsically anti-Palestian project, the solution is therefore necessary to break sionism.
Second, sionism is a political ideology.
Uruguay missed the slaughter since the start.
Their terrific results will give them what the dogs are ordered.
It should start its reactivation by small shocks.
I hope he didn't lose the appetite of the game.
There are so many subjects, including racial damages and physically hard tacs in the football, but Suarez was sanctified too hard.
I would like to see him returning to England, but no matter what the purists say.
Yeah, I hate all these molarists.
The football is a contact sport where the balls exist, and therefore, the players will hurt.
The fact of returning his dents into the flesh of an opposite to have the advantage did not certainly have its place in the game.
A rubyman was suspended for 80 matches to have made a similar gesture.
It's now the third time Suarez did it.
If you're gonna kill someone at work.
What would be the consequences of you?
I knew someone's going to go.
If you're dislexic, I'll forgive you.
I'm actually slightly dislexic.
I forgive this sarcasm with two balls.
I think he was hot to go back to full teeth.
All of these words games on Suarez are in the course of losing their mourning.
I failed to shut up.
An essential condition for a good school course is respect for students of their teachers and school institutions.
This works if parents culminate this respect for their children.
Parents make this more easier respect if they feel respected by teachers and schools of their children.
In the good institutions, those who make progress to their students, parents are considered partners, not as emms.
Who can believe that this is the professor that should do all the jobs (doctrine, education, respect, limits, living together) It is to parents to make at least 50% of the bath.
But it's definitely simpler to take it to school.
It's not operational.
No one has really taken on them.
Since the action will be limited.
On the contrary, school institutions could have a lot of things.
Operational solutions resident.
The actors (proofs, herarchists and ministers) should play their role and do not remain touched.
There can be a troop that slows to relax her, not families.
How do you not talk about education?
It is true that communication courses allow to change.
It seems to be teachers but it is forgotten the first role of the school.
Transmission of knowledge.
And if parents require there, it is that the school ensures their children's education.
What is the Minister who is going to make up what was called the Public Instruction.
Articles falling: little information, partial reflections and destructive reflections.
Are you really waiting for a intelligent comment from this over Eastern banks?
It's a beauty, it's clear, but I think he's instead of Willoughby, and so North coast...
Sloppy Joe does not understand the numbers.
He refuses to accept the facts.
It is not surprising that we have a budget emergency.
Let it fall and the economy will soon wake up.
Hunters Hill, actually.
carefully true
That's it.
A little Aloysius.
His elector is the North Sydney's seat.
Effectively a beast of the North coast!!!!
Well, if British BBC televisioners want to compare the neo-conservator governments of our two countries, they would obviously come to the conclusion that the two of the Monster Raving Tory Wang-Bangers.
It passes for a grinful, today. :(
Yes, but his leader regularly leaves him on his hunger.
You would be shiny as if you wake up a morning and realize that you will never have the role of Prime Minister and that all these legal and illicit advantages of life will never be outside your port.
Battle Joe.
Very patient.
He tried to present a budget and then abandoned.
At least he's not threatening to find someone.
Brittany Ferries needs a new boat.
She will well be able to command it, without gas turbines - in a remote country and call for State aid.
And as she could do lobbying, no fear of the result.
And as a pool for employment in France that she has nothing to do, she is always ready to shoot when their corporation has losses on markets, especially foreigners...
That's just because their lobbying did not function that the command was cancelled.
If the company had reached the time or planning for marpol, no doubt that the project would have been achieved.
Open, to know whether it's good or not and how BF will comply with the law, despite all, it would be nice that "the world" is thinking above!
The Britishtany Ferries company is detained by the bretons.
Those who burn the tax centres and follow-up.
They want State aid.
That they didn't seem to me at least normal.
And, however, when armies a ship under French metropolitan pavillon is 30% more pretty than any other civilized pavillon, yes, it is normal to wait for a shock of the State.
Or then it is condemned to tolerate that the British people monopolize the market.
That's the choice.
Eternal issue of French which considers its maritime façades as tourist destinations, not as activities areas, where people sometimes live different from the average parish.
This difference is paid every day, lack of investments, to spend all short.
One of the reasons why Britain must find its sovereignty.
That's it and after they will create the bretton pavillon with exclusively composed of pure sweet brettons.
With that, they're sure they're going to make down costs significantly...
All right.
Unfortunately, this is what we are expecting from the BBC now.
They always hate all that was reported to the prog, so it is not surprised that they chose to pass beyond Hackett's only career, which has always been closer to the genesis of the 70s than those of the other members of the group.
Hackett was for Genesis what Malcolm Young was for AC/DC.
If you don't understand how important it was for the sound, you really don't understand their music.
To say the truth, they do not say almost the only work of Gabriel no longer.
I don't think that the BBC could be accused of "hate all the things relating to the prog" because they have come to disseminate a documentary of an hour and a half on one of the largest prog groups that have never existed.
I have not yet seen the documentary, but it's a film on the Genesis Group, not only on its members' projects.
With regard to Hackett's only career that would be "be closer to the genesis of the 1970s," I am not agreed.
Hackett has no right to take the road, play a lot of Genesis songs on which he had several degrees of participation and intended to have an affinity with Genesis that David Gilmour has no right to assemble a lot of demons to half ends and call it an album of Pink Floyd.
Oh, wait...
I think that Steve Hackett asks nothing more than a just representation, but he didn't receive it.
A curiose feeling, the first album of Bank, is absolutely generous, and in fact in the spirit of Genesis of the 1970s.
They've been over the only Hackett cart because, we're honest, she's afraid.
Yes, it's one of the best prog groups, but would the documentary have been done if they didn't have their business success in the 80s?
I have not always seen the BBC to diffuse a long documentary on groups like King Crimson and Gentle Giant who have a very interesting story but lacks the popular attractor of Genesis.
Good comments.
I would even say that the BBC has "will" hated the fact that it ADORAIT progressive music in time.
A person with personal interest cries "prejuds": of course.
A little more interview with Jonathan King on the DVD version?
An absolutely wonderful chance.
If death penalty is an attempt to dump a horrible act by another horrible act (including sometimes against innocents), then it is a clear success.
There will always be a difference in size between a criminal condemned to death and those who kill him.
The criminal has made his act since his unreasoned understanding of society and rules.
Those who kill him do it since the vision and the most fair and wise reflection of a society.
I mean, they don't have any apology.
They're indefensible.
Yes, we understanded your point of view, first time.
This is precisely the difference, Mr LeClos.
We need to have a well different spirit of the common of the dead to play violence.
That's what the criminal is doing since his understanding of things.
But it is also what produces pain, hate, vindicate in the neighbors of the innocent victim: a false understanding which will never be able to prevail those who are wisely decided on the death of others since their healthy and just reasoning.
But to try to balance the analysis, it could also be said that the death condemned often have experienced a wild violence, which he could play, against slightly loved people, who made it free.
The neighbors of these disappointed victims will eventually see their pain with the disappearing of the one who was the barrier, sometimes the torturer, being loved and hateing their nights.
Don't miss their relief.
Thanks Emilio for this reflection I find very just.
Articles strong and encouraging.
As to Marc Asnin, he has proved to be a great intellectuality.
The heart.
That's, of course, what I've been reading for a long time more.
However, it would be believed to read historys of another time, of old things, that the barbary of the past would apologize, and then it's the dates that cry, 2009, 2011, 2012...
I really don't believe Philip Roth is so generous.
Word for the other two "Best Romancians Americans" referred here.
Roth, Pynchon and De Lillo are all over.
I thought you'd stopped white, man.
What's it going to be?
Roth is great, well better than De Lillo or Pynchon.
And Roth is uncommonly better than this punishable Bellow, who received him the price.
Maybe the judges of the Nobel this year have decided that if we have to have an American lauréat, it could be likely to have a [lenger] racist.
Munro's very good, too.
They are all produced of "geny Romans" as if it was a literary type.
His homosexual Joseph against...
Who were you reading?
How many DiLillo books have they read?
I never ended Underworld but a few years later I started reading his other books.
Have you read The Body Artist?
News as "Human moments in World War III"?
White Noise?
The first lighter, crazy, smaller, and their dialogues are also super.
I don't know if I'll end a day under world.
I just know that if I meet someone who wants to live in the same world as I and have read enough books from DeLillo to reject his writing talent, I can only be afraid that his favorite romanzer is Tony Parsons.
Why would there be a conflict?
That's a simple interest.
It was a tray of humor, “the law”, not a request for definition.
Among the text and the spirit, it seems so EVIDENT here that the lady acts in SON only interest, and not absolutely in the institution which she represented, that the term "conflict" is asked to do it.
For her, there was no conflict.
I hope she'll take very money!
Well, state services are very practical: or they prevent a dynamic entrepreneur to create the value, or have not prevented it from the danger.
After we hear that French employees are not dynamic and are only looking for tranquility.
The unreasonable areas that are built from the day on the next day when a large construction program is going to start there, it is classic, and not only on a lower coast.
Look at the alluvial beaches near the rivers.
It was said to us that “of today there is no more injuries thanks to the regulatory bars”.
Now, the retention lakes must be expanded in mounting and crushing the dogs.
But this will be due to state services, of course...
The benefit of the field, all of the promotion?
To the ground.
So six million euros.
Is it clearer, there, the interest?
Sort the calculator and you will dream to the life you could have been at the place of Mrs Babin, the first adjoint UMP of La Faute on the sea and the former President of the urbanism Commission, which grants the permissions to build!
The 2 Sarkozysm' mothers are old and immobiliary.
I'm on the left and not all sympathetic with Sarko, but svp, not of low political or low cuts of all azimuts, we're not there in a battle of push balls.
I wonder if the police who were involved in these recent fusillads were also involved in these incidents.
The U.S. police are endured criminals.
The U.S. is a midnight.
So, what the hell did you see, you?
The U.S. isn't a mercy.
Yes, the American police are driving because of the rakes they've done on the daily.
Of course, none of them do never, but the police "come haming them because they are racists".
That's a good apology.
The racism is endemic to the United States, it is unfortunate that it is a incident like that to force people to see the problem closer.
Your generalization reveals a deep ignorance from the US...
You don't know it here.
Good cops must denich corrupted racists.
Get them!
Calculate it.
This kind of open racism does not exist here.
Is this the first time you participate in a conversation?
It's not a conversation, you're accusing someone to be ignoring, while it's clearly you're not going to know anything - of many sources (US sources) have noticed the perpetual problem that racism is in the United States (that's not the oise speculation).
It is very likely that you understood the extent of the problem and don't appreciate how much the tension to this matter is now.
Thus, the border between the public service and the private security for power and privileges, which has never been very robust, is still more important.
Wall Street finances the NYPD in different ways, where the treatment of Occupy is on the ground.
That's awesome to me is the naiveness of some and shocks me the VA and others.
And where do you think that journalists find their information?
On the Internet?
They're going to interrogate the responsibilities, speaking, suspicious.
That the Man goes to Elisée really has nothing wonderful.
Then, what you know is recovery, verification, analysis.
And there's a understanding that the sarcolators are worried about to do.
@Munstead, our current President has been elected on a vague of antiarcozym on the basis of businesses mounted from all parts (unplace and no condemnation), which seemed to have been concorded by judges(2 returned to correctional), two friends of Holland.
If this collusion that is revealed between justice, political, executive and press that is not supposed to be a body of power does not shock you, it is that your partisan spirit is shocking you!
RV with Holland ...
And of course all this is just coincidence and not teleguided!!!!!
If you think that only Sarkozy supports are confused!
From the extraordinary I could read, the VA article does only cut the shooter.
I even rid so much it was pregnant.
For the rest, the world's complaint has little chances to abrogate because journalists aren't "astraints" in the secret of the sources, isn't it?
On the other hand, it seems that it does not seem to have a knowledge between VA and the power when it seems to have known between the power and the journalists of the World for an operation against a opponent.
I should not be the only one to wait for an explanation of the World on the background and its dangerous relationships.
We are well before a state scandale that would cause the fall of the government involved in any other democracy.
From where this edition to lawyers, who said long on the complexity with the current government.
It's not a matter of left or right, it's worse.
I would have thought the shoe would be good with the smoke hair!
It's just for the numbers and to reduce salary and to create housing problems, I am sure that if I was an immigrant of the second generation whose life was pleasant because my parents had come here, I would doubt about the issue of immigration but that is not a reason to oppose controls.
One of the most sensitive people in a BBC employees on immigration was a second generation Sikh, who said that she was in the sense of the number of people who entered and the changes they brought with them, was associated with a Muslim man who wasn't all co-operating, even refusing to give sweets of soup simply because of the religion of the lady, he also refused to enter into her worship place, although she admitted that he was not obliged to pray.

As we all know, if we let it, the United Kingdom will continue to go to the right - whoever puts the limits and contests this must be admired even if it is a pub director:) So better for you!
More to the right?
Where are you living?
If this country was more left, he would be communist.
According to you, what did the New Labour, especially the left?
The liberalization of a country, NHS, is repeated, immigrants' mass immigration (in their own terms to raise the narrow of the right of Dan), the culture of social benefits, the age of the whole-earth permission, the right policy that kills the freedom of expression.
I understand that the Labour is left and not communist, I said that to blague, which I mean, they socially manipulated a very high percentage of the population to make them dependant on the State.
It's typical of the left, if you want my opinion.
Leave your prepared arguments as much as you want, but what I requested you is specific examples of the Gauchist Policy, or a left programme defended by the Government of New Labour.
Can you do this?
With all my respect, it's not what you asked, you asked Daniel Johnson what had done with him the New Labour, specially right.
He gave you his opinion, and then you refused to accept it and changed what you ask.
Yeah, it's more the territory of Tim Bell.
So Martin Sorrell, the strongest publishing director of the United Kingdom, associates the situation of his parents to the economic migrants now in Great Britain?
What an insulting of their memory!
He was totally right to do it.

The treaties should be renegored to me.
Are you, renegations and if the word "democracy" is still a sense in Europe, should it not be?
In turn, the Commission does not consider the unfair fiscal competition between countries in respect of companies.
This must be negative quantity.
The Europe is not the solution, this is the problem...
The EU has only a goal, it is to make the rail transport sector fully marketed.
In terms, this means that all panes of the French territory will not be reserved by the rail.
The abandonion of which are already victims of many territories will only be strengthened.
All sacred, including the advancement of a country, on behalf of the Liberal Doxa, did not seem to me a good idea.
EU is a real problem that will have to be treated well a day.
Not all.
Europe is the first institution to have both the will and the means of clarifying the SNCF accounts.
The French State has been displaced for a long time.

Is he still a problem with alcohol?
If that's the case, shouldn't he be the loving leader?
It seems to me that you have not really been able to distinguish the problems that were existing during the marriage and that, naturally, you are always in the way of coming out of pain and cold now that over five years have been past.
Of course, having an ex-alcoholic alcohol so close to you and what seems to be a daily impact on your life is energetic and very difficult.
This says, it would seem to me to love the separation process between your life and the complications you have heritage.
It seems to be what they do, but it looks like an enemy.
Because you all live close to each other and that complications seem likely to persist while new things are on the surface, have you reflected on a 'fleet' plan so that you can make a cut between your life and your future?
Financial problems have an unfair effect, but with a competenced tax company, a good lawyer and a bit of pressure from the court, they can be resolved.

Why not go to a family advisory group to speak openly of things and to provide support for it to help retain and pay food pension.
I think that's the key.
Your life is done much more than the time you have passed with your ex.
Very good advice.
My advice, ask the children what they would like to do, even if this implies to meet the new woman.
Tell them that you will support their choice whatever it is.
Warn them that he will not hold his promises for the contact and ask them to consider how this would feel and how they will handle the deception if he does not make you.
Try for them to keep a contact with their father.
If they see you do this for their good, despite your own sense because of the way he has treated you, they will respect you.
They will never go to love you and if you do everything you can to facilitate a family/children' relationship, they will be able to thank you when they are greater.
I'm thinking that the children are finished by understanding who's fault, if they're letting them see things by themselves.
Go again a little effort you are near the Godwin point.
Moreover, civilization will disappear in 30 to 40 years, the short-term economic interests are too powerful, that is the land pool against the frost pool.

It is not the climatesceptics that produce from C02.
It's all those who fly, those who use the climate, those taking the air or car, those who live in housing that it has been necessary to build, buying industrial products that have failed to produce and transport.
It is not the climatesceptics that have demonstrated against the epothesis, but the truckers.
No climatesceptic policy is climate and Arnold S consums much more than me.
But nobody said that climate sceptics are more than CO2 than others.
Environmental Defenders also move to conferences.
It is that individual actions, even if they account, will not be sufficient.
Political actions are also needed (other energy sources, reducing dependence to the car, etc.).

Don't use the word immigration, you'll be afraid of horses!
The United Kingdom depends on immigration to pay all our retreats, to take care of our old people, to see their hygienic bassins, to enter the 30 000 people who die each year of hypothermia or hungry (not forget your laine and goodness, which allows you to retain, to eat the heat ET to eat this sandwich in the wound).
Don't be so funny.
The uncontrolled and untested immigration will bring the Ebola into Europe and the rest of the world.
Is that a blague, or isn't it exactly done?
It's more comfortable...
This is how the public money is equipped to allow a slight minority of individuals to pass the good time in the space to make gallets and turn back by playing clouds before television cameras.
The real television has therefore not invented anything, and the authorities certainly hope that a baby is designed here to flame the world and to reinforce the mediatic cover to the western reigns of the tablets.
It may be that they're rescent on the ground to find out that we're bowling here!
In contrast to what you seem to believe, we are not sent men or women in the space to make gallets or crowns, but to work.
And these works are very useful for humanity in general.
And that's in all areas.
Many of the things that improve our daily life are made from space research.
So yes, it's the money expenditure usefully.
You can quote only one thing that improves our daily and outdoor space search.

You know, people who boss what, including more private enterprises, in particular to shop the office at the station.
If you think you're going to buy a plastic gun...
But, and those who do not think to buy plastic weapons now, but who have the potential to buy it for the future?
Maybe they're the most dangerous of all.
Not because the sword in plastic was a decoration in a private residence.
A plastic gun in a bank is used to try to mere people to believe that it is a real gun used to commit a crime.
Plastic swords may be kitsch decorations, but nothing else.
A very malhonned article would have made him bad to the author/editor to put a photo of the 'sword' in question instead of the generic photos of 'plastic swords'?
Or even being sufficiently curious to ask what you wanted to mean (the case if) which was above?
Small typical reporting, it is attracted to the fact that "that's just a sword in plastic" and not on the inspiring jihadi text that is written above.
The sword, a Zulfiqar or Dhu al-Fiqar, is one of the major symbols of Islam shiite.
The Dirani family, on the contrary, is a shiite musulman born in Afghanistan, the terrorist groups that are trying to break the governments in Syria and Iraq are almost exclusively of Sunnite Muslims.
If only people stopped rigouring the fact that plastic cottons are unforeseen.
They can be dead in their hands.
Even the small covered that we are given in fast rests can swim the flesh.
Thank you for this information, so if it's a common decorative object, it justifys the ridicule that the author gives him.
It's not the pain to try to make it a 'ha, ha, a sword in plastic' the facts you have expressed them actually supported his argument.
I saw at the occasion these decorative objects in muslim houses, or paintings on the walls, they never seemed threatening, just another version of a 'Cruz'.
Two Jesus, you're right.
And that's all his sense now...
I saw that guy that looked like being from the Middle East to Kebab Stop and distributed plastic cups every night!
I love the conclusion.
All wonderful new, often technological, are thinking of many people that it is a right and need to benefit it, but they have an immediate and worse cost (subscription, electrical consumption) which are in the budgets.
And it is impossible to enjoy new technologies that lead frustration.
For example, call to the Energy Pacte Solidarity, which allows to isolate the house combles for 1€ symbolic when it is located by a modest household (work costs are supported by the suppliers in fact!).
Simply effective but unknown even if more than 3000 houses have been isolated this year!
Interesting on this PES.
But I never heard it.
Who can call it and how does that work?
for the information of 60 million consumers, water-economic tests, and predicts the use of water economy materials on the robinets and WC.
The study shows that a family of 4 people can reduce from 30% of its water factory (from 150 m3 to 100 m3) is 50 m3 of water economy each year, while maintaining the same comfort.
This is not a crisis of the request, it is a system crisis that is not able to produce enough exceeding (which would then be redistributed as an increase in income in real terms) in order to pay the increase in the expenditure you are classified in the "contracted expenditure".
Otherwise, the energy precaution is "just" the reverse of the medaille that the economy can no longer grow as fast as she wants.
Note that the theory (neo-classific) of the economy is totally unable to respond to such a question, because there is no intrinsic limit to economic growth, and there is no possibility to achieve, more than a decade after decades, the rythm of economic growth.
By its own definition (in physical), energy is what allows to achieve any physical transformation.
Because production is fundamentally transforming, energy is allowing to achieve less economic production (being or service).
And more we want to produce, more energy is needed.
This means that any contrary to the increase in energy obtaining (notably called "producing" energy), even in the form of an increase in its price, involves production to its turn (except to improve energy efficiency, but to improve energy efficiency is always required to significant investments, which are not rewardable if energy is not sufficiently careful).
In short, there is a very strong link between energy precaution and the fact that it is arrived, or not, to increase the "production" of non-friendly energy.
And the very officially published data, for example by the International Energy Agency, shows that the situation will only be able to increase in the years and decades that come (IAEA, in these last reports, clearly indicates that the conventional oil production film has been reached in 2008, including oil nourishing.
However, oil is the most universal energy form, because of its very strong density of energy, its transport and manipulation and storage facility, its variety of possible uses, etc.)
Three points, good jobs anymore than performance.
It was a good performance in Germany, and there was nothing back to the things.
Take that France!
Don't vote on 18.
You're a Watch Tower Webmaster?
So it was noted before: It's good to win.
It's good to win.
In fact, it's good to work the guys.
Although many Englishs love to move skosais when they are just losing, there is nothing to say, they bring a little color to the tournaments when they come to qualify at least until they can remove the first tour.
It's still more rigorous if we play against them ;)
England starts to worry about me.
Because now, when the “size shidge generation” is removed, they may have a decent team with all these young people.
Ferdinand, D.
Batty, Joe Cole and David Seamen returning to the starting XI, why would you change a team that wins?
The only English footballer, who, in my humble opinion, had really been “to international class”, is David Beckham, a little afflicted, maybe, but I think that if he touched a superpower patch like me, he would be fully slaughtered.
People forgot his athlical constitution, otherwise, talking about athlical constitution in the sport, Wayne Rooney...?
I'm never shocking shoes.
I'm tendency to surprise in observing their warm colors with nostalgia at the end of the evening...
The only English footballer that, in my humble opinion, was really "de international class", is David Beckham
Yes, people seem to often forget that he was, at his best hours, a very good player.
It is that Juppe would have been bad to request $100,000 for a conference in South Korea.
And not that he would get them if he asked them...
You mean, people come to shoot a good shooting?
For the rest, I would be surprised to learn that B Debre, for example, only sees on his deputy compensations...
I especially ask the question of knowing what it can be told in its conferences.
How to reduce his deficit?
How to return to full job?
I would say no serious conference of a scientific discipline, or any of its scientific level, even if it is a Nobel price, I will not think to ask the less sum.
Content conferences are most of the free or almost free time.
And I can assure you that these young people work really and that the results presented in their -graduate conferences - are real.
At the time of the research budget restrictions, the reporting of these two figures is constructive.
The researchers conferences are even payable by the lab!!!
That's to say...
Everything's lighting for me.
They look at the sun.
N Sarkozy is a honored representative of the UNP ethics.
I'm like the impression we're trying to win the money?
I am far away from being one of his fans but, that we recall him to have bad (or fraudulently) to manage his campaign OK.
But making conferences seem to be an entirely legal activity.
To add to Nina's comment, we recall that his movements are taken by contributions.
Rule No 1 of Epidemiology: isolate.
All United States and British flights towards or from Africa should have been suspended last weeks.
Human life is more important than the right policy.
It is present in Spain, GB, Texas and other potential places.
What density of the population's infection is that politicians will decide to take the right decision?
So if I want to go from Africa to the United Kingdom, I take the airline for Spain, and then I return a Spanish aircraft to the United Kingdom.
If the Ebola comes in the Western Africa, I see all the flights and ships in the direction of the United Kingdom.
We would always need to send goods that say...
What damage is that the panic of international media on Ebola is not more used to speak of less spectacular but more mortal crisis that affect the people of West Africa.
We are TOUS threatened.
In every part of the world, men, women. It is a very tragic newspaper, a big title so low.
I could read each paragraph and replace the word Humans in other contexts (together relevant): Women are the first gifts of care - read - men travel from a community to another, etc.
More intelligent comments would have been made on the ways, reasons and places we can all help to understand and interpretate cultural and social approaches and the differences in the gender role that could help Ebola in West Africa.
Come on, let's think and write, don't be pleased to do a smile.
There's a moment for everything.
If you are not able to offer a good analysis and an intelligent opinion, maybe you should just think before writing?
While I will put the women's genetic mutation on the same rank as the decapitation - a form of terrorism so barbar, his survival rate is only a different form of torture - saying that its temporary suspension is a "light of hope" exceeding the understanding.
In fact, I see that the contributor is of Sierra Leone, which can give a certain degree of “validity” to his opinion, but in this case, obviously, it does not give a better perspective than that of a medium activist on the street.
And I believed that the Guardian was being “muri” as a worldwide resource of journalism - which progressed in the 21th century, depending on its founders.
Who, in the editoral team, let me look like that?
For a territorial election or other money does not contain.
I read without delay that the territorial public function increases its effectiveness, and I have never seen the article that gives them the word or attempts to explain why.
That would be legal, effective.
There will be uncertainly lies and truths, to separate us the good grain of evil.
The Court of Accounts is cherish to tell both economic aniversarys.
It's true that they never had anything to manage the people in the Cambon Street.
CTs are not in deficit, they have funding needs that can only relate to and only to investments they do.
A force to use too frozen concepts the press as the World makes the game of all darknessisms.
Debt benefits because it finances investment, collective patrimonie
Unfortunately, debt financing is particularly the operational costs...
And as the safeguard of officials (to make good rounds-points, for example) takes a growing and incomprehensible load (obligative load until their death, since life work + retrait), these collectivitys are large in investments.
It is therefore necessary to remove the status of officer, predominantly at the low rate of funds.
In addition, to responsibilities for the financially-building barriers.
It is fabulous, the communities should be accompanied by a decline of common effects, and it is the inverse that has been produced, proof that accompanying a scale is not effective without suppression of the other.
How do you want to correctly manage large territories like cacahuet at the time of the TGV and the car?
The time of the horse where these Territories were created is revolutionary, it may be time to react.
They wouldn't prefer to stay in prison, worse inclined, in the administrative toilet, to paralyse him!
Even striking trials, it is not too strong to explain the situation of blocking to which the state of the Vème has conducted with its provincial men.
This really began with Petain.
Then he continued to reach the series "souffle cuts" arrived strongly in this regard.
Why will they not live in a apartment of 250 million dollars in Monaco above a cinema to leave all this suffering behind them?
Europe is also built on a cemetery, which will be a long and difficult process.
When will these people learn to take care of themselves?
Don't even try the answers of the kind “It's the fault of the whites.
"responses" not "reply"
I hope it's a sarcasm.
It was in my previous post, where it was not sufficiently clear.
That's what happens when we're disappointed to be the first.
If it's a sarcasm or not, there's a argument to pass.
It is now agreed that modern Sapian Homo has developed in the northeastern Africa some 200 thousand years ago, and for a special humid period of approximately 150 thousand years they have been able to travel north to the Middle East, and the remaining (or at least eight thousand years ago) is part of the history.
The current Minister of Defence had stated a few months ago that no military hospital would close.
So he lies.
It was uncertainly the only government that seemed to hold the road.
Now, we know that we can't trust him anymore.
Six o'clock!
in 2017: Transformation in a comfortable private hotel for future retreats of the Republic?
Movement of the floor in Bercy?
Very good decision: Val-de-Grace was a symbol of the past, a doctor for nanites and their families, the "Grand V" care of a 3-speed doctor.
We're going to economize the money, and the military will take care of the grip of the last little part...
Do you know that 70% of the patients are civilians, of all the horizons?
Londra Watps?
I thanked their fans that are based on Wycombe/Londres.
Like the London and the Welsh?
They left the London past season.
It's just the Wasps now.
A franchise of any other name...
At least they're going to Los Angeles, right?
This changes that a football team uses the field of a ruby club instead of the inverse.
Moreover, the movements outside for Tigers and Holys will be much easier.
No, it doesn't change anything.
At Stockport County, we had the fault to be purchased by the Sale Sharks, and we ended by loving our own stage with them once we found our independence.
I would say the same thing.
The way they emphasized to lead to the field, although they have access to other places, did not benefit us.
I like supporter Coventry City.
Good news doesn't stop.
There's always the possibility of a Coventry United now.
This must be frustrated for a team that has no bad supporters and which has recently been at the top for more than 30 years, seeing his stage repeated by a ruby club.
I have aware of the recent CCFC problems but this must be a good glass.
For my part, I'm not the club ruby, and to be honest, I don't know anyone who does it by some fans of the Watps at work.
Yours and some thousands of other people in the south-East will certainly follow them from far or now they'll have to support another team?
Good pro home and good vulgarization.
But who's worried about it?
But why do TOUS IT systems are not based on these concepts?
+ because a large masses of pre-existent programs (cobol, java), + because all systems do not need them, + because there is no magic bag ++....
And because most of the computer systems, bugs have no real importance, what is about being the first on the segment.
The work of G.
Berry relates to a need for niche.
Mr. Gérard Berry.
It should be (mediate) of such personalities that work for humanity.

But they don't sell it.
The real time has become a key sector in many areas, and few of them who know the immediate details of these processes.
It's 15 years old that I didn't go to an Olive Garden.
The quality-price report slowed.
I'm sorry for those who are going to lose their job, but it's better to close the box.
I would recommend a simpler menu with choices known by popularity.
Reduce costs and prices.
There are already too many salts in our food regimes.
Don't ask Olive Garden not to put a salt in the future.
It seems that they agree with Faisons more profits, and not Faisons for healthy plates and the best quality-price report.
They take us for pigeons.
Oh, yeah, look at what people didn't have too much gressin.
And then let's do our suppe by someone else, it's better when it's industrial.
Assure that there is a full dedan salt, that replaces the real ingredients.
We should also add a little bit of sodium glutamatic.
The amount of salt you need to add to the skin water is unlikely, but this significantly enhances the gust of the end product.
It's not only the sweat of the salt, it also affects the way the skins.
The final product is so better.
Without salt, there's no food.
Everyone should try alternatives to the company kitchen.
Is there family restaurants and offer wild plates at reasonable prices?
What happens in the United States is very triste.
A banal accident of the work that turned badly.
A young promiser, who learned the volunteer, followed his father's career in prison for murder.
A man slaughtered everything and brutally interrupted this vote of birth.
That it is sentenced for 10 years of prison seems to be the minimum.
Where are you going?
It's all right!
That humor!
The shipping of it is obviously and difficultly apologizing and bleeding as well as...
Effectively, it is difficult to apologize.
That's what I've got a certain sympathy for a 15-year-old boy.
During the prosecution, the father of the child was complained of never seeing his son but without forgiving the nearby of the guy he killed himself.
Who's really victim in this story?
What are you coming to mechanize!!!?
The father of the child was sentenced for what he did.
With regard to the lost ball connes, the accused and accused, he knew just that the balls are dangerous.
The kid did nothing to the accused!
So he pays for the crime he is responsible!
10 years old, it's a little bit in my opinion.
To have the intelligence to shoot this young man to smile?
Effectively, it was a smile!
If the opportunity is presented, go in vacation in the Mouse Valley and sleep in the B & B of one of the small viticultors.
Two times I do this, wine, landscape and food are excellent.
Furthermore, if you are there for one of the many wine festivals that hold in each community, it's still better.
I'm sorry, the Moselle Valley, I've shooted too fast.
It is glad to see that German wine is recognised.
Instead, the German vignery is traditionally used only a single variety of rains, which means that they really need to bow hard to keep a certain quality.
Of course, some young generations are experienced with different roots, such as France, Italy, etc.
There is not only the Moselle region that must be recommended - France, the Palatinat rheenan (Pfalz), Baden pledge to be visited.
A French region of interest is Alessace, which is like a melange between Germany and France.
The wines are the German style (or maybe it's the inverse, bref).
The Germans prefer birds.
Traditionally, they drink the wine after feeding.
Knowing the popularity of sec whites during the feed, they now propose much, and with a very higher alcohol tension than their 9 degrees prefered.
But their traditional vineyards in bottle to the property are so complex, the breath is overridingly balanced.
Try the Schloss Vollrad spatlese with a thermal homard next time you go to the rest.
Search Hallgarten online to have a good selection.
I used them when I had my restaurant.
The World Atlas of Wine de Hugh Johnston is a good guide, superly illustrated.
I understand that there are new Guardian readers who discover wine, but this is a recap of each newspaper on the German wine since the nights.
On the other hand, there is a article on the German vineyards that are in arrival, the new Baden sects that are going to be accompanied with the plates, the reds that are extremely strict, but especially these are not the degrading Liebfraumilch that people drink when they were young (hey, I really don't think that it's always true or evocator, except if I address me to more than 40 years of age - which, as I say, will already see all this).
Close the Val of Grace would be a great error and a illustration of the lamentable state in which France’s administration is.
A crime against Louis XIV and an epine on the foot of my grandfather and my grandfather who studied it.
In democracy, public health management should be submitted to the vote of the Chamber of Deputy: these ministerial calls, which are holding by the barbichet, and these decisions taken to the closed house, have become insufficient.
Sorbogroin is right.
It should be done as in the Green Solar: euthanasia for 70 years.
Moreover, we could return the flesh that will eat our poor (sic) poor active actives because they can't go to the market.
Really, find the job to our unemployers, the real job, and you have no more deficit problems!
For older people, it is time to pay a little more because national solidarity is not able to provide...
Assets, in the way of disappearance, will not be able to keep this demographic transition alone...
So from the geriatrie, of course, but to think otherwise than a hospitality model of the 30 glory.
Today, the maximum growth of 1,5% (that is the case for 30 years) for the next 50 years will take us to reflect all the model defined after war!
Val de Grace is the symbol of the excellence in medical matters in France: a certain rigorous and disciplinary that was more known in the public hospital.
If this symbol falls, we're really wrong.
First, we're wrong because the rest of the hospitals is not at the height.
Scandal is that the presidents and other elites are able to cure more than in the public hospital.
The solution is to increase public service offer in other hospitals than to keep a doctor at two speeds.
The Val is a French physician pool, and of course it is a symbol.
The closure would be a mistake, a sign of more walking to the French Mediocritical.
Without talking of the military status, which must be preserved absolutely.
"The Hospitalization Day Price", a hospital management unit, is decided by the Ministry with local supervision of the Regional Agencys of Hospitalization.
The abomination of our nation continues.
Finally, I mean, obviously, the baby is only one of these economic refugees, he came to Australia to have better paid work than the one he had in his home.
In almost all countries of the world, a child born in this country of two non-citizen parents is almost always non-citizen.
Australia is far away from most countries by making children born from Australian citizens.
But it is Australia that is criticized because it does not respond to some very high standards, with obviously difficult consequences.
Why?
It seems to me to do two weights.
Send Abbott to the Middle East, Pakistan, Sri Lanka to end all persecutions and violence and wars that flee the people of their country, and forced them to find help in Australia.
If he doesn't want people to come through the ship, then the problem that generates this traffic must be resolved.
I don't have to blame anything about life at Sri Lanka today.
Civil war has been 26 years old, tens of thousands of people died from both sides.
That's what happens during civil wars.
However, war ended six years ago, and the country returns to normal.
Everything takes his sense now, nimrod...!
Strange that the British Prime Minister David Cameron did not believe this little superchild when he was in Sri Lanka with Mr. Abbott...
Cameron condemned war crimes and maltractions that were still happening.
Many European countries have already suspended the deportation of Tamouls with ITTEs, thinking that they would run a risk of torture to their return.
UNHCR revised its assistance application assessment directives in December 2012, and recommended that those with LTTE links be considered at risk of their return.
The year [2013] saw a number of attacks by buddhist warrants groups against Hindu and Muslims.
The elections for three provincial advice were held in September.
Too late, boys!
Mr Nowak, the coco is gone with so periodicly.
In fact, this guy couldn't even get a chance to make it.
He didn't have a health insurance in the States?
So he wouldn't have been given any treatment.
I would like to know who's going to pay for medical costs during his stay in the hospital.
The city of Dallas may have paid some lab for the purchase of the body?
In the United States, the rule is paying first, help comes later.
Specially in Texas
Ahhhhh!!!!
There was no longer, it was explained that the ebola killed so fast that a large epidemia was impossible (we have all a scientific literature on the question, with models and everything).
Then it was said that the risk of contagion of returned persons was null.
I'm afraid more we're wearing up.
You must read newspapers to believe that a risk may be null.
It's slight to three weak, but not zero.
Finally, it is a scientific realistic, more a virus is rapidly dead (generally) less than it has chances to get back because the death of the host signs his own death.
The combination of 2 (third transmission and fast death) is sometimes under the Spanish influenza.
Open c is the general quarter to save humanity..
There's nothing to be obscene to make mediatics of certain brave and true westerns, but at the detriment of thousands of other African sicks who do not know the place or the brave or the verse?
Of course, this lights the action of NGOs and encourages them to help, but the repeating of advertising is a terrible part of it.
The freedom of expression, so loved by the conservators.
The suspension was to keep the doctors under control.
I ask how many doctors have voted for Newman and Abbott, weapons brothers attacking the freedom of expression and the right to the private life of Australia.
I think they have never imagined that their conservators would have taken them out of their rights to the freedom of expression.
I wonder how many doctors have voted for Newman and Abbott,
I think there's one who doesn't do it next time.
Yes, this is exactly what we need at this time, less health professionals are available during potential health crisis.
A heat tour for when the problem really becomes out of control.
There are no longer enough doctors who work around Australia in this way.
Tony Abbott's refusal to participate in the “guere” against Ebola illustrates his philosophy about medical challenges.
The plan of Joe Hockey for a new deadline market fund for medical research, which should reach $20 billion from 2020, would be likely only a black skin for the budget.
Using the pretext of the novel medical research, it will raise $20 billion and transfer these funds as a general income.
I hope that Australian voters will come to see this excellent Russian for what it is.
Tony Abbott is much more intelligent than we don't want to believe.
It explains that the sale of Medibank Private is compensated by the Medical Research Market Fund.
However, it is a loss for sick people, a loss for older people and a loss for low income.
Maybe it's very intelligent, but it's not just.
Finally, the "menger roller" and its Telstra's market fund were excellent teachers.
If it's not just, then show Abbott that's intelligent.
Send it in hell to the next election.
The worst for Nadine is even the “ancient personality, sacred....
I also noted it, enough corrosive as a comment.
If it was only possible to dissuade her to appear a buzz on it constantly..
The worst destiny for a (e) road policy: it is not recognised in the street.
Welcome She has not been acknowledged in its city of Toul as enough to administer it.
What the good sense “ provincial” has good!
We live a hatred time, Madam Morano.
I'm certain that I'm against the Burqa port, but it's not the question.
What this anecdote tells is the purity of sarkozism: small medium-sized ministers, a confusion between the government function and the execution function (if Sarkozy could come with his tonfa on each road in order to demonstrate that it is well guarded by the public order), the pregnancy and extraordinaryness of their maximum degree.
I propose that the right to Morano, Sarkozy and all these “ancient personalities” have become disappointed to bring a fire and a instruction, there would therefore be a obligation to exercise their self-declared function of judges.
But who's Nadine Romano?
This is in fact the main teaching of the case: even the police have turned the page of Sarkozy, maybe they do not regret it.
It's really necessary to stop before it becomes a genius for him.
I send this agent who ignored Nadine Morano's existence, if I could only do the same...
like bob, for the shooting
Not agreed, thanks to her we're striking well...!
Nadine, if she didn't exist, it should be invented!
It's however easy, she looks like Christine Boutin with a blonde pearl.
On that occasion, N.
Morano was clearly done in the fault, in the lack of the police officer that she had faced with her, and who would certainly have had to multiplie the curbs and "Yes, of course, Madam, then Madam, tell me, in what direction I have to run to get out without waiting for this sick woman."
"In one of the cases, the Australian Super Hornets left an air attack on a target of Iss when the risk of killing civilians became too important."
The Americans are not bad about this, but I think even when Isis will go over or have already done it, at least someone counted the body here now no one.
For civilian deaths at the industrial scale, nothing revalues the western war machine.
I am not agreed that the sanctions imposed by the United Nations (including non-western) between the two Iraqi wars would cost millions of Iraqi people, especially children, older people and vulnerable adults.
Most of the anti-governants I knew prefer the sanctions in the defence of the “guerry machine”.
Did you also be the man who prefer the sanctions to order and men on the ground?
Very good comment - the United Nations has acted incredibly hard and unpredicted in the past few years.
The sanctions are generally inefficient and are not able to touch the election - uncertainly a reason for which they have the occasional approval of the Security Council.
You may remember that the insured people have not lost time to mark their main enemy when they saw it in the recent war in Iraq.
It was the United Nations Mission QG attack that they had established at least five days in Bagdad in 2003.
They shocked this place with force and two times and I imagine with satisfaction and cold blood.
So brutal and hard this bomb is, I was surprised by the shock of people to know that a United Nations mission was targeted in this way.
Good notice, I really forgot that.
So add a half million people to the total number of deaths of Western nations (also with recent problems in Ukraine the economic activity was directed to people who intended to hurt).
This does not help your argument only to explode not-reliable statistics.
The only numbers even lowly reliable on the deaths related to sanctions are the children of less than five years and they are even very suspected because Saddam Hussain refused to leave target inspectors to find the facts.
Of course, it was in his interest to examinate the negative effects of sanctions.
The most reliable believes that the number of additional deaths for this age group is between 2000,000 and 400 000, but no one really knows it.
As regards additional deaths in other age groups, estimates are not better than hypotheses.
Since the number of pre-sanction deaths in less than five years was about 10 times worse than in the United Kingdom, for example, it is possible that the number of post-sanction deaths are widely partial to this age group.
Of course, it must be afraid, but also the gift of gams in general.
It must be stopped doing as if people were pure spirits, that love was all that the children needed, and that we could do with unknown people that neither the parents nor the child will ever know, without their consequences.
One of our mythes founders is Oedipe, 60% of French people are from the genealogy.
It's an essential and lacking thing to know his origin.
Instead of doing as obvious and useful fanatists, we should explain what serious problems may happen for a child adopted or designed with a gamlet donation.
If you realize that you've not provided your parents whom you were doing, you could give it, my opinion, because they wouldn't have done any crime.
The last advanced PMA (e.g. ring) are at least debatable as a reasonable GPA.
The real question seems to me: the frustration of the desire of children is justified by these acrobatics and that has nothing to see with marriage for all.
It's just as a point.
It is obviously necessary to fear the GPA, which is what this stupid matter is.
Of course, it's regret that you can't have a child when we want it.
That's a problem I met with my wife.
However, it is less serious than born very disabled or becomes, contracting a serious disease, losing all its children in an accident, etc.
Among all the concerns of life is not the worst.
It's a frustration among many others.
This doesn't prevent life.
And we can always care for other children!
In a society that does not support any form of frustration, where children become well consumption, the GPA is unacceptable for me.
Child's desire is not a caprice where we can use the other according to his good desire.
Staliness requires reflection and acceptance.
