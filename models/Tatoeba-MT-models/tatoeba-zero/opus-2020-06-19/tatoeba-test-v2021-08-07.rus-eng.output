I'm sorry that Tom doesn't have a feeling of humor.
It's a pain when someone dies.
It's a jerk, but he can walk on two floors.
It's a jacket, but he can walk on two feet.

It's hard to make sure he's crazy.
The hope of my size is difficult.
It's hard to say.
You're hard to take it all.
Now take her back.
It's his first day at school.
It's great here.
We must go right now.
It's important that you understand.
I can't explain this to you.

So much isn't normal.
You can't predict everything, so just live and enjoy your life.
It's not really so precious.

The clothes have no importance, but the one whose clothing it is.
Tom isn't too late to save.
It's not too late.
That's wrong.
In these lands, it's not rare to hear a strike.
In these places, you can often hear the shooting army.
I'm not here for this reason.
It's incredible that you make me believe that I believe in what you do not believe!
Last night a little snow was sneaked.
The snow went overnight.
The snow went all night.

We can survive only with quality and bombs.
It's obviously that you love Russian language.
It's like a rain.
It's a strong rain.
Now the rain is in Boston.
It's a strong rain.
It's red.
We can be sure that he will still be invited to return.

That's inevitable.
It's not cold at the season.
It's so cold now.
It's very dangerous here.
Life here is very caro.
Living here very precious.
It's very hard to stop someone during the conversation.
You're worth it.
Try to keep it.
It's written to Croatian.
It's written to Croatian.
This is written on the Niederlaw.
It's written by Niderlawski.
That's your fault, not me.

You're accused of what happened.
Now she's your.
Now she's your.

This decision was difficult to take.
It was in the bathroom.
It was just water.
This happened last night.
It's my book of your kid's shooting.
It was my plan.
It was my head to play, and my king wasn't attacked, it wasn't a shooting, but no one of my films could do the right step, so it was locked with what is called "the shooting King" or "the shooting of the shooting."
It wasn't happening.
This was not a complete inesperation.
That wasn't him.
I didn't translate it.
It wasn't very fun.
It was just a bitch.
It was our choice.
When Tom came home, there was a little bit.

Tomorrow it'll be snow.
It's not easy for us.
It's not so difficult to set up.
That works.
So it'll be easy to win.
It wouldn't be useful to do that.
That would be possible.
It would be safeer to stay here.
I wouldn't be surprised.
The whole story would take a lot of time.
I'll have too much time to explain why it doesn't work.
Without your assistance, that would be impossible.
Without your help, it would be impossible.
