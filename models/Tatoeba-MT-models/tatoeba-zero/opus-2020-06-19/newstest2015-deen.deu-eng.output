Resignation to the very American idea of employment rights as human rights
The Congress Members Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a legislative proposal to enable the organization of workers as citizens.
"Comme workers die, the Middle Class jobs also died", said Ellison, a democracy from Minesoto and the Chairman of the Progressive Caucus in the Congress.
For this reason, I am proud of John Lewis' law of employee.
This delicate law provides workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination because of the organization of workshops as in other forms of discrimination - and stops so anti-economic force.
The addition of the national Labour Law in order to create a possibility for discrimination to organize a co-operation, in order to complain to justice, and to obtain harm or punishment, is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But with security it is no radical initiative - in any case, not according to American standards.
In fact, it is the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors proposed in their legislation, the connection to a very American idea.
Despite the retreats of the workshops in the past years, in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries throughout the country, the United States has encouraged one countries in the world to recognize, enlarge, and maintain employment rights.
There was a time to remember millions of Americans when this country was called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of press and the law of association.
When the United States established after the Second World War Japan, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his stage encouraged the country to adopt a Constitution which would ensure that the military autocracy Hedki Tojos would replace by democracy.
In full consciousness of the fact that the workers and their workshops had a role in creating a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognized that "the rights of workers are guaranteed for association and common negotiations and trade."
When the United States decided after the Second World War of Germany, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his stage stripped the Germans to write a Constitution that would ensure that the Fascism Adolf Hitler would replace a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers should organize, and their voice should be in the new country, the Germans set a clause that explicitly recommended: "The right to establish associations to ensure and improve the working and economic conditions and to improve each individual and every professional or contract.
Agreements restricting or aiming to deteriorate this right are null and unnecessary; these measures are unlawful.
When the first Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was addressed to the President of the International Commission on Human Rights, which was designed by the General Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted by the United Nations as a World Agreement in 1948, Roosevelt added a guarantee that "all of them had the right to form or participate in the protection of its interests."
Since generations, the Americans accept the fundamental press that work rights are human rights.
When the other countries are able to form civil and democratic societies, the Americans explained that the right to establish a community - and that the community should then be protected by collective negotiations as equal partners with companies and government institutions.
After these rights in the United States, it is really wise to re-eye the American ideal, thus the working population must have the right to agree and to hear in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr said,
The story is a wonderful master.
Now everyone knows that the movement of workers did not limit the strength of the nation, but increased.
By increasing the standard of life of millions of people, work has in a wonderful way created a market for the industry and increased the whole nation at an unpredictable production level.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but the story keeps them.
The story remembers, and we should do that too.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights and the enlargement of citizens' rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of employees treaties is too long.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renewed the ideas that the United States have made great in the past and resolved the promise of democracy.
The Judge stops temporary law that all dismissing clinics in Louisiana could be able to closure
On Sunday, a U.S. advisor stopped implementing a law in Louisiana, saying that it would probably lead to the closure of all five delaying clinics of the State.
This measure, which was taken by Bobby Jindal, the Governor of Louisiana, was taken into force in June and was intended to enter into force on 1 September, would force doctors who carry out delays to purchase their practices in a hospital home within a radius of 30 miles.
However, the decision of the judge means that the doctors can continuously carry out legal delays while calling for such a law.
"The applicants can continue to develop legislation while trying to achieve these rights," wrote the Federal Director John deGravelles in his judgment.
A hearing for the judge shall be established within a month in order to make a decision more durable for the law.
The decision that recently in a number of judges against similar measures was welcomed and said that the doctors gained so much more time to achieve hospital information rights.
"The present decision means that women in Louisiana are taking a latter law that would like to take their health and rights to them", said Nancy Northup, President and Chairman of the Centre for Reproduction Rights, which had claimed in behalf of three of the five clinics of the State to hold the law.
It was not directly clear whether the judgment was also struck to the doctors from the two clinics that were not connected to the complaint and also requested instruction rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 States who have adopted similar laws, which recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi for non-constitution.
The keys of a texture law, which had forced most of the clinics remaining in the state, were cut by a federal director on Friday.
In accordance with the American College of Ostritrians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, Dr.
Infringement opposites agree that the measures to protect women's health, although some welcomed the effects of closure of clinics.
Only one physician who carries in Louisiana dispenses has patients' rights, has the center of reproduction rights.
If all the other doctors in the State are forced to carry out any delays, this doctor would not carry out the operation with fear of his security, said the group.
In their argument against the court, representatives of the State of Louisiana said that no doctors would be punished because of the implementation of delays while their applications were still dependent on patients' rights.
Delayed diagnoses and lack of access to the best treatment opportunities to lead higher mortal rates through iron tock cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have set a video home online for her mother who died in the 2007 icestock cancer.
For women in rural areas, Australia is a higher risk to die to egg-tock crystal than for women in towns.
Scientists analyzed the medical data from more than 1100 Australians in which the 2005 icestock cancer was identified, and found that only 25% of the years after diagnosis were still alive.
The research director Susan Jordan, from QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, said that for those who lived in rural and distant regions, the death risk during the study was up to 20% higher than those in urban areas.
CLEINE STUDY: New medicines may delay lungs and icestock cancer
The researchers investigated the health care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in diagnosis, the type of ice toxic cancer, existing pre-related diseases and the social and economic status also affects the survival opportunities.
For older women and those whose cancer at the time of diagnosis had continued, the survival rate was lower.
For those who lived in rural and distant regions of the State, the mortality risk during the study was up to 20% higher than those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women who live outside the city died with higher probability of icestock cancers, Dr. Jordan has a late diagnosis and the lack of access to the best treatment centres as possible.
"This disease is the best treated by ginacological isolates, and these are mostly to find in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedical services in order to resolve the displacement, it suggested that, as possible, strengthening the service of fled doctors to give specialists the possibility to give women close to their home, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that the study, independently from the geographical status, was a bad long-term survival rate in women in the iron-tock cancer and stressed the need for improved treatment and precaution strategies.
The study financed by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years of the gold coast, found that she had an aggressive form of iron tock cancer.
Garden centres deplore slightly household payments

The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society pointed out that residences to the midst or small farms do not mean that people cannot plant.
Guy Barter, Chief Gardens Adviser for RHS said: "Container Customers, for example, are very popular with meats because they can take their plants with a shopping."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of the garden trade due to increased domestic numbers and economic well-being from the late 1980s to the midst of the 1990s.
He also prognosed for this year a improved market situation because of the best weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.

The first spring day with weight and weather conditions affects flights from the airport Adelaide
The FRÜHLING has caused an winter surprising with strong shoes and strong winds that threatened the flights of the Adelaide airport.
On night until 21 a.m. more 5mm rains caught to the city, after 6,6mm, which were already cut on Sunday at night.
The last shock was the result of a series of short-term shoes, including a guest that began shortly before 20 hours and careed for almost 4mm shocks in about 10 minutes.
After the winter last week for a early dose spring, the temperatures in the city returned to a maximum of only 15.8 °C at Monday.
The bad weather conditions probably have led to the late load of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The aircraft had to be taken short after 19.30 hours, but was taken by a shock wind - a slow change of wind speed or direction through a short distance - and had to start.
Winds at this time reached about 50 km/h on the ground on the Adelaide airport.
The flight data showed that the aircraft also had to be started at a second country flight and ended around 20.40 p.m.
The flight delay led to the late of some other flights, including a Emirate flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
The maximum temperature of 16°C is prescribed on Thursday, with possible shoes.
Matthies means: Maximum time to large networks
In view of the gallopious technical progress that threatens our available home in high-tech-scale centres, our colonist Bernd Matthies is comforted with a super confidence of electronic access.
When I write this here, my eyes fall on the sculpture cable that connects the ear with the phone, and I think, "Boah, how back is that?
But in that way, it was a surprise: if the cable wasn't, in recent times all the ears would flee in the house without delay, and that would still be significantly more back.
Unless it is applicable to the ekeltronic (ekeltronic)?
No, Tipp errorr: electronic) the rule that the world’s newness is from today's electricity from tomorrow is purchased.
And, for example, today, who has a rooster in the living room only tells him that he denied the television basically.
Why are these discussions?
Because the Android of the Ifa at the function tour this week reiterates our absolute incompetence in electronic issues.
The Laie, who is blindly dominated by the previous washing machine and CD players, does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are distributed with an unfair expert talk before him: "Connected Home, Wearable, Health Care and Urban Technologies" is the press site.
Yeah, are you all right?
What should you talk to people who obviously extend this quarter?
In fact, there are some 20 years of maintenance that we have to connect our house.
To make the Joghurt himself resigned to tell us the burning newspaper in the holiday on the maledives that it burns grade in the work room.
And it wouldn't be wonderful if we're from the climate office on our nearby arrival ...?
Yes, however, this proposes a climate plan.
But a dream will first be true: We have our arm offering, you say, "Saugen!" - and go home to the steadily bottle.
Ire.
Everything runs on nothing more than a revolution: "The borders between white and brain goods are disappeared", a industrial skiller, you can connect the washing machine with a head-out, the dampgarer sends the weather report and shows how long the pizza in the backhoven is still needed, but nothing uses because we are standing in the stage.
In the daily practice, we also know that if a new device is really urged to use, the battery is empty.
What another reason is that the sculpture cable on the phone will also survive the next functional samples.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the regions near the Gazastrephen returned to schools on Monday after they passed the summer in air protection spaces, while raketen and murder committee on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, and the schools remained closed to Gaza while the area of the fighters was recovered.

President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the border of Gaza to provide support.
To the last week, thousands of people who lived in the borders such as Saad in their homes, or left their homes to get away from Gaza and get out of the smoking and murderer fire.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a community near the borders to Gaza, where a four-year-old young man was killed by a Palestinian murderer granate, are still hungry with the back.
The Ministry of Education shared some twelve families have not yet been returned.
Your children were promptly taught in other schools.

He called the children to learn much and said, "We will ensure that they get knowledge and provide security."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an unexpected armed stage on the past Sunday.
The weapons were careful for a immediate end of the battle; however, important problems remained unsolved, how the demand of the Hamas after the relief of the Israeli-Egyptic blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the air and sea ports in Gaza.

In the war, more than 2.100 Palestinians were killed, three four of them civilians, and at least 494 children according to estimates of Palestinian and the United Nations.
The Israelites take this information and estimates that at least half of the murderers were fighting, however, there were no concrete investments for these information.

After choosing in Sachsen: CD-Viize Strobl makes NPD prohibition procedures
In view of the losses of the NPD in Sachsen, the CD-Budget Vice Thomas Strobl was expressed before the Federal Constitution Court.
Berlin - According to the CD-Budget Thomas Strobl, NPD should find an end before the Federal Constitution Court.
"The NPD is worse than the last time," Strobl, who is also the CD Laden Chief in Baden-Württemberg, said "Leipziger Population".
This is a joyful development in the right direction and development, which can make me more towards the results of the fighting of the NPDs politically and not against the Constitution.
The NPD was totally slow in vote on Sunday at the fifth percentage period.
A first start of the prohibition of the extreme right party was denied in 2003, as the Constitutional Protection had also been in the NPD spectrum of information.
In December 2013, after long preparation, the Federal Council introduced a new request in Karlssrue.
Federal government and Federal Day did not agree.
Harbourg: Zelte for New Refugees
Refugees are now undergoing in villages in the neighbouring countries.
The Central Reception for Refugees in Harbourg offers all neighborhoods.
Now the Internal Authority has set three cells of the Red Cross.
The central politicians have been informed recently, and they have not been disappointed.
"These Hauruck Actions continue to preserve citizens and do not give the central policies a possibility to participate constructively in the human submission of refugees", says Brita Herrmann, President of the Green Group in the Harbour Meeting.
Your party calls for the Harbourg District Management to provide now unnecessary households for enterprise.
96 Refugees can be carried into the three cells.
For reasons for the completion in the first record, the establishment of requesters for aid and the condition that the authorities are not able to provide sufficient places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months.
The house prices have experienced the most intense winter rate in seven years, showing a broader observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for own homes in the Australian capital increased up to 1,1% in August, so the RP data from Monday.
This increase is 4.2% of the total increase in June, July and August, the largest increase in winter months since 2007.
Annual price increase was 10.9%, more than double than the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but increases were not distributed equally over the country.
The research leader of RP Data, Tim Lawless, shared Sydney and Melbourne's two-divided markets.
The numbers of RP data show that the house prices in Sydney in the past year increased by 16.1% in Melbourne in the past year.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices in average increased by 5 and 6%.
At the other end of the scale Canberra, which has been deeply taken by inputs of State expenditures, and where prices in the year only increased by 1.4 per cent.
Mr Lawless continued to observe the increase in the real estate for sale in the next months.
"If you consider the high rate of the auction prices, a generally fast sale rate and a low cost of costs, it is probably likely that your own home prices will continue to increase in the next three months," he said.
In an opinion to the New Press, he opposes the statements of the director Peer Medau and confirms the "come a fieldherr".
The style of high school is not this, meaning in the communication.
If the Medau family is already informed in June about high schools.
The statement that the plans have only been known in July is definitely wrong," says Pötzl.
At the same time, he pointed out that the plans are not "preferences or decisions", however, it is "preferences".
Anything the necessary development of the slight road to the close is less dramatic than the Medaus.
From a nine meter wide road and it is not the speech.
It goes after the current position around 5,50 meters, which is a metro wide than ever,” says Potzl.
The argument of the Medau suppliers that their free and sweet park areas in the future will not be used only by students of high schools, but not to apply.
It will not even be parked because it is possible to solve more intelligently with other public parks.
Think of the people
The children's crippe mountainwechtel, which is on the floor and which would lead to the parking of the parking, would be "not affected".
Moreover, he is thinking of "as it is not only about the children's crippe, but also about the people in the involvement of Friedrich-Streb and the 800 students of the nearby real school.
It is therefore much more than the particular interests of Mrs Medau," says Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the child's cousin, with the development of the road, would be right to go "the small-determined fleets of Coburg," is "supporting the reader itself".
At the beginning of October, Pötzl wants to inform the city directions of high school development until 2020, together with the State Bauamt Bamberg, "and speak to the importance of the new resolution in this context."
Peer Medau has informed the parents of the children's crip about the high school plans.
This will lead the passenger to the new Parkdeck, not as long as the campus and the Friedrich-Streib trailers, but through the Medau margin.
Thus the small street should be built on a kilometer length two-purpose.
According to the higher calculations of the Medaus, the traffic in the park of closs hohenfels would deceive it.
From about 2000 vehicles every day the speech is.
From the sides of the city, they did not want to be expressed to the project.
Glandorf enters into the handball nationality

His ideas and approaches have helped me as well as they will be able to smell my long-year-old players and my followers.
But for my club, I also want to be healthy in the next years, for which longer regeneration rates are needed, which do not allow the current double charge.
The link country had to be afraid of his career after a pheren infection in 2012.
Because of the problems of aching, he had made himself treated by the German Handball Association teams (DHB) with a cortison spot that later had solved a strong distortion.
A emergency operation and two further invasions.
Then, Glandorf had announced a complaint against the master physician, which ended with a comparison.
Twelve years Professional and 11 Years National Humanity Carriages are not going to the body without shock.
I have some healthy buildings that I can't ignore.
After the three infected foot operations of 2012 in short distances, I have never got my blood pressure right in the griff.
There are some other disadvantaged complaints.
Soon at the beginning of the year, I noticed that I control my head, but I can't lie," Glandorf explained in the interview to the Magazine "Handball Time".
For a competitor, he would only be prepared in the absolute emergency.
"I'm always ready to talk to all strikes," the two-fold family parents explained to the machine.
However, I can tell the years in which I can play a handball.
I have also to say that after my long hospital residence in 2012, I have also become very modest about my health.
After my career, I would like to go at least a few times.
Besides the WM title 2007 and the winning of the Champions League 2014, he took 2008 (HSG Northhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo) the EHF Pocal.
In 2012, he also saved the European Pocalizeer Pocalizeers with Flensburg.

"We'll see again in 2015 at an hoping weather on August 30, or for another weekend," the rail drivers, however, talked to return to Munsterland, and the events plan a new location.
Constantine Wecker's unclean honest memories
It is actually more philosophical witness than biography, what has brought Constantin Wecker, lingermachers, patifists, politician activist, ex-haftling, on 287 pages.
Not chronological, but more thought feeds for thinking feeds, the munchers born on June 1th, 1947 had not written his memories, each chapter inscribed by a suitable song text.
And he is unreasonable: from the Onanie as a gymn Asian to the lading steel and drug consumption he does not allow human weaknesses.
In order to demonstrate how he himself has learned tolerance with his fellow believers.
Width rooms also take abstractions, but more important terms: love, soul, ego, his now, spirituality - all that he is trying to go on the ground, very philosophy, but also very personally.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and also how it was not just the music (the operator became a soul and rock music), but also his prison residence.
Last time the Lebemann Constantine Wecker also closed to the asketic mosk, which is "in subtraction" as he says, "If you leave everything unnecessary."
Among all the high-speaking views, however, there are also short shoes to earth: about slopes in a GI frequencised local or a swimming car where it was frontally viewed by a tree.
He's too honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me into the arm.
He never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of the seven children of a Yamaikaian immigrant family in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry tried for a commodity, Rudy's Rare Records, which was partly based on a imaginative conversation with his father and was found on the radio series 4.
The sound track is a mixed of Reggae and Rap, with living melodies.
But Henry had to work on some difficult childhood.
He visited therapies "wealth" after his mother's death, and Henry is desperately about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
They never saw his face, just listening to his voice: "On with the snake.
Leave your sister in calm.
Move!
I want to look at Cricket.
My old brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were grown up when I was a child - went with him in the skin and talked about things such as the shape of the beerglas or the beauty of a cricket.
I never had such a conversation with him.
A majority of my life he was this serious guy in the edge that reads the newspaper.
He's opened a sweetie in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at the time of his father, he won a view of how life would be for him.
It's now something lighter, but they're dark, weird, deep steady labyrinthe with flaming and fuming and much rush.
My father was just in the wheel, and then he was able to hear how he was to sing, because he was able to wake up the skin.
When I went out there, I was clear that he had done the year to take the food to the table, and my respect was greater to him.
However, Henry was a child without his parents’s loved witnesses.
My dad never burned me, he never said "I love you."
When my mother went badly against the end of her life, we're trying to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
By his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he could share the love he missed as a child.
Can you stop with the "I love you?"
Shut up to shame me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
It is still pleased with French whom he was married 25 years old.
That's a good man.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was diabetikerin.
That helped her death.
So when I was very overwhelming and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You must be radical.
So I moved this fatnessing and had to do a drastic diet to turn the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's strict.
No one likes the caroten.
Henry's career change may be shown in his elegant, short-cut bar.
Since he was promised by the critics for his othlello, he was combined by the theatre.
It followed the Commodities of the Irrogations, and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is another experience than the Sitcoms and Communities who have filled its jobs.
He started with only 16 years of age when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on the bridge when he initialized people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the middle of the seventy years. "I was for a very long time the only black immitator/Comedian in the television."
He learned in professionals.
I had to be great not only before the eyes of publicity, but also learning from 1975 to 1985 how I could become an effective Witze account machine while I was a star through the television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had the right of the Black and White Mintrel Show, a light-speaking training program in which the people "smile up", Henry put his comedy there over five years.
My family was very unclean.
I wanted something that would never happen, but I don't think I did it.
It was a extraordinary position for me, but I worked in rich projects with and learned how to do with a great public.
But this "from years of prestigious light sample of the British television" was also a "great parodie of black people".
Introduction of figures that the British black culture was shocked as well as fellowed, Henry worked in the eighth centuries at a alternative comedy circle.
The first series of Lenny Henry Show went to sending 1984, and in the ninety-years he was known among the kitchen cheese Gareth Blacklock in the Comedyseries Chief!
Advertising, documentarms, TV series and film rolls predicted his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008 he thought, "What do you do as the next, Len, because it feels all like you're just bringing the time rum or a little at the place."
Then a documentary for radio 4 with the title What's So Great About ...?
The first result turned around Shakespeare.
On Shakespeare, I was regularly allergic.
I never had learned something right about him in the school, and he was overlooked for a domain of the Middle Class, white in electrical hoses and a carbon head before it.
So I had great fear of it.
All we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try it once.
Don't make it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take a few words in your mouth, and then you will understand why we all love Shakespeares so.
Henry took 20 lines from Othlello's last talk for the documentarch film and he was shocked.
I felt I could make it.
It was almost like someone would finally put me the head right.
"It's why it's a serious matter, take them seriously, learn your text, search a little.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for a month before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seem to expect a car accident, and it didn't happen.
And soon he came to the committee of the bans.
Soon I was in the National Theater and I couldn't believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical error, and Henry felt instinct that he had to maintain the public.
"Any little voice said to me, "You've got to overcome 10 minutes, while they're reparing the computer."
Instead, the chief announced that the idea continued when the problem was resolved.
I went from the cup and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for it.
I can leave someone else.
"You play in a theatre, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences am Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was right.
Panic is very good, that strengthens the blessings.
It also came well, so it's like a great shield of gods that say to me, "This is your determination."
He said this, of course, with a DONNERNAND voice.
So I'm staying there.
I really love it.
I love it to be in a sample room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation has been overwhelming by humor breaths, while he still initiates people again.
I have decided to do no stand-up comedy because I find that this kind of immediate satisfaction of a room full of foreigners is dangerous.
If you're always looking for this, you're going to go to the wall.
Sometimes I live in the Apollo when I enjoy it, but in total, I don't have a lot of time before.
I ask him if he's going to make a standup commodity again.
The joy I have in a room with a government that helps it to form a start, a means and the end of a travel - I don't think I want to resign it again.
Is this his new incarnation here?
I'm thinking.
I'm a player.
It's fun.
It's always a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi-rebelles block streets in Jemens Hauptstadt
In the conflict between shytic Huthi rebellies and the Jemenitic government, Huthis has called to civilly injury in the capital city of Sanaa.
Huthi-accessors had been located on Monday central streets in Sanaa, said a speaker of the Huthi-Parti "Ansar God".
It has also been blocked to Parliament.
Jemenic media reports from a chaos of transport in the capital city.
According to the online output of Yemen Post newspaper, Huthi Leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi had called on Tuesday to the measures.
Huthi threatened by the Blatte's details with a further sculption of the conflict, it should not be satisfied with its requirements.
The Scytic Huthis fights for more independence from the sunnitical ruling Jemen and calls for the government's return.
The city of Huthi has been the capital of Jemeni since just two weeks.
Rund 30,000 rebells have created Protestlayers on the large road of Sanaa.
In the round, it's always coming back to battle with the Jemenic army.
Kenia registers Beamtes to develop "Gestioned"
Kenia has thus started to register all State officials biometrically to remove "heritated" from the content lists of the government.
Workers who do not register in the next two weeks would not be paid anymore, as a government communication.
The Government is grateful that thousands of people are also obtained after their decision from the public service and content payments.
President Uhuru Kenyatta said to fight corruption in the public service at its 2013 office.
During a test at the beginning of this year, at least $1 million (700,000 £) per month, on payments for "heritated" and by other misleading financial practices lost.
The government claims that detentors are continued to be paid on accounts after a person died or left the public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports for the BBC from the main city of Niirobi.
All officers must now appear in the next two weeks in identification centres to ensure that their data on the biometric registers were included in a government report.
All those who did not do this without a credible excuse from the content list continued the communication.
"But this step is essentially involved in rationalization of the public service by identifying the actual number of officials and also joining the content list at two government levels, so the "great-building" will be eliminated," said Anne Waigru, the secretariat of the Department of Decentralization and Planning.
The scandal on the artist Helge Achenbach is negotiated first time before the court on 11 November.
Five heritage from Berthold Albrecht, son of the Aldi Greener Theo Albrecht, requests 19.4 million euros in a civil process in the Düsseldorfer Landgericht, Achenbach, and two of its companies, which are insolvent procedures.
This shared a court speaker on Monday.
The record indicates that Achenbach has affected the purchase of artworks and older names and Berthold Albrecht was higher than the actually paid purchase prices.
The arranged provision should also be higher.
Achenbach has purchased 121 million euro values for albrecht.
Childs need roots and flights
44 years old, he was in school service, 23 of whom he was head of school.
From that time, Manfred Judgers knows many standing Petershauser and colbachers from their time as a teacher.
His methods sometimes were unconventional, but it was always able to see people in the school.
The Sneehead is the most famous mountain of the Riesenberg.
Manfred Judger loves the motive with the motive from his home.
Judges were born in 1930 in Trautenau/Nordbows, today Trutnov.
Soon with 14 years after four years, he was a high school for teachers.
A year later, the Southern Germans were responded.
The family had to leave her house within half an hour.
After a few months in a camp, 1946 he went to Bayern - in the boat.
Thus, the judge moved into the top-frencies senk village.
The education was placed in Bamberg.
In addition, Manfred Judges had six times a week to the next train station, with the train to Bamberg, where three miles away from the whole city to school and at the end.
After two months, Manfred Judges took a sleeping opportunity in Bamberg, together with up to 15 colleagues in a bed hall.
In 1951, he made the first and 1954 after three years of teacher officer the second State review.
Because the hospitals weren't free of school for him, he was on top battlers and came to the school in Collbach on November 1st, 1954.
The "Freulein Room" was his first "service" in the school house.
In 1958, he was located in the new-building teacher house next to the school, a three-room service.
This house purchased Manfred Courter 1980 after the school was dissolved in Collbach in 1968.
To date, there were three classes in Collbach in the school group Petershausen-Collbach and in Petershausen five.
Since school year 1968/69, these were together in Petershausen in today's Council House.
When the Inderdorf School Association was found, the primary school remained in place.
In order to get back to the smaller school now, the current rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Judges became his follower.
But Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers were able to relate to the today's construction, which was expanded by the Courts of Pension since September 1982.
Manfred Courter welcomes the incomplete movement of the former citizensman Ludwig dentz, which made further work spaces on common costs and in the extension of 1997, although it was not possible for educational construction directives.
"Their God was very blameful," the judge recalled.
In his whole career, Manfred Judger never forgot the decree of a government adviser who had responded to a referendum on law and justice: "You should never forget the love." Manfred Judger put out what he had heard as a young teacher.
"Thank to tell the children two times: roots and birds", says the 84-year-old boys today.
And he had to learn, "It's not always happening." If he only means his own six children, it's not clear.
In any case, the judges were sometimes unconventional.
When the students tried, they did not find him a criminal work and were not distributed to the subsidiary.
At the cost of the community, judges had to create two pairs of box hands and left the two contractors against each other, even if it had to give it a box.
In the course of the school, judges were a good relationship with the former citizensman Ludwig Götz (CSU).
This moved the participating judges after their pension to claim at least as last on the CSU list for the Council of Communities in 1996.
However, the judge was chosen on six places and the CSU was involved.
180 km in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 drivers in the curk of Bad Salzhausen and shoots
If Radler makes its tour in Bad Salzhauses or shoten rast, this is nothing special.
On Friday, however, only the number of rasters were impressioned: the 700 participants of the hr4-radio tour and the jointtros had a suspension in the lower park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under free heaven in the Scoteburg Park.
Under the Motto "Radels and celebrations on new discovery ways between Nidda and Kinzig", the participants met on Thursday in Bad Vilbel and there lived a concert of Van Baker & Band.
On Friday, it was serious: the Radler took the first step, 60 kilometers through Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and continued to attack.
In Bad Salzhausen, the Sports of Master Hans-Peter Seum, who was launched in Bad Vilbel with the bicycle rade, and the director of Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring, was welcomed.
To refrigerate the body and spirit, all of the good things were prepared: the farmmen from Ranstadt and the Nieder-Mock City had backed 85 clouds of apple, swimming, swimming, and swimming swimming swimming swimming swimming swims.
"Solche kitchen can only return to agriculture girls", a participant from Aulendiebach, while he ordered another piece.
At the level of the Turn Convention, cold refrigeration could be found.
The "Duo Bravo" supported visitors with famous melodies from operates and musicals and rejoiced applause.
The beautiful environment of the park was quiet.
In addition, a masses of his partner: "What he has granted, he has finally confirmed a bicycle chain that has already been cut today."
This is where the citizensman and the manager of the business were still working: they were interviewed at the breakfast before the reporter Rainer Janke's drinking house and used the opportunity to purchase in the Bad Salzhauses radio.
Promotion Chief Tobias Hagen, since the first hr4-radio of 2004 as a tourist leader, was only able to shoot in a short way, but he was able to make a lot with the technology in place.
His Pickup Trick, in which he wrote through three phones and a shuttle with his employees and the 15-bottle motor radstaff of the Hessen police, wrote Facebook entries and reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of participants are from the Rhein-Main area," he said, "but also from shoes or Fulda, from Lauterbach or Taunus, and even from numerous cities in Westfalen, rail drivers.
The number of participants is a few of the overnight capacity available.
In category I, the participants are entreprened in Hotels, in category II in collections.
From the course, the radler had a good impression when they turned back after a half an hour, "Thuss!"
"It was beautiful in Bad Salzhausen!" they wined.
After the arrival in the shoot, the group was able to set a short salesspause.
But the radlers were requested in the idyllic Alteburg Park at night.
Under the region of the Scottener Society for Tourism and City Marketing (GTS), the park had received a beautiful celebration environment and, of course, had been prepared for leckerea, about flaming cubes with well-coated frozens.
Master Susanne Schaab, GTS Business Director Markus Hosfeld and MSC President Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his function as a member of the ADAC Hessen shows welcomed the visitors.
The three were apparently pleased about the "willing operations in shoots".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance bubble.
The opportunity to smooth movement under free heaven was slowly used, despite the sporting confirmation on the bicycle.
Among the guests, growing citizens, which were made by the good smiling as well as the great crowd of the rail drivers.
On the second day, the stations Birstein, Wachersbach and Bad Orb - were included in a concert with the trainwalkers - on the program.
Last night, after 180 kilometres of Radeln, the sportors returned to Bad Vilbel.
twenty-third Turkish police for "conciliation" against the government
The total of 33 police officers in Turkey, due to the suspect of the "conspiration against the government", reported local media agents.
The police authorities did not comment immediately.
Under the prisoners, 14 high-range police police reports the Law Daily News.
Some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government employees, including four government ministers in the last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested because they might have found a organized criminal association and called telephone numbers.
The Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan, who was then Prime Minister, described its action as a part of the activities identified by the Islamic Islamic clergy fethula Gullen against him and other people in power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally a important day for families, and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenj Jazenjuk took his daughter into school.
There he attended journalists that not all schools have reopened that he had decided to defend the country for future generations:
The September Festivals were not held in each school.
The heavens are not peaceful over all parts of Ukraine.
We need to fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian people's face, must fight for a peaceful heaven.
Alexsan Pastukhow, school head of the school in Slawjansk, who visits Japan’s daughter, spoke about Russian.
We hope that this is finally resurrected by peace and that the children will receive a education that will be useful for them in further life.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with the children's slaughtered hairs, hold ballons into the hands and give their teachers flowers.
With Rona Fairhead the BBC may have found the great director that she needs.
It applies with a honourable sleeve of the banking world, the media management and the internal circle of the Tory Party.
And she has his own front.
Their careers started at the world management company Bain and Co., which changed to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was headquarters of the Financial Times for seven years and came back when the top posts of the mother company Pearson went to a young man colleague.
Your discharge was almost 1 million £.
It is also solid for her political rhinking.
She was recommended by Lord Browne, the previous President of BP, as she searched for more private knowledge in Whitehall: she became the shopping officer.
Her husband is a former Tory Council member.
Soon in May, I described the task of the Chairman with a forgiven chair.
It is not only BBC as a huge and complex unit in the heart of public life, but there is also a internal paradox in its structure.
The confidence is in two directions: inside the first garden of the BBC's management hire, but also in the outside as a voice of public concern and distress when things are wrong.
This ensures a almost untenable Duopol, which requires complete reform.
But what new chairman would risk to happen, to struggle, and to interfere with a institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynamic, while he may take himself for his job.
It's a difficult task.
And if it's not enough, there are still many interests in seeing the BBC reduction - overcome power, money and status.
While competitiveness is closer and new technologies are threatened by older, attractive security, the existing negotiations of licensing costs for BBC are associated with specific risks.
For the reasonable amount of 145.50 £ per year, the British public is acquired in the world's largest media companies.
The BBC tells a good story: she says she reaches 96 percent of all households and it's only 40 pence per day.
And apparently, the BBC is growing up on top: 53 percent are supported today, compared to 31 percent from 10 years ago.
The View and Use habits for the BBC have changed: I get news lines today on my phone and see passed programs later on my iPlayer.
But she remains a very loved and beauty institution.
She needs a careful President - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says that the decreased Twitter was not authorized
A Twitter from the official user account of the Republic of Texas, Rick Perry, took a decreased comment on the democratic government adviser, which is at the center of a criminal accusement against him because of the abuse of the officer.
The Twitter was later removed and replaced by another by Perry's user account that depends on the previous.
A tweet from my account is sent out that was not authorized by me.
"I don't approve the twitter and have removed it," he said in the later news.
The workers of Perry did not respond immediately to questions on comments.
Although the Twitters of Perry's official user account had not been clear, it was not clear who actually beds the feed.
In the previous Twitter, a unprecedented image of the Central County advisor of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, was signed in April 2013, which was sentenced to the tax for the throneness in April 2013.
Perry took a veto against a financial promotion of her office when she refused to return, which could be a complaint against Perry - the candidate of the presidency may be - before a Grand Jury in Austin this month.
The text of the twitter says: "I do not always strike with the three-fold authorized alcohol level ... but if I do it, I claim Goberneur Perry when he explodes it."
I'm the worst democracy in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not in charge on the investigation of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was conducted by Michael McCrum, a special lawyer of San Antonio, elected by a Republican judge.
Perry's not guilty and called the accused a political trick.
His high-classic team of law advised the judge in the case of the complaint and argued that the law, which was introduced against the senior Governor in the history of Texas State, was unconstituted.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of government money to the Public Integrity Unit of the State, which is adequate in Travis County, and identified in cases of state corruption in Texas - as Lehmberg refused to return.
This Veto was careful for a public complaint on the left side of the Watchdog group.
Perrys official user account is often updated - and sometimes famous.
After he concluded at the election meetings in Iowa during his 2012 presidency candidate as fifth, Perry came to speculations that he will stop by posting a twitter of a photo of himself from the joggen near a sea, with the words "South Carolina, we come!"
Berkeley explains the accommodation market for "normal"
One of the most prominent manufacturers of London pointed out that the housing market in South England is to be "justed" to a normal level.
Homes in the capital city were hot, and there were huge price attentions, which the Bank of England involved to place in June on top of hypotheken credits.
Tony Pidgley, founder and headquarters of the high-class building company Berkeley said on Monday: "Seen the beginning of the current financial year, the market returned to normal transaction levels since the 2013 maximum."
The real estate market in London was well established during the decrease, as foreign buyers were cut into the capital city.
According to the information of the Catastrous Office, the prices in the city have been increased springly in 18.5% in the past year, much more than the average increase in England and Wales.
The average sales prices in Berkeley's private, prices and students were around about one fifth in the past year and laid down at the end of April 423,000 £.
However, in the past months, a stronger pound has made the real estate property in London less attractive for foreign buyers - some of them are also affected by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political Rhetoric for a possible "villial tax" before the general elections in May next.
In the last week, the London real estatemaker Foxtons warned that the Hypotheken market report for April, which was presented in the largest credit payment schemes, would also lead to low market growth in both market sales and prices.
New data from the Bank from England from Monday show a decline in the hypotheke authorisation in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is coaling.
Hampions International, another real estate agency, corrected its expectations for increased real estate prices in London for 2015 at least 3 per cent, based on a weak house competition now.
The transaction volume in the main areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has returned to a fourth year for a year, so the Macler WA Elis.
However, the desire is a blessing after a home in the capital city for Berkeley, as the accidental amounts for terminal sales are at more than 2,2 billion £.
Mr. Pidgley added: "The question of the right, well planned product remained stable to the best places and, as a result, the terminal sales remained stable."
In June the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year until the end of April, almost one third more than the maximum of 2007 before the crisis.
Annual preimbursement result increased by 40 per cent per cent to 280 million £, up to 18 per cent to 1,6 billion £.
In a communication on Monday before the year meeting of the company, Mr. Pidgley said that the income for Berkeley would be in line with the current market expectations in the past year.
Analysts are estimated in accordance with the annual preimbursement result of 450 million £.
Berkeley's actions were held at 23.96 £ at the afternoon in London trade.
Photos of Jennifer Lawrence by Hacker on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence income at the 85th Oscar delivery.
Nackt photos of Oscar Prize Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker to have a "master list" of images more than 100 starlets.
One representative of the Star from "The Tribune of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real and complained the hacker because of "eclatarant violation of the privacy."
The authorities are informed and will follow all those who post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on the photo-sharing page 4chan were used by a lake in the online player system iCloud of Apple. The suitable "Masterlist" of the Hacking offer includes the name of twelve women stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstett and Mary-Kate Olsen, reported BuzzFeed.
It is not sure how many of the images are real, although Winstead, Star from "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those of you who look at photos that my husband and I have taken in the private environment of our home for years - I hope you are so satisfied with you," wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeonsians "iCarly" and "Victorious" describes that it is about pictures of her and tweeted "This so-called nackt pictures of me are GEFÉLSCHT, people.
Let's just start the beginning. *Word games look at*.
Buzzfeed reported on Sunday that a speaker of the Popstar Ariana Grande depends on the truth of the pleasant photos of her.
Exclusive exit from Howard Jacobson's highlighted new Roman on love and letters "J".
They cut off, so you could describe the best, they slowly solve themselves as a swimming card that you have left in the rain.
He was a woman who told him that he was too serious, tender, intensive, distance, and maybe something crazy.
And then he protected his hand.
He knew the crowd.
He was sweet, like in Igel, yes.
The last sacrifice of this stability was a just starting business that was more promising for a delay of the long-term of his life was more than any other, and maybe he had brought him even a certain satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a swimming sweet sweet beauty with swimming hairs and a flattering heart from a village on the northern island, which was even more distant and rare than the Port Reuben.
She was with a older lead to the south, who took the Keverns for her tank, and who had generated a floor in a fired but paradise Tal with the name of Paradise Valley.
Over a few years, no one lived in the house.
The wheels were pleasant, in the bowls were still spring, nacktacks had left their shoes on all windows and believed, heard all that, and the garden was grown up with unclean, which was like a huge coal head.
It was like the house from a child market, both threatened as locked, a garden full secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose Roman "J" is on the long list for the Man Booker Price 2014.
The shortlist is announced in the next week.
Kevern had seen with Ailin on the broken legs in high grace and a uncomfortable spring lunch. Both of them were in the service console, which supplied the country with quiet music and encouraging news, when the view of their crewed brown bein him to an old song forgotten black Entertainer, who was pleased to be cut in the house with his father.
Your feet are too big.
On the basis of their extreme aggressiveness, the songs of this type have no longer been played on the console.
Not prohibited - nothing was so right - just not played.
It was successfully obsoleted, as it obsoletes.
The general shock created what was never done with the release and rules, and as the people in books chose the balls in the Vom-Tell-Teller-On Millionary Memories, Cook Books and Romans, so they chose the balls at the music.
In the Euphorie of the day, Kevern began to play a imaginative clavier and spend in a large-comic Serenade Ailin's feet.
Ailinn didn't understand that.
"This was a well-known song of a jazzpianist named Fats Waller," he explained and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
That was his father always done to stop the letters J before he came out of his mouth.
It had been a game between him and his father when he was small.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told him.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers on your lips, it costs a penny.
It wasn't a very sweet game at that time, and it wasn't now very nice.
He knew that this was expected by him, that was everything.
It was supposed to explain what Jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard what.
Jazz was not played, even if he wasn't prohibited directly.
Improvising was no longer modern.
It was only place for a single "wan" in life.
People wanted to be safe at the beginning of a melodie where it would end.
Like the mind.
His inheritance made people nervous.
And Jazz was musically expressed.
Although he had become 10 years old without hearing by Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about Jazz from the half secret collection of old CDs of his father.
But at least he didn't explain that Fats Waller was black.
In her age she probably couldn't remember at a time, in which the Popscanner wasn't black.
No laws or interferences again.
Conform society means that each element of this society was grateful to the principle of grouping - thanks to the switch.
People with afro-karibian origin were suitable by temperature and body construction for entertainment and sports, thus read and cut them.
People who originally stood from the Indian subcontinent were blessed by the nature with electronic talents and were taken to ensure that no family remained without functioning service phone.
What else was from the Poland Community, it was concerned about the changing; the rest of the Greeks was destroyed.
Those from the Golf States and the Levant whose grandmothers did not quit rapidly as WAS GESCHEHEN WAR, WEEN GEESCHEHEN WAR did, because of the fear of being accused of fires, even fear that the flags would be seen as the next – had opened the Labneh and Shisha's Pfeifen restaurants, and were depressive.
Everyone after his ability.
As she had heard only Balads, Ailinn was hard to understand how the political words that Kevern had just foretold her could be shocked.
music was expressed by love.
"These aren't really gentlemen," said Kevern.
Besides people whose feet are too large.
My father never played anybody, but he loved this song.
He was talking too much, but the unforeseen garden gave him the trigger feeling of security.
There was nothing to overcome the shadow of the huge cold floors.
Ailinn's not yet understood.
Why should your father like that?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but he was smiling to put two fingers into the lips in their presence.
She didn't even think he was something else.
"It appears to him", he said.
She protected her head incredibly and disappeared the view of Kevern.
There was nothing else in the whole world to see than you're inconsistent rabbit hair.
There was nothing he wanted to see.
"If you say it," I don't believe it.
But that's not yet explaining why you're thinking about me.
They seem to be honest.
Are my feet too big?
He saw him again.
Don't get your feet soon.
Maybe your kitchen, a little bit...
And you're saying you hate me because my skin is sweet?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the dark song.
He could say "I love you," but it was too early.
"Your smell is exactly the reason why you're wrong with me," he tried.
I'm a little perverse.
That wasn't right.
It should have been funny.
When he tried to be ridicule, he often in difficulties, because he did not have his father as the calm charm that he needed to defeat the inflicted grains.
Maybe his father wanted to be graused too.
Maybe he wanted to be, Kevern, that's it.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomon was red and was cut out of their lift, the console drew up and swallowed the wine they were slaughtered.
The wine of Hollywood, therefore, was not a apologist for him.
In their exhibition, they seemed to sit as palmweed in the storm.
"And your copper is exactly the reason why I feel perverse to you," she said...
Besides I'm not there.
She regretted him, for the unnecessaryness of his words, as well as the fear shown in her eyes, when she rejected against him.
Did she think he would shoot her?
She didn't tell him of life on the cold North Archive where she was grown, but he had no doubt that it was so importantly like here.
The same huge and heat ocean took place here as there on the ice.
The same condemned men, with still a skin and a tremendous skin after DEM WAS GESCHEHING as they had been as smugglers and beach pumps, moved from kneipe to sneipe, always ready to swallow the hand against a woman who refused or slaughtered them.
Dickcopf?
They would have shown you a shirt faust if she didn't wake up!
It was only useful - useful the most commonly used word for an erotic association force between men and women, a opposite to the unfaithful balls of love from the console - to use them only and then shoot.
According to Kevern's view, this was an unnecessary defense, since the use of itself represented a act of violence.
Ailin Solomon gave him a sign through his body.
He took himself out of the snake like a old man.
She also felt angry, but the weight of his dreams surprised her.
That was not the end of the world.
They didn't know.
She saw him how he was removed - as well as from a room in the top Stock with her companion with him - a man, sweet by something he himself had succeeded.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
She felt a deep pain for him and men in general, although some of them had led their hands against them.
A man turned away from her, shocked, wounded, without fighting - why was this a view that she seemed well to know when she couldn't remember at one time in which she had ever seen something like that before this day?
When she was back alone, Ailin Solomon looked at her feet.
A number of years ago, the preceding events, Esme Nussbaum, a intelligent and encouraging 32-year researcher in order of Ofnow, the illicit supervisory body for public stimulation, worked at a short debate on the continued violence at the lower and medium-level level, in exactly the countrysides where their reduction, if not decreased, had been expected, in view of the money and energy, which were invested in the eradication of this violence.
"It was already done so much, and it is still to be done," she wrote, "to strive the native aggressiveness of a people that leads thousands of wars and won most of them, especially in the distances and men of the country, where the sweet breath of human friendship historically seen, despite the high demanding warms between the heats.
But some of the properties make themselves unroticable.
The higher of the snake, so it seems to be lowering the suffering he continues to be shocked.
The population smiles at the earning of emotional ballades, smiling in stories about overwhelming difficulties and emphasizes to believe in the ancestors of heritage and family life, but it is not only the former morality of the rural communities as well as our urban accommodations in the hand, but there is also an intriguing to bring up a new and remaining warriors to home, at the home place, on the streets and even on the game fields.
"They have had an unfortunate tendency to overcome," her mentor said when he had read the whole report.
I propose you read less Romans.
Esme Nussboum is on her head.
I have to ask you, are you atheist?
"I think I don't have to say that," said Esme Nuss tree.
Are you lesbic?
Esme reiterates its right to privacy and refusal of the statement.
Feminist?
Again.
"I don't ask it," said Luther Rabinowitz finally, "for I would be against atheism, lesbentum or feminism.
This is a predictable workplace.
We serve a predictable society.
But certain types of hypersensibility, which are absolutely acceptable and loving, may deteriorate the results of the way you have imagined them.
You themselves have apparent prejudices against the Church, and these things which you call as "hinterest" and "roh" could also be interpreted by others as well as the expression of natural power and vitality.
If you are on the floor, WAS GESCHHEN, WHEN WEEN THIS GESCHHEN, like if it had happened last night, it means to take the country its essential life force.
Esme Nussbaum saw the ruin while Rabinowitz spoke.
In his head, a LED writer in Flamingorosa repeated the advice provided by Ofnow to the country in the last 40 years or longer.
Love your neighbors, value your partner, listen to Ballades, visit musical, use your phone, speak, explain, hear, apologize.
Speaking is better than sweet, the sweet word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I understand absolutely what you want out," said Esme Nussboum with a quiet voice as she was sure that her prosecutor had spoken at the end, "and I say nothing else than that we are not still so effectively healed as we themselves.
My concern is that without warning we can find out how we repeat the errors that have ever been reaching to WEIS GOOD WHAT WE HEES HEESHEN.
This time, however, are not the other to which we leave our wrath and our faults.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with the hands.
In order to show an angel's pacience.
"He goes too far," he said, "If you call acts as "error" who may have started our grandfather or even not.
You're going too far if you're talking about these would have left their "good" and their "misstrauses" to "other".
Indeed, it should not be necessary to remember someone in your position that we speak when we understand the past as in the protection of the present, not of "we" and "other" when we understand the past.
There was no "to" and there was no "other".
It was a time of unjust, that's all we know.
"For the one, if we are honest to us," said Esme, "no part of society can be able to have a good behavior.
I don't blame anybody.
If it was bad or well done what happened, it happened.
That was then.
There's no need to be said anymore - we're alike.
And exactly as no guilt must be acknowledged, there is no fault to be acknowledged if such a trail would be suitable and if there is a way to cut it.
But what the past needs if we don't learn from that?
The past serves for us to forget them.
If I can tell you something...
Luther Rabinowitz put his pyramid together.
"I'll think of her report," he said and decided.
On the next day, as she lived to work, she was overlooking by a motorcycle driver who, as described by passengers, was walking on a way in a "brutal wrath".
There are accidents.
Leotho-Military Member states that no State rule is planned; the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Official representatives of the army in Lesotho have planned a state troop to the struggle of the government and said they were inclined towards police fans whose weapons were put on the arms of political fans.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled out of the country and shared that the country's army circled its office and placed government buildings in the capital city of Maseru.
The first one brought his family into the border of South Africa after reporting the attack threats.
Military speaker Major Ntlele Ntoi said that it wasn't a state rule that the army reacted to the threat by the "political fans", whose weapon was promoted by the police.
"What happened this morning that the stage of the Defence Forces of Lesotho was acting after he had received several secret service reports that acting in the police some elements that really wanted to weaken some of the political, partial, young fans who had soon faced an expensive damage," he said against Voice of America.
The South African government speaker Clayson Monyela said that the military race had made the impression of a circle.
"Even though nobody has argued to have been able to have the government by violence, all the reports are agreed that the activities of the defence forces of Lesotho have been shown up to now signs for a state rule," he said.
The speakers of the military of Lesotho shared on Sunday that the soldiers returned to their castles and the situation in the capital city was quiet.
The Vice-Premier Mothetjoya Metsing overcome the government during Thabane inconsistence.
Thaban shared that he believed that he was a goal for his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
In Lesotho, since June, there have been great explanations after the Thaban Parliament's meetings due to the discussions in its unity government.
He said his actions wouldn't have been determined by the government, otherwise, with condemnation.
Production in the euro area on a 13-monat table
The increase in the production in the euro area was the lowest point in the last 13 months, so that a specific study was observed.
The final market in purchase management index of the producing shop (PMI) was 50.7 in, after a rate of 51.8 in July.
An indication over 50 gives an expansion.
New contracts returned and factories experienced burdens in a period of increased spending between the EU and Russia through Ukraine.
The figures shall be held before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
The markets are expected by the bank to be a clear plan for the transition with a deterioration of the euro zone and for the threatening deflation at an inflation rate of only 0,3%.
There are speculations that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information in the past of this week whether it is taking into account a quantitative facilitation for the euro area, according to those employed by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.
"By though a small growth is better than no growth, the frequencies impacts of the growing economic and geopolitical insecurity for the manufacturers have become more significant to the manufacturers," said Rob Dobson, leading economic scientists at the market.
The Fabric SME for Germany, the largest Russian trade partner in the EU, went to the deepest level in 11 months with 51.4.
In the interim period, the second largest economic activity of the block, France, the SMEs at 46.9.
France remains a child of concern, as well as the Italian decrease from a solid expansion to the stagnation.
The fact that growth sareizes in the key industrial mechanism of Germany and Spain and the Netherlands are not calm," said Mr Dobson.
The decline of the industry is probably the fire of the analysts expecting other monetary or fixed encouraging.
A positive message was from the Republic of Ireland, where the SME increased at 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, Chief Insight expert at IHS Global Insight, said, "The best thing you can say for the sales manager in the euro area in August is that the sector continues to grow."
He added: "Producers in the euro zone are obviously very difficult, since the current geopolitical expenditure increased, especially in Russia and Ukraine - insecurity in the continued difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased insecurity have clearly affected the economy, especially and the confidence of consumers, and it is likely that some contracts are delayed or even delayed, in particular large contracts.
He said that it'll always be more likely that the ECB should finally introduce a type of QE, "but we believe that this will be limited."
The decade of hell of the survivors of Beslan: ten years have passed since the sighty placement of the school, as the children who have been disfellowshipped today.
Ten years ago, more than 1.000 Czechian Military people were taken as a sleeves in Beslan in Southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them, were killed in the three-day Martyrium that the world was shocked.
We have returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had died in the classroom.
Just a decade after the accurate placement of Beslan school, 334 people, including 186 children, warned the Helena survivors the night before a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
As a fanatic Islamic terrorismist kids and parents on 1 September 2004, the beginning of a new school year, took and killed, it seemed to be the worst of the wicked.
The tragödie joined West and East in Abscheu, and then wonderfully turned into acting and hope for the future in the worst dust.
10 years later, we were returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had died in the classroom.
We found surprised young people who have surprised the rebellion, although the memory of this terrorist hell will be persecuted forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that Ukraini is now home - and in the kids as they die - now finds a end.
The girl who was photographed at the attempt to return to the shooted school chain
She was photod by the Russian Starfotographs Dimitri Beliakow when she was only trying to turn back to the shooted school chain after a mine was explosed.
People confusioned, Aida searched for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were guarded for death, but they survived.
"A woman said to me that I was going to go to my life, but I couldn't," said Aida at that time.
My legs were blut overstromed.
I stood up and clotheed again to search for my mother.
A soldier took her in safe.
After a number of operations, she was fully healed, but he said yesterday, "For three months the pain returned.
I'm afraid I have to be operated again.
Some granat drivers are still in my knie.
Its goal is to be a dent doctor to help people how you have been helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't destroy me," she says struggling.
"This happened to me, and you can't change it.
One day in the year, I'm always going to the sport chair to remember the remaining ones there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it at other days.
It's too big.
My best friend and future class camera, Dzera Gapoeva, was killed there.
We played together when we were small and dreamed about going to school together.
"I don't want to marry until I end my study and start my career.
I think about a family later.
She says that the allocation will always be part of her, although the memory will be something weaker every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help that we have received from people in Britain and all over.
When I see the photo of me online, how I turn back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and contribute to that something doesn't happen again.
The boy who flew through the ball, in the sense of his mother is dead
It was his first school day (Russians went with seven years to school) and survived the three-day placement in the arms of his mother Tamara.
When he was seven years old, he said, "Mama told me, I have to give up if it gave an explosion, and keep her hands."
After an explosion, he thought she would die.
She said to him, "Let it."
Full fear that she could be dead, he flew and saw on the way a smile kid, took it in the hand and flew through a ball.
His father Wladimir, who closed his son outside the arm, said, "Danir told me that his mother was dead.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was shocked out outside and with injuries in the hospital, with the acceptance that her son had been killed.
After her reunion she said, "I sweared for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He was in there and smiling me.
Damir was later fled to London (from the instant news of the World) to receive the title of a Barnardo's child's Champion from the former Prime Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop with the remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say it's gonna be blunt in my memory.
I'm still sure I'm going to get out of my games.
But now I can play computer games with shocks and this is no problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to get back to the sports hall, but I don't think about myself.
I remember those children with whom I played in the court and who haven't done it outside.
We never say they were killed or died.
We're saying they've stayed in the sport chair.
I remember very well at my journey to London, especially at the game loads where I could see everything I wanted, and the driving in a higher open car.
But now he feared the place like Ukraine, where wars cause the type of disaster he and his friends.
This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I'm so sorry about all those suffering under the greuels," said Damir, who worked as volunteers in a closter.
I want to help you so much.
I want to go to the police a day and hope that she takes me the next year at the training academy.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the horrible style after the shocking, there was no children who could call and walk, and this style was a lot of months.
She remembers her travel to London with Damir.
People in London swore when I told our story.
I understand how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings, and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and its foundation for the prices and the possibility of traveling to London in early 2004.
I wish I could call Chery and just tell her that 10 years ago, but I still remember her and her husband in London, and how the Damy and I helped me.
I remember how Damir would like to eat and call her all local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with Kelners in a restaurant. Shooting with his water pitoles on them and they shooted and played with him.
And this was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so volunteerly shared with our pain and supported us.
She said, "I always think this world has not been better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war continues, and every day people die, and I believe that many children were killed and killed.
They're just like our children.
I think that for many of the war it is a part of the news they hear when they are slow or with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the whole horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and it's so triste.
Damir has become big and is a very sweet and quiet boy, he's not really aggressive or angry.
For example, he does not seek to rush, he has not exceededed from the past greuels.
I know that he doesn't like to remember it, but he has six close friends from the class and they're going to the sport chain and end up there.
When he was smaller, he was understood - I remember how he sometimes stood on the sofa, the face moved from us for a long time.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I remember, too, how he continued to get all his weapons and other military games. Damir is now 17, more than me, a good look, intelligent and healthy.
I can't believe I've been so sure for a few hours that he's dead and I'm never going to see him again.
When I repeated me after the explosion and came on the leg, I saw me, and I saw the hell about me, with the whole body parts of the body.
I was absolutely sure my little boy couldn't survive in this hell.
"I remembered him, "Damir, run, go," but I was also so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard it, and he's gone.
And that's how life goes, other than the many others, for us.
George Ilyin, 17
The boy whose horrible image after the placement was the symbol of Beslan's greuel
Trost: The Beslan surviving Georgi Lyin with his mother Fatima after the 2004 placement, right a picture of Georgi today
His blue overwhelming face was marked by fear when he crossed his life, while the Tschechian terrorists shocked his class councils.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbari of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had left him for his first school day before she was born to bring her older son Wladimir to university.
"I left the Court for about two minutes before the terrorists shoot him, and my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone," she recalls.
Not all the time, there was a whole family of relatives from us, but they were all killed.
Only my georgy made it possible to survive.
Before this date, the harder is thinking and talking about it.
There's no only day we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time, I mean, last night, some scenes of these days follow me always.
No one will forget that, I promise you.
Interestingly: The image of Georgi (left) was one of the most shockingest of the attack and was shocked as Statue (right).
I remember that Georgi wanted to go to school this day so much, and he said he wanted to make his teachers.
I just knew he was alive when I saw him on the television.
And now there are even these statues of the wedding Georgia in San Marino.
Georgi does not like the image, and it's hidden with us in the booking area.
I understand this, but I also think that people in all the world are feeling thanks to this image of our pain.
Georgi says today, "It's important that something could never happen again.
"I doubt that we have ever learned the truth.
People always investigate such tragedies and never learn the truth.
And now they investigate the absorption of this boeing in Ukraine.
Should we ever know what has caused him?
This world will be a little horrible.
"I can't understand how it is possible, because if you ask the people, no one wants a war, so how does that happen?
10 years of pain are nothing.
We need twenty years to forget it little.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years, I had a few dinner rooms because of the placement, but then it was better.
Then, in 2004, I returned to school and had fear every day.
I thought of my friends and class room friends who were killed.
That's why I'm always going to the sport chair when the 1th September goes closer.
I want to steal my old boyfriend tribut.
It's hard for me to go to the sport chair, but I have to do it.
I don't feel as a victim, this story is now a part of my past.
I'm not gonna forget it, but I'm not intimidating.
My life goes on.
I closed the school this year and visited a medical high school in Wladikawcaz.
I'll be a heart surgery.
My first choice was a training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health did not stop it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
George Fanijew, 20
The boy who survived, although he was captured to feet a murderer terrorist.
A miracle: Georgi Fanijew was captured to feet a murderer terrorist, but he tried to survive.
During the displacement, he was captured in the sport chain and was close to the bomb that was confirmed on the foot of a murderer terrorist.
It's really a wonder that he wasn't killed.
"We feel like it was yesterday," said Georgi, who wanted to go to FSB as secret officer, but this was because of his healthy damage.
It's still with me. It's nothing I left behind me.
I'm now older and people say that children can easily go with bad experiences - I have to say that it's not true.
"2006 I worked with psychologists and then feeled something better, but I can't forget it.
And I would like to forget.
2005 - in the year later - was the first and only time I went back to the sport chain.
I lost the consciousness.
I will never go back there and ask me not to show you where I have seen in this famous image.
Residents: Georgi Fanijew today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after posting on the laptop
My pain is unfair and I'm bringing him with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never asked me after school.
I'm fine.
I should be careful with my last skin, but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I couldn't study the FSB's Secret Service Academy in Sankt Petersburg, how I wanted.
I sent my documents, even the medicals, and they answered that it was not possible.
My second suffering was the animals, so I went to the animal institution.
I've been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "of cats to kitchen".
He said, "I knew I would never tell my children about my experience.
In this regard, children should not know anything and, of course, they should not experience it.
His mother, Marina, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse when the Year Day is nearer.
I'll go to the holidays.
I know that Georgia's not going to go.
It must be much more stronger for him because he was there and I don't.
I was waiting at home and I couldn't help him.
I am so grateful to God that he was given to me, and here in Beslan all are signed.
It's staying in us.
Georgi is an adult now, but this horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept this if something is unfaithful.
He's a boy, he likes sport, but he can't participate in because of his son.
He's been operated several times, he can run, but no sport.
I would say he was over 50% overwhelming the horror, but we never can overcome it completely and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed at the placement and it strengthens my pain only.
I lost a lot of people I've been well learning and moneyed.
My son is with me, and this is the biggest gift that God could make me, but my heart crys for the killers.
I know about families where new children were born, but also of widows that have never been married again.
It is difficult to accept that life continues, even if you don't want it.
I'll never forget how my heart is in me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what happens in the world - wars in other regions.
Why are these people fighting?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country, and I can't believe it almost.
We were a friendly country before, how can we fight now?
People and children suffer, I'm sure that many children were already killed in Ukraine and many are still killed.
If we can take all of these rebels and turn out - so far as far as possible.
Ajonna Tskajewa, 10
The baby, which has been carried out in safety by a special income command
Device: Aljona Tskajewa is safely placed by a Russian special input command (link).
She is now ten (right) and never remembers the grain.
The world took the breath in 2004 when the baby Aljona was brought into the arms of a Russian police officer from Beslan.
Terrorists left them to go, but in their gravity, their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar returned to the school sport hall.
Makhar, then three years old, took away, but Aljonas's mother and sister died in the murderer.
Her father Ruslan has married again and had a girl with his new wife Swetlana that he called her lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, a ten years old today, does not remember the placement and is grown to a intelligent and happy girl, says neighbor.
"They are now a great happy family and Aljona and Machar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastical father and wants to spend all the memorys that take up with the tenth anniversary day.
You will understand why.

4 Tips for better subwater photos and videos
If you want to make photos or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.
The most precious option is a water-decimal point-and-shot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or a Action Cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver edition, both for $300.
I've included these photos at a family party with several cameras that are all available to a price of under $350.
Independently from the equipment, there are some rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a water-deed camera, make sure that the battery and other cases are closed closely.
Place your camera also on the photos or videos you want to take.
Some cameras and Camcorders have scenes and accommodation modes with which the lighting time for the deep subwater conditions is optimized.
And before you split into, check at which depth your equipment is functionable.
Some cameras are allowed only for 5 feet, other to 50 or 60 feet.

Make several spectrums - because many do not be punished.
Point-and-shoot cameras have a LCD that you can compose pictures, normally not action cameras.
Even if you have a LCD, it's hard to see this under water, and the right image set is a lucky case.
So do many pieces.
If your camera has a series mode with a number of accommodations with easyly changed light settings, use it.
Keep near the surface.
The light will be dramatically worse, as you continue to remove from the surface.
So if you can stay close to the surface if you make ups in a pool, a sea or the sea.
This also allows you to take more colours into your photos; in deeply you go, which is less colours you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good counsel in the country, but it is under water more important because of the bad light relationships.
It is particularly important when you work with a action camera: these devices are often available through a fixed wheel line, which means that you need to get closer to your objects if they are to fill the entire image frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man from the species who changed things, even in such a giant organization as the NHS.
As an advisor Anasthesian, he was a career of his task to improve both the agony of illness and the treatment of the nurses.
Among his patients, so remembered his wife, was a MI6 employee who had to live with the overwhelming impact of torture.
Lawson knew that physicians are important to diagnose and diseases, while treated are overly occupated with something else: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one who started his suffering.
"I didn't feel," he wrote in May of this year.
I had difficulties to smell me.
While he struggled with the gripped symptoms, he noted that he made his wife Juliet unpatience.
"I would like everything soon than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business journey for a week, Lawson felt uncomfortable and without reasons.
There was something in the air.
He asked a colleague to conduct a root investigation of his breast.
First two weeks ago, he was going to ski in the French Alpen.
The result of the rail investigation was proposed.
He left Mesothelium, a unheilable cancer, which smells the breast skin, so that the skin that crossed the lungs.
Like most cancer diseases, the precise eliminator is mostly difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokes in the lungs cancer have been sick, not all the lungs cancer diseases were previously smokers.
But the metothelium is different.
In almost all cases, the dissolver is a asbest loading - contact with the fabric, which once was known as "Wonderstoff" in this case as dead.
For most of us, metothelium is a disease that can be ignored as easy.
Asbest is finally a product of the past.
The most dangerous asbest type has not been used in Britain since the 1960s than the industry has voluntaryly forced to use this.
In the area where he was still used, only people worked in certain sectors directly with the substance - clampers, construction workers, rooms and advertising workers, for example.
As an industrial risk from another time, he seems not to be more worried today.
But this self-friendy has been uncomfortable.
The UK seems to be the high point of a mesothelium epidemic today.
There are more deaths through Mesothelium here than in any other country of the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, so many people die to this disease as well as in transport accidents.
Annual numbers of losses of metothelium totals since 1980 and foreseeable mortal accidents in Britain
The reason why we are now experienced the mortal impact, although Asbest has been illegal for years (1999 forbidden to all the asbestotypes), is that a metotheliom is only developed after decades.
And the glove of the metothelium is not limited to former employees of the construction sector.
Asbest was, and is still often in the houses where we live, the offices we work, the schools we learn and the business we buy.
And therefore, metothelium does not know class pains, financial limits, professionals or age.
The privileged bases, from the elegant buyer houses in London to private schools, are no protection room.
The parliamental buildings are asylum.
In the hospitals where we need to be healthy, this mortal carcinogen has already been identified as the starting heritage.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a clever too.
In fact, it was hard to imagine where he might have been contacted with Asbest.
Then he found it out.
"It seems like if in the tunnels at the Guy's Hospital, where I completed my training for six years, there was a lot of asbest."
All - students, nurses, doctors and physicians - use the tunnel.
Do you ask how many of my older friends will suffer from the same disease?
This question was unfortunately able to answer at least partly.
"For the four doctors who were trained at the Guy's Hospital, and those in the past five years in Mesotheliom," he wrote in 2010 in a letter, "I am the last who still lives."
How many of us will still be ill?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed in the age of 48 years of age.
When he died on February 17, this year, he was 55.
This was an unexpected long-term survival time.
Fifty percent of all metothelians died within 8 months after diagnosis.
The disease is always dead.
So we can only repeat Lawson's question: "What many of us will still be ill?"
The leading expert of the British Mesothelium, Professor Julian Peto, argued that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestes diseases in Britain are expected to be experienced, there will be a total of 90,000 of the disease to sacrifice.
Most of these are not aware that they will die so.

A short view of the cases of the courts, at which the interested persons often applies because of harmful requirements, shows how much the throat of the metothelium has already been distributed.
In June this year, for example, Marks & Spencer had been able to exhibit Asbest.
She worked for nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations, one of the Flagshipers in the Oxford Street.
Mrs Allen was only 18 years old when she started their activities at M&S.
Now she has two children in the 20th.
"For this thing," she says, "I never heard of the Mesotheliom, I never knew really something about Asbeest.
I never thought it would be about me.
There are only few people who know much about Asbest.
The fact is that the term Asbeest is not a substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name leads to the word "Asprostitution", a description of the faser structure that makes the substance resistable and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the building.
Chrysotil, even known as a white asbest, is today the most common asbest found in buildings.
It was used for bathrooms, footbooth plates, raw risolations, boilers, even for breeding plates in cars.
It is less mortal than other asbest forms, however, the EU and the WHO are considered as a "great health risk" with a possible death result.
But more dangerous is the blue asbest (Amosit) and the blue asbest (Krokydolith).
The United Kingdom was one of the world's largest importer of braune asbest, and experts suggested that "the clear, but indirect indication is that this was a main basis for the unique high-rates of metothelium."
An employee of Marks & Spencer was employed in the Flagship Center in the Oxford Street, London, Asbest
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical metothelioom sacrifice, but the work of Julian Peto points out that their history is not uncommon.
He has presented a study of the interested persons in which "a significant part of the methothelioms was caused by work or home by asbest contacts in the environment."
A majority of these contacts is based on his statement on the "normal use and age" of our buildings.
It seems like nobody can get out of it to be safe.
A report of Goddard Consulting, which has investigated the palace of Westminster, shows how people could have been exempted in the heart of the government.
2009 Goddard reported that the service defects and guidances were seized behind the committees of the Parliament with Asbest, whose mortal facility could have been destroyed by something that was so harmless than "staird air movements".
Parliament members are often accusated to care for their own interests, but this seems to be the contrary.
While the Parliamentary Working Service's Directorate of West Mines has received a "supplicable health product", it was noted that 1 billion £ of work should be taken over a number of years in order to renew the Parliament, to modernize the electronic installations and to remove the asbest, and that, after general elections 2015, the deputy will be meeting in the nearby QE2 convergence centre as well as on the green banks in West Minster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the preaching of Asbeth was not complied with the provisions of each other."
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost life.
All you can do is wait.
A person who has never been able to determine the contact with Asbest is Graham Abbott, a general medicine.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old abbott summits that he had been expelled in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital, where the asbestos were positively decided," he said, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so difficult to remember all the places where you've been working, and to the data.
What he still remembered is the day of December 2009, in which he received such a kind of fever.
He was 45, and just late over a operation.
Soon I had shoot feed.
It's been soon.
I felt horrible.
I thought that the journey wasn't going home.
As a doctor, he knew that the pain of the breastfish, the skin skin skin slowly cut his lungs.
But as Janice Allen, he didn't have a reason to smile a metotheliom.
He didn't go to work a month.
The surprised doctors made rings in his breast and placed Pleurakatš to take flexibility from the lacs and test in the lab.
However, his complaints remained without diagnosis.
His health was slowly improved, and he returned to his workplace.
However, from time to time the symptoms returned, often after sporting confirmation and heavy breath.
2011, a patient has similar symptoms in his practice and later was diagnosed with metothelium.
But now, too, it does not revoke this with his own case.
Finally, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with Asbest.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011 Abbott was angry, and his home physician brought his CT scans and rail receptions to a group of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt sick for the first time, one with a camera equipped sond was entered into the hill between the Ripper and the Brustfield.
I'm an optimist.
I'm making it mostly easy to go," he says.
Really, I hadn't made so many concerns.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of Biopsia was in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told me that it was metothelium."
Graham Abbott: Metothelium diagnosis
Finally, Abbott had ends with Macmillan hospitals recommended to take a lawyer.
First of all, he means the size of epidemic.
"It was found that Asbest was very wide, especially in large public buildings where Rohre was often isolated with Asbest," he said.
Those who were exiled to the Asbest in these buildings are now sick.
And so, the Messothelium is now more young people who haven't worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous grain with asbestosolations in hospitals were under the earth, so patients were probably not more exposed to the substance.
But many employees who changed in football tunnels from a building to others (e.g. Andrew Lawson) or eat in underground cantine (e.g., Graham Abbott often done), were in contact with the gifting substances.
It shows that over a few decades after the war, hospitals could be saved for patients, but lively threatened for the treating doctors.
He will still be away today.
The students put their bunners on asbestmates.
And it's not only about hospitals.
Asbest was often used in offices, businesses, libraries and city halls because of his fascinating isolating and flaming properties.
The schools too.
In fact, many people have probably had the first asbest contact in the classroom.
Overall in the country, in thousands of chemistry hours, students have put their bunners on asbestmates.
On the website, the Asbest theme is now often discussed in schools.
And the world has so innocent objects in our houses as well as footsteps or shooting shoes normally.
"It's an industrial guiding in large parts of our real estate," observes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer, who was in his process against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that took a woman concerned was the abris of a garden shoes in the 1970s.
So check how you're cutting your garden shoes.
The effects of diagnosis, and the knowledge that illness is inherent.
"There's a time to process," Graham Abbott says.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized that I couldn't concentrate on what I did.
I was two weeks in the practice.
Then I knew I was going and had to take care of myself.
Well, I'm not gonna experience another Christmas party.
With the greatest difficulty, the prospective change from a doctor’s position to a patient was.
As many patients before him, he remembers how he was overwhelming from all the information he had to come right.
"It was very hard to get everything," he said.
"I asked my doctor how long have I been?"
And there's been more than 12 months.
I remember that I thought, "Yes, I won't experience another Christmas feast.
"It was then."
Metothelium is particularly home-toxic because it is our life conservation mechanism - the respiration itself - that the mortal cancer causes.
Most cases of metothelium are caused by asbest contact.
Asbest consists of smaller fasces.
If the asbest is destroyed and the fabrics are inhibited, they may be set in the breast skin around the lungs.
Asbestphosers irritate the brown shell and can eliminate cell mutations.
"The problem is with the inhaled nadelfourd asbestos fascinates", says Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax arzt, who changed to the Guy's Hospital 2001.
Just as the hospital, from the Andrew Lawson, that it has put him to the asbest, is now an ironically leading centre in the treatment of Mesotheliom.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others, probably also during their training in the hospital house of Asbest.
When the asbest nails reach the lungs skin, Treasure says, "If they pressed from the breathing end to the border where the skin is.
From nature it is from the beginning to invasive.
The common options in other cancer diseases do not work so well with metothelium.
For example, the effectiveness of an operation is heat.
Some thinks she's worth a trial.
Treasure cleans that.
"You can't throw the breast fat," he says.
They don't come with the skin.
This is because the cancer says "not very good about chemotherapy", the "distortion" shows, but not healing.
"Atimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But at the end they're all dead.
Happily, some patients live indeed long, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott still fights.
After he had contacted Mesotheliom, Abbott in contact with Andrew Lawson, who four years after his diagnosis became a one-man support and consultation office for participants.
"Hello, cancer central," he expressed joyfully at calling.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis for 4 years and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott six chemotherapy cycles were offered that would continue four months and would expect to extend its life only for a month.
"I was doubtless," he said.
I wanted to stop.
However, Lawson created it "to allow things to appear in a little more positive light".
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart-thorax specialist at Guy.
"We had a advantage that I should not be forgetted, I just called and made a term", says Graham.
A normal patient should be given a reference and should be expected at the approval of treatment.
money is decisive for metothelium diseases to make sure the best available therapy.
But if these treatments finally failed, many of them affected by another financial concern - about the future of the families who have left them.
And in this way they appeal to the courts in hope of punishment.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It is known since 1898 that Asbest is extremely dangerous for health", says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s is that a very low load was a health risk.
And here the ability of business began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally helped her case, but it wasn't what Morgan called a "complete punishment" because Lawson could not prove with absolute security that his metotheliom was to return to a asbest contact at Guy's.
However, after the investigation on his death, a speaker of Guy confirmed that "the asbestfaces have been removed in the 1990s.
This was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How can Asbest be removed
Indeed, it is for metothelium diseases that are trying to defeat a great problem to order the mortal asbest contact of a company or a workplace - normally decades after the accidents.
Many of their previous employees are sold or closed.
Insurance records can be lost.
Those who rise against the punishment know that the time is for them, but surely not with the clauses.
As a reaction, there were significant new legislation that makes it easier for the metothelium concerned to defeat, even if their previous employees have no longer been found.
The Law has been able to demonstrate a contact with one fund of 350 million £ that was supported by the Insurance Industry for all who were diagnosed after July 2012, but no one can pay.
In these cases, the applicants receive 80% of what a court could be told in a normal punishment process - about 120,000 £.
For about 300 successful applications to the programme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan thinks, as many metothelium interests, that 350 million £ were a "very good job" of the insurance sector.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he said, and said, it is a fourth thing about what the insurers had to pay if the time wouldn't come to it and the metothelium diseases find the companies and they could be normally punished.
Mike Penning, former work and pension minister, also admitted that the law "not perfect".
But both Penning and Morgan gave that, in view of seven death sacrifices, it was necessary for a rapid action every day.
"The people suffer so much and need help today," said Penning during the second hearing of the Metotheliom Session in December of the last year.
At this time, Graham Abbott was in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
Following its first discussions, Lang-Lazdunski recommended a operation that he expected a positive effect on Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a trifthrapy that can represent a survival rate of 5 years from up to 40 percent.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"This is of course with the most important," says Abbott.
This is always seen in patients.
There's something that lets you continue.
If you get up, you're going to be worse.
Graham Abbott was undertaken in March 2012.
Finally, in August he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind himself.
No signs of illness were shown in the following carecans.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer flanks on my breast.
I've just been 50.
It's not life threatening.
That's a life end.
Abbott again understood six chemotherapy cycles.
Now it is no longer visible to the tumor.
But the process is very physical and psychologically encouraging.
You have to think about practical things - about the money if I'm not anymore, for example, or my wife shows how the boilers' schedule works.
If you get bad messages, you'll be negative.
You have to look forward.
As Ellie's father, 16, and Tamsin, 14, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for your parents," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I received my first diagnosis, I told my girls that I would have a disease with which I would not be old.
They reacted very different.
Tamsin is very sweet and angry.
She told her friends about it, and soon we got a lot of calls.
Ellie was back.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients need.
But for metothelians, such conversations have not been deceived by hope, not by a spot of hope to survive.
The disease brings (such as finally for Stephen Jay Gould) a grimming security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelium is not vital.
Bodies unbalanced pharaones in asbest clothing
Asbestfases used for strengthening shops and for a greater slightness.
Plinius of the elders describes asbest.
It has been developed a weed that is not burnable.
I've seen the servers in the Kamaj Festivals.
The use of the modern commercial asbest begins in Italy where it is used to produce papers (e.g. money appearances) and substances.
Important asbestos will be opened in Canada and South Africa and soon later in America, Italy and Russia.
It is the ideal isolation substance for the machines and turbines of the industrial revolution.
The global asbest production increases more than 30,000 tonnes annually.
Statistics of Prudential identifie a previous death rate in those working with Asbest, and they do not receive life insurances.
Nellie Kershaw dies in Rochdale.
Dr. William Cooke says that asbest particules in the light are "in any conscious doubts are the main causes."
This is the first case of this type.
Kershaws workers, Turner Bros Asbestos, do not take charge.
It is not payed for a damage.
During the Second World War, intensive ships will be built, one of the most dead ships with Asbest contact.
Voluntary refusal of the industry to the import of blue asbest
A professional court confirms the first successful person's punishment in Britain because of contact with Asbeest.
The global asbest production increases over 4,213,000 tonnes annually.
The UK imports 139.000 tonnes.
A health and security executive in the United Kingdom is obligation to make a license for all companies working with Asbest.
The import and use of blue and blue asbest are legally prohibited in Britain.
Every use of asbest is prohibited in Britain.
The Metothelium seat is adopted in Britain.
A deterioration program of 350 million £ is announced.
Asbest is prohibited in more than 50 countries, however, white asbest is still used in many land countries as a precious building material.
World production is about 2 million tonnes annually.
China rejects Hongkong's right to government choice, demonstrants Black payment
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided, despite the increased call for democratic reforms, against the namement of candidates for elections in Hungary 2017 by the Hungarian election.
This action is likely the long-declared Protests in Hong Kong's business centre, while the aktivists leaded the planning and mobilization within less of hours after the relief.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows the Communist leaders to submit all non-committees.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us anger," said the legal experts Emily Lau, Chairman of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Peking promised.
You've lied the people of Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we have to do it with an authorisation regime.
In its defence of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Vice-Secretary-General of the Permanent Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the authorisation of public nominations would be "chaotic".
Since 1997, as the Britannia has returned the Chinese controls to Hong Kong, Peking has promised the people to choose the government presidency since 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision on Sunday as a democratic interruption, since it has a right to electoral right to the citizens of Hong Kong, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership holds the end by a closely controlled nomination committee.
After a new clause, only candidates should be permitted "with love for land and love to Hong Kong".
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and public most effective protests in Hong Kong have been held for some years.
Between the Democratic campaign in Hong Kong, the movement of Occupy Central with Love and Peace, whose organizations threatened to shoot the financial sector if Peking does not allow a real general election law.
Thursday, hundreds of Occupy-central attendants were gathered in the rain before the government headquarter in Hong Kong within less than hours.
In the demonstration, the organizations said that their movement had reached a new stage of civil inhumanity and planted Protestwells in the coming weeks.
However, they did not make any further information to avoid problems with the authorities.
In a online communication, the organizations reported that the movement "the establishment of the Central District has taken into consideration only as the last means, a action that should only take place when all dialog opportunities are exempted and no other choice exists.
I am sorry to say that today all the dialogs have been shocked and that the establishment of the central sector will be definitely happening.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been prepared for the announcement of Pekings for days, and it was held on Sunday before the government building, including police forces and barricads.
The unreasoned ones are strengthened by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control over their city.
The accession of people from the fixed country strengthens competition to products and services.
Furthermore, the fear is that the values of Hong Kong, such as democracy and speech freedom, start to be broken under the growing pressure of Pekings.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy Centre movement, as they threatened the business industry - the lead of the Hong Kongs.
"The Protests they speak could cause great economic damage, after how many of them have been involved and how long they are to duration," said the legal experts Regine Ip, who criticizes the movement for a long time.
We don't want to worry that Hong Kong's devices out of control.
This impression is bad for investments.
The stately controlled media of China reported also slowly about democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by western forces.
In this summer, the aktivists organized an informal reference to the election rights in which 780,000 people participated - more than one fifth of the electioners in Hong Kong.
In July, ten thousands took part in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.
The tradition of school finances in the United States is now transferred to universities where freshmen are offered with the private flight.
We are glad to respond to this question and to offer the first luxurious travel service of the United Kingdom for students today.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive event at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private flights, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also acknowledged that the service has a security party.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who, instead, have to cook their cars in a dangerous car loaded by the country.
With our new VIF options, we are pleased to ensure that students reach the university with a minimum shift and a maximum Luxus.
A company speaker said that there is no new booking that the service was just introduced, but he added that " students would book the services in the next weeks".
The company also reported that, despite the costs of study of 9.000 £ per year, it expected a market for this offer.
Students today differ in their expectations and adversities very much from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than everybody to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can precisely do this.
However, the National Students Union criticized the service as decreased.
Megan Dunn, NUS Vice-President for High School, said: "This offer seems to be completely separated from the life of the majority of students.
Many students that start this month with the study look at a crisis of life conservation costs, since the available financial aid in the form of crediters and Stipendians does not keep the stronger accounts for the simpleest life basis before they can think about thousands of pounds for such a simplicity as the arrival in the student home.
Feminists criticize racism and police behavior by Ferguson
The unarmed young man was killed in the beginning of this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants put their hands in the air and sing, "Hands up, don't shoot," while waiting before the beating.
After two weeks of protest in Ferguson, Mo, because of the fire of the unarmed young man Michael Brown, the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noted a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
After their experience, white feminist comments place gender before the race when it is about to speak to reproduction rights and income inequalities.
However, while the shocks in the Middle West increased and received all the country's attention, Perez saw that the responses of white women turned to 100% through the race.
In comparison with the responses of black women, short after the shoot of August 9, the personal tests came with titles such as "Dances to Ferguson from a white woman" and "Feminism is not only late for the interpretation of women".
But for Perez, this means a significant change.
"I don't believe that you find many people in feminism who are white and privileges so high-class," she said.
People felt that something was imprisoned to express on the events.
It is characteristic for the crisis in which we find and because the situation in Ferguson is so etennied that they must express it.
For English Profesor Coritha Mitchell from Ohio State University, Ferguson faced problems on light which black Americans were expressed every day, but not as "Frauen themes" in the cultural space.
"I can publish some fun on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from everywhere," said Mitchell.
If I post something about how colorful in their own country, the sweet swimming is sweet.
"Why can women be sure to speak publicly about a relationship but not about security in the public space?" she asked.
For black women such as Mitchell, race, gender and sexuality have studied in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between race and gender problems.
For them, black women did not have the Luxus to share the subjects cleaner; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women are now connecting the topics of race and gender in the feministical mainstream crystal, Angela Hattery, Professor for Women and Sexual Research at the George Mason University, said that they did the opposite.
"In 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were shocked and the foundation was almost always the shock of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in the history to justify the Lynchmorder.
For Hattery, the disappearing between white and black women came at the point where white fighters for women's right, like Susan B. Anthony, analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the fight for the right of election could only be successful for everybody: women or black.
"They decided to put up for women's choices, and the right to elect for black should come later," said Hattery.
If you remember such things, one with power will be aware of why white women do not believe.
We didn't make our job good.
We never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
After women received the election law in 1920, there was still a decade of years until white women were organized against the Lynchen Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group came nearly 40 years after the original request for helping black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flow of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - is a spiegel of time when white feminists played with the problems with black women from generations.
"Isn't it nice when the aktivists who have such traditional feministical platforms have the right to draw up a child's education as serious as they do with the right to control of receipt?" Mr Mitchell asked.
Feminists of the second generation who have built their careers on the struggle for reproduction rights and access to recommended resources now try to understand what this means.
The famous white feminist acter Gloria Steinem went two weeks after the shock of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a pointed article from Rebecca Carroll, the Guardian colonist, in which she requests more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have another but parallel reason for understanding a risk of the body - and views of the race that are significantly different in public surveys - the changes will be made", wrote Steinem.
Although stones for a higher intersectional feminism are mentioned in the race as sex topics, some of their comments on the race topic in America are noted.
Christina Sommers, researchers at the American Enterprise Institutes and authors of "Who Stole Feminism?" said to She The People that young men in the United States, in particular young fabric men, "we are farther than their sisters," but stone comments on Ferguson are in contrast to their previous criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for children.
But when the white house recently set a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help young blacks and Spanish men, there were awesome reactions of many feminists, including Gloria Stein.
The relationship of the police to the black Community is not the only problem of mainstream feminism.
After the United States Great Police has reached nearly 63.000 uncomplied minority in the south-west of the country in this year, the issue of immigration reform is also re-elected to the surface - this time as a theme.
Andrea Mercado, Co-Chairman of We Belong Together, a organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for re-observing the topic as a key topic they should only publish the storys of immigrant women.
"This speaks for himself," said Mercado.
If the large majority of labour visa is to men immigrants, women that they join, are in a position where they are attracted to sexual violence and exploding.
"These stories find a posthall in the women's organizations," she said.
"Sweine-haus" in Ipswich is to sell
The image of a house in sale was removed from real estatemakers as clear that it showed a big swimming swimming in the living room.

The SW-stadt Harvey has a new million seats after Lotto wins
A Harvey Lotto player is this month
The search for a new million in the south-west of Perth continues with a happy winner that obtains nearly 1,1 million dollars from lotto education on Saturday.
A newspaper kit in Harvey moved a second time in five years the Jackpot in the course of the first division, after $1 million in November 2009.
However, the happy winner must still be reported.
Steve Forward said that the winning is careful for the small city in the southwest of Perth.
The city speaks of nothing else, and all are quite surprised.
We thought that such a win could come.
Eight WA winners have won in the last month in the first division, a good end for a few happy weeks for the players in the State.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale was one of the five million players in August, after a couple of Belmont had reached only a few weeks before the mega win of 7.5 million dollars.

Leonidas asked in the Gladiatoriana
Not only the gladiators were sweetly located in the match at the first Rheinbacher Roman Day in the free-time park.
However, the educational power of the event was enough to lock over 1000 visitors last night, who found the rain viewers and the rainy shoes, and quite slowly left by the historical spectacle.
There was a good journey of shows, performances, games, exhibitions and information about the time of the Romans and their importance for the Rheinland.
The main attraction of the day was uncertainly the martial struggle of the Gladiator School "Amor Mortis", which used every rainpause to demonstrate their robust fighting art in which Arena prepared with weak sand.
Gladiators "Leonidas" owned themselves as a humor and special representative and sent his men to the Ring two-helmed battle in different gladiators.
First, the "provocators" were at the row with the right shield and short level, as well as shifts on the left skin and army on the right arm.
It followed the "essedari" with breeding, short-weight, and wheat-floor, as well as the eiser gladiatorhelm, grain and army protection.
It was particularly impressive that the "Retirial" was shocked with the "secutor", which was shocked against the "secutor" and shocked the bourbons to land after a short struggle.
Thus, the weights were metallically forced each other, the shields shrubed, and the flowers flew over the Arena, that anxiety and band could be made for the health of gladiators.
But on that, the imposing "Summa Rudis", the Muscle Scheedsman, had an observable eye.
"We wanted to live again on the Roman day and make the culture of the Roman times experienced", explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the event "Freundskreis Roman Channel", the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, a "Oppidum Romanum" from the free-time park was established in his green word, a Roman city, like Vice-Claus Wehage.
Finally, Romans have not only brought war and opening into our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
The rest of that was also to be surprised at the Roman Day, about "Aquadukt-Marmor" from the 11 meters high and 1400 meters long Roman Canal bridges, which were first at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus Society once put the water and energy supply towards it, and the business leader Petra Fricke knew: "We still benefit from the knowledge of that time."
This also confirms the Diplom Engineer Ralph Heiliger of the "Ingenieur TeamZwei" from Rheinbach, the provision instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman Villa in Blankenheim presented skis and models of the expansions in 1894, as well as stones of the original hypocost, the warmth and warming of the Roman Villa.
Also impressioning the footprints left by Wolf and Fuchs two thousand years ago in the footsteps of the tone before you burned it.
2011, the Agency for Landennails at the Rheinland Association was slaughtered the rest of a Roman villa in the North Coast Park in Rheinbach.
It has been found to be reconstituted in a economic building with a dark for graining cereals and meal.
The building probably heard to a Villa Rustica, a agricultural good, explained the architecture Dr. Jennifer Morcheiser.
A number of foundations from these expansions introduced them in a glassvirina, including a large terrace, several fingers of glass, and parts of a cereal hair chain.
The villa has certainly existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, until the Germans in the then Roman Rheinland, the Morcheisers.
The children also worked with the Roman wind mood game, similar to the today's swimming game, or they wrote as the Roman students first their name with metal shoes on guard tables.
At the stand of the Roman Darms Zülpich, the children were able to put Mosaics alone on the stand of the glass museum Rheinbach glass mosaics and to serve a severe swimming meal from stone to select the meal for a fladen brown or a museum.
With the original Roman travel cars covered by two cald blows, visitors passed through the freetime park and also arrived in the impressive position of the city Gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Romer Projects".
With a Roman Wednesday from 13 to 21 September, the Watchberg Community will also be reminded of the 2014 Roman Year of Rhine, which is to remember the death of Kaiser Augustus before 2000.
In combination with the home and shoes agreements, as well as the Watcher Wander Agreement, the Partnership Agreement and the Layer Game Crystal Oberbachem are offered, among other thematic changes, a talk, cochabends, and the leaderships for school classes and the Roman past of Watchbergs.
For example, a Roman legionant from his work on the swimming Watchberg is told to present plants as a living thinking model from the Roman time and offer a wide lesson in matters between a group of Watchberger "Germans" and the Romans attracted.
The Adendorfer's basic school works in the context of a project night at the Roman Topic.
With the Roman Wednesday, the many, but often not more on the first view of the Romans in Watchberg, should be recovered again.
In the Watchberger Council, a small presentation is reminded of the fund of the Berkumer Matronen sanctuary in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic struck West African economy
Ebola epidemics in West Africa is also a serious failure to the economy.
The markets are excited - and international enterprises are going to distance.
The exciting ebola epidemics the West African economy makes a serious struggle.
The reward is broken on the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are slow - the virus has made it difficult to make the region.
Some international enterprises have already been at distance.
"Ebola epidemie is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic crisis", judges the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberkah.
Liberia is the worst involved
"It's a total disaster, we lose a lot of money," Alhaji Bamogo says, who sells the second largest market in Liberia, the capital of Monrovia clothing.
On the market only comes who wants to buy food or something to desinfection against Ebola.
Liberia is the worst of the virus, only here the fever is cut off more than 600 people for sacrifice.
The health authorities later declared that disease was predicted in any angles of the country.
Also in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria have spread the virus.
Overall, more than 1500 people died, thousands of other settled.
Foreign enterprises depart from employees
In the whole of the resource-resource countries, enterprises are employed to operate.
Foreign enterprises such as the steel concerns, Arcelor Middle depends on their employees, several international aircrafts have no longer reached the regions concerned.
They also respond to the domestic handlers and farmers: only few purchase fleet leaves their homemates to obtain subscription.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under the Quarantines, broken among others the important coffee and coffee bombs for exports.
The farmers do not want to leave their home for the reward.
Food to be cut
"The people will always be less traveling," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Pariser experts for West Africa economy.
For example, the man who normally goes on the market and sell its fruits remains better at home.
The population therefore has the consequences of epidemics to feel directly and slowly: food will be shocked.
On the markets, the proposal is slowing to basic foods such as Riis.
Similarly, the strong region dependent on international firms threatens a image damage - with a lot of widespread consequences.
The largest risk is that international companies are based on the area over a long time, Philippe Hugon says from the French Think Tank Iris.
Decisive is how far and how long the virus will be extended.
In investors, the impression can be "what is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus to invest", warns Hugon.
The illness also sustains the polluted state budgets of the States
The disease also sustains the non-strainted State budgets of the States concerned.
The Rating Agency Moody is afraid that its budgets are strongly affected by the high expenditure for the health system and, in addition, by the worse economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the health systems of the countries concerned with $60 million ($45 million).
Evidently the effects are already in Nigeria, where only few Ebola cases were diagnosed.
However, the oil region in the southern Nigerdelta has not yet been involved.
However, there are already many people who are afraid of a packaging home.
Reservations in Hotels also go clearly back.

At first in 1964, 19 young men again found the "new" shooting agreement "Tannwald" Berngau from the Baptist on April 30th.
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the Agreement to be a Protection Meeting by a difficult starting time, in which it was predominantly concerned, to find a United Nations and to install the shoot industry.
The shooting agreement in the guest house "Leinger" was prepared in autumn 1965 with two men in the streetwet battle.
In the following years, the sport protections organized in the meantime seven mass were in all classes up to 1. Gauliga.
The agreements cleaned annually and the magic borders of 380 rums have been reached at the first time 1980 by Rudi Meier.
As the performance of active protection has increased, Member numbers have also developed positively.
After the "Leinger" agreement had no longer compliance with the claims of a modern shooting agreement, the then leadership of Johann Rinn has decided to create a future domain in the fields of the new "Landgasthof Ferteis".
After 2700 hours of work, Pfarer Strasser gave the church blessings on 8 May 1988 for the new shooting rooms.
One of the great highlights in the event was certainly the 44th gauge shooting, associated with the celebration of the new shooting fash in July 1991.

Merkel speaks power Password: Mood will "come clear"
Now the officers will be clearly recognized.
But it is not a free letter for all complex details.
Hard concerns from the CDU against the Pkw smooth have seen the CSUs look likely.
The federal journalist Angela Merkel has spoken of a powerful word to introduce a pkw mouth after continuing resistances from its DDC.
"To say it very clearly: she's in the Coalition Treaty, and she will come," said the party finance on Monday after meetings of the CDU spectrums in Berlin.
On a detailed model, Merkel did not first stand.
In the black-red government programme, "determined parameters" were called.
Federal Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made a proposal and is now worked.
However, the NRW-CDD holds its none to a mood equal to all roads.
Merkel stressed, too, that the Minister of Finance Wolfgang Schauble (CDU) was constructive in the discussions on a draft legislation.
In addition to the theme, he talked to Dobrindt about further opportunities to activate more private capital for investment in infrastructure, such as for the development of the breedband.
"It's nothing special." Schuble was left on Sunday a "sleeping" report, his house checks a own concept to generate autobahn investors with swimming income - after the 2017 election.
The CSU Chief Horst Seehofer warned to develop in the Cabinet Mautkocepte against the federal minister.
CDU-Bunded Armin Laschet confirmed his objections.
"The Coalition Treaty never decided to take all the circle and federal streets", said the North-West President of the CDU.

Residue against the plans also comes from the CD-Land-Württemberg and Rheinland-Pfalz.
In the background, fears that a murder affects the small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seahofer had requested a series of Cdu coalition targets because of the mourning criticism.
The left views the plans in view of the fight in the Union.
"The Murks Mout is dead," said the party Bernd Riexinger of the "New Osnabriger Journal" (Monday).
"If the Maut decrees the Minister."Dobrindt wants to introduce a obligation on all German streets to start 2016.
Inland autoowners, however, may not be worried additionally, according to the Coalition Treaty.
This is why they should receive a full compensation for the mood through the Kfz steel.
However, in accordance with the EU law, the model of foreign drivers should not take part in their nationality.
Genetic disorders often diagnosed wrongly
A Britishin says she thought that she would die as a result of a missing diagnosis for many years.
Karin Rodgers, almost all of her youth, lived in the faith that she was only a few years after she was diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from the Charcot-Marie Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and backmark.
Charity CMT UK reported that missing diagnoses are a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
About 23,000 people in Britain have probably suffered from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscles, an insecure gang and cracked dentists.
Patients also suffer feelings or pains. The disease is unclean and prosecutive, which means that symptoms will be worse with time.
As Rodgers was 13 years old, she believed she suffered from Friedreich attack (FA) - a disease with very bad survivors.
Rodgers thought she would sit on the roof hall before she was 18 and died before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children who are now 51 years old said, "If the child I knew I couldn't do the same thing as the other.
I kept out, and everything was longer with me.
I never could walk with the other kids of rollschuld or skateboard and was often in the school for my way and to walk.
Rodgers said that, in the age of 13 years of age, she took several operations to load her skin and strike her feet, when her doctor left the room and read that she was at FA.
"I felt guilty because I was pregnant, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, searched for the disease in the library, and wrote to the FA community," she said.
When I received the answer, I was shocked and worried in panic.
I thought I'd be 18 in the roll store and die with 25, and so slowly lost all my ability.
I made it all alone with me and planted my own revenge.
She said, when she was 17, she was clear that her ability had not taken so strong as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just standed up and angry me and said, "My love, I don't think you have that, otherwise you'd be in the Roll Stone."
I think you've got something less than life threatening.
After some genetic tests, the CMT was identified.
"If he explained what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has started a CMTwareness module to take attention to this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether works since the closement of the former trumpets as fire workers
Since about 10 years, the former trumpet in Munsingen is not shot.
Nevertheless, even each month, the murdering munition in the heart of the biosphere area is covered by Sweden Alb.
The granates are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be cut into place.
A horrible knall is located in the springs over the heart of the biosphere area.
In December 2004, the last shooting shooting shooting was held on the troop of Munsingen, which was closed by the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since this time, the 6500 hectares large area is the nuclear part of the Biosphere region Sweden Alb, which is opened on 13 ways for wallers and rail drivers.
Taxes of business loans in the Washington area increased with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
The public and local tax decisions for enterprises in the country were easier in the past year while the economic recovery was accelerated, so a new study published in the past week, and the companys in Washington had no exception.
Employees in the Area District, Maryland and Virginia shared $27.6 billion in public and local positions in the 2013 financial year, increased by 3.8 per cent against the income of 2012 by 26.6 billion.
In the past year, the State and local tax rate of enterprises rose up to $4.3 per cent of $671 billion, compared to 3.9 per cent in the year, and it was the third growing year, resulting from the several years of estimation 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased by 4.3 per cent than local taxes, so the study carried out by the Service Agency Ernst & Young with the Centre for State Taxing, a tax policy group.
More than half of the tax revenues of the district, 56%, from undertaking taxes, while 36% of the income from Maryland's enterprises.
Virginia has reached at 28 per cent the lower tax revenues from enterprises.
A major increase in tax revenues is based on the recovery of the real estate values of the companies, and researchers say that it has resulted in an increase in real estate tax increase in 3,7% in this year after the three following years with growth rates less than 1%.
While a large part of these gains from large countries such as California, New York and Texas, the end seems to be met to the Washington room.
Enterprises in the district, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid more than $10 billion for government and local real estate taxes in the past year, compared to $9.6 billion 2012 - an increase in a year's past 4.2%.
But the likely recovery of the real estate values in Maryland is not so effective in increased State and local tax revenues, as the real estate taxes are about only a fifth of the tax decisions of enterprises.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. are almost half of their State and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland, there is a large part of the real estate, especially in the area of D.C., or in the possession of government or non-profit organizations that do not pay real estate taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, director of the Headquarter of State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore able to leave, for example, much more on revenue taxes to provide the same services to the other States.
Recent recovery of tax revenues by undertakings cannot be calculated only in the recovery of the real estate market.
Companies also seem to be recovered, so the data.
In the region, enterprises reported about income taxes in state organizations of $2.3 billion compared to $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion in enterprises taxes, the highest amount of the region.
While the trend goes in the same direction, the local tax charge for companies does not increase equally at all three places.
The increase rate in the district was 4.3% of the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9%.
Only Virginia reported a average tax rate of 4.1 per cent.
Virginia has 6 per cent in all three offices the most lowest income taxes (in all three are fixed taxes).
The company tax rate in Maryland is at 8,25% and in the district relatively higher than 9.975%.
A comparable study of the U.S. H.A. at the beginning of this year showed that Virginia requires less state and local undertakings and in total a better tax climate than in Maryland.
The area has not been investigated in the study.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure by its southern neighbors.
North Carolina has adopted laws to reduce its tax rates in this year by 6,9% to 6%, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will be decreased to 5% in the coming year.
If the State continues to reach its revenue goals in the coming year, this law could reduce the company tax rate of the State until 2017 to 3 per cent.
It seems to be better in the area of Washington, and therefore they pay more state and local taxes, so the recent study.
Enterprise taxes paid as private income taxes by small businesses - a transitional structure which is organized by most small companies - in the district, Maryland and Virginia, in the past year up to 20% to $2.4 billion, a significant growth rate of total enterprises.
The researchers say that the trend and increase in enterprises in the whole country will probably be maintained in this year, with an increase in the overall multi-based tax revenues for the State and local governments in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period.
Nevertheless, the Washington area could be dealt with when the expenditure of the federal government affects the labour market in the region.
Partner City: German Beer for Guangzhou
Hopfen and Malz - also in China a popular combination.
German beer enjoys a wonderful call in China.
Frankfurts partner in China now wants to be a rabbit and also hopes to connect a flight direction between the two cities.
Deutsche Beer, used in Frankfurts partners, Guangzhou, is the urgent desire of the officers in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German brauery would go down in our city," said the Vice-Party Secretary of the Southern Metropolis, Li Yiwei, in this week when visiting a SPD delegation in his city.
The official of the Governing Communist Party of China has always been back in the course of the discussion on this concern of the Twenty Million-Metropolies.
Guangzhou, also called Canton in Germany, was one of the richest towns of China, was Li.
So people also have the power to purchase the German birds.
The Hessic SPD President Thorsten Scherfer-Gumbel, who joined the German political delegation, said to the host that he will turn to a possible partner for the project in Germany.
"For bird it doesn't need much: good water, grain and life satisfaction," he added at the lunch with the party in Guangzhou.
This lifely joy has already been slowly out of Mr. Li, he shocked the guest.
In addition, the official of Guangzhou was shocked with shoes - but with red wine, which was served to eat.
The Chinese Marke Tsingtao returns to German Brauart.
Tsingtao beer is used after the German cleaning order.
More Business Trade
A second desire of Chinese guests would be a airline connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vize-Parteichef Li.
The airhansa had offered the flight previously, but in 2012 he was shocked for economic reasons.
"It would be rewarded," the Communal Politics confirmed.
"The business trading between our two cities continues to grow."
The travelers should now take the journey through Changsha in the province of Hungan, complained Li.
The management of the province of Guangdong, whose capital is Guangzhou, is also expected to connect the airport.
The Vice-Governeur of the province, Chen Yunxian, put this desire in his conversation with the social democracy.
"This is a very good idea," she answered, "the Chinese Vice-Minister Li Jinjun, a temporary Kenner Germany, agreed with.
Employed partnership
The charming Vice-Chairman of Guangzhou hopes that he can visit Frankfurt in the next year to a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already on the main, but not yet in this function.
He just came to the office in this year after his department was transported from the office for corruptions.
The local party Wan Qinglian had to go.
The action against the officials of Guangzhou is part of a country-wide campaign against corruption in parts and administratives conducted by Head of State Xi Jinping with illness.
The new Spitzen Policy Li Yiwei had worked before his participatory officers for a American company, which is most commonly in the Communist Party of China.
Before his officer in Guangzhou, he worked as a spectacular officer in Fujian, where the autobuilding VW has built a great work.
Frankfurt has officially entered more than a twenty city partnership.
The connection to the 9000 km from Guangzhou belongs to those who are filled on both sides, about with a school exchange.
Last year the 25-year-old existence of the German-Chine connection was celebrated.
The Southern Chinese metropole in the Perlfluss is almost strong as the whole heavy.
In the next year, they would like to reach a brutal domestic product of 250 billion euros, reported Li.
The family of Joan Rivers "prints the daums"
Joan Rivers is unconscious since her involvement in a hospital in New York City three days ago, but her daughter was hopeless today that the 81-year-old comics had been taken from her disease.
"Thank you for your long-term love and support," Melissa Rivers said today in a communication.
We all press the daums.
Her mother was provided sources on Thursday after a emergency because of a heart-station situation in a clinic at the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, in the Mountain Sinai hospital.
The doctors keep them sit down and under precise observance until they are more satisfied with their condition, which is still described as "prinst".
The reactions came from many pages, even in the form of a super-line support of Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmental friendships and increased dishes
For cars and steel shops that come from today's trade are futurely more strict environmental standards.
Like cold refrigerators and wash machines, new steel machines are obtained from 1 September to a label where the buyer can see central data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, "Euro 6" strict oxide values are used in the damage class.
Furthermore, there are more money for the buildings: they receive a single minimum loan of 10.25 euros.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1,04 billion
AMAZON confirmed what information was reported on Monday morning: The online single producer and video producer, and a variety of other things - buys the videostreaming service Twitch for $1,04 billion (970 million).
The announcement is surprising, not because no one had expected a transfer of Twitch, but because it was sweet that YouTube would buy the company.
Three months ago it appeared as if the sale of Twitch to the Google video service was decided for a cool milliarder, and the cooperation appeared also.
Twitch, founded as Justin.tv three years ago, was started as a general striaming service - a Live version of YouTube.
Instead, it was fast towards a platform for players who wanted to publish their bravo pieces in games, a "YouTube for live games", so an insider.
The Twitch Switch.
And "let's play", a video generator in which the (the most older) plays a strike of secret science theaters are already very popular on YouTube.
It is also that YouTube is often called when you want to describe Twitch, so the message was that YouTube wants to buy Twitch was slowly included, a book game of an etablished technician that buys a potential competitor.
It's a race why the YouTube deal did not agree, as the company was ready to pay as much as Amazon.
What we know at the moment is this comment of the President of Twitch: "We have decided for Amazon, because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions, and they want to help us reach it soon."
Another secret is, honestly said, the incredible success of Twitch.
For Snobs like me that they explain that they are swearing sports as well, it is difficult to understand the attraction that seems to look at others at games instead of taking the control console into the hand.
It's something to look at a friend at 3 a.m. on the slaughter, while she's smelling by the resident Evil, and something else to see how he's shocked in Call of Duty 20 times in the head.
All these games could look at you now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are Ego games, so the view can be a good reception for head pain.
I urge that the fast drives in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age are completed all games in record time are maintained.
But as long as a game or humor virus is there is, its Twitch channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do you know skepticers like that?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet transport spots.
And what exactly does Amazon want to make this money?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch will be integrated as elegant in Amazon Instant Video, how YouTube Twitch could easily be shocked.
But Twitch has something that would like every company: thousands of young men who are converted as advertising.
As the Chairman of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch, "we both believe in the future of the Gaming," and the media does not show signs of a shock, not even - shock - as a view sport.
On the hippoburg at the Burggarten Festival, some were left on the Sunday.
The concept of the event was true.
Despite the powerful regens at the afternoon, 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival in Burggarten.
Sometimes the entry had to be cut.
"This was worse," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salt glass l light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem have formed the name Amula.
Because the open Air in the Salzweading Burggarten is to spend light on the day and night through several shows.
Well, and the fun comes from all the way.
That was already shown in early Sunday when the first visitors were watching open Air.
A festival for all generations had promised the organizations.
And that's they're done.
On the basis of the supply situations in the Burggartenvise, there were also guests from the nearest and further environment.
They followed the first Live adventures, stripped with the feet in the touch, sweet cooked drinks - short: dispatch clean and Genuss were advised.
And that wants to be through generations.
While the one on the skin on the extra white sand on the beach, others lay down at a fourth wine in the Vinothek, the snake died on the Heepburg, which was a larger point of access to the smaller guests.
But also when the child lack, the voluntary helpers had to make all the hands full in the true sense of the word to become the Andrang Lord and to smile fantastic creations into the small faces.
The sizes used the Kickertik or participated in a skateboard shop that directed the Good Foot Crew from salt world.
Until the big rain arrived.
Shortly before 17:30 p.m. he prayed on the visitors, especially the family searched for sweet and sweets.
But the attractiveness of the Festival did not disappear.
"It came more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who said by a "come on the entire line."
Therefore, the great party has not been repeated in the coming year.
Although the content and size of the event must still be worked, seed clearly made in a first balance on Sunday towards the population.
It was noted that between the time of the entry was to be cut.
Of course, the security company was registered with too few forces.
The results: Some who had already paid had no longer come to the ground.
The resonance has been very good.
In a first careful estimation, the Salzweek co-organist of some 1200 visitors who were in Burggart.
There were problems in the technology.
The Salzweeders Hip-Hop-Band Blocks'n'Rox decreased their reception.
The technicians were not able to create a half-way conscious sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the zells were not able to be brought to Salzweed.
"The next year they will be there", says the event.
The primary of the Amula-Open Air was more than possible by the visitors.
And that's the bad weather.
However, the events have started some mistakes that will still be lost during the first time, but they must be removed in the second place.
In the Facebook social network, the events have to be criticized.
"Sorry, but for 12 euros you've just been expected more", Melanie Meier expresses on the event page.
"I'm sorry, you've taken a little bit," He's a roomman in the same place.
Others are not very close to the initial problems.
I'm very good that some don't just swear, but also really try to put something on the legs.
Hut down!", Stephanie Jenß writes to Amula.
Now the eventors remain a year to delay these critical points.
New Radom in Berkum: Watchbergs Search marks schrumpft
That's not expected.
Moreover, the ready part of the building is expected to be used in the marking building.
The action is in the context of a greater measure: almost 50 years after the establishment of the world space observer TIRA is completely renewed by the so-called Radom.
The new radom will be a diameter of 47.5 meters a little smaller than the older.
But the size remains world reorder.
The last step to complete the new shell is the headtauch
The upper quarter of the old ball is disappeared and taken with a clan.
Then the last fourth of the new shell will be set.
If the weather plays, the action is to go through the bridges at the beginning of this week.
Participants at the Ice Bucket Challenges are reduced by Kiefer
Isabelle Roberts from Britain shouted so much as her heat water was shocked over her head that she hurted the skin structure of her face.
This Ice Bucket Challenge was painful further.
A woman was sent to the hospital after she was shocked at the Ice Bucket Challenge so much that she was cut off the kitchen.
Isabelle Roberts from Britain grew so much as her heat water was shocked over her head that she hurted her face structure.
"The water was so cold that I cry, and while I did, I remained awake," she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is protected over 20 years.
Isabelle Roberts some seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that didn't go, the kitchen was cast, and then I understood that something wasn't true.
My mother and my sister also saw that, and they were almost laughing in the hose, but I had to be in the hospital.
The 20-year-olds from Britain were sent to the hospital in order to return the kitchen after the participation of the viral trend on Tuesday.
The Clip was linked to an Internet sensation and a thousand times on Facebook and Twitter.
The Burgvereine will soon go back to a squad?
Lastly, there was always a swift between the two Wolf Ratshauses of Burg.
Now, consider the scopes of a possible cooperation.
As an example for the reconstruction of the Wolf Ratshauser Burg, Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolf Ratshauser Burg, introduced the project in French Guédelon.
There was no good climate between the Burgwan and the Burgfriend Wolfrat Houses for a year ago.
It seems to be different to the point of viewing the history of the Wolf Ratshauser Burg and a possible reconstruction.
Now, the two camps will be moved towards each other: there must be a very short discussion on a common action.
This confirms the arrangements of Torsten Sjöberg (Bugverein) and Herbert Piffl (Bugfriend) on request of our newspaper.
"I've called Mr. Piffl and proposed that we can join each other," reports Sjöberg.
It is the point of view that all the members of both Vereine can return to a strand in the future.
This is how rapidly visible successes are.
While the Burg friends of Richard Dimbath had a reconstruction of the Burg on the mountain wood in the eye, the "Resolution and Exploration" of the land is the first place for the Burgborne to Sjöberg.
Herbert Piffl, second Chairman of Burg's friends, has been very pleased in its own information on the call.
Since Dimbath's death, he's predicting the Burg's friends.
A new Chairman will be found in a membership in the middle of September.
At the time, the Agreement is referred to in the 74-year-old 40-year-old.
"After my friend Richard Dimbath's death, we have first let the coherence activities of respect", this "dennkphase" was needed to "reason the way it could continue."
According to Piffl, the new Chairman will then go to the meeting with the Burg Convention.
To this end, the Burg friends could also make a current stimulation image within their grouping.
A candidate for the Presidency is still not, says Piffl.
"Are I'm certain that someone will be found." He doesn't want to claim himself because he has his stay in Bad Tölz.
The new Chairman should be a Wolf Council House.
The teacher wants to work on the project "but it is very pleased to continue".
The different positions in matters of reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffls in the next time.
He honored Dimbath as "Missionary", who always believed in the reconstruction of the Burg.
Two similar, long-term projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an aircraft.
By a high participation of the people and by voluntary helpers from all the world, they were a tourist champagne.
Piffl: "I was skeptic at the beginning.
But in the course of time, I have been more convinced that it is sensitive to advance the project." It can be created a "all-set-mark" for the city of fleet.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be financing through EU supports, visitors and potential sponsors, believed Piffl.
"The idea of reconstruction, therefore I do not just want to turn on board." He hopes that the Burgborne may move something in this point.
Their aim to document the story first, "is important and good."
Then you could look forward.
Clevere ways to swim at Uni-Learning Books
Since the costs for the Uni-Learning Books for many students are more than 1.000$ per year, the Fast-British student Matt Schroeder was a clause sparidee.
He obtained a reliable system for books of students from higher seeds and offered a named punishment to delay the return sale.
"My mathematic book costs $180, but I received it for $10 for a seventh and a chick-fil-A-Keks," said Schroeder, 19, which visits the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last seed would have costed him $430, he said.
He gave $ 120 out.
The colleagues shared the average students $1,200 per year for teachers and research materials that it gives a variety of cost recovery options for students.
Online and creative reactions such as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution for the choice for students.
The rent of teacher books will be more popular, so students can use a book a sevenster long, often to a significantly favourable price than at buying.
Nebo Inc, who works with more than 250 university books, shared that the mix of textbooks had doubled since 2011.
Inquiries in the industry show that some four of the books were mixed in the college books last summer year, said Nebos Vice-President Tevor Meyer.
Instead of half of all teacher books are purchased according to the organization of the National Association of College Stors in Campus Books.
Here's the one for the best accounts.
Buy online
Some new books are online only a third of the price for which they are in the campus book load.
The nineth exit of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but it can be paid for $239.99 at the specialized book member Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buy used
If any other or normal use samples do not appear, the books used are a good option.
"Calculus" is used to have $93.49 for Chegg.com.
Matt Casaday, 25, a final student at Brigham Young University, says that he has issued on Amazon.com 42 cents for the use of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End of the Advertising Business".
The book was newly sold for 48 dollars.
Academikers such as Ingrid Bracey, director of the University of Massachusetts at the Amherst College Without Walls recommended students to ask if they are authorized for previous expenditure.
Sometimes the updates for seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases, older expenditure may often be obtained for a burden of costs for the latest expenditure.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, the half of eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for useful books.
Measures
Learning books is a valuable transmission if you are treating them sometimes well, thinking to return them and you don't want to keep the books after the course.
You can escape more than 80% of the costs of a newly sold book.
For example, a student could "Calculus" for the duration of a seedster for about $20.
Information about the provisions of the business in which you are offered, and also on the penalties that are affected by ggf. for the writing of notes, subsistence or use samples.
Required: If you don't return the book, the penalties may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-books
E-books also instead of traditional teacher books are an option.
Sometimes these books are measured in fact by providing an electronic license for a certain period of large members such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
With Chegg, "Calculus" can be paid for about $ 61 for 6 months.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers, since many classicians today can be downloaded freely, while scientific and technological education books can be very costly.
Look at any case.
Joe Gault, 29 who is first visiting the Pepperdin Law School, recommends the ISBN number for price determination in books, as you can be safe to find the right book.
And before a online order, you should check whether the book is actually predicted.
This lesson he learned on the hard tour.
He purchased a book that had four weeks of delivery time and finally paid the full price in the college book load.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" didn't become a caster
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone played less than 30 million dollars his $90 million budgets in the United States while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" just $12 million of its budgets of 70 million.
The "Sex Tape" assembled on Cameron Diaz played only 14.6 million dollars at the opening week, while children's films like "Drachen dogs 2" are easy to spend on receipts.
A article of the telegraphic film critic Robbie Collin states that in children's films, the lack of quality may be the reason at the films itself.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" for children's films and described "dragons made 2" as "functional" fantasy continued.
However, in films for some older target group, it seems to be whether the quality of the films is unlikely the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and metacritic evaluation for each summer film that was shown between the American Memorial Day and 20 July 2013 and at least 2000 Leinwand in the past year.
The results are based on the view of cinematizers and film critics and pointed out that this year's films are equal to those of the last year.
Some comments believe that the development in changed visions and the growing popularity of web-streaming services, such as Netflix, is to be reduced.
Regior John Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's shortly appearing Dschungel film, said to the website Hollywood Reporter: "I think that the times are changed."
We need to accept this and do not try to go through the past.
In contrast to the current weak results of Hollywood productions, Netflix has recently achieved changes with the cost of $1,2 billion, almost doubled as in the past year, in which the amount of $837 million.
In the past summer, the director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studys to concentrate too much on comics shocks and prophecies a "shirt" Hollywoods.
In the light of the current abstention, some comments argued that his dark prophecy could contain a real kern.
On the basis of the potential avengers expected in summer 2015, including Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline of the cash results as simple "cyclic" and said to Hollywood reporter: "The next summer will be the biggest summer at the kinokase, and no one will be worried about the business."
When a few years ago, the 2-third class has been slaughtered to punish the ligation, this has been a step in the right direction.
Now, the German Tischtennis union has taken an additional 3th federal link into the programme.
The results: Whoever is not washed is cut off.
Thus, the top team Torpedo has avoided the decline in the Oberliga Republic, but only five-classful plays in the next season.
Virtuality remains Torpedos Dames, despite their great diarmarche in the regional link.
The boys and girls of Torpedo started in the Niedersachsensenga link, as well as the SC changing boys.
The SG Lenglers and Torpedo Reserves are in the new association link, in the country's Liga there are no divine clubs.
The TTV Geismar plays in the Liga, the Torpedo range in the country's Liga.
What the composition looks like a better district class, now the new district sovereign liga is South.
Here TSV sees, VfB loddingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Inbeck, Hammerstedt, Bovender SV, Large hot, the FC Weser and the TTC.
As a regional representative of Dransfeld and the SC channel, the TTC II, the Red Weiss, the SV II Bovender and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III. The branch liga of the lady starts at least in the Solar Structure.
Counterers, TTC and TTV Geismar II are here with the party.
In the district liga, Torpedo III and Satellite Houses/Wolf Mars houses start.
With your nine mansions
The SC switch sends his girls to the small district liga.
The SCW Jungle also is not completely starting to Torpedo II.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Pass and the SV Bovender goes to the season.
In the first season of the newly established regional association, the two gods start with the nine masters.
In the Western Staff, the Red Weiss II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Millennium Houses and SG Lenglern II.
In the Eastern Staff, play satan houses/willing houses, Nikolusberg and landholfish houses.
The Ladies-Crisliga consists of satan houses/wolmarshauses II, Balshauses, Heavens, Seulingen II, Tuspo Wende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the circle of Osterode, where there are no ladies teams anymore on the circle.
As a matter of the fact that no of the six second cycle classs reach the soil power, the innovative and surrounding circle will have to be thinking once.

"We're not going back without having forced Sharif to return," said Khan.

Hotel village after second season seage on place 3 of the table.
With 2:0 over Gross, a worst week on Sunday has taken a daily end.
"The winning is very free", said Trainer Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached a interim depth in Europe League on Thursday.
"The success was insecurely important," captains and torches confirmed Hofmann, who predicted with green-wess on place three.
Schrammel-Tspacetor has shown the correct response to the slaughtering against Helsinki with a successful experience in the country-pause with the second season.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said the Foreign Defended Thomas Schrammel, who tried to win with his magnificent leadership volley in the 14th minute.
"I thought I had the whole place of Thursday and smelled him under the latte," said the 26-year-old boys laughed.
On 13 November 2010, the smell had taken to a federal liga party, it was still for Ried.
The first mastership strike in the fast press will therefore remain in a special memory.
"For me it's something very special, I'm already out of the fast nearby," Schrammel said.
On the basis of the short-term skin blue of Mario Pavelic, the left shirt turned from the left to the right defence side and made it very good there.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise this position.
He won himself, he has already made some assists", loving Barisic.
The Character Schrammel also delivered the flank to 2:0 by Hofmann to a good hour that finally took the decision.
Because before, they could also write the guests.
"Thank you today we've been lucky", noted the smell, which played in the last few weeks, with the results of the outcome of performance and results: "The results have not been voted, but the player was always well compared to the last year."
Barisic even found that you were "in many games better than today" - against "the strongest manage played in this season."
The first triangle since 26 July has therefore proved that the Manager's customs were intacted by the reactions: " Today my mansion has shown that she has characterized."
It's not less joyful for him, "It's what we've finally played again to zero."
A lot of work during the country game is also the condition that with Brian Berendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsbergers are several defects, and Mrs. Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their initial departments, making the winning even more valuable.
"Do not forget this," magnificent Barisic, who lost in the past three days with sweet and Pavelic players, "the last time were very stabil."
Consequently, the country's pause should be used in order to "speak and put a bit in the physical area" explained Barisic, who has five U21 wavellers in its lines.
One who is well located in the pause is Captain Hofmann.
He's struggling for manship, and it's about pain.
Even in this serious phase, he has shown that he is a very important player for us", observed Barisic.
Hofmann gave the game speed before his movement in the 68. minutes not only the structure, but also reached the second door.
For the 33-year-olds who completed his 350th Federal Liga game, it was the first part of the game since 2 November 2013 (4:2 over the Admira).
Hofmann: "Don't believe that it's all right now" "We have certainly got a little luck, but at once the luck must also come back to us.
Now it was the highest time," said Hofmann.
He could freely concentrate further work: "Don't always see it black and white.
We haven't played as bad in the last few weeks as it was shown.
But we shouldn't believe that it's all right now.
The importance of his role for the team was not possible.
It's a very young man, which I can help very at the moment.
They hold on me in some phases," said Hofmann.
Growd-coach Michael Baur had little predicted himself and his manity.
He regretted the rapid opposite "of the Category Wondertor", as well as the regular gate of use in the 40th minute, which was renowned by Schiedsrichter's colleagues.
The only provision I can make is that we were not sufficiently concrete in some phases.
There's too little decisions.
Inside defender Maximilian Karner saw it similar: "It has just started badly, but then we found clean and even a gate.
The big and all would have been more in there.
Under this wheel, Ruth ruled
We showed a powerful stage at our summer series "My part of the routine luck" last Friday.
Many of these trees are still in the country crystal, the illustrated example is the "gree-friendy" overward of education burns.
A holprener walk leads to the age of about 600 years of egg.
It's over to coppers, bathstone sales and basalstone seas.
A piece below the stone brush from the Bauersberg, a kilometer north of the street to Weisbach, where it is.
Vital looks like the natural dental, it slows over the other trees of the area and remembers a width of over eight meters to a American mammal tree.
A small Buddha on a tree stomach shows that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
However, despite intensive investigations, there was only instructions on the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Sneider has also consulted the Bishopsheim Archive and asked older people from education burns to find out what concern it has with the beast.
The result of his investigations remained the right to useful declaration for the name.
Thus, by about 80 years ago, the skin rings should have made their animals of shooting burns out of the possibly shooted and freed from stones.

Putin requests the inclusion of "state conversations" with the Eastern bug
The Russian President Wladimir Putin requested Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian government sets the fight against the separators in the west of the country and immediately takes negotiations on "statute" of the abstraction region.
His speaker Dimitri Peskow later cleared that Putin did not agree that the area of the Eastern bond will be a part of Russia, but that his status should be re-definited against Ukraine in order to give the Russian language region the power to develop its rights and interests.
However, Putin's call to the Kiewer government on negotiations with the pro-Russian surgeon is passed to the strategies that appeared to be followed for separators in the introduction of regions and pressure to the Ukrainian government to allow the new proclamed novoossija facial independence for an alliance with Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the state television channel One of the Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to restore the regions held by separators in the eastern Donezk and Luhansk, which were adopted in March and April after the Moscow's half-based Crime was adopted on 18 March.
The cream and the separators have recently called the area adopted as "Novorossija" or "Neurussland", a term that reminds the prerevolutionary green period of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those in the course of the Ukrainian policy campaigns for elections on 26 October and while the governments' community groups were attracted to rapid peace discussions, Itar Tass reported.
"We need to take close discussions, not only on technical issues, but also to the political organization of society and the state of the Southern obligation to realize the interests of the living people there", he said.
Peskow said that Putin's reference to the State in the context should be seen with the greater autonomie that has been discussed for months by the Kiewer leadership to destroy fears in Russian language areas that their cultural and speaking rights are threatening.
Only the Ukrainian government can provide the necessary autonomy in Eastern regions, said Peskow.
It is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskow, "for it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but for an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the creml speaker on the correction of the "fell interpretation" of Putin's comments stressed the Russian leadership request in the course of the separatistic rebellion in the East, in contrast to the direct analysis of the Crime, where most of the two million ethnic inhabitants are.
Moscow had been larger difficulties to adapt the regions of Donezk and Luhansk in the Eastern bond, since most of 6.5 million people are not Russians and investigations from the time before the conflict produced a wide majority of the remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy, called by Russian diplomates on international forums, would give the regional governments in Ukraine fully to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, and thus provides the control of a area linked to the Russian State area.
The halfbinsel adopted five months ago in the black sea is the home port for most of the Russian marine, as well as a major trade chamber and the historical coast region.
The regions between the Rostow region in Russia and the Crime are also rich to mines, manufactures and geesees, which make significant components for the Russian military.
The Ukrainian President, Petro Poroshenko, proposed, on 7 June, that the Ukrainian legislation - as a new choice - should take into consideration the Constitutional Appendix, with which the regions are entitled to greater control on their financial and the state of languages.
But his imagination of autonomy seems to be deeply contrary to those of the chronic and the separatistic rebels whose weapons are predicted to be weaponed and rebuilding Moscow.
Putin's last call on Kiew to negotiate with the separater leaders at the eye level, following another front of the rebels in the past week after the Russian troops and panzers over the previous peaceful region along the Asian sea were entered into the Eastern bond.
The separatists supported by Russia, the first step of a campaign to overcome the strategic coast region to Crime, the control of Nunoasowsk's controls, according to the fears of Ukrainian security officials.
For this reason, massive civil and military preparations have been made to confirm Mariupol, a steel industry port with 500,000 people, which is between Nuoasowsk and the weak access to half-binsel Crime.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and asked urgently to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We are short before a point where there is no more back," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign panzers are now located on the Ukrainian territory.
The EU Meeting decided no concrete action, which the leadership requested further sanctions against Russia to enter into force in an unspecified sculpture of Ukraine crisis.
The Ukrainian soldiers had to return from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian Panzer Colones and 1.000 soldiers last week in the Donetsk region to support the disappointed separators, Oberst Andrich Lysenko, speaker of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council reports on Saturday in Kiew.
The first 63 Ukrainian soldiers, who were closed by the Russian accident in Ilowajsk, were discovered on Sunday for 10 Russian shields that were arrested in the Ukrainian area, shared Lysenko on Sunday.

Radler, Jogger and Wanderers last night, at the 8th rounds on the Great Fieldberg, supported the Agreement "Help for Krebs Hospital Childs".
The tour, for which one was a tour, was a easy training for others.
However, in one of them, they were all alone: it has made fun.
Thomas Studanski would have sleeped good night.
Because his first time in his life, the chief of the Supreme Brauhause, last night, went with the Rad on the camp.
For the good purpose.
The small muscle card can easily disappear, so that it has also made a valuable recognition on 8th rounds on the Great Fieldberg for the Agreement "Help for Cranks Hospital Childs" (Frankfurt).
That's a good thing.
"I know now that I can - well!"
Small powders walking in the Applaus course?
No, if I had stopped, it would have been out of...
As Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Supreme City parliament, four of the 718 participants last night arrived in mountains and founded closely, but rejoiced on the plateau.
However, it was easier to overcome the 11 miles long road between the Highmark and Fieldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The whole red green politicians from the Circuit Day - Red Dress, Red Bike - made something on the start of under-station ("Every amount of professionals, there is the goal!"), but then it appeared on the mountain as a half proi and went to 45 minutes without breathing.
He has also been on the road in a rush, such as Nina Kuhn, preacher of the city of Oberursel, who had been on the way together with Frank Greeneisen.
For the two triathletters, the "Feldberg Radels" was not unfortunately a sportive challenge: "This is about Charity, where we like to be there - an exit we had done without any of these days," says Kuhn.
In the way they had taken Paul Wenzel from the top rifberg.
The boy (12) was moved to the top in the morning to strike back to the height.
Frankfurter Florian Zeerz was shocked home at 9 a.m. at home, "made" the field twice to get home with fun.
It's fun, too, "Fritten Toni."
For the chief of the overseas Kurtkiosks Radtors are simply over the fieldberg.
He was able to have his 6.5-kilo-renard 40 minutes.
A crazy event.
For this purpose, I like it," said Andreas Balzke.
The trained maintainer says that he is a "ambitioned radar."
It must be, because he was with the "fixe Rad" in the way, that's also renal, but without shoot...
This also went to the top without the rad locker, not only the 20 wallers that sloped over the white wall and the flight station to the hill, but also a jogger who slowed a car shoot behind him.
Bergwacht-Arzt Professor Volker Lischke, who with his team, equipped with Allrad-Bully and Quad, for safety, said, "I know" from Frankfurt, who trained for a special bed trail, just that he keeps the slipper itself." Hence, he is certainly aware of his own sleeping dog.
The 718 participants - and so many as ever - were sent to groups in the morning.
The wallers first at 9.30 p.m.
The first rail drivers and drivers followed at 10:00 p.m.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers left.
Bent Hansen, Chairman of the Convention "Radeln on the Great Fieldberg", gave the starting commands and wished the participants to fly.
For the next year, he hopes that it can see the roads to the fieldberg to the security of the participants.
