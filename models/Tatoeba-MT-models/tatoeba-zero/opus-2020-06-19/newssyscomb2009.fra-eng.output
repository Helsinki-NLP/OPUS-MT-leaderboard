The triumph of the right populations in Austria has 29 per cent in total
According to the preliminary results, the previous parliamentary elections in Austria have made a sensible delay of the two parties forming the current large coalition, as well as a noteful strengthening of the popular parties.
The Austrian Popular Party (EBP), where the position of President Wilhelm Molterer was seriously threatened, suffered particularly important losses.
On the contrary, the Union's electoral leader for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the Carinthie Jörg Haider Governor, prepares a triomphal return on the national political scene.
According to the preliminary results, socialists (SPÖ) remain, with 29.8 per cent of the vote, the country's first political force, however, compared to the 2006 elections, lost 5,5 per cent of the vote.
The EVP, who with 25.6 per cent lost about nine per cent of the voice, ended even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major parts of the next war, especially for the popular party, which has delayed the previous elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
Before the beginning of July, when the AVP left the coalition, the popular party had a considerable progress on the SPUE.
However, the electioners were apparently punished to have left the government to shoot.
Since the first reactions faced with the results, speculations relating to the possible demission of the head of the party and the current trial Wilhelm Molterer were announced.
The observers believe that this may occur since Monday in the special advice of the party's direction.
Such evolution would facilitate priority towards the outcome of the election result that remains most likely, namely the renewing of the SPÖ and OPP's great coalition.
However, in view of the strengthening of the two legal popular parties - free (FPUE) would have reached 18 percent and 11 percent of the votes - the socialists expressed the fear of a recurrence of 1999, when the popular party agreed with the popularists (which was still unified, in 2005 the BZE was separated) on a common government, which even sustained sanctions from the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he was ready to cooperate with any party and predicted the return to Vienna, on the national political scene, apparently on this development.
The last party to have access to Parliament is the Greens, but those were slightly lost and restored, among the Austrian political parties, from the third in the fifth position.
Of course, no other party does not have the limit of four per cent and not access to Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India are risking to refrigerate
If it was not possible to resolve the issue of the Czechese investigators accused of a illegal coffee collection in India, it would follow, according to the Czech Minister for Foreign Affairs, Karel Schwarzenberg, a certain refrigeration of the Czech-India relations.
The Minister will declare it today in New York, after having met her homology in Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not resolved, then, yes, a certain refrigeration would happen", it was observed after the meeting, which was taken after a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after talking, that executive power could difficultly be involved in judicial matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švacha, who was discharged from the accused and punished of an amendment, the Central Government could negotiate with the local government, the Darjeling, the case under the court of it.
"It could be resolved," said the Minister.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kučera, sentenced for three years of prison, would be to call for a higher instance.
Since then, it could request the release under warranty and wait for the judge in freedom, it was explained.
Schwarzenberg confirms that his partner is expressed in the same sense as during conversations.
"He advises to call for a Supreme Court, as a result of what it could be grateful," said the Chief of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide the sentenced "a competent legal support", states the Indian Minister.
He also said that such assistance had already been brought from India.
"We want to keep the best relationships with India above, which have a tradition that continues over many years.
The Indians also recognize it," said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as he said to śTK, he stressed his partner that the Czech Republic granted much importance to the problem faced by the entomologys of Czech.
"We consider the incarceration and the accusement of these Tschechian investigators as a great misgrace," he states.
The Minister chooses whether he has obtained India's promise to take care of the case.
"I have already received a lot of promises," he only found.
A Czech will fight for the sea fund
It is approaching an electronic card that is represented by Australia and the adjacent marine areas.
He is not interested in the continent, but at a small point lost in the ocean blue.
"The island belongs to Australia, as well as the adjacent sea fund.
However, this area is large as the continent itself," said the Italian judiciary Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the thirty members team of the United Nations Division for Ocean Affairs and Sea Law.
His head, the director of the Division, the Tschechian judiciary Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and full time to another.
Labour and enthusiasm characterizes the dominant atmosphere.
The marine fund has a little known world, rich in natural resources.
It can be found by oil, minerals and other mineral resources, but also for unknown organizations, which can contain the key for the development of cancer medicine.
A larger fund than the stronger earth
The literature states began from today to be shocked with the new sub-sea territories.
According to a United Nations Convention, they are in effect of their rights, on which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is especially the area of what is called the continental shelf, which is often extended to hundreds of miles from the coast of the given country.
It may, according to the Convention, excluding all the resources of the continental shelf.
"To simplify, the part of the marine fund and its sub-sol, which is a long-term natural continent under the sea, is considered as a continent shelf.
It is extended beyond the borders of the Lithuania Sea, often more than two hundred miles of sea that represents the exclusive economic yun," says Mikulka.
The request that the country concerned to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by a large scientific and technical documentation based on costful prospections and metrometers.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"The one of our roles is to provide the commission of legal and technical assistance.
To date, the Committee has taken five requests, from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For the moment, they have known the success only the last three countries mentioned,” adds Mikulka.
The success of Australia, which was the first to have significantly expanded its sub-mare possessions, recently known a global retention.
The New Zealand also won from the territory - the extent of the marine fund, which the Commission has assigned the Commission last week, corresponds to 1.6 million miles (6 million km), which represents the expansion of the multiplied country by six.
The two countries have invested millions of dollars in prospections.
The benefit that they will shoot in the future of the operation of the marine fund will be, as they are planned, inevitable.
Progressively, other countries will, at their turn, submit their requests.
They can do it within a period of ten years after ratificating the "Convention of Montego Bay".
There, where the continental shelf ends, the zone of the ocean fund, declared by the Convention "Common Patrimonie of Humanity".
There, no State more played with an exclusive position.
The right to extraction in this area is assigned by an international institution established by the Convention.
"But not, however, we don't lie there, the marine fund is not a Klondike," he said by explaning the Director Mikulka, saying that "the areas are just clearly defined and their regimes are listed in a contract."
Czechs in the Pacific
A part of the marine fund today belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other States of the former Block of the Eastern countries in the framework of the Joint Interoceanmetal Organization.
This has been achieved in 1991, in accordance with the Convention, as well as investors of some other States, the status of that which is called "a pioneer investor".
It has the right to extract in the Clarion Clipperton Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaii Islands and the Kiribati Islands.
The investor's area is slightly exceeding the surface of the former Czechoslovakia.
The background is moved there, it is a kind of submarin replica of the Tatra.
"It is possible to extract it on a wide range with a total surface of 75,000 kilometers away.
The area represents a rich polymetal conceptions containing nickel, cobalt, and manasse," said Ind Pakshi Rajan, another judiciary.
Rober Sandev, a macedonian employee of the division, provides an example of such a creation.
She remembers a small earth poom, or, with a little imagination, the mythic shoem, which, according to the legend, animated the Golem.
The German Special Forces were on the place for the release of detainees
The Egyptian Government had requested Germany's assistance for the resolution of the fighting crisis - experts have come.
When the situation became serious, the special units were prepared, but they have never been in the action.
More details on the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt are revealed.
According to the indications of the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Defence, German Special Forces also participated in indirectly in the rescue operation.
Thus, both federal military experts and officials of GSG 9 of the Federal Police and the Federal Police Office of Criminal Police and Technic Hilfwerk logistic experts were on the place of release.
As the door of the Ministers was the Monday Monday night, the German forces have not finally been required, the opposition princes who freed their prisoners and fled when they recognized the imminence of freedom by force.
The Egyptian Government would accept the aid offered by Germany to integrate it in terms of support force.
"He has not arrived unfortunately until there," said a speaking door from the Federal Minister.
The aggressors took into the south of Egypt the group of tourists consisting of five Germans, five Italians, a Roman and their eighth Egyptian companions.
After their slaughter in the wilderness in the south of Egypt, the edges were transformed in the border zone between Egypt, Libya, the Sudan and the Chad.
The identity of opposition primers has remained vague until now, as well as the details of release or possible ransom payments.
Those who were saved have arrived in a healthy time except in Caire.
Steinmeier stated that the released floors were under the protection of the embassy in Germany.
It has not stated anything about the details of liberation.
In Berlin for the time, no information was given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to the magazine “Image”, the five vacancies and the special forces should have been collected on the border of a Airbus in the air army and arrived in Mord Germany.
The Chamber of Representatives of the United States rejects the Safety Plan
The first room of the United States Congress has failed to save the financial markets over $700 billion.
The Dow Jones was in the shock.
With 227 votes against 206, the Chamber of Representatives of the United States rejected the Government ' s relief plan for financial markets.
Despite all the calls from the President of the United States George W. Bush and the political men on the head of the two parties, the programme that had to play the chaos of financial markets did not get the majority.
In a dramatic manner, the parties tried desesperately to convince the opponents of the well-based plan of this $700 billion.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic representatives during the debate, had called the deputy to a favorable vote, even though the plan was unpopulary.
"It is difficult to have political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet occurred," he agreed.
During the further vote, Dow Jones was more than six per cent or 600 points.
The reason for this was the concern of investors that the state saving plan could lead.
He took a little time before the end of the vote, and then, after the announcement of failure, he shooting again.
Experts now design new serious turbulences on international financial markets.
In order to enable the programme to enter into force, the approval and the chamber of Members and Senates are required.
The organizations report a growing number of reservations
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In terms of reserves for the next months after a study, the business rate has significantly increased in comparison with the previous year - for winter season, even more than 30 percent.
Despite the weak conjunctureal perspectives, the soif of German travels remains insufficient according to this study.
Reserves for winter season, travel agencies registered a number of businesses over 31 per cent in comparison to the same period in the past year, as the German Travel Agency Federation (DRV) granted to Berlin Monday in Berlin.
According to the GfK Market Search Institute, more reserves are already in the automatic months.
Thus, the sales rate would have increased around 11 percent compared to 2007, trusted in the DRV.
The sources of these results are the GfK's figures, which annually analyze the reserves of 1200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the global market.
The travel reservations since the end of August 2008 would be recorded.
Because of the low rate of the dollar, travels to the United States would be particularly requested, the DRV would declare.
There would be an increase in reserves around one animal.
Besides that, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as our share, would be specially searched for German destinations.
The specially organized trips are requested, explaining the president of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of the increased energy prices and food products, the costs would be "wise calculable for the customer than for a individual travel".
Consumers can economize the money between others with the reductions of pre-reserves or all offers of all Inclusivia, explained Laepple.
The summer months have also been resigned so that a increase in sales numbers will be re-registered in comparison with the last year - even though, according to another study, the number of Germans who have entreprened a travel has declined in comparison with the previous year.
My first time at the Bière Festival
Ballermann or Open-Ski's shoes in continuous, bird in litre pitches and celebrates in tirolian costs to design.
A event at the bird party.
Suzanne Kronzucker and me, we haven't actually a big-chose in common.
It is blonde, television animator and takes a tyrolian costum cut on measure.
I've got smelled hair, I'm a student, and my robber is at the time.
But one thing is connected to us: at least three minutes at the bird party, and the photos already stand on us and fill their memory card - very flatting, and this is my first visit to the bird party.
That's how we get friends.
The good market cost seems to achieve its goal.
As a tourist of the bird feast and a normal resident in the north of the Whitewurst equator, my feeling of well-being in the traditional cost was limited.
But once on the theree place, it's half less worse.
Each or almost takes a tirolyan costume or sweet pants; no one has the breathed or affected air - it's completely normal.
Only the table of my tirolyan costum collects some strange shoes at the stand of the bananas-choco.
A bavaroise notes me that I would have been badly attached to my table: "to the left means free, in the empty environment, to the right cast, to the back. "
Discretely, I'm a triangle of my back to the left.
"It's better," she says and rigole.
Others do not so bad for these subtitles of flirt and hold simple fires, on which it is written "Too drunk to get clothes!" and we are exposing their back-train without being invited.
The young man at the exhibitionist attitude called Bob, arrives from England and comes for the first time at the bird party.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a long-term "ooo".
He's telling me all this after he's understood the shope that he had drinked before.
Directly next to this fire mouth that everyone believes that it is a powder.
Bob, therefore, is one of these "beauty pitchers" tristely famous.
Others do not have the opportunity to get away from alcohol so.
By eight hours of the night, swimming ribs run on the place of the party and need to take care of poor drinkers.
Infirmers, instead, are in myth - always by four, they spend their crowd of tears.
This works so for most visitors of the bird's party: we're going empty, we're back full.
Those who rest in the circle under the bowl are not visible.
"It's those who can't shoot anymore," one of the shocks in response to my question then disappears.
Police Unidentified Unidentified Unidentified Unidentified Unidentified
A 63-year-old peetone, deceived to the hospital after a vehicle was raised, was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Monday after midday, in the city, in Shenfield Road.
She was transported to the Queen's Hospital, Romford, but then deceived.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested because suspected of dangerous conduct.
He's been released since, under warning.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons.
Before Turkey thought to join the European Union, the European powers had not been able to enter into its back-land.
On the coast of Bosphore, there may not be 20 of Asia, one of the most ends of his imperial ambition.
Hydarpasha car was designed in a neo-renaissance style, by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
This is at least what we're telling the guides.
The monument is equipped at the bottom of the platforms, observation tours at each of its angles, such as some German provincial cherries.
The stones are salt.
All the buildings are destroyed.
But once in the shopping ticket, we have no doubt about the size of the company, which represents a passage to the western.
The car was inaugured in August 1908 by a German Association, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a delay in the game of imperialism, wanted to realize his medieval domination ambitions through this ferry path that arrived in Damascus, Bagdad, as well as the most known land under the name of Saudi Arabia.
But the German imperialistic ambitions have been evacuated during the first World War.
His ice paths were attacked by Lawrence d'Arabia and his Arab irregularities.
The relative isolation of its region to the outside, generated by the glass borders of the Flood War, is completed.
. The British and the forces of the Empire continued further to Egypt and pushed the Turkeys and their German partners outside Palestinian and Syria.
But there were also bad news for Hyderpasha's car.
In 1917, an explosive train of munitions destroyed its subtle tower.
Turk sources say that it is a sabotage.
Since then, she slowly slowly slowly, incorporated in the meanders of the history.
But today, the rail passage to Anatolia and all Eastern points, at least symbolically, is to emphasize the expansion of the diplomatic horizons of Turkey.
The Justice and Development Party, the ACP, has established a new foreign policy for the country.
The isolement of its region to the outside, generated by the glass borders of the Flood War
It is now the time of a new commitment policy.
The Turkish government has great relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian Hamas and Fatah fractions, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I shipped on a wagon-bed in the direction of the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit MP AKP Turc Suât Kiniklioglu, one of the experts in foreign policy.
On the next morning, after a 10-hour journey, shooted on brushing rails with the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived in the Turkish capital presented as a new city of a new serial status, turning back to his German past.
But the ACP, with its well-known Islamic roots, represents an example of change in the Turkish consensus.
He suspicious the West, and in particular Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the AKP General District, an extremely modern structure that was expressly built in stones and steel, in a development district, covered by trade centres to half buildings and by many pastures in which the medium managers in the slaughter and women meet for morning affairs.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a right center politician from any other part in Europe.
Costume, cravat, and he even has a Black Berry.
"the purpose of this foreign policy is to reintegre Turkey now in its immediate neighborhood.
The Flood War was an anonymous." He said.
Turkey was taken from its backland.
Now she must look at the East and the West at the same time.
That wasn't the case of one and another.
She should do both.
"But this is that at a moment, "I asked?" Turkey should not choose?".
"The Turkey" said "does not want to choose between the two."
He then highlighted a aspect that almost all those with which I had spoken, remarked me with heart: the Turkish ferry way is not only going to the Middle East, but also to the Caucase, and around the Black Sea, which is, therefore, a advantage for Europe and the United States as well as for Turkey itself.
With the integration of Turkey, the message seems to be drawn up a Europe that travels metaphorically on the rails to Asia and the Middle East.
Returning to the HYdarpasha car, after another night without sleep, I recalled these two Germans, Mr Ritter and Mr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could, mostly, be found in Turkey's hands.
While I was waiting at the terminal, the ferry to cross Bosphore, I remembered the period in which Turkey had been called "the disease of Europe".
At least there are no doubts on the continent that could prefer this fascinating country.
Remembers of Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown wrote: Musical Director at Gilldford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (deceased 11 September) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
When he joined his musical project for the city, he found the next year, the fantastic tears of young people, Proteus.
The breath had to include less than 21 years, but before Proteus could not sing his last song in 1979, many of us who had more than 20 years - refused to abandon the heart.
The name "Proteus" (when changed according to mythology) represented the will and ability of the tear to manage any kind of music was presented to him, that it was madrigal or medieval.
The musical versastigity produced by such a young lady was often impressioning, always exciting, and this thanks to the inspiration of a single man, and to its enthusiasm for music, which remains constant at the end of the years.
Remember how long the Death was to say "Let music speak for herself."
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants."
Everything's here, in music.
So sing!"
His bagate technique was absolutely clear, accurate, even if never dictatorical or appearing.
Someone of the musical standard, he was very higher.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If a driver had to be called chevalier, it's Vernon Handley.
I well known him during the decades 1962- 1982, when he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic.
In the past 40 years, I've revised more than one hundred of its concerts, and I can honestly say that no one of them never discovered me, and, a few times, they even inspired me.
The death of Handley was so rare that combination of size and modesty.
He hated drivers who, according to him, "not focused only on some."
He would miss many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett wrote:
Your necrology by William Woodruff (deceiving September 25, 1946) states that "he had repeated his studies in economic history in Oxford, and became a member of Houblon-Norma research, while he did a BSc, a MA and a PhD."
This is what is letter from Woodruff's author in Beyond Nab End, but that's not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor in economic history at Nottingham University, and ended at the same time, a PhD thesis on the British Plastic Industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; she was later published in 1958 under the British Rubber Industry.
In the 50s and 51s in the United States, he studied at Houblon Norman, and the summer 1952, at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for the Illinois.
The reason why Woodruff chose to dismiss this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophie
"I recommend the exposure of José Vicente Resino " the Flamenco and life " because its photos in black and white, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They attracted me to the fact of their simplicity and strength that they transmit and because they are always treating the protagonists with much respect.
A exposure that brings many feelings.
Resino knows capture of magic moments."
Second smooth for the super sales of Honda
In November, Honda will start the marketing of the second generation of the Jazz model.
If his predecessor had already a good habitability, this new monovolume has an overwhelming internal space.
This adds some refined mechanisms, which increase the conduct comfort and allows to economize more than that.
Evolution faced by a revolution.
That's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Honda Jazz presents a very similar line to the previous model, changes introduced in this monovolume are many.
Among them, there is an innovative design, a new platform, larger sizes and new engines.
However, before considering the new model, it must be stressed that this new Honda Jazz arrives six years after the market of the first generation.
First, it is noted that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter period than that of the other manufacturers.
Although Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon of sales on other markets.
This is Japan's case, where Honda Jazz was the most commercialized car in 2002 and also 2008.
Precisely in Japan, nearly a million Honda Jazz sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with a million cars sold in six years, represents the second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow him to increase its sales in Europe.
Thus, while the Japanese brand marketed 83.000 Honda Jazz in 2007, it thinks to sell 100,000 in 2009, which would represent a growth in sales of 17% on the European market.
In the Spanish market, Honduras has marketed 8.000 Jazz since 2002, which represents 6,7 per cent of the Dutch sales in Spain.
The responsibilities of the Spanish branch are expecting to sell 2,000 Jazz in one year.
This is precisely the outcome of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to break the sales down in Spain.
Indeed, the brand responsibilities expect to end the year with a sale of 22.000 cars, are 4.000 cars less than in 2007, or a decline of 16 per cent.
With this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain by a market share of 1.8 per cent, with a share of 1.6 per cent in the last year.
Japan’s brand also hopes to get a 2% market share in 2010.
Honda hopes to get this market share when the new model will be out.
This is Insight, a five-door hybrid and a compact width - 4,37 meters of length - on which the Nipon company hopes to market about 200,000 cars per year in the whole world.
On the basis of the markets and according to the estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50 per cent of the Insight sales will be in the United States, while the remaining half will be shared between the Old Container and Japan.
The Insight's commercial launch is provided during the first three months of the next year, after its presentation to the public in January to Valence.
With regard to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its sizes.
His length reaches 3.90 meters (5 centimeters above), its width of 1.69 metres (2 centimeters above) and the distance between its axes is 2,50 metres, which represents an increase of five centimeters.
Instead, the height is not 1.52 meters.
The sizes increased and the internal space also.
This gain was, on the one hand, required to introduce a new platform and, on the other hand, the introduction of a substance reservation in a central position, a solution also adopted for the Honda Jazz.
Similarly, the capacity of coffee - which has a double fund system - can contain up to 399 litres, 19 litres of capacity in more than the cover of the first generation.
It should be reported that these dimensions are those of the version with a engine 1.4L, as the capability of Honda Jazz 1.2L is 379 litres.
The other innovation - more than external elements such as back fires or panoramic table - is the improvement of access to back places.
The doors that give access to back seats have a 80 degrees open angle, partly with the back doors of the first Jazz that opened with a 67 degrees.
The engines are also new on this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model will be equipped with two essence propulsors of 1,2 and 1.4 litres.
The two engines have a i-VTEC technology that reduces the cost consumption and CO2 emission, which makes the motor most powerful and increases the engine regime.
The first 1,2 litre motor develops a power of 90 horses of 6.000 tr/min and 114 Nm of couple at 4.900 tr/min.
This propulsor, who was on the previous Jazz, presented 78 horses, presents a consumption of 5,3 litres to 100 km and 125 grams of CO2.
With regard to the previous propulsor, who was on the previous generation at 83 horses, now reached 100 horses.
This Honda Jazz 1.4L of 100 horses has a combinated consumption of 5,4 litres to 100 km and 128 CO2 grams.
The 'blue' flow which avoids collisions
To achieve the development of the technologies for the prevention of accidents, Nissan was inspired at this time, of nature, in particular snakes.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, imitating the flight of the shoes, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robbot Drive, or BR23C, and represents the first steps to collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of Nissan Motor Co's Advanced Technology Center Engineering Engineering in cooperation with the Centre for Scientific and Technology Research in Tokyo's prestigious University in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the Director-General of Public Relations for Technology and Investigation and Marke Management, the BR23C represents the scope of the Nissan Security Bulller.
This robot will allow the brand vehicles to prevent collisions.
During his flight, each abel created his own personal space of an oval shape that looks much like the Nissan security boxer.
But the most important thing is that the eyes consisting of the abel, which can be able to see in an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, which allows it to fly without interruption within his own personal space.
To re-create this visual function, engineers have made the point what it is called a laser localist (Laser Range Finder).
This detects the barriers that are on a distance of two meters and in a radio of 180 degrees, calculate the distance to this object and send a signal to the microprocessor immediately to avoid the obstacle.
"When he detects an obstacle, the small robot will switch the movements of a sleeve and immediately change direction by bifing its 90 degrees or more to avoid collision.
The largest difference between any other system that exists is that evasion handling is totally instinctive.
If that was the case, robot would not be able to react enoughly to avoid obstacles, "explicates Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of the Movement Labor and main engineer of this project.
In contrast to a bridge, robot can not be turned up to the top or down, or in diagonal; it can be moved only in two dimensions and on the basis of what its wheels allow him and not in infinite directions such as the sheep.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation function, but also the acceleration and detection, so that the small robot could avoid obstacles.
" Each second of this device shall only treat information and act in accordance with these data.
There is no need to keep the information or intuitive logicals of pre-related handworks, so it can work continuously with only a few twenty-five KB memory.
This can be surprised, but we don't speak of giga-octs of memory, nor of megaoctatoes."
This represents the first cause of development of new technological prevention technologies, a technology that will be introduced in series cars in a decade of years after Nissan.
The robot walks with lithium-polymer batteries, which are slighter and dry more than lithium batteries.
Another possible application of this technology to the future could be the adaptation of this device to a satellite navigation GPS system to lead the driver to its destination by avoiding road barriers.
They're afraid to be hypothesis.
It should be recognised that the Treasury of the United States, in addition to the fact that there are many liquids to make plans, is not disappointed by genes.
It is a crisis, and to avoid the Americans switching into hypotheques at solvent banks, they created a game to learn not to fail: " Bad Credit Hotel " .
It's to say 'The Hotel of bad credits'... or history.
The pleasant aspect of this accommodation and specially of the Hotel Master brings us to think several times if it is the right time to ask a loan.
And, especially, where to do it.
It is sure that this game gives useful but little detailed information.
It's a reserved game for adolescents.
What if the game is finished?
Because a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It's better than nothing, because it's impossible to buy a house
Morgan Stanley opens his capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry to its Misubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which would be $9 billion to take 21% of his capital, a new welcome with a strong decline of its Burse course.
A week after launching an provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9 per cent of the ordinary shares Morgan Stanley to $25,25, or a total of $3 billion.
The stored price is less than 19% than the account value of titles at 31 August.
The MUFG will invest six billion additional dollars in the purchase of convertible titles, assured by $31.25, as a result of a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the overall operation would be carried out on the basis of a average cost of $29, or 28 per cent above its current course.
The Morgan Stanley action, however, lost 6,79% to $23.07 to 17.00 GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to the bank holding status", explained John Mack, the Director-General of the United States Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which should allow him to diversify his activities but pass it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
Their Alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis imposes the largest names of Wall Street to adopt a more careful attitude than previously.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been amended in the last days: last Monday, Morgan had just announced that it would sell up to 20 per cent of its shares in Japan for about 8,5 billion dollars.
"A week ago, Toshihide Mizuno, Executive Director of MUFG, explained that the participation would be completely composed of regular actions.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to minimise the risks and cover us."
Based on the average price, MUFG will pay its titles Morgan Stanley 7% under their account value.
And the operation will be translated by a dilution of approximately 20% of the benefit by action.
The agreement provides that MUFG could convert its preferential titles in regular actions for more than 50 per cent over the conversion price, or about 47 dollars during a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the MUFG's capital will enable him to enter investment opportunities, strengthen its balance and increase its liquidity.
However, a parliamentary port of the group refused to clarify the strategic projects of the two new partners.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should show a solution ratio animal One of approximately 15%, one of the best sectors.
Morgan has explicitly aligned its balance since the end of August.
The last weeks were triggered for the group, who saw its course in Bourse, while the insurance costs against a debt standard were turned into.
This was a midday, but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "living" banks of Wall Street's large investment banks after Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers' firms and Merrill Lynch's purchase, announced 15 billion dollars, in part at the Berkshire Hathaway Group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa at Quito this Monday.
Reflect the Republic around the 21th century of socialism.
This is the common project of Venice Hugo Chávez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Equatorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, instead of his homologues and friends, is the third who put a new Constitution project on the vote.
As 64 per cent of the elections have voted to the referendum, according to official results of 80 per cent of the question.
According to these results, "no" reached 28%, 7% of the demands were null and 0.7% were white votes.
In order to adopt the draft Constitution, half of the demands should be obtained.
On Monday, two reviews carried out in the vote offices and a detachment of a non-governmental organization had announced a wide victory of the "ji", which was between 63 and 70 per cent.
Rafael Correa also returned in the Sunday night the victory of his Constitution.
The Constitution has triumphed strictly, assured the Equatorians in the Guayaquil governance seat, at 280 miles south-west of Quito.
As soon as you hear, Rafael Correa was welcomed by Chavez and Morales, but also his chilian homolog Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which has been in calm run in accordance with the United States Observation Mission (EEA), was a text in 444 points that consolid the "new socialism" defended by the President.
The Constitution project is dedicated to the power of the State on the economy by reserving the "development planning" of a living country primarily of the extraction of oil by foreign companies and the debts that its migrants are sent.
By Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants strengthened powers to the Head of State, which will be able to perform up to two consecutive mandates of four years and will have the possibility of dismissing the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that it would use this power and would be a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolids the principle of free health and education services that the President has started to establish in this country of 13.9 million people, where 50 per cent of the population lives under poverty.
Finally, it provides for the prohibition of the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of equatorial base as a start point for American drug operations.
19 days were released in Chad
A Egyptian command launched the struggle against the ravisers of the 11 tourists and their eight accompanies captured 10 days ago.
They're in Caire.
The 11 European tourists and their eight accompanying Egyptian captives for ten days in the wilderness were returned this Monday after mid-mid-day, except in Egyptian capital.
On the morning, they were released by an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently, the shoes arrived at 15:30 p.m. on the border of a special aircraft at the Al-Maza Military Base, accompanied by the International Airport of Caire.
They were immediately transferred, without ability to talk to the press, at the board of helicopters to the Hospital of Maadi, a residential bathroom of Caire, to take up the reviews.
They are in "good health", and "no ransom has been paid" to the ravisers," said the Egyptian Minister of Tourism, Zoheir Garanna, on the Tarmac.
On September 19, at a safari in 4x4 at the foot of the Oanat Mountain, at the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of oppositions was balled with a cache on the other side by 35 unknown switchers.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and a Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four cars, a border garden and the director of the A Egyptous Agency, the Safari organizer.
A Egyptian security director stated that 30 members of the special forces, switching on board two helicopters, had launched the shooting in the right night before the slaughter.
"A fire shooting shooting was produced, and half of the shooters were killed, the others flying," said the responsible who required the anonymate.
He stated that 150 Egyptian special forces of the “clair” unit had been sent to the Sudan, where they received support of German and Italian commands.
The chief of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini mentioned Belgrado, where it is found, the role played by secret agents and elements of Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result through professionalism and the effectiveness of our men of secret services, special forces," he said, without more details.
He also disbelieved the payment of a ransom.
The older, the Sudan army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on the board of which the rabbits were found, killing in six, including the tchadian chief, and stopped two.
The army had stated that they were linked to a rebellious group of Darfour, the United Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which immediately dismissed this movement.
Letters - Most silent of the culture
A discussion on the financing of cultures makes smuggles and takes this election campaign.
It's better.
But a sector of our cultural life remains still forgotten.
Who will stand up to condemn the poor ones that are granted to the small museums, the archives, the archaeological crowds, or the national historical places who believe hunger?
What politician will remember the federal government that he denied his monuments and his heritage buildings?
What in Quebec, as in Canada, do we have no real laws that effectively preserve our patrimonie?
Did you know that the French government devote three million and half euros to the restoration of the only château of China in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbors, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of patrimonie is part of the American culture and that this patrimonie must be protected by all citizens, elections and government departments in concertation.
In Quebec, the Québec History Society Federation, at least 400,000 voluntary people grouped in 211 stories, patrimonies, archives and genealogy, are concerned about the struggle of the history, to preserve with three of private archives and to preserve archaeological clothing.
These are often the chief dogs of our patrimonie, which protest with the energy of desire when promotors and decision-makers launch their bulldozers against our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When, a tribe for history and patrimonie?
Benelux Governments nationalize a part of the Fortis Bank
The states of Benelux are supported by the Belgian and Dutch bank, as the first European banking establishment in a depressing situation following the neighbouring effect of the crisis of the credit market in the United States, which is partly nationalized by the three countries, with a sum of EUR 11,2 billion, this financial institution and insurance also has interests in Hungary.
This weekend, Belgian Governments, Luxembourg and Holland agreed at the highest level in this case, calling also to the European Central Bank and to the competitor of the European Commission.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the framework of the international financial crisis has been more than one year for the Fortis Bank, and the decisions that will be taken in the case of the bank will be previously needed.
In accordance with the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will save nearly half (of 49%) of the capital of the bank in each country.
The bank will, without doubt, sell a part of its participations, among which, first of all, the activities of insurance, which it has purchased the last year of the Dutch Organist ABN Amro.
Last week, the Fortis actions started a vertiful fall. In the second half of the week, serious crisis signs have already been revealed in the bank.
The analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too large to let it go to the faillite.
Only seventh, the company's actions fell 12 per cent in order to reach the lower level of 14 years ago.
Since January, actions have been lost more than two thirds of their value.
In view of the current value of actions, the total value of the group capital is around 14 billion euros, which is not realistic, according to corporate leaders.
The company's leadership condemns the uncertainty of other Atlantics, in relation to the adoption of the US Safety Plan of $700 billion, to be due to the fall of Fortis actions.
Monday, the papers have already benefited from a low increase.
Thursday, Philip Derrckx was appointed to the head of the bank as a new Director-General.
The financial body was also looking for private purchasers, but has not yet received a proposal on the fund.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors should not be concerned, and they would not lose their money.
No panic has been seen in the circle of the bank's client and no agency was taken to battle.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent agencies and also saved leasing companies.
A powder in the powder
In America, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate on the basis of information on its medication purchases.
Information protection experts fear that the data market is uncontrolled.
" There are data protection programmes related to the use of information on the prescription of medicinal products, in all cases, to the agreement of the person concerned.
This type of program must be found among independent hands, except back to reliving his polar to a rear" - recalled Richard Dicket, the program creator used to manage medicine requirements at Washington Post.
Insurance companies depend on the insurance premium and the capital assured in case of damage, the health status of the customer present, and if they consider that the risk is too large, they do not even ensure it.
During the past, they sent candidates to a medical examination and not signed insurance contract with them only after having taken knowledge of the results.
Since ten years, Dick has found a very less careful procedure: from a number of identification, it easily provides with pharmacies, the data regarding the purchase of drugs of the person in the decades of eight months. As a result, the program determines its own disease, the disease of the person and its health status.
For example, if this person regularly purchases strong doses of cholesterol reductor, it refers to a extremely higher grain rate in the blood, which then places it in a higher risk category.
several versions of this program are in circulation. Some at the same time determine a risk coefficient, therefore, there is no greater thing to make the assurer from the paper. However, small problems can still appear.
Among the disadvantages of this program, the fact that a medicine can be used for various purposes, for example, some melanges may be used against migraine or against heat bottles, but may also be effective against depression.
This is considered by assurancers as a aggressive risk factor, while others, no.
Companies have developed in the research and analysis of data, and they have to request the patient's authorisation before collecting the necessary information to the pharmaceuticals.
Dorenavant, they are imposed by the authorities, even though they have not been sanctified for their lack of the past.
Since a few years, some companies are also treating laboratory analysis results, and they are connected to the data on the medicine consumption, so they are able to provide a further specific portrait of the health status of patients.
More companies have access to data, and the use control is parallelly more difficult.
There is a different law on the protection of medical data, but its action field is extended only to practitioners and assurers.
A law proposal on the expansion of the control circle of authorities on business specialized in the supply of data is now before the Congress.
Dick Richard recognises that it is not sufficient and that's why he has developed further before his program, which would condition the transmission of data to the excluding agreement of the person concerned.
It is another question of knowing whether the person concerned is really free to give its agreement or not, because, if it refuses, the insurances do not sign an insurance contract with it.
Thus and finally, the powders depend on the well-being of the rear.
The global menu of Marseille
The European Union and India are multiplied by two of their trade exchanges.
Since the European Union and India are very important commercial partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this nineth summary side of the other problems, mostly globally.
Today, it will also be a summit of France-India where nuclear energy cooperation will be particularly questioned.
The European Union recognized that India is a great democratic power that would have to give a more broader word right in international affairs, but Member States have not yet been able to agree on their support to New Delhi for its candidate as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
They have not been too attracted to this issue last night at this nineth summit organized in Marseille.
The French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current President of the Union, as well as the President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and the Chief of diplomacy, Javier Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, with which they have fallen in agreement that in five years they would multiply by two commercial exchanges, which means an increase of a hundred billion euros.
Bearing in mind that between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods has been from 25 billion to 55 billion, it does not seem to be too ambitious.
In this sense, they harmonized the 26 bilateral conventions with India on civil flights, and thus the air exchange will also be able to take their shore for the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union at the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to accelerate the negotiations.
The goal is to balance the situation with one side, India, the first trade partner of the EU, and the other, New Delhi, which is only the nineth place among the EU partners.
The Summit highlighted global affairs.
The Afghan and Pakistanian situation has been strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and the urgent need to hold a United Nations conference on this subject.
The completion of the Doha trade cycle was also requested, although both have a large part in the current failure.
EU confirmed that it remained faithful to the energy and climate programme, including that it would like to reduce at least 20 per cent of its rejections of toxic materials until 2020.
India was also agreed on this point, as well as with the fact that global market should be passed at the next year of the climate conference, and reduce the emission of gases from 50 per cent to 2050.
They would also like to prevent increased food goods prices, and supported the convocation of an international working meeting to consider the financial crisis.
The Indian Head of State is today in the French capital, where, at a bilateral meeting, it is prepared to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders for a value of twenty billion euros for the construction of Indian atomic reactors.
According to the press office information, the agreement would take up 15 years.
A Francfort, more than three hundred Italian editors
Forte presence of Italian editors at the International Book Hall of Francfort.
More than three hundred Italian editors present at the 60th edition of the Buchmese, the most important of you are international in the exchange of rights.
The International Book Hall of Frankfurt waits for this edition, more than 7 000 exhibits from 101 different countries that will take place at the 171.790 meters from the Hall with more than 403 miles of exhibition titles, and Turkey as an invitation to honor.
This will be the Secretariat Sub-Secretariat of the Ministry of Goods and Cultural Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government, during the Papillon's inauguration ceremony of Italy: in fact Italy will be in institutional manner, with a Italian Point 264 meters of exhibition.
It will be followed with the press press in the Structure Room at the publishing 5.0 of Buchmese: an opportunity to present the numbers, trends and perspectives on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to data, the importance of the books of foreign authors is progressively reduced in comparison with the total Italian production, and in particular with that for adults and children.
He found Steve Fossett's aircraft, the Milliardary's gone a year ago.
The sword of Steve Fosset's aircraft, the Milliardary was lost on September 3, 2007 while he flyed on the Nevada wilderness, was found.
The debris were found on a 3000 meter height plateau, in the Sierra Nevada of Mammonth Lakes area, at the border between California and Nevada.
In the aircraft, however, there is no human rest.
The Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, remarked the doubts that remained: "The aircraft has been localized, we sent a team, and now we have confirmed that this is good about what Steve Fosset traveled on the day where he was gone," said he at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore stated that no human remains have been found on the aircraft or outside.
In February, the 63-year-old age was considered deceased.
The United States Transport Security Office (Ntsb) informed that a few hours after the slaughter of the sword, a research team sent on the places, identified the device: it is well Bellanca 8kcab, who was gone on September 3, 2007, when Fosset decolled Jelington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal effects of Fosset have been found by a couple outside their room in Mamoth Lakes.
These are two documents named Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, species money and a poll.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The Milliardary won a place in the history through a long series of records.
At the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complement the world's tour on a aircraft ball: two weeks of solitary flights.
Three years later, he did the tour of the world in an aircraft and without scaling.
Among all of these records, also the one to steal at 15.445 meters high on the Andes, but with a copilote.
Glk, the public you don't expect.
A 4x4 out of the community of a original and well defined design, on the marked lines, on the broad surfaces and net angles.
Here, in synthesis, Glk, the last born of the "compact" road of the star house, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to make a new wind in this sector.
Just from its standard, unexpected and unconventional contents will be the communication that will comply with the starting of 4x4 Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showroom from 17 October next.
Thus the advertising battle that will comply with the start of the new car will take place in an unreceived communication mode, through a future 3D showing campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A maxi show project, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of the Milanal shopping, Corso Como, up to November 15.
The first stage of this new type of communication provides the presentation of the stereoscopic car, and thanks to special lunettes distributed to Corso As, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, there will be the impression that when we look at the image, the auto starts out of the display.
Then, through the use of the innovative technologie, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, to be composed of a unique image.
Of course, with this advertising, Mercedes tries to introduce something again in the stereotype area of the automobilist communication.
Will she resolve with this form to sustain the interest of the future buyers? We will see good.
This is the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they're risking the Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls whose Italia has now hungry? They are part of the "Ultra Italia" group that follows the Italian national team for years, which has never created great problems.
He never had been injured with the adverse tifosis.
The extraction of the group is right.
Promotors come from Triveneto.
De Verone, Maureau, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (peak in reality) of Campanion and Poland were added.
They had tricolor dragons on which their city of origin appeared: Saturday night, they were all taken to not be identified.
They were inspired from the English tyrosori.
In Bulgaria, they found a strike of real nazis, the Levski.
The Figc had available Italian tifosis, 144 tickets for the part: all nominatives and therefore easily controlable.
And the Viminal had all controlled them: among those who went to Sophi, no one had had the current Dapo, no one was banned to frequencise a stage.
Four Italian tifosis who had former stage crimes did not have the right to the ticket, and they could not be moved.
Now the Viminal expects to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police, and will then take steps: in that case, tifosis may be arrested or identified in disorders pursuing Dapo for at least five years.
A Dupo international that prohibits the Italian cities, but also Europeans.
Unfortunately, our hooligans will not put up the stage.
Happy.
But now it is the time of fear-emuning: it is to say that others are risked to add to hundreds and fifty firsts.
"We must exit this fire immediately, and don't legitimate those who do so," supports the Viminal.
So, "Give the eyes open, especially for the match of the National Monday Times Team"
In the Pools, there is actually a small noyau of Italian Ultra supporters.
Tomorrow, the Observatory gathers, the Casms, which can even take account of an Asian section, is to say secret services, which are just about stage problems.
"The twenty-double shoes, and the arm heated during Mameli's symptom? in Bulgaria, it isn't a crime."
This is the opinion (expressed in a really unpleasant way) of Domenico Mazzilli, director of the Viminal Observatory (he took the post of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously in Trieste where a shock of supporters of the Ultra Italian group was founded in 2002.
It is true, like Mazzilli, that in Bulgaria, Louer Mussolini is not a crime, but it is sure that the behaviour of these 150-200 tifosis has been honourable.
"I am not a sociologue - adds paragraph 1 of the Observatory - crimes must be assigned in the country where the fact is happening.
Until now, this group remained in the rules, we will now see what happened, and we will evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about siffles against Mameli's hymn: those there are no crimes, but if you allow me, they're not police..."
