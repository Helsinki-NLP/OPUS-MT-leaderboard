A Republicn strategy to combat Obama ' s choice
The Republicn leaders justified their policy by the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers this as a myth, claiming that election fraud is rare in the United States than the number of people killed by the rabbit.
In addition, the Republicn lawyers noted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will be mined in part by the American Democratic System.
In contrast to Canada, the United States are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
In this sense, a majority of American governments promulgated from 2009 from new laws that make it more difficult for the registration or vote process.
This phenomenon has taken its extent after the elections of November 2010, which had been added to 675 new representatives of the Republic in 26 States.
Consequently, 180 legislation projects restricting the exercise of the vote law in 41 States were introduced during the only year 2011.
The new election laws require the elections to present an identity card with photo and evidence of American citizenship.
Furthermore, these laws also reduce the periods of vote by preceding, invalid the right to register as a elector on the day of the election and to retire the citizens with a judiciary their right to vote.
Before the 2006 elections, no US States requested elections to submit a photo identification card.
Indiana was the first State to make such a requirement.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirms the constitutionality of the Indian law in 2008.
The Republicn authorities pressed to extend this practice to other States.
In the past two years, they had launched legislative projects in 34 States to force the elections to present a photo identification card.
It is important to note that, in contrast to Quebec, American citizens do not have universal identity cards such as the card of disease insurance.
In fact, 11 per cent of the American citizens, 21 million voters, do not have identity cards with photos issued by a government agency of their State.
In addition, five million new elections in 2012 do not have such identity.
However, it is often costing more than $100 to obtain the required identity card.
New restrictions affect young people, minorities and low income disproportionately.
Indeed, 25 per cent of Africans, 15 per cent of people win less than $35,000; 18 per cent of the people over 65 years and 20 per cent of the electors from 18 to 29 years do not have the required identity card with photo.
Good more.
Students, electorals consider more vote for democratic candidates, are not allowed in several States to use their identity card with photo issued by their institutions.
On the contrary, these States authorize the members of the fishing and chase clubs that vote more from the Republicn side to use to vote on the cards issued by these clubs.
Before 2004, no State needed evidence of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to submit such a requirement.
Since 2011, twelve States have adopted laws that require elections to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limited Spanish vote.
However, he learns that two Spanish electioners on three are favoring the Democratic Party.
Furthermore, the Republicn legislators discussed in 2011 the laws which abolished the registration of elections on the day of the election in eight States.
Moreover, they have limited the right of persons and groups to provide assistance to elections wishing to be included.
These restrictions are not unexpectedly.
For example, during the general election of 2004, election campaigns contributed to registering about 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have been 17 per cent of the registration rate of new elections in 2010 for 2006.
Furthermore, the Republicn legislators adopted laws in five other States to reduce the vote period in advance.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida 33 per cent of the elections voted in advance were Africans, while these were only 13 per cent of the electors of the State.
He went along with the Spanish.
These represented only 11% of the elections, but 24% of the people who voted in advance.
On the contrary, 76 per cent of the elections represented only 46 per cent of the elections voted in advance.
The Democratic legislators and their supporters were obviously opposed to the adoption of laws restricting the registration of elections.
several legislative projects have been blocked by the veto of democratic governments.
The United States Advocate General is undertaken to suspend the most controversial laws.
They could be limited in part.
For example, only 16 of 34 States have adopted laws for the presentation of an identity card with photo.
However, the new rules established will, indeed, make more difficult the exercise of the vote law in 2012.
Democratic critics declare the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted, and they see a clear goal to influence the results in 2012 in key States.
A report from the Brandan Centre of 2011 shows that States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required to the election colleague to bring the Presidency.
It is too early to confirm with sure that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have significant impacts on the result of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will be mined in part by the American Democratic System.
Detection of prostate cancer: pass the test or not?
Indeed, the APS test would sometimes present wrong results, with false negative results or positive false results, resulting in unnecessary medical interventions.
What to do more hesitate men already reiterate to pass tests of detection.
Do you pass the test or not?
We asked two specialists.
In the United States studies, there were much contamination among witness groups, therefore it is difficult to interpretate these data and have strong recommendations.
Another study, in the European, has concluded a difference in mortality between patients who have discovered and those who haven't had.
The study also showed, with a follow-up after 12 years, that between 30 and 40% more chances to have metals if not be detected.
I therefore recommend the test from 50 years of age, or from 40 years of age if you have a direct parent who already had a prostate cancer.
Afro-American men are also more risked.
The key is to take the right decision once you have detected cancer.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent.
The risk level of cancer should really be understood to the patient by offering the possible options, not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not lead to long-term life, and instead, in these cases, to be actively monitored by disease.
Today, many men who are detected cancer will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their life.
We will suggest that they will be monitored actively and if the disease progresses, they will provide treatment.
Furthermore, criteria for decisions which should or should not be treated are determined in specific way.
So I recommend even to pass the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with her doctor to determine whether we should pass it or not.
In collaboration with the International Urology Society, Movember created a tool that allows to evaluate the forecast and against the APS test.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no wonderful receipt to prevent cancer.
Despite research progress, the adoption of good live habits remains the best way to reduce the risks of suffering.
It is estimated that if everyone eat well and moved sufficiently, 30% of cancer could be prevented.
"If nobody was smoking, this rate would be at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, a speaking port of the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the contrary, there is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heritage.
Many remain totally unexplied.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the reduction of the number of smokers.
Cigarette is linked to 85% of the powder cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several others.
This night is very important to people's health.
"After today, there are 1,5 million smokers in Quebec", laughed André Beaulieu.
Encouraging donation: 10 years after smoking, the risk of death of cancer falls from half.
Fucks
Abbonpoint and obedience also promote the appearance of disease, according to the CCM.
They would increase the risks of cancer in the air, coron and rectum, oesophage, pancreas and uterius.
"The research shows that the practical practice of physical activity during the whole life protects coal cancer," it adds.
Food
The body also recommends to limit its consumption of red meat.
In too large quantity, it strikes the risks to be reached by a colorctal cancer.
The characters also, and they should be avoided.
Conservation of meat by smoking, seat or salary may lead to training carcinogenic substances.
"The latest can damage organ cells and lead to cancer development," it explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists studied the relationship between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not final for now.
Vitamin E studies are contradicting, according to SCC.
While one of them observed a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly established.
Moreover, Mr. Beaulieu stressed the importance of talking about his concerns and his family elderly with his doctor.
"It doesn't give it cancer."
Higgs' Boss decorated
The advertising of the likely discovery of the Higgs Boson's boss created a whole emotion, the last summer, and for cause.
It is actually believed that this boss is involved in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Univers, nothing else.
And then this is the last part of which the existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "that worse" explanation of the nature and behavior of the material - but that has not yet been observed imperially.
But for physicians, it is not yet completely sure that Higgs is good.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particule, and that it seems much like Higgs' boson predicted by the Standard Model.
Furthermore, new data discarded this week at a large physical conference in Kyoto seem to be confirmed, but there is still lack of data to be perfectly certain.
We also suggest that it's good about Higgs, since the chances of misleading seem to be mine, and let's see what's happening.
There is, in this world, a factly unconscious law wants that two things cannot be found at the same place at the same time.
It's not the way to break this rule - and try not too strong, you're going to hurt you.
And even if the physical of particules is a strange world, it also seems that she has such a law: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which claims that two particules cannot take the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quanticular state" - this "status" consisting of a great way in some of their characteristics.
From there, physicians classify the particules in two categories.
In a round, there are good citizens named fermions, who are wisely obedient to the principle of Pauli.
And in the other way, the bosons, a salt band of anarchists who have no respect for nothing - in any case, not for this principle, what means that they can be beautiful and well found at the same place, at the same time.
These bosons are then divided into two groups, according to the site (exactly extraordinary, otherwise) The Particle Adventure, the Berkeley Laboratorys: the bads that we do not address here, and the "power parts" by which the great forces of nature are promising, and which the higgs' boson would appear in some way.
These bosons, we need to emphasize him here, not all of them are so exotic animals that we could believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronic, it is thanks to an extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "light particule" that is the "messenger" of the electrical force.
When, in fact, a particule with a accelerator electric load or direction change, it "depends" on the electrical field in this specific place, a little like a chaleau launched in an etang.
From this "delimitation" is born a electrical place (of light, or infrastructure, or ultraviolet, etc.), and that where there is nothing else than a photon - and therefore, one of the "fighter ports".
More Stables Champ
He's going along with the Higgs' boson, so close to this difference that it's another field, the Higgs field, which must be "designed" so that this boss appears.
But, this Higgs field is much more stabil than the electricity field; to exciting it, it must be reached very high energy, a little like it was a gentle edge of which only a very large rock could lead to the surface.
That's why there is a large switch of particules like the CERN - the Great Hadron Collider is a 27 km circle ring! - to reach such energy.
The analysis with the electrical field is again useful to explain the relationship between Higgs and mass.
It is not actually all parts, nor all materials, which interact with the electrical field.
Some, like lovers, do it, but others are not - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold himself on a cold.
And in the same way, it is not all the particules that interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while the other (such as photon, hang) do not have it.
Now, what do you mean to bring all these research, Mrs. Plamondon?
For science, this makes a verification of the validity of the standard model (MS) and it allows physicians to check any difference between MS observations and predictions.
They are also several to desire strictly that we find it, because the less difference could open a door on a "new physical" and move some troops of the model.
This is necessary to say, there are still huge carences, proposing no explanation for gravity (aups!) or the dark material, which forms about 80% of the material of the universe (re-oups!).
But we have not found such distances in the CERN until now.
Impacts
The impacts of these research in the daily Mrs. and Madam All-Mode, they are harder to predict, but it would have been wrong to predict that there will be no one.
Hold on: At the beginning of the 1960s, the laser pioneers, in the Bell Labs, did not suspect the revolution that their work would be delaying.
They were interviewing scientific applications, but nothing else was left.
In fact, we already said the physician Willard Boyle, who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself put the first continued laser (the first were pulled), in 1962, the laser was seen instead as a "gadget of labo".
Imagine...
And then, applications can also come from all the instrumentation that runs to search.
For example, the same Willard Boyle set a small light captor in 1969 during its optical work.
This captor, although it wasn't all its original intention, now serves "ooil" to all the digital photo devices of the world, and he valued the Nobel of Physical 2009.
This does not certainly mean that LHC's activities will necessarily transform our lives, but that means that we never know...
Palliative care - The best way to die...
With its Commission to die in dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate must be renewed when a draft legislation is prepared.
But, in this essential area, many remain to do.
Dever tried to look closer to it.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still alone in his apartment in Monteregie.
The prostate cancer that was cut off had left him a replica of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I did seven years," he said, mid-ray-fig, longed in his bed at the house of palliative care Victor-Gadbois, Beloeil, where it happened.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for this," he said.
The disease makes its work: a huge weakness that prevents her to become alone at the toilets, and even to eat alone.
He agreed to allow himself to eat, resorted to eat.
The courageous one is even smiling, talking to the unknown people who are around him, bringing his medicines to him, offering a bathroom.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest desire is that we care for diarrey, it's humiliating," he trusts.
A few hours later, the team found a cure to this bad.
"In our life, a man is learning that it is cut off, " said Peter Brodeur, psychologist at the house Victor-Gadbois.
Putting the child’s stage, for some people, is an inacceptable humility.
" This depends on the ability of the person " to accept the punishment, it finds.
Because, on the opinion of several people who act in palliative care, there are great moments in the heart of this punishment.
Patients who are in the palliative care house Victor-Gadbois suffer all cancer.
They have a maximum life pronotic of three months.
At this stage, the " physicians and nurses team that do not care anymore said " curative " .
For Ms. A., 89 years of age, the worst fear is to die " conscious and enthusiasmed " .
But illness made me discover my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I have no more desires in life," she says, before accepting that we put him a mask to help her breathe.
In the next days, she waited for the last visit of her son from Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, with a voluntary group, the care of the body and the food aid are made.
It's palliative care, which is given when there's nothing else to do.
To make the death more comfortable.
In Québec, there is a palliative care bed for 11 700 people.
It's very little when we know that we all end by death a day.
Here, the life continues in the best conditions possible, explains the Christian Martel, one of the doctors of the house.
It is at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
On the death, it will be accepted to promulgate brandy or Pepsi, according to the request.
Diabetes will not be required to control their sugar rates.
And death is part of every day.
Last night, we used a bird at Mr. X, deceived during the night.
This morning, it's her son who will finish the bird at the feet of the fire.
"We are helping closers as patients ", says Nathalie Savard, the Head of Training.
In the Victor-Gadbois house, the days follow, but they are not like.
At the side of a 93-year-old man who saved his last family assembly in the court, well calmed in his ears, while a young man of 36-year-old died tragicly, around his parents, his wife and his two young children, after having all tried to survive.
" Since six months, there are always three to five beds that are employed by cancers under 45 years of age," the Christian Martel Dr.
53% of patients who are administered to the Victor-Gadbois house arrived from their home, 47% from the hospital.
Palilian care problem
77% of Canadians are not simplely accessing palliative care, i.e. the care designed to eliminate suffering when a sick is reached at the terminal phase of his life, which is at home, hospital or in the hospital.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois house and the Great Montreal Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in cancer care.
It is precisely the great care in whatbecois health care that fears several specialized doctors in palliative care the adoption of a law engaged in euthanasie and suicide.
Since October, a manifest, signed by the sommities of palliative care, including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, circle to witness their opposition to such an initiative.
According to the Christian Martel, the quantum health system is not enough to ensure that everyone has the right to quality palliative care before it is accepted to process euthanasie.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient passing 14 days at emergency, in great pain, without doing what is necessary to stress it.
I am afraid that patients are asked to die only because they do not receive adequate care.
And parallelly, several employees reach their patients until last day, despite the worst pronotics.
Helen Richard's hope of survival was already minimum when she left a testing chemotherapy.
When I announced to my grandmother I stopped the treatment, she answered me that she regreted I stop fighting, did she tell me.
However, she told me that I was finished!
None of all powerful cares
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who ask for death thanks to the nursing that they have not accessed their request after they were understood by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, the Director of Palliative Care to the Great Montreal Palliative Care Society, patients would be refracted in the treatment of pain in 8% of the cases.
At the end of the life, doctors have so often recurred to the palliative seedation, which return to sleeping the patient until the time of his death, or sporadicly, or permanently.
We can't do a similar to not listening to this part of suffering.
Furthermore, unsubjected sickness will have the possibility of having this palliative seed.
The diseases that are not understood always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But this does not necessarily mean "I want you to euthanize me ", which means "I want to be stressed " .
The implementation of this report was made possible by a newspaper board of Canada's Health Research Institutes.
Located real estate scanda in Quebec
The workshops, the BTP entrepreneurs, the collectioners of political and specialist funds of Italian mafia's mafia are reporting a day after they know of a forming "system", the building industry, officials, politicians, syndicalists and mafioso.
A " industry " expenditure expenditure, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's curious as the system has been employed since the big means have been taken", Ironic Jacques Duchesneau, deputed in Québec and the former police leader of Montreal.
It was by him that the scandale was exclaimed in 2011, by a fund investigation on infringements related to road work contracts in Quebec, where the first liberal minister, Jean Charest, was only allowed to return.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, hidden financing of parties and corruption of officials.
"After the beginning of the investigation in 2010, it stressed that the only Department of Transport would have paid a billion dollars on contracts," some replied their instincts to touch a quota!
The Charbonneau Commission "he has already dropped two bathrooms," he adds, expecting that it can "demonise the strategy behind individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, also accompanied with its Government's army of checkers, investigators and analysts.
More police officers from the Marteau Scout since 2009, who had led to the Montreal's "eggles Cartel" to put the sweet pedale on contract smuggles...
In recent weeks, she carried out a series of investigations and brought charges for fraud and corruption against municipal elections, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the chief of a bathroom city.
The next list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who came to depart from his master position in Laval, the third city of Quebec.
It is suspicious that you have put up public contracts repeatedly.
They are formally accused of technicians in Montreal and Italian original entrepreneurs, including Tony Accurso and Lino Z Area.
The latter felt that the Committee explained the mechanism of the "system" for the obtaining of public contracts.
He himself paid 3 per cent of the value of the contracts obtained in Montréal with a mafia-related intermediary that turned money to the Montreal Union, the party of Master Generald Tremblay.
Mr. Zrang has seen all winds in the 2000s, giving more than $88,000 Canadian dollars ($68,000) to provincial parties, especially for the Liberals at the time of power.
He also agreed to have organized an illicit collection of funds for the former Liberal Prime Minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Exemption contracts in which it spended on costs
In Montreal, the "corruption system" worked round.
Gilles Surprenant, former technician in public work, has been well-detailed before the Committee: in ten years, he received giftal construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tours, restaurants, hockey matches and $736,000, in exchange of cost contracts.
Other officials of the pool have agreed to be grained by 30% to 40% of the factures, by extra false.
Then a Master party organizer Martin Dumont accused Mr. Tremblay to have delibly closed the eye on a paralelel budget to feed his boxes with salt money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay was released early November, pushing Montreal into a major crisis.
Cantal Rouleau was one of the first elections of Montreal to shoot the alarm sun.
Master of the Rivière-des-Prairies Arriving in the east of the island has been firmed since 2010 against the sale of a municipal land purchased $5 million and returned... 1,6 million to promotors, in full real estate boom.
70% sales money in election campaigns
The survey that will finally be established, she says "shoot on a fil to understand the operation of the system, filtered by strokes, to stop gangrene and escape the faults."
The process, she says, is "awesome but positive".
We are being cleaning the plague but there would be a own investigation unit in Montreal and a vel, not seeing back doubtful practices.
As we do the house.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes on his side that "the officials stolen hundreds of millions of dollars," but especially worried about the role of "elected to know the strategy" when they did not throw in the shooter!
He estimated 70% of the money sold in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, and he said, "We said it was only a piece of reflection of the reality."
The Quebec Government proposes to limit $100 the donations to the parties, but it will not change the woman, according to him: "When the electoral expenditure will not be strictly limited, there will be money sold in policy."
He provides a complete review of the system of authorisation of public and financing contracts: "We can't go low; we can't go down, with courage, and will make it possible to rebuild the house on stronger bases, with more controls and laws."
If this story comes to the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who haven't seen in their own court...
"The PSG is not the Barcelone FC!"
This season, you took a new envergure with the PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by individual conscience, but also by the new PSG dimension.
Great players arrived.
Each day, I'm progressing on their side.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
In the daily, these elements have me able to make my level of game.
And, in match, it's easier.
Everything's going very fast in the foot.
But I don't fly.
From my beginning at the INF Preformation Center to my passage to Saint-Ethan, I've always expanded by Palliers.
So you will benefit from the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
The recruitments of this year are used to discuss high-level matches.
They also know that each training is crucial.
What does a player like me wants to face and provide the maximum.
Furthermore, Carlo Ancelotti gives me much about my positioning.
He's shooted by adjoints like Clude Macelele, who played at the same post as me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Of course.
Anzenlotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today it is not equal to Liga 1 and is part of the best European trainers.
He has a great experience and won a lot of titles with hupped clubs.
He cooking great players.
I think he'll take other titles to Paris.
In January, I had a comfortable discussion with him.
I was out of a series of wounds.
The confidence he agrees to me also explains my performance.
What look are you taking on the first part of the PSG season?
In Liga 1, Lyon took us the leadership place.
But we're still in a bus.
One of our major objectives is the Championship Link: we are qualified for the 8th end in the way.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We'll try to go so far.
Now, everything can happen.
But we will say to face very good European teams.
We want to first end our powder, before Porto, to receive at the 8th final return.
Can PSG become a large European club in short terms?
There's already the budget...
In order to become a large European club, Paris needs to report titles and to be inscribed in the period.
Today, that's not the case.
Financially, the PSG provides the means to achieve the project.
In Liga 1, do you not report the title, as the last season, wouldn't a big failure?
Of course, it would be a great deception.
This year, we really have a heart to push this champion title.
The last season, we didn't pass away.
In May there was a deception because we had the qualitys to end first.
We made a very big season.
We've finished 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we should be champion...
But another team, Montpellier, has performed an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think that's the good thing.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are in the battle for the title, I think we have weapons for it.
Do you think media are waiting too much from the PSG?
It's normal that we're waiting for many of us in view of what has been invested and players we have.
We are totally accepted.
Then, when we win 4-0 homes against Troyes and find things to reprove us, it's sure that it's a little frustrating.
We ask what people expect more.
We can never win 4-0 all weekends.
We're not Barcelone's FC!
We're trying to make a game project.
A team built with time.
We have proved in Liga of Championships that we could answer here.
Look at Manchester City that isn't coming from two seasons to qualify for the 8th end, they also made great expenditure!
As you were invested, we imagined you with 15 progress points to the trave!
It was to dismiss our opposites and the French Championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well in the last season, were "bood" by this new PSG.
This shows that Liga 1 is passioning.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile by saying that, despite all the difficulties, we ended by importing it.
The PSG seems to be entirely dependent on the operators of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
It's better that we say there's a "Zlatan dependance."
That means that Ibrahimovic is very effective and that it brings many goals.
He came for this and proves he's the star of the Liga 1.
He showed everywhere he was a great player, a world star.
In the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects those whom he has around him.
What he did is really exceptional.
This moves others to embrace their level of game.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders of the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How did you live the Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like a deception.
I had a heart to participate in this euro.
Unfortunately, my blessure prevented me playing time.
I saw things there, and I've been strengthened.
Today, I am able to achieve good matches in the selection.
That's what I hoped since my baptism with the Bleus.
We have learned about what happened in Ukraine and today we have to have an exemplary behavior.
What look do you take on the first months of Didier Deschanmps at the head of the Blues?
He has the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualified group for the Worldwide.
The selectioner is strict, near the players, and inspires the win.
Like it was Laurent White.
But I don't want to compare.
White had reached its goal by qualifying us for the euro.
I hope Didier Deschanmps will lead the Bleus to Brazil.
The good null (1-1) cut on 16 October, in Spain, is it a founder match?
This match gave us confidence.
Everyone fighted for everybody.
Before this shock in Spain, I never had lived like a match in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
The contrary to current monetary exchanges based on central banks, the identified transactions and the treatment costs between the stakeholders.
Furthermore, as often in these technologies, a political vision is pumpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, a bank monopolies, leads to financial crisis.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (Pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (not more convertible in dollars, euros...) and a safe exchange protocol in BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of pair files.
About 200 000 transactions have already been registered by 150,000 computers on the network.
A small thousand web sites accept bitcoins as gifts or as payment means.
The Bitcoin rate, after reaching a sum of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2,5 months later, before returning today around a decade of dollars (which are calculated on the Bitcoincharts.com site).
Nothing very impressive, compared to global exchanges in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the most successful success", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "conventional currencies".
Bitcoin distinguishes other types of virtual currency like "credits" used to progress in a video game that is winned by playing or buying it (and sometimes turning back).
The Facebook social network has also developed such a system.
But each time, a central authority controls and treats trade.
With Bitcoin, all the network noises are depositely from the account book, checkers, monetary emissions, and buyers and buyers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two email addresses in a way of e-mail.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, safely assuring the anonymat.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Through the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the changed bits exist well in the public account book distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers and whose winner, as an interim central banker, will be the privilege to add this additional line.
This is a file hachage phase, i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique digital press.
Computers "accepte" the new transaction and add a number before "hair" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that gives a special employee (more of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number has been found, the other nodes are clearly checking that it's the good.
The transaction is then undestructively linked to the line of all other transactions; any change would change the press.
If, for fraud, one user wanted to pay two times with the same very fast money (minutes ten minutes), one of the two transactions would be valided by the network - the other remaining orpheline because the two have different impressions.
The computer resolving the challenge gives 50 bits.
To avoid inflation, this reward is regularly divided by two, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bits in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divided up to 100 million, which leaves the margin...
The challenge is also highlighted at each increase in the calculation power.
The life of the network has already been high and low.
Web sites provided for Bitcoin services have been attacked and shooted bitcoins.
"It does not concern the protocol itself," says Peter Noizat, who comes to launch Paymium, a real currency paying company using Bitcoin network.
The ECB also provides opportunities for money whiteing through this anonymous service.
But the cash also has this default.
Weight actors like Wikipedia reject the gifts of this nature.
Others, such as the WordPress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, have analyzed the account book and showed that nearly 80% of the bitcoins did not circulate.
In November, "good soldiers" were launched.
"Thanty thousand dollars have been changed," John Holmquist, who worked for Coinabul, converted in gold bitcoins.
Peter Noizat, also author of a pedagogic book on this currency, believed the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system, Paytunia, is equal to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but uses Bitcoin to validate operations, which becomes less costly.
The carrier has more personality and may therefore be an anonymous.
The system is easy to implement in goods, which do not need to install new terminals or software.
They are sufficient to communicate a address that a phone can "fotograph and recognise" specific Peter Noizat, which ensures having thousands of users.
There is a general movement of relief due to heerarchic systems for more horizontal systems.
"Bitcoin will have time to impose, but 2013 might be a tournant," he predicted.
The ECB, in its report, also intends to reevaluate the different risks, currently considered high, in case of success of this currency.
We went from Afghan.
And then?
The French troops left their responsibility zone in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
Otan and the Americans should follow the end of 2014.
It is time that the Afghan army returns to the possession of its territory and the Afghans choose their future without waiting for us.
These are especially the Afghan countries we have punished them as terrorists.
And we himself, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the blessed, the mutilated.
Talibans are composed of foreign extremists, former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often countries who refuse foreign army presence, such as soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, elderly and archaics, even if they have been joined by jihadistes, Pakistanians, Arabs, Ozbeks, Tadjiks.
Tolerated, sometimes helped by local insurances, those will not be more when the Western will become more discreet.
The department of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I have observed from the top of the jungles planted by French credits, took place in the order.
Track and blind chairs joined Kaboul without being attacked, overwhelmed by helicopters.
There will be no defense of Taliban on Kaboul since the end of 2014.
The circumstances changed since their irrestable progress from 1994 to 1996.
Kaboul was then empty, the country of fire and blood because of struggles between different factions.
Their country's control was then identified as a type of release, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price of the occupied of these countries exceeding the organization of Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not been improved today.
Older moudjaidin, Afghan government and current Taliban government are joined in the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main remarkable anti-Soviet war was returned to the power in 2001.
They moved into businessists, from government lands to build them to lands to build refugees income from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from 'own American subtradition contracts'.
They have discovered themselves; most of them did not fight themselves.
People, as I heard in the campaigns, seek to a government that is not a fleet.
Many young people want to go out, as they will go to those who have benefited from large Americans: capital fleet is considerable.
Young people are inflicted by war and their ideology.
They covered the modern world at their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated the benefits.
About 65 per cent of the population under 25 years; Kaboul now accounts for 5 million people, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, government schools are full, girls as kids.
It should be provided for work to these young people who do not want to return to the desertism of old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
All, including armed opponents, are phone flights; television, and Turkish cards that present a modern world are following.
The army is present now.
Will the commander's authorities be considered legal?
An elderly commanders of the anti-Soviet fight are already concerned about reconstituting provincial milliards, which will escape central power.
Afghanistan, the mountain countries, the strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization, in the image of Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, eliminating the post of Prime Minister, which was since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, particularly at the occasion of the elections planned in April 2014.
But her country has been depending on foreign aid since the 50s and so far.
No industry has been moved on the road, no barge has been able, no important irrigation system has been repared.
All is imported; nothing is produced except fruit and fruit.
The priority is left at the private initiative.
In a country destroyed by thirty years of war, a government control on infrastructure would have been needed.
The brush was depleted that Afghan had mines.
It was just to add to the feeling that the Westerns were only to stop it.
Without energy to treat the iron mine or copper on the ground, nor transport means to export it through the mountains, there is no mineral exploitation.
The Chineses have already left the mine of Mes Aynak, letting the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to build the Burundi site and remain the most important employees in the province.
It will also be a day that Afghan and Pakistan, whose imports and exports are widely depending on normal reports.
The department of French fighters finished on November 20.
The new Cooperation Treaty provides for the continuation of traditional support: girls, boys, French department at the university, French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, support for the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, to try to win the hearts and the spirits and to achieve the impossible task to counteract offensive aids and actions, a service of "military" civil action from the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), removed in 2012, has been conducted, and done well by a small French NGO, many collective interest works and activities for agricultural rehabilitation in the decades of mountain villages.
These works, in hand-d's works, have helped contain the insurrection: irrigation, powder, potable water, rebow, fruity trees, soil protection and increased cropable surfaces.
What will we allow to remember, after two billion euros of military expenditure?
A more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, very hard in these regions, often situated up to more than 2 000 meters of height.
The Ambassaded received decades of written requests from small agricultural achievements from local communities from the province of Capisa.
In order to pursue the insurance conducted by foreign groups, what the farmers wanted to say to me, small civil aid should be maintained in favour of them, well controlled and directly touched.
A Constitution to Force in Egypt
It's a new poker cut from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the Constitutional declaration, which is providingly granted the full powers, he decided to play all his way.
He, taking all the shortly, announced, mercredi, that the Assembly would vote on its final text next morning.
Only one week ago, the Head of State had granted two additional months to the Assembly to end its work.
This is two years ago that Egypt is supported on a provisional text, several times amended by the fact that it fragiles institutional stability and leads to legal imprisonments.
This new initiative has only increased fracture in the country.
For its opposites, the President continues to "train his word" and "Petite the right".
On the side of his parties, it is a way to end up soon with the institutional and political crisis by accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be organized within 15 days.
A very short time lap that obliges the Brothers to reject their project to explain the text by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to find popular and democratic legitimacy while the contestation is rare throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote favorably, as he stated in an interview with the American Hebdomary Time.
As this appeal to a preceding vote is finally to the Egyptian people: "You vote for my text, or I keep the full powers," those who will be able to end after the Constitution.
It is a strange environment that 85 members of this Assembly, largely Islamic majority, voted the text last night.
Most liberals missed the call.
On November, just before the Constitutional declaration, they closed the door, estimating that they could not just justify their views.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done this same.
In order to reach the necessary quorum, 11 people, replacement members, have been added to the guest, last morning.
Some are very close to Muslim Brothers.
Without surprise, it's most often the unilaterality that the articles have been voted.
Moreover, commenters were pleasing that one of the only differences of the day was expressed around... the time of prayer, some members of the Committee estimating that the debt of the constitutional was badly regulated.
The text, which was still in vote last night, contains 234 articles.
Objects of all attention, article 2 remains finally identical to that of the Constitution of 1971, as stated that "the principles of charia are the main source of law".
The salafist parties, for which the "Islamic Law establishment" is a major return, would hope to replace "principes" by "the rules" which would allow a more strict application.
For Islamic people, the fact that this article has not been amended is a profit of their good will and respect for the other components of the Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisia", they answer the liberals, which only see a piece of communication.
Because they believe that the Islamicization of the Constitution is through other articles.
They see, in particular, article 220, which confers to the Al-Azhar university a consultative role, in particular for checking the conformity of the laws with the chariot.
According to the Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, it is worried because "the people called to speak themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see the premices of a theocracy."
The fears of liberalians are also undermined by the fact that the next rector of this university should be well less moderate than the current.
"To the time there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution, we remain in the framework of the Civil State.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not less than university, for some forms in the French system" temper Alexis Blouet, which prepares a thesis on Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he recognizes "it may have an ambiguity around article 220, because the terms employed have been paid to the religious vocabulary.
This refers to the "fiqh" in particular [islame jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question could be found at the future in which measure civil judges are responsible for proclamation above. "
Besides its religious aspect, the voted text last is very criticized due to the extensive powers he granted to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers claim that these are clearly reduced in comparison with what they were under the former regime.
Another strict point: the powers conferred to the army.
In accordance with military desire, the review of the Defence budget will not be submitted to the Parliament but to a national Defence Council.
Not more than civilian proceedings are prohibited in military courts, as requested by human rights defence associations.
These are also part of their concerns about the text, which they judge freedom.
The crime of blasphem is maintained and the insulto is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences on the freedom of expression, including the press.
Furthermore, no items have been made to protect women, emphasized by Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to it, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by article 36.
The word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President had to express the television last night, manifestations are expected to be held at the afternoon.
The support of the Head of State will develop them, Saturday.
In Israel, in holy places, the World Center and a sea of samurai are waiting for the Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Earth joins the size of Bible truths, modern comfort and wild nature.
Argumenty i Fakty had five major reasons to make you in Israel.
Go to worship the holy places
Return unto you: the rivers of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that whoever puts these "Christ Funds" will be touched by the Divine Great.
As for the Galilee, she is the earth of the miracles of Jesus: where the water was shed in wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he was shocking the beach or where the fish was wonderful.
It is in this specific place that Jesus appeared before his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you find the most holy places, it is good in Jerusalem.
The believers and parked the street of the Suffrance or the way of Croix (in Latin: the Dolorosa Via).
This path begins near the strong Antonia (the pretoire), where the process was held, then leading through the streets of the old city to the Church of Saint-Spulcre on the Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to the one of the Peter of the United Nations and the place to the garden.
Here is the Christian center of the world, symbol of the salvation of humanity.
According to the Christian legend, the monastery of the Cross is enriched in the place where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus has been crucified.
Jerusalem also opens the most holy place of the Jews: the Wall of Lamentations, which is the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in the year 70.
According to the tradition, people of different condemnations leave small words accompanied by prayers that are then heard.
Travel in height
Visit the ruins of Massada, former refugee against enemy built by Herod the Grand in 25 April. J-C. for his family.
These ruins are located on the rocks of a mountain at 450 m above the sea level.
Only the alpinism amators can make it in their own ways.
For the others, a telephone brings them on this sum of history.
In the north of the country, between 1 600 and 2 040 m height, it is the ski station of Monte Hermont, which welcomes many winter tourists.
A ship can drive you from the foot of the mountain.
The ski tracks make a total of 45 km long.
The old believers want to live by pagan gods as the top of the mountain.
Visit the unique museums
This country opens about 300 museums.
Can't all visit during one stay.
This is the five most interesting ones that really valuent the back.
First of all: the Museum of Israel situated near the Knesset (the parliament).
It opens the very old manuscripts of Qumrân, or manuscripts of the Death Sea, found in the green of the wilderness of Judah, as well as about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological objects.
See also: the Museum of Art of Tel-Avid.
There are mainly the tules of the impressionists and expressionists Mon, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
At Acre, the Hammam Al-Basha waits for you with its Turkish bathrooms composed of visitors and overseers of the time.
Once in Caesara, enter the only Ralli private Museum where you can admire Rodin's sculptures.
There are no guides or memories.
The entry is free and donations are prohibited.
The fifth Museum is the Holocaust or Memorial Museum of Yad Vashem, located in Tel-Aviv, which returns to the most dramatic pages of the history.
The most tragic part is the memory of children, built at the memory of 1,5 million children exterminated in concentration camps and gas rooms.
You're coming in and pulling it into a total darkness.
Skin stars.
Then you hear the names of the Jewish children and the names of countries where they are dead.
It is also mentioned by Ukraine.
Health and well-being
The three great Balneary stations of Israel are located on the rivers of the Mediterranean sea, the Red Sea and the Death Sea.
Each of them offers pools, aquatic parks, delphinariums and giant aquariums.
Note: You can swim in the Red Sea even winter because the temperature of the water does not fall below 21° while the air can reach 23°.
The Death Sea is still warm and you can swim it all year.
This is the only sea in the world: it takes the lower point of the Earth, or 417 m below the sea level.
The blue water contains sweet water, and it is very easy to retain the bathrooms, even those who do not know swimming.
Landscapes that are around it are a surrealist beauty.
There is a basis of salt water treatment, limon, curative booms and to treat different diseases such as democrats, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthrite, bronchites, diabetes, but also for all the ways of detention.
Discover the secrets of the Antiquity
They are guarded by the old city of Tel-Avi, Jaffa, on the edge of the Mediterranean sea.
It is through the famous Via Maris, which links Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in the Greek and Egyptian legends of the Antiquity.
According to the legend, it is here that Noah built his ark and that Persée saved the beautiful Andromede, with whom he himself saw here a long and happy life.
Tourists especially love to walk in close streets that bring the name of the zodiac signs.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street that corresponds to "You" signs, the destination will care for you.
To Jaffa, you can believe young husbands who came to make photo meetings of all Israel and even other countries.
In Caesar, the city of the king Herodes, you will be able to ball in the Roman theatre, "conquer" the strongness of the believers.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarus was the main city of Judah and the residence of the Roman lawyers, including Ponce Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is currently used for evening concerts and opera spectacles.
Note to tourists
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks of Russia.
For your trip, it's better to prefer the dollars in the euro, because they're easily exchangeable in shells (which $1 is now equipped to 3.8 shells).
For urban transport, these are mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tramway and Haifa has the only metro line of the country, consisting of six stations and able to connect the lower and higher parts of the city.
This is almost a subterranean funeral.
Trade in all types of common transport costs 6 shells and allows you to make changes during 1:30.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition wants to celebrate the Sabbath Saturday.
From Friday night at sun beds, markets, shops and public transports stop their activities.
And the week of work starts on Sunday morning.
Many coffees, restaurants and hotels serve only from casher food, which excludes sugar, sea fruits, skin fishes, and plates composed of milk and meat.
It is proposed a multitude of breast-based plates and bottles, soups and deserts based on cocoal milk but also the homous, the traditional juvenile, different sweet, the mould fish balls, the balls, the fruits and fruits.
There are no wrong dogs in the streets of the citys of Israel.
On the contrary, there are many well-friendly chats that walk up the high-air.
We can see them sleeping on the roof of the cars on the night.
These felins love the past places and do not refuse to give them a gift.
The location of a car varies from $37 for $24 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 the day.
Louer a vel will cost 15 shells the day.
A museum entry costs average 30 shells.
The language of the figures
Three million worldwide tourists visited Israel in 2012.
It was particularly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8.000 Ukrainian tourists entered into Earth Promise from January to October 2012, which was 51 per cent more than 2010, before the revising of the visa on 9 February 2011.
"Who has the language goes to Moscow": migrants economist money to learn the language
While the deputy and human rights militants are publishing on what the law on binding language tests is going to be given, frauders for "fake" certificates have already appeared in the country.
Each year, 13 million migrant workers arrive in Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time are central Asian citizens: Uuzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkey.
Their only goal is to win money to help their families remained at home.
Since 1 December, a law has entered into force and states that each migrant worker should take a Russian review.
At the time, this rule refers only to those who intend to work in the service sector, housing, private services and sale in detail.
However, with time, the Federal Migration Service promises that tests will be binding for all immigrants.
Furthermore, the knowledge of the language should be validated, but also the history of Russia and the legal foundations.
The Russian language knowledge should be validated in order to obtain and renew its work permits.
They are exempted only the people of the countries where Russia has the official language status.
Persons receiving certificates or educational diplomas prior to the expiration of the USSS in 1991 are not more interested in that law.
Benefit, negative attitude and rights protection
The network of review centres will be under the auspices of the Russian language Institute Pouchkine, the University of People's friendship, the State University of Moscow, the University of State of Saint Petersburg and other higher education institutions of Russia.
Migrants can be reviewed in all the cities of the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the territory.
This review initiative was supported by the deputy of the State Douma and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law entered into force, the defenders of human rights have already made the issue in the presss many times: what will this give?
What is the obligation to know Russia to change Russians and immigrants?
First, they respond to the representatives of the migratory service, which will allow to reduce the number of people suffering from the slavery to work.
Many speak about the rights of migrant workers, explains the director of the Russian Federal Service of Migration in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of the rights must start before their starting.
Only one organized selection system will allow for 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems are made for migrants without professional, without training, those who do not know the language and who have no medical certificates.
Without the understanding of the language, Sebelev certificate, the future migrant is intended to believe malhoneses who, under the pretext of help, will provide a "cover" in an overwhelmed house where he and the decades of his likeli people will be turned up for months without food and paper, and will have to spend between 12 and 14 hours per day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"What they are promised, and when they arrive, they are wrong, they take their passport, and they do not touch the expected salary", confirms the Head of the Office of Migration Services for the work of Tajikistan Migration Service, Tolib Charipov.
Don't talk to me, Mr. Police!
However, many people from Central Asian Republics who want to win money in Russia are convinced that they do not only know the language of the country where they want to become, but also write difficultly in their own language.
Of course, it is not their fault, but their deficiency: little of Turkey, Ouzbeks, and Tadjiks may be allowed to follow only a passable primary education.
Indeed, their families do not even have anything to eat their children without talking to them correctly and to earn them for school.
As they arrive at adolescence, these young people are going to win the money as long as the opportunity is present.
It's difficult when we don't know the language, trust them.
"You feel decreased and loved."
The defenders of human rights noted an important aspect of the language law.
The reviews will only be used for migrants who have legal status.
Without the status, there will not be any official review or work later.
However, most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
Welcome or defense in
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain an official status in Russia.
The reason? The administrative barriers and these language difficulties.
Moreover, the legalization of money costs: between 12 and 16 000 robbery.
And then, you can get a false record fast for only 1,500 robbers.
The Russian police knows that we have false documents, which we have not registered, where the cases of extorsion.
"They ask us 100.200 robbers, about to buy cigarettes from the tea," firmed journalists Oumed Khouchkadamom, a member of Tajikistan.
"Do so fast, don't less and buy a beautiful art work."
Since the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it was found that the register papers of migrants were not the only to be false.
several false language review certificates have already been confined by the employees of the Federal Migration Service.
The false papers are out of a normal colour.
Of course, their new owners did not have them for anything: every migrant who would like to facilitate the task of reviews had to decrease seven thousand robbers for this document.
It is two times and half more than the official procedure: it will cost the employee migrating three thousand robbers.
The representatives of the power and human rights defenders agree to say that the short-term goal is to protect the system against corruption so that it is impossible to just buy these "papier bottles".
The authorities may give migratory workers who have not been able to validate the first time to follow language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russia will be proposed a work in areas which do not involve actively communicating with people.
The Ministry of Internal Arms does not care for the arms market
The part of legal weapons crimes is very low
The Russian Ministry of Interior proposes to decrease the law against civil weapons publishers.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: it is the shooting of marry or murder organised by the Moscow judiciary Dmitry Vinogradov, who made seven dead.
The police wants to prohibit the port of ball weapons in public places and highlight the legal age of the arms port permit by over 18 to 21 years of age.
The idea was supported by the Chief of the Douma Security Committee and Combating Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the Amendments to the Weapons Act would be introduced nextly to the Douma of State.
Everyone is not satisfied with seeing that Russian authorities try to solve the problem by "sing the vis".
A open letter appears on the Net, where his authors, representatives of various tired centres, require "insensitive hardship".
The percentage of crimes made with a registered weapons is minimum, stated to the Russian Vasiliy Lesnikov service, a judiciary and specialist of the BBC crime.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Interior, at a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were made with a fire weapons recorded in police services while 1,168,000 crimes were registered during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are that the strengthening of civil weapons laws will not prevent criminals from providing themselves to the black market.
According to them, we can find any weapons today in Moscow for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of Interior claims that it controls the distribution of illegal weapons.
Providers: of the officer
The weapon black market is provided through several channels.
The main channels are five, reports Victor Baranets, colonal for the decree of ten years to the Ministry of Education and the General Quartet.
Screen capture from a site taking arms commands
The first is "the military trace", namely the weapons slaughtered during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians," explains Baranets.
The second type of weapons out of the black market are those defeated by criminals to the arms of the order.
Baranets explains that weapons are also shooted in the police stocks as well as those slaughtered directly to the representatives of the order forces.
Illicit weapons are sell from military deposits.
Many of these lasts have often suffered explosions.
"The proof versions indicate that some fires have been decreased to dismiss the deficit", explains the former military man.
For Baranets, weapon manufacturers are for something.
"We see private weapons manufactures that do not reflect with the international market competition and spend weapons on the black market, in particular in Moscow," said one expert.
One of the other sources of the black market is the contraband.
A major part of weapons and metrollattes come from poor countries, such as Kirgicia.
"We find a local production, sometimes artisanal, a mafia has formed and organized the supply", adds the former military.
Where's the weapons coming?
Experts evaluated the nearly part of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on this issue was established in 2011 by the Challenge for Problem Analysis and Research for Public Administration.
Specialists analyzed the reports of the Ministry of Internal and Rosstat, criminal records and the public data of the weapons ports.
The large majority of illegal weapons, explaining researchers, come from the army and the order forces.
The half of the weapons presented on the black market were found " by the fault of employees whose work is linked to the weapon", explains the report.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of the weapons originate from military conflicts, 14 per cent are stolen at the time of manufacturing, and 5 per cent are displaced from "inland folks".
A seller and consultant of a weapons requested to keep the anonymat ensures that for a long time nobody has purchased the weapons found by these clan specialists; they are too old.
The most frequently said that the sellers are going to search for new goods in military loans.
The person buys a unit by a teacher, for example a TT gun.
We're booking him by passing the goods by a grilling.
"He transported the city and returned $900 through the unit with two loaders," he says.
"It is true that the police is aware of all matters, so when crimes are on the issue of being elected, it is a control purchase to illegal weapons goods", adds the seller.
"Come in a luxury bottle."
The buyer and the buyer are generally found by knowledge.
I have consulted websites, blogs, until a guy was shown and proposed to come to the Begovaya car where someone would get me into a "coin" to walk.
The weapon price was given to me on place.
Victor Baranets and military observer
To find a gun, I have to know someone who has a contact, explains the seller, I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are sellers on the markets, but there is also need to come in, for example, "Dead of such a person, who asked me to give me that her daughter lost a dent."
Now I even buy a couple of American pounds through a person I trust.
He's just booking them to me because he knows I won't give it.
Smalls are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military Victor Baranets tried as an illegal weapons purchaser in the 1990s when he was prepared to publish a article on the subject.
The schemes, according to him, have not changed.
We gave him a album in which there was "all we want."
"I believed in a luxury boutique," the military remembered.
There's no secret for the buyer, explains Baranets, we can try everything.
As a potential customer, I don't like to buy, we're going with the boss seller and we're installing a target.
"We let me shoot, and when I am convinced that weapon walks well, we're starting to negotiate", describes the expert.
A boutique from his canape
Search engines show websites and groups on V contact where weapons can be purchased for different uses.
For this, we need no document and no one to meet.
"There is enough to have a precise amount of money," it is published on the site "Buy a gun or a mill of fight."
Users leave their request and ask their questions.
And we're sell to minors?
"Sans permission, of course," requests the "Ivan" user (conserved orthographer).
"Buy TT. Moscow," wrote "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has distributed a wide range of false sites and put the people wishing to purchase fight weapons on the skin.
People smile on food, such as fame loups, and then return to exploit carbon in Siberia

I heard about this type of schemes: generally, the site is registered outside the Russian law field.
People take the commands.
The buyer performs the payment on the automatic bottles.
"He has returned a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden", explains the secretariat of the association "Receive a gun," Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets claims that if you request the site, you can find out without weapons and behind the bars.
The Federal Security Service has distributed a wide range of false sites and put the people wishing to purchase fight weapons on the skin.
"Those smile on food as famined loups, and then they come to operate carbon in Siberia," he says.
A Makarov for $100
The purchase of an illegal fire weapons, estimated by experts, may cost from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov's "A gun Drop" association, you can buy a Makarov gun for $100-300.
We'll have to wait for about a month and half.
It has been out of long loans through the direction of these medium size loans.
According to the official data of the Ministry, in comparison with the period January-October 2011, the number of these crimes had reduced in the whole Russia of 7 per cent, and 22.9.000 were increased while the flying and extortion of weapons, munitions, explosive substances and bombs slowed 7.8 per cent.
United States: Employees of fast food and supermarket are grown
About a quarter of American adolescents passed by a castle work at McDonald's
In recent days, a protest vague is mounted against the basket salary practiced by the Walmart supermarkets and the famous rapid restoration chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the moment, no one can predict if this vague is going to take the width or swift quickly.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left associations.
In comparison with the increase in modest wages from the basic employees in Walmart and in the rapid reconstruction chains, manifestations organizations want to achieve trade unions.
This sector is not now covered by syndical movement.
46 cents per year?
The manifestations started last week, after Thanksgiving, the "Noir Vender" at the time when a defeated rain of money preventing millions of people slaughtered in America and sometimes turned out clouds.
In that day, some employees of the Walmart company, who are employed in the world by 2,2 million people, left their place to organize green pikes with trade unions and left activists in the shops of society whose products are intended for the consumers of modest and medium-sized classes.
Walmart markets all: chass shoes through car batteries, aspirators, eggs and milk.
The products are averagely 8% to 27% less cherished than in large supermarkets.
That's why many employees misleading in Walmart do their courses only on their workplace.
The price and choice of products made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to the critics, Walmart may allow to sell its good market products, in particular because of the wages of its employees.
These are also difficult working conditions, such as the lack of heavy carriages or portable scanners.
The participants of the "Noir Vender" demonstrations requested an increase in payment, as they claimed that the price of medical insurance provided by the company had increased from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
For the basic employee at Walmart that touchs $9.5 of the hour, it's a sum that he can't allow.
Scientists at the University of Berlin show that if Walmart increased the average payment at $12, it would cost $3.2 billion in the group.
It is 1.1% more than what it is currently expenditure.
If Walmart would transfer all the payments to the consumers' edges, each course in the store would return to 46 percent more.
They will cost only $12,39 more than now in one year.
Walmart's partisans noted with satisfaction that protests have been held in only nine States and had no prejudice to the group.
The "Noir Vender" continued in the winters on Wednesday afternoon, and Walmart sold 5000 items in the second period.
His boxes performed in total 100 million transactions for the "Noir Vender".
The portfolio of the company Dan Fogleman in a interview at the left Huffington Post, which in all "minus of five" employees of Walmart had left their posts and that protest was only a "coming operation of both other" from the organizer trade.
" Next Client!"
Protections continued this week in New York and were not more concerned with the Walmart shops (from this progressive city, they are not very appreciative, because they were not yet implanted) but the McDonald's and other good market restaurants.
McDonald's advertising to sell billions of parts and after they don't even give you sickness and pay you not the work you have done honestly!
Jumae Williams, members of the New York municipal Council
Today, the minimum payment provided by federal legislation and New York law is $7,25.
Speed-foods increased by time, but at a little time, its basic employees at New York $8,90 at an hour.
Nobody touchs less than they are in this city.
For me, it's unconceptable to live with this sum in New York.
It was a time when almost a fourth of the American adolescents worked at McDonald's after the school in life for their parents.
Many people saw their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a while.
Today, I'm going to interview McDonald's employees who are grateful to live with this salary and sometimes have to eat their children with them.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal's forum, comments say it's irresponsible to make children if you don't know with what you're going to eat them.
The manifestants who started the afternoon movement at 6 p.m. near McDonald's 40th Street and on Madison Avenue required that the chassiers and fast food kitchens be paid at least $15 of the hour, or a multiplication more than two times than the current minimum payment.
They also asked for the establishment of trade unions in the rapid rebuilding sector.
The American Law prohibits the administration of hindering it and punishing the protesters of a synagogue by brimades or licensing.
However, the administration simplifys their lives rarely.
For a syndicate, the prevention of rapid reconstruction remains a difficult task, and this is for concrete reasons.
One of the main ones is the extraordinary rotation of staff.
They're not agreed
Other turbulent manifestations were close to several other rapid restoration chains.
The fair moment of protest was the mid-day assembly near the McDonald's de Times Square with the intervention of several local democratic policies, including Jumane Williams member of the municipal Council, which stated: "McDonald's announces to sell thousands of portions and after they don't even give you sickness and do not pay the work you sincerely do!".
The manifestants have been supported by other New-Turkey Democrats in view, in particular by the candidate at the position of Master Bill De Blasio, who stated that "We must all support the workers of the rapid restoration to obtain a fair and economic welfare that mere each New York.
The New York Times characterized this manifestation as the most important to know the rapid restoration sector throughout his history.
But only a few hundreds of people participated there without knowing that everyone was not fast-food employees, which employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It's very difficult to say if this mass movement stage makes small.
"To the moment, it's just a medium to lie the brain."
Lastly, the fans of the new technologies were used to understand the increased reality through special lunets.
At the beginning, Google declared that his current model at its annual conference and in November was learned that Microsoft had made the request of patent.
However, he is holding with the director of the 3D Interactive Technology Group of Microsoft Cambridge Lab Shahram Izadi that the lunettes are already from the old history of this society.
They are tried to handle virtual objects in cloud hands by creating open virtual spaces.
- Can you tell us in a few words what your research group makes?
- We work on the interaction between man and the machine and we try to expand the borders of this interaction.
Humanity in its whole has remained for the time on the plate screen and sometimes on the table.
We want to look at 5 to 10 years before us and become the radical changes that will happen with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect captors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in command by geste.
- What are we reserving the future too?
- While the Kinect gave the physical interaction, many things start on a plate screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance is not really real.
We're trying to change this and we're working on 3D image systems that operate on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to get out of the computer world in our, in the physical world, to make it more tactile.
For this, however, not only the user must be identified, but also the space that is around it.
Thus, we can complement the real world by virtual objects in a more practical form.
And to begin, let us get out of these stupid boxes of virtual reality!
- What do you think about the vocabulary command?
She's appreciated, but isn't she not overwhelmed?
It is not possible to say that it is a panacase: the question of confidentiality is because it is not always intended to inform others of his actions or intentions.
In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but everyone in his neck.
For example, to command the devices in the public places, we had a project for which we are pensioning to gests, not wide gests, but rather to discrete, limited gedges.
The giants were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet covered to the hand that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is now large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it at the size of an hour.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: geste + voice.
- What do you mean?
- For instance, how would you ask me to pass this kitchen?
You would do it with the word and with the gests.
- Normally, I'm just talking.
- Oh, it'll be hard to recognise.
- So, do you want to force users to adjust according to what the machine can or do at a given time?
- Not bindingly, but it's a mutual approach.
I think that soon we'll be working to develop new types of sensors that will make us better identification of human reactions.
For example, the laser captures can act, they produce a sufficiently deeply well-resolution and it is very important.
- If we're interested in your work on the Xbox Kinect captors, what do you don't like in modern cameras?
Do they miss a resolution, deep or otherwise?
- In principle, it's on the current generation that we are based on our 3D recognition.
Of course it would be good to get about 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the same megapixels, but the quality of the matrix and depth.
As far as this point, all the current technologies are pretty good, this congratulates the work to the designers of algorithms.
Resolution should be maintained in mind according to X and Y-axes, but also Z.
Speed is also much, the number of frames in the second.
Human movements are sufficiently dynamic, and the 30 c/s do not really suffice, especially for gests.
Steven Batiche, of our Redmond laboratory, gave to captures a regular delay of treatment between 1 and 100 μs, current sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Everyone does not understand how this influences human and machine interaction.
I would really need a device of this type in my work, but not to touch, to have more frameworks in the second.
- But don't you have to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect has today three "cameras", which one is in fact a infrared and the second, a receptor of the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a normal sensor of the visible field.
It will not define the depth of the object.
Many of the cameras could solve this problem...
Or Imperialize it by increased the volume of calculations required.
It would be interesting to create a Kinect soft product, play with the camera curve and see how this might help define the locations.
- As I remember, Microsoft, at the difference of Google, did not present his lunetts to the public.
Do you not think that daily use of the increased reality technologies are one of the most prospective platforms?
- Of course, walking all the time with a smartphone, it's not practical but this is what I think: the best option would be an increased "transitory" reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to pass lunettes to smartphone.
Lunettes are a very personal instrument and that's what makes their strength (personal elements are the only one you are to see) and at the same time their weakness: the increased reality from lunettes will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Let us imagine a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is not more accessible than Tony Stark in Iron Man but also the simple mortality.
There is a problem about which opposers to this idea point the duty: there is no tactic sensation!
The hands don't feel anything!
What answers will your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my course, I often say that the increased reality is the seventh lost in the interaction between man and machine.
I think that the eighth could be very well the scope of tactile feelings.
For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve image support.
It records the pressures perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly intended to allocate palpacity to these "images in the air": for example, the interference of several ultrason radiates leading to a specific point where the duty is found and which gives you the feeling, for the time still low, of an air suffix on the dogs.
There are also bracelets that affect the nervous finishings of the teeth, they are also a work axis with perspectives.
- And you tried to wrong the brain?
He believes he feels what he should normally feel at the time he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't still tried.
There is still a task below on which it will still be bad: the way to believe someone who is physically located in a very reduced space that goes in an open space almost unfinished - we work on the concepts of the course mass (are to see those found in the Fitness clubs), mobile platforms, and also generous balls.
For the moment, it is only medium-sized to mislead the brain, there are still many years of work.
This is what works on the virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many are still in the absolute state of fecondation.
The rule of the guest and not the culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues to the "World Garde Petersbourgeoise" project described to citizens who are in advance, at the preserve of culture and art.
This extra-selective list has already been welcomed by major actors of the artistic scene of Saint Petersburg which goes beyond the border of the city and who found a recognition in Europe, after being known throughout Russia.
The new "Rosbalt" heroes are Kirill Miller's extraversive painting.
All the city knows Kirill Miller, this man instead of barbue, all red clothes that can be crossed near the Russian Museum, the summer garden or still in the branched festivals and beachings.
Kirill Miller's tables are always assembling the crowds, anyway their exposure place.
It's one of the petersbourgeous containers that are very social and philosophy, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is an exminent representative of the previous petersbourgeois garden at the end of the 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, his appearance makes the people smiling and bring them a good humor.
He has recently taken in his hands a Barbara's orer and became the symbol of this instrument in Saint Petersburg because he had been sufficiently mature for this difficult role of his existence, his philosophy and his image of bohemia.
- Kirill, why are you walking the city all red and not in yellow or Turkish blue, for example?
- I chose the red as a specialized kitchen in the look and image.
In this world, red is a commitment between the painting, the image creator and society.
Even if in society, everything that is not green causes aggressiveness and negative angry.
But my provocations are intended to reach the debate.
All the story of my provocative actions is an invitation to the discussion.
- And when did you understand you should be clever?
- On the exhibition of the Palais of the Nevskiy culture where my work was found.
I realized that it was my way.
So, the vague of the old non-official paintings was past and the new, free, in my kind, were incomprehensible.
I started to link my friendship with the new vague paintings, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina that gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10" and then there was no more vague.
I'm interested in the theatre, mode, music, for all kinds except for words.
And all this was found in your art Clinical Clinic... and it was important for me to find me in the centre of Saint Petersburg culture where the best creative forces must be gathered.
In 1995, I took place in Pouchkinskaya-10 which opened before works a musical and artistic club, a bohemen club, the house of Petersbourgeois.
Many have been born there: NOM, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour's coming with the "The Van Gogh's Ear".
Chnour and his friends sing easy play-back songs in mould maillots, they were among them Igor Vdovin, today's mode composer.
When the group began to produce life, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg was not bad for emissions before Hali Gali time.
We gave them Trakhtenberg, and then his great carrière started, but his training and basic education, it's at us he received them.
Galleria "D137", Club "Griboedov": these are the impacts of the artic Clinic.
Our employees have gone as a housing.
I'm a hero of the last century, from the time the culture wanted to mean something.
In 2000, a study was organized in the press: it was the price "The personalities of our city".
I was called "First of the Year" and that's when my government ended.
This is not the way to work in a new time with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honestity and culture of the last century.
Today it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by an acceptable style.
- Many of my tables are shocks, they have a very strong journey and a very strong acuity.
I'll have an exhibition programed "The Russian Museum through the clouds."
Crowns belong to an intemporary category.
Before I was a social person, today it's worse and it's afraid of being so.
But with the crowns, everything works, the tragic falls.
I love the bigsk, I have great ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through the total and binding guiding.
Today, this is the house that is important, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not in the inside of the person.
Maybe we can't give him the hand, but instead we need to kick him.
And the lie will be removed by the disguise.
- We have recently seen you in the role of the Baraari's horrible player. - An cultural city must have such a hero.
Whoever else can play him.
- But maybe the commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Today the commercial art is to be careful, delicate, mild.
There is a disintegration of culture involving itself.
Before the people were shared in flocks, the partyrs of the boom loved one thing, and they snake one another.
Today, everything is divided into micro communities, it's difficult to enjoy everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollars ticket to enjoy everyone.
Today, we need to think about who you're going to enjoy.
Everyone saw 100 fans.
- But several thousands of people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- It's people we've got to see it, that's the sexual and social side that walks.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 100,000 will not come and at the end of the account is less management, money, all depriving.
I've got my fans, the main thing is that I'm not wrong with them.
When I was young, I preached the tables that a collectioner rose next to Falk or Larionov.
I have started with the tables that are usually those we're drawing up at the end of life.
Today, the ideas are often confused.
It is said, there is spiritual culture, consumption culture.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to see.
I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew up with the example of the paintings that lived in poverty and died in poverty and who rejected the money just for the painting.
I'm for this culture.
- Kirill, what's lacking in Saint Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the cultural official.
But everyone can't work in culture.
Under the rule of the good tsars, it was not like that, the tsars did not understand well the culture, but they understood that it had to keep the good experts.
In Moscow, there are good advisors today.
We have people here in Saint Petersburg that might be experts, but they are discarded, because there are higher experts who will be assessed correctly and take them a way.
Today, it's the "good's rule" which fled.
The same Erarta, but they differ in this sense, they say honestly that they do not take all the contemporary art, that there are paintings that must be found other museums.
- For you, what is this St. Petersburg?
- Saint-Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a land for this.
And on our stones, the art has a bad powder.
We need a cultural land and we have more writers than readers, that's bad.
In Europe there are many curriculums that will see exhibitions, concerts.
In us, this kit is very good.
We must make art as it was the case at the beginning of the last century.
Project implemented with the support of the St. Petersburg bourse
Skip in space
Earth is in danger.
Climate refrigeration or collision with a killing asteroid.
Space ships characters with landscapes start to search for a relief planet.
In order to save humanity, a great question is: how to continue to make our species live in a spectrum or still on a relief planet?
I think there's no choice.
There are actually two real planets that can be conquered, only by hypothesis.
This is Vladimir Sourdine, researcher of the Astronomic Institute of State P.K. Chternberg (GAICh).
If on Mars the conditions are more adapted to life, the temperature at the surface of Venus is 500 .
We can live only in a very high height or on the orbit of Venus... in the space.
It has been started to interest in reproduction issues in space by focusing on flowers.
There was a half-year-old experience on plants.
Four generations of small crops on orbit did not vary in any way of the Territory Diversities.
Then, insects, small drosophiles, reproductive muscles were put on orbit.
In 1979, ball eggs were sent in the space to see how an overwhelming embryo was developed.
We get a powder in the outdoor as well as normal.
Then the problems are starting.
" The problem is linked to the fact that the powder must find support, put on its pats and begins to move, " explains the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Biological Medical Problems of Russian Science Academy (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
When no support was found, the powders were destructive.
And at 10:00 p.m. new births saw their instincts fully atrophish.
The powders did not react to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would just die for four days.
"We missed them two times, then we left, because it's just impossible to work with them there," explains Vladimir Sychev by observing the failure of experience with powders in the space.
The last "miniature ark" with animals was sent on orbite 16 years ago.
Experiences will continue in spring 2013.
However, the Biosatellite " Bion " would blend only species of the same sex.
There was an experience with rats sent with their fetus in space.
In principle, we haven't found nothing of supernatural.
"There was still biosatellites, and then it's the only experience. This kind of research needs to be done", says Vladimir Sychev.
After the shooting, the rats of the space gave birth to their generation.
However, it is not possible to make playings directly in space.
This isn't a bad business.
By losing their habitual environment, animals are not able to achieve their sexual instincts.
In contrast to the beasts, man is capable in principle.
Homo sapiens have abstrated thoughts, it is able to create a convenient emotional fund.
This type of experience is not performed for ethical reasons.
But women have been in space for 50 years.
The largest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the women's body is what humanity has more precious.
Our swimming pool was shocked and nobody on Earth could tell if he stood after a flight in the space.
If she could give birth to a child after the flight.
" Nobody answered this question ", explains Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, retreatment of the fuel sector and space.
In June 1964, just one year after her flight in space, the first cosmonauta Valentina Terechkova birthed a girl.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolaiev, was also cosmonauta.
In 1988, the second cosmonaute Svetlana Savitskaya, who had been two times on orbit and even worked in extra-vehicular environment, was born to a son.
However, the risk is to lose.
We have little, even very little cosmonautes who have nothing and who give birth to a full healthy seed after long flights.
"And if they are longer, this presents a danger even during the orbit flights, " concludes the pilot and cosmonaute, the soviet and heroes of the Russian Union, Valeriy Poliakov.
However, humanity must find new solutions in biotechnology, radio protection and creating artificial gravity.
Cosmonat preparation laboratory: binding stage of flight preparation.
Here, in no flottability, the cosmonats lead to extra-very outputs.
Water bleeds the swimming shoes.
If for adults, water is comfortable but a foreign environment, for food, is their real element.
Small amphibian men seem to be confirmed: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
As the baby evolves around 9 months in the lymphatic liquid of his mother's wind, it is easier to live in water.
It's in a logical principle, because from his birth to his first bathroom, it's only two weeks.
"It's very little to forget," explains the Nation Instructor for Food, Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the child who comes to birth the appeal is a more natural state, the woman needs gravitation, a weight force.
Instead, the wind muscles, the bassin muscles are very rapidly attrophe, the baby’s ability to slow down lost.
All right, let's ignore this by supporting us on the simulators.
Of course, we can prepare a fellowship in a special room, and the woman will get out of it.
"And then?" asked Valeriy Poliakov to invite you to consider this complex issue.
On the other hand, the child also needs an artificial gravity.
If it does not feel the earthquake, the body does not form squelet or muscular system.
No food can be found as an adult with special combination for training.
He's just gonna be private of his vital needs.
" And this experience we considered in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will go back to the Earth of a disabled child, completely disadvantaged, " provides the Director of the Committee for Bioethics of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of Russian Scientific Academy, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space is still the theory.
However, with time this will become reality, when the Territorys will turn into their ships to a remote planet that will become the home of their descendants in the space.
The head of the ICC (Summit of Public Finance Control Institute) stated: " The control of the independent pseudo-work (in Czech " system Švarc " ) failed because of the politicians.
In the field of public markets, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and a quality legislation, but it is on the basis of its application.
This is what Miloslav Kala said, the Vice-President of the Supreme Finance Control Institute in an interview for Update.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my view, it is what is default to us, " said Kala in his comment of the current situation.
A jointly conducted control by Czech and German inspectors suggests similar conclusions.
He quotes as an example of abuse the approach of the " system Švarc " by Petr Nečas.
Mr. First Minister recently stated that ODS would not import entrepreneurs with controls; is it therefore permitted or banned?
"The law must be applied in a way or in another, if it prohibits anything, even the government head may not prevent action of a authority to inspect the law's compliance", states Kala.
At the meeting of the Commission on the Chamber of Deputy, you have proposed a Czech-Deputy project in which public market legislation were compared to these two countries.
What was this concrete question?
This is a parallel control that we have started about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides how to manage public markets and specific national legislation, as well as a self-declared practice.
We have gathered all this and even though this control procedure has not yet been completed, we have occurred very interesting differences: generally speaking, our legislation may be "a more severe and better quality", however, according to some parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This, therefore, confirms that it is not sufficient to continuously develop more detailed rules but that it is necessary to dedicate itself to the application of the same law.
What can this project help you and what does it result for you?
A common control of this type should just contribute to what we stop trying to clarify the laws, decreasing and improved the tools when it does not have a very positive effect.
The principle of good management means obtaining the matter to a reasonable price (what does not always mean the lowest) to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But by switching out the markets, this goal will not be strongly achieved.
This system could be so submerged by the paper, that those who are looking for the fails will find much more opportunities than if the steel remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems relating to the implementation of public market legislation.
How does the control system operate in Germany?
Is there a similar institution to our ISC or a different organization mode?
With regard to institutions, like the ISC, the Federal Computations Court, which is also organized, also has a little differently constituted advice, but these two institutions are essentially in similar ways .
The skills are also similar, however, with a weakness in relation to our system: Germany is a federal structure, and it also has a course of accounts of this type at the level of the different countries.
The BRH can only control the federal money, which corresponds to state resources.
The public funds managed by the regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of the country accounts courses.
With regard to national legislation, is it more simple than us?
I do not want to make general comparison without concrete data, however, in certain areas, Germany is often appointed as a model, but it is certainly not possible to say that it makes better in all areas.
Maybe they have better inspectors?
No, of course not, but I repeat, I don't have comparison data.
However, it is also necessary to say that this country we consider as a model is also faced with a number of problems.
If they had no advantage to cooperate with our institutions, right?
What does national legislation mean for you, as a institution, the amendment of the public markets law? Do they already feel its effects?
This amendment has been in force relatively recently, it has no effect on our control operations.
As we have later controls, we must take account of a certain delay.
Our observations relate only to the process of preparation of future controls - we have started a new instrument for the "detection of the risks of wrong management" with which we have been in the cribble nearly 14 000 public markets - these changes will be heard, because the waves have been changed, as well as the conditions of certain types of offering procedures and so on.
Do you therefore consider the adoption of this law instead of a benefit or as a load overwhelming for the administration?
I think that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that can happen is that these rules become more severe and that it is not possible to respect them.
Under the scheme of previous regulation, the provider (e.g. the regional counsel, in the case of regional operational programmes) imposed the subjects controlled to accept that any violation of the market law means lack of budgetary discipline.
Is it, therefore, really useful to make the law more severe in this way?
No, I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack the system or to abuse but not punish those who do formal errors without income on the decision-making process.
Such a system will provide pressure advantages on administration.
So what is the solution to get out of it?
Let's take care of where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that ODS would not import entrepreneurs with controls of the self-distributing system - what does that mean?
Is the Švarc system prohibited or authorized?
The law must be applied in a way or in another, if it prohibits anything, even the government head may not prevent action of a authority inspecting and demanding compliance with the law.
He may declare: "We'll change the law and authorize it " but it can't say that we're going to act as if nothing was.
The market law contains relatively strict rules on formalities to be implemented, just to protect offers.
But it is also tragic that a submissioner is only eliminated because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair, and I think that is what is default in us.
The roads are by glad places, but most are practical.
In some places of the Czech Republic, the roads are heavy and also engaging.
However, the network remains most practically, at some places with increased monitoring.
Karlovy Vary region
In the Karlovy Vary region, the roads were practitionable this morning, but by heavy places and also heavy.
Temperature dropped and oscilled between -5 °C and -10 °C but they should be slightly back in the day.
The neighbors stopped in the region and there's only one end of neighbouring.
However, the crystals of the Metallife Mountains (Krušne ory) are some 30 cm of snow.
It provides data from the regional road maintenance services that, due to the brouillard, the visibility was reduced.
The R6 speed road and the national routes in the region are now practical without difficulty.
However, monitoring remains, for example, on some points to which the revestment can be heavy and slow.
All headquarters and third-party roads, including mountain routes, are also practical.
There are still some of their thrones of glad nest rests and by places cut by traffic.
Overall in height areas, drivers must strengthen their monitoring.
Pardubice and Hradec Kralové regions
The Trade Directorate and Authors reports on its website that some roads from East Boome are threatened by the training of green and that traffic swimming beds can be found on roads in mountain areas and located in height.
Rail maintenance services are maintaining conductors against the risks of clothing training in the area of the Pardubice region.
There may be greens around Lanškroon, Ustí nad Orlici, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Möto, and this, mainly on the headquarters and third-party roads.
The routes I/43 and I/34 to Svitavy's roads were chemically treated.
The snow is mainly located in the mountains of the Gentes (Kkronoše) and the Mountains of the Aigle (Orlické Hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Knśnou and Trutnov, a swimming neighborhood is presented on the roads in areas located in height.
In East Both, the time will be now sec, the most commonly discharged, with possible weakening passages.
It will swim a low wind and temperatures will normally swim between -3° and +1°C.
Pilsen region
The routes in the Pilsen region are now practiced, although, by places, there should be a increased monitoring and adapting its conduct to the meteorological conditions.
He throws this morning, the temperatures between -3 ° and -9 °C.
After the latest sneeves and the refrigeration that has followed, some communication ways can be used by glad places.
The drivers may expect to pass through brouillard areas, but the visibility will be progressively improved.
This is what it provides for information from the regional road maintenance services.
The D5 route is almost uncomfortable, but the maintenance services recommend an increased monitoring between 80 and 131 kilometers.
The revision of most national roads is sec and gentle.
Some thrones can be heated in the Pilesen-South district and in the Tachov district.
Departmental and third categories are humid and, in this case, the guarding of the heat throne is applied.
The drivers must be monitored, especially on the ways less frequent than the Zhumava region.
Olomouc region
The drivers in the region of the Olomouc region must now be counted with a swimming nest and swimming swimming snake on the roads.
This shock remained on the colle said "ervenohorské sedlo" and on the road in the direction of Videlský kśí, after chemical treatment operations.
The neighbouring snacks imposed the maintenance personnel on the ground; according to the swimming service, it was taken over three centimeters in the district of Šumperk.
In the other parts of the region, most of the shoes are uncomfortable.
" On the heights of the Šumperk district, there are rest of snow.
The drivers in direction of Jeseník must wait to meet a swimming swimming swimming swimming swimming swimming swimming swimming swimming swimming swimming swimming swimming swimming from the district of tsunperk today.
Their colleagues in Jeseník were also placed during the night; according to these lasts, after the chemical treatment, the roads are now displaced and displaced, even in the highest areas.
In the Olomouc district, the roads are not difficult, but the drivers should take attention in forest areas to huge remaining shocks in the district of Šternberk.
Labem and Liberec regions
Since this morning, the road maintenance services in North Bohem reported several difficult throwings.
It provides data from the police, which in some places covered by nest or green, the mountain road from Telnice to Kniniice in Ustecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain under zero lower height, and therefore nest and green should be maintained on the roads. In the plains, especially in the south-east of the Bohem central plate, there is no problem, and roads are generally seed.
No movement difficulties have been reported at the time.
Road maintenance services have reported the presence of gloves, in particular the shore of sqtti.
According to meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal to their training: rain and snow source during the day, swimming and ice during the night.
There are also difficult conditions on national road 13 to border between the regions of Labem and Liberec.
The closure of the movement between Telnice and Knínice is due to tree branches that have been cut under the weight of the neighbourhood until the shock reached.
Šimon Ornest said: "In concert, we want to collect positive energy."
What do you think that at least one month this should be the end of the world?
It's just one of these alarming news, the kind of pieces in which we like to fall.
In our group The Tap Tap, we are in place and are said that we are the only able to collect a positive energy rest in order to rise or prevent the end of the world.
Furthermore, you're taking a very unique project in December: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you more detail this project to our readers?
It's a caritative action that we have been preparing for for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential at the end of the Maya calendar announced on 21 December to 11 a.m.
The age, on 20 December, will take three concerts simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will almost end at the time when Maya calendar on the Kiribati island, which is in the peaceful ocean, on a temporary gun over 12 hours in advance for us.
Who had this idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed everything with our Creator, Honza Augusta.
Besides the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want to think about the state of the world that we leave our children together with the public.
At the end of Maya calendar, we have created a collection of unique objects, including chains, T-shirts, sacs and original keys against the end of the world, buying them online on www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap Group with other interpretations also recorded a hymne against the end of the world, titled " End of the World " (in Czech " Konec svṣṭta zrušeno " ).
It is already very popular on YouTube, will you also understand it at these qualitative concerts?
Of course, at the end, finally, if we're successful and the end of the world has not been...
It will be sing at the same time by all the interpreters in the three concerts.
The hymnes will also join in a given time in the context of a direct, in fact uniquely, from the Czech TV.
The words of this song were written by Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X and also sing...
How have you come to cooperate with them?
We cooperate with other personalities of Czech-biz show, due to the fact that we organize many charitative concerts and events...
We are striving to participate intensively in these projects.
It has been noted that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that they are pleased.
What will benefit these concerts against the end of the world?
Equipment of the Studeo training centre that is available to those who have been reduced mobility and which we are working to achieve within the Jedlička Institute, with the Tap Association, and that's for six years.
Teachers regularly become among students of the Jedličkśv Institute and propose activities interesting and encouraging them.
The students themselves do not have the way to go to course, we try to help them in this way.
In the context of the completion of the construction of the Jedlička Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
A number of music and interpretations groups will go to scene at each of these concerts?
According to what criteria, have you chosen?
We have tried to develop a programme that addresses all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, they will go to the Chineseski scene, Lesbian Support, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jií Suchī.
You will find all the details on www.kpks.cz.
Do you also prepare for other " mega events " in the future?
In May, we will play the first time in the Prague's spring, and we will certainly prepare a quality program with interesting invitations.
We would also like to play the next year in the Czech Republic's house in New York and personally, once they were established in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimumlists, for example you have played in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
However, Tap Tap is a group of persons with disabilities.
How will you organize the organization and logistic of your tours?
It's not so terrible that it appears first.
We have five electric bug members whose ships have to travel on board, naturally we trib also many bags and instrument boxes....
As far as everything has been more or less well at all, ŠSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything happened without problems.
Thanks to your foreign journeys, you can compare what these countries vary for access to persons with reduced mobility, the attitude of public views regarding disabled persons and so on.
What were your experiences until now?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than our homes, we have just been witnessed in Moscow than all is still in a initial phase.
With respect to Prague, Moscow is still very little access to disabled persons, and there is not yet aware that a person is only moved to the city's center.
They have not yet considered a evidence of giving priority to a person in a stakeholder.
Unfortunately, there is also a association that is trying to draw attention to the problems of disabled persons is being created.
What should we still touch the most developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're still late...
It is important to mention that improvements and improvements are always dependent on efforts made by the person concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is really known that people with a weak disabilities move themselves alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilets, at the museum, anywhere...
It is never even very frequent there that many persons with disabilities participate actively in social life, on that point, you, the Tap Tap, are instead of progress!
The respect of the public and access facilities is one thing, but the situation will really start to change when we have among us sports, artists, actors, politicians or famous lawyers.
For the moment, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap Group is currently very popular, back in a few years, what has you put in 1998 to create this group?
I started working as a teacher at the Jedlička Institute, where I have found many young people who are ready to invest in something.
And as I am myself musician (I play, inter alia, saxophone), with a colleague, we created a musical activity.
And then, with the time, as our modeller Láśa Angelovič said, a little lost the control of the situation (rires).
Success has happened only in the past few years, if I don't wrong?
It is true that the creation of links with known songers and actively worked for the promotion of the group has helped us.
We understood that if a work is not visible, it is like if it wasn't in the background.
Thanks to the Union's subsidies, we can also enable to have professors of quality, equipment and so on.
Did you go to reach such a level with The Tap Tap Tap?
Since the beginning, I felt there was a potential to change things.
The business show is full of things that copy each other.
In a certain way, it's logical: everything new is accepted with care and it's long.
Rare are the original projects, and I can confirm that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally the mercy, it's natural...
But compassion is totally unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering, abandoned from all, that we must take in compassion.
They are people who can live in a whole life, even if they have the necessary means of it.
I often say that when people with disabilities come to realize something, it is not only a advanced for them but for the whole society.
Is your success not also required by the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we must be intransigent in many areas and require a certain discipline.
But I think that's really normal.
Some people come home with a romantic vision and the head in the clouds and, when they realize that they must come to repeats two times a week, follow the preparatory courses and pass a lot of time on the roads for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But this works in each group that wants to work and achieve objectives.
The Tap Tap Group currently accounts twenty members.
How many of them were there in 1998?
One, the only, the ́s ́s Angelovič.
We're a open group, people go and go, we can't do anything.
Our doors are always open to those who want or wish to join us.
This will be the date of the end of the world, on Thursday, 20 December 2012 from 21 hours.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba Aline, Brino in Fleda and Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of 12 groups and other musicians of the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relaxation when they will be sing together the song of the Tap Tap Tap Group "The Fine of the World " .
The aim of the concert is to assemble financial resources (to high of 25 million CZK) to equipze the multi-functional Studeo training centre in Prague in the Jedlička Institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is of 400 CZK, the entry is free for children up to 12 years, the ticket prevention is open in Bohemiaticket.
Poland and cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was approved as the twenty-fifth member of the Agency, it is the second Member State of the former Eastern block (Czech Republic became a member of the whole 12 November 2008).
Poland had undertaken close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and in the years following a number of Agency projects.
However, the road from Poland to the space began much more early.
Before the second world war, the passionate Polandians worked on space flights, and they did not always meet understanding.
I would like, for example, to the A. Šternfeld conference at the Astronomy Observatory of Varsovia on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas from his previous guard book entitled " Introduction to the Astronaut " .
The developments of this young engineer (born 1905) left cold auditors, and the years later Šternfeld recalls that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld obtained the price Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for his book "Introduction to the Astronaut".
The doctor Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) became a large propagator of astronomy and astronomy.
He published hundreds of articles in Poland newspapers and wrote many books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski has become a propagator of the world's rename astronautic, and its contribution was particularly rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of the clathers of the Moon's hidden face.
Since 1925, a drainline was built in Poland to be equipped with a fuse engine.
Unfortunately, no author or details of this project are known.
It is not clear yet if the shooting should serve to propulse or shrink the dryine.
The only information known about this dryline is those of the press of the time.
From 1933, the Polandic artillery began to dedicate to smokes.
The research was conducted by the Comorka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
The Commission reports that this investigation had reached the test stage.
Of course, with the arrival of the German army, research has been interrupted.
In 1937, the plans of an electric shooting shooting, drawn by the engineer Rohozičski, appeared in the specialized press, and the next year was published the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by a author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
These two projects finally had a military use of smoking engines.
Just before the war, all the projects for the use of fusion technology were conducted by the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczawy Committee Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all the works.
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the start of the war with the end of its activities.
After the war, other works dedicated to the aircraft were published in the Poland press, thanks to the Polish Astronaut Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, it is a company in the number of November 1954, in which four more detailed items are provided to the aircraft.
In one of these articles, written by Professor Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a company dedicated to the astronomy.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that the area of space research had the future.
At the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronaut Society (PTA) has made efforts to enter into the International Astronaut Federation (building in 1951) and after the autom, the PTA became a regular member.
The next year, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), Kazimierz Zarankiewicz, became Vice-President of the International Astronaut Federation.
He maintained his function until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA will contribute significantly to the crooned development of RM meteorological fusion (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polandese fuse to perform scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch was held on 10 October 1958.
This smoke of a 1800 meters was a length of 80 cm and weighted less than 5 kg.
The following was built a improved version, RM-1A, and, during the summer 1959 flight tests at two floors RM-2 were engaged in the wilderness of Bledov.
This fuse had a length of 1,4 m and probably weighted 11,5 kg.
The following prototype should be able to perform concrete scientific works - the RM-34 fuse should have a portion up to 14.5 km and serve to observe the wind in height.
But in 1963, all development works were stopped.
The Meteor-1 fused during the period 1962 - 1965, succeeded in the first RM type fusions.
The fuse, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and a initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (named Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they differed from the sizes of the space reserved to scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A fuse had a space of 0.4 litre volume, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 litre and in Meteor-1C of 0.62 litre.
The maximum portion of all these types of start was 37 km.
During the 1965-1968 period, Meteor-2 fusions were set at the aircraft Institute, the first flight tests started in October 1970.
Meteor-2 was a initial weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a useful load of 10 kg to a height of approximately 60 km.
Then the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
Poland's entry to COSPAR (Commission for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of a CAPAR national committee two years later.
In the Interkosmos programme, Poland also participated in the space exploitation on artificial soviet satellites, and in 1978, pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimír Remek, the second non-soviet cosmonaut of this programme.
The abrogation of the law on public use work is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court abolished the law on public use.
This decision highlighted a life-debat in the public view.
It is no doubt interesting to consider this issue of a broader point of view.
Economic systems towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalization are based on the principle of more non-regulated economic competitiveness.
This means concretely that the different economic entities and national economic systems are constantly conflicted with each other.
This results in the principle of freedom of trade and free movement (less limited) of private capital associated with an unexpected financial speculation.
The considerable differences of the work price (payments) generated a price tension.
In this term, the following meaning should be made: a producer is endeavoured by the import of goods sold to residue economic competition by " making the competitor's price more valuable " in order to remove a larger part of the market and thus increase its own benefits.
This means for most enterprises: transfer to foreign production, buy at low price, or disappear, and the result is an important unemployment in countries where the prices of work are higher than other economies.
As the private capital has no responsibility for social views, and the responsibility for the unemployment that it is inherited, the social charges of the State are necessaryly increased.
All this situation intensifys the perfect wicked will of employees to pay taxes and thus compensate the economic and social damage caused by the whole society by this course.
This situation is at this point of public notority that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
Privacy-capital practices generate in different economies a situation in which governments of the different countries are committed to start in a mutual competitiveness in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population in order to attract their homes to the foreign capital.
In other words, Governments put their own population to the good of the private capital without taking into account social expansion.
This is mainly expressed in the amendments of the laws in force.
The goal is to impose its own population to accept the dictatory of the privacy capital prices, in particular in the field of salary.
This results from a system of economic countervailing in long-term unemployment and, on the other hand, by restricting the rights of employees in the field of labour legislation.
It results in growing poverty and the deepening of differences between rich and poor.
In RFA, there have been years of public food distribution points for poor people who can't respond to their needs with their own work.
The number of these people is already accounted for millions.
In the context of the increased competitiveness of the German economy, it is realized that employees receive such payments that the State is able to pay a supplement to achieve the minimum vitality.
For example, such a scandale was updated in the case of employees working as assistants in the Federal Parliament.
Nevertheless, the economic measures of almost all the Southern EU Member States generate a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a disaster of society, people are bound to emigrate or (such as the smoke in the 19th century), or to live with poor salts, at the margin of the society, in hope that a day the private capital is invested in their country.
The following question is to be taken here: where will this capital come?
If it comes from other EU countries, poverty will go from one country to another; this capital may not come anymore, or a Chinese, Indian, Brazil, a Turkey, a Marocain, an Egyptian or African will continue to work for a fraction of an European salary.
This also concerns the whole Latin America.
The liberal theory and media argued that the State cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the leading economy leads to an economic disaster.
The private capital defendes the idea that the State cannot enter into the economy by regulatory interventions.
It must then be asked whether the private capital does not influence and even today does not lead, according to its own selfish interests, policy and the whole State.
The answer to this question is no doubt.
The evidence is that there is practically powerful and present lobby in all States.
It results in a deceased situation in corruption, through mutual advantages, in legislation, where everything is condemnable but not punishable.
In RFA, the situation is such, as due to the lack of financial means, national delegates the development of law projects with closely related lawyers.
These legislative projects are then adopted at the Federal Tag.
The totality of the power is not from the people, as the Constitutions of Western Type declares, but of powerful financial groups serve their own interests.
It is clear that the democracy directed to liberalism is now soon faced with the situation described by Appianos in its book entitled "The Roman Empire Crisis at the time of César and Pompée": "the State has been in full delicacy and the functions were assigned by violence.
The powders, the favorites obtained illegally, and the stones and swords were also used to obtain these posts.
The under-detail and corruption would be proliferated without limits and the people were making elections with already sold voices... "The honest people do not want to get functions, it would result once the State remained unconsulted for 8 months."... "There is really starting to say that the relief to this difficult situation was an autocracy and that it had to be chosen an energetic man"... It is true that Africans had the Spirit Pompe, but it is Caesar that turned irreversibly democracy into absolutist regime.
In conclusion, as in the antiquity, the present society is based on the preference of personal benefit, without regard to the interest of society in its entirety.
In its substance, the private capital is no longer able to understand and value the interests of society in its entirety.
It has resulted, as the other time, of a decade without previous eleites, without any effort to carry out deep reforms.
We should therefore search for the causes of emergency of fascists and communist regimes in the free-scale liberalization of the economic systems of the XIX and XX century.
In the current state of things, the disappearance of these systems can be considered by the benefit of liberal democraties as a kind of suspension before a new step.
The fact that the current eleites fully ignore the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future losses in human life, the humanitarian and social crisis we are today witnesses, as well as the crimes against humanity, such as we know them from ancient and recent history.
The abrogation of the law on public use work is not a solution, at least long-term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both at the international and at the internal level of the European level, the Government of the Czech Republic will continue to search for means to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is systematic.
The solution consists of sociopolitical reforms, which will strengthen State capital investments in the economy, will increase the influence of citizens in the government and enhance the position of the private capital in society for the benefit of the State.
Israel: chaos laboratory.
"Neither will come out of violence and never be able to" says Sting in the song titled Fragile, whose main top of repair is "no forgets how fragile we are."
"If my son wouldn't want wars, there wouldn't be there," said Gutel Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on his death bed in 1849.
Following the last vague of violence between Israel and Gaza flag, as normally, many reactions have been higher.
Some take the party of Israel, arguing its right to self-defense and putting Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support Palestinians, calling on the racism of Israel's State, the genocide committed against Palestinian Arabs and considering Israel as a terrorist state.
I don't want to think about the question of knowing who is guilty and who is victim in his recurrent murder vagues; overall, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomy territories, are born in this political situation and have not lived in the start of violence.
I would like to offer readers a point of view that is "turn the rideau" about the whose mainly benefits of tensions that have been lost for more than 95 years (of Balfur's Declaration in 1917) in a small bout of Middle Eastern countries.
Some of these reflections are supported by historical facts for the study, others are of my own understanding of that, or more exactly of the individual group, which is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
Humanity's history is mostly the history of a fight for power.
Every time, we can find a Alexandre the Great or a Napoleon.
This is not so obvious to know whether these individuals act independently or if they had to do their throne acts to someone who directed their acts on the basis of previously defined objectives.
We must admit that we live at a time when the world's riches are connected between the hands of some individuals and that this financial concentration that generates certain powers could not be done during a single generation.
Among the families with astronomic riches is particularly different the Rothschild family, which could be considered as the head of the skin (I don't know if these families have a leader but I do not exclude).
Peak is written about them.
All right.
Since the 1990s of the 19th century, they acquired the first World Press Agency (Reuters) to put an end to the establishment of links between their name and serious criminal acts to which they were matured and which had always meaning for them strengthening their power, increased their happiness or both.
They have major participations in nearly the majority of the world's central banks and prepare or bring wars against countries where they have not yet been involved (for the invasion of Afghanistan, the number of these countries were 7, after the Iraqi invasion of 5 after the Kadhafi's reverse of only 4 years of Russia had placed the Russian Central Bank under the control of the Russian government).
Everyone who tried to fight against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Central Bank at the Bank of America of Rothschild and began to evacuate his own money during civil war (governmental, I hear well) and was killed in a theater in 1865.
JFK began to evacuate the own money and wanted to disappear the EDF, he was murdered in 1963, Mr. Louis McFadden was empowered in 1936, while he wanted to try to make a case against the EDF to have deployed the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their soif power at the world level led in the 1859-1871s to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a smooth French launched at the 33th degree, as the highest level.
The first war was aimed to eliminate the greatest state monarchies of Europe, the second should remove colonialism, including British, and the third should reduce the global population between 1 and 0.5 billion individuals (as a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), creating a unique universal religion (ocumenism is nothing else than the love of such solution) and finally obtaining a absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the most rich families with their heads is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the following order).
These solutions are false and are always leading to a degree of the situation (see the establishment of the EDF aimed at avoiding the recurrence of crises such as those caused in 1907).
After the success of the first world war by the murderer in Sarajevo de Ferdinand, Habsbourg in the Austro-Hungary Throne, they destroyed Russian tsarist by causing bourchy revolution.
The first world war was slowly completed by a German capitalisation without economic and military justifications (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Tsirist Russia) and was followed by the Mortific Austria and Hungary, Central Europe.
For a more easy deployment of the second world war, bankingers left political leaders to create a late conflict situation: they have, on one hand, put to Germany for a faminous war reparations that generate the conditions of radicalization of the appeal masses (they are sufficiently putting a sufficient energy leader, showing the deal of accusable, proposing simple solutions) and, on the other hand, establishing a Czechoslovakia composed of various nationalities, including a strong German minority that played the role (which effectively) of the fifth pillar to put fire to the pool and declare war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothsköl inspired the creation of the sionist movement, including one of the branches aspiring to the creation of a Jewish State, of preference in the region of the historical Jewish region with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The above Declaration of Balfour sets the basis for a massive Jews migration to Palestine and the first flights with the Arab local population began.
Terrorism acts were made by the other part.
The second world war is difficult to see if Hitler has cut the chains in which the international bankers had initially held it; or if everything he had done was planned, the fact is that the suffering of the Jews in the concentration camps created the basis for accepting a Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; as the war repairs in Germany were originating in the second world war, Israel's foundation of the state of Israel had a fire home that could cause a third world war.
If international bankers can start this war, the Jewish population will be like it during the Second World War, the first victim of the battles, as well as the Arab or generally Islamic population in the Middle East.
Israel is like a great laboratory, the source of discorde and chaos, not only in this country, but at the international level (to see how people are breathly divided between the parties and the defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is victim of Israel and Palestinian conflict, where a torment generates another torment according to a circle of unfinished violence and where, as a result of all, the cupidity of certain individuals and their desire to obtain the power over the whole world?
The difference between the simple citizens of Israel and their leaders must be done here, because as in our home, international bankingers do not propose people to electoral only their own candidates.
The current first minister of Israel is a typical example of political, loyal to international bankers, which makes everything to initiate a war with Iran, which could, due to the accession of this country to the Shanghai cooperation organization (Chine, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) being extended to become a global conflict and, as Iron controlled Ormud by which 20 per cent of the global oil (the naval corridor has only a wide range of 2 thousand) and leads to a destruction of global economy.
It appears now on the proposals made by David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population is serving an aristocrats of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every new birth is seen to birth an electronic pocket that makes it a completely controlled being.
"If they bound all individuals, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves to bring a mark on the hand or front, so that he can't buy no one who does not sell the name of this ferroce beast or the number of his name.
It must be understood: that those who have good sense account for the numbers of this ferroce beast.
This number names the man and it's six hundred sixty."
Argo film: When everything goes worse, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a number of Islamic students were composed of the American Ambassador of Teheran, which was struck by 52 diplomatic students.
They should be freed by Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, went to the United States, which supported his regime for several decades.
The situation was not offered to the American Administration of Positive Success, and it could actually not abandon Shah, because it would seriously strike the confidence of its partners in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had been delayed on the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was not able to obtain the release of otages.
It was a hard cut for the United States prestigious, and later aggressively aggressively by the failure of the attempt to pursue struggles by force.
The sequent diplomates were finally released 444 days later, following the negotiations organized by the Algerian Government.
Their exhibition involves the United States a vague of solidarity and an anti-iranic feeling.
The Iranian devaluation has strongly contributed to the defect of Jimmy Carter faced Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The Argo film, from the actor and putting the Ben Appleck scene, describes an episode of this story that offers a small victory in America.
Only before she was busy, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After complicated perceptions, they found themselves in the residence of the Ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA arrived to make them out from Iran thanks to a rocky cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as a member of a touring team to make retreats for the touring of a large spectacle of science-fiction film.
Gender combination
Tony Mendez's expert plan requires the collaboration of Hollywood.
In order to make the most credible legend, specialized shops took the status of this film project, press conferences were organized and a fixed production company of real offices.
The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, the film is based on Tony Mendez's memorys.
Affleck's film is an insolent combination of several kinds.
It is part of a realistic political stripper designed as well as a "moking cap", the account of a success, of a traithry - for example, in the Ocean's eleven, twenty and thirty-five trilogia.
The environments succeed: the sequences of Teheran of documentary style (from subtitled sequences are presented with iconic pictures of the time of events and the way, through these photos, the same situations have been rediscreted in the film, there are no major differences);
less lower passes of Hollywood, treated with iron and a little bit of exaggeration,
and then scenes from the CIA General District and other institutions with consumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in ballers and on phone...
Ben Appleck has succeeded to restart his carrière in a marvelous way.
From a ridiculated actor, it became a respected scene metal and his actor game stopped to highlight iranic comments.
Argo is his third long-term metro after the police shadow "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the "The city" (2010).
It's also the first film of Afleck, which does not start in his original city, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the features that placed its first films above the Hollywood standards.
Appleck also shows this sense of the atmosphere in Argo where the role of Teheran is "joined" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film are launched in streets, during the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the embassy's fall is impressed by its clearness that also suggests the confusion and inconsiderability that happens when, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Spleck and its collaborators have an analogy effect in the fixed scenes (the false turning team in the Teheran's ball).
Too many locations
The scene Metaphor had to satisfy a subject offering only a few palpitants scenes, in the cinematographic sense of the term.
It seems very well, sometimes adds some elements to the reality, and there is not always so elegant (the scene in which the crisis threat to the Teheran airport is cut off by a phone cut in America, and the continued shoes on the shoes are shocked sufficiently).
The lowness of Argo resides in its dismissed character, due to the need to show too many different events.
If it's true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their role of Hollywood co-operators, their personalities would be a larger place and they're not, far from there, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's movie misses a little dramatic tension, he leaves to see with a moderate interest by appreciation of the achievement and the back style of the 70s.
He leads the spectrum, but with difficultness.
As a reminder of a story still, in a certain manner that is incapaciated to this day, and as a illustration of the exagerate character of the representation of secret services as omnipotents and all-known, it is the case.
Rules for gonfling balls, bananas and circles
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which takes each year a public survey on the most absolute banking costs, has now decided to start the support of the regulation or ideas from the most absolute EU poster.
"The fact that the EU thinks, in recent times, of adopting a quota of 40 per cent of women for large European enterprises was original to our decision," said the Pravo newspaper, the organizer of this investigation, Patrik Suer.
Among the absurdness mentioned, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify the insurance premiums for men and women.
Eventually, women were benefited for life insurance rates because they are objectively representing a less risk for insurance companies.
People can sign up to the end of the year any other unbelievable idea of the EU's stage.
"The vote will be held before the end of February 2013", reported Nacher.
The EU's controversial regulations, for example, are the obligation to add bio components to fuel, which have weakened consequences for the environment, or the prohibition of use of fiable mercury thermometers, only because they contain relatively low amount of a dangerous substance or even the directive on the size of powders, which affected the increase in the price of eggs.
The past has also been issued criticism against the prohibition of using the expression "bourre to tartiner" or the retreat of the sale of classic ampoules.
Quality bananas must have a size of 14 centimeters.
The European Administration often responds to the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby whose applications are normally defended in Brussels by a State or a group of States (as well as the Czech Republic currently implies the requests of its banks by threatening to use its veto right).
The interests of the pressure groups, for example, are also due to the fact that bananas should not be lower than 14 cm or to present a "anormal corner".
The European Commission was defended by argumenting that it was only to harmonize non-homogeneous national standards that complicated the trade.
The standards on fruit and vegetables have been implemented, despite the opposition of certain States, which claims that existing directives lead to a gaspillage of foodstuffs.
The first price may be issued in this investigation to the Regulation of the EU last year, which must be reported on tangible balls a warning indicated that children under eight years do not have to join without adult surveillance.
The EU refers to an American investigation that the balls are among the games the first cause of children’s death by storm.
A similar restriction applies to children under 14 years of age to suffer in skin skins.
We also have some weird ideas.
The following rules regarding European officials themselves is absolutely absurd: due to the sensitivity of this topic for Greece, any person who has an official function within the EU cannot use the "Macedonia" and must, on the other hand, speak of FYROM (Forme Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the "Lass Faire" association with free economysts, the Bankovnípoplatky.com service was appointed in this investigation, in addition to certain absurdities mentioned above, the EU Regulation on the volume of food reserves in the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had fixed maximum volumes for food reserves that could be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our membership to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volumes set for the chain in the preserving and risked, in fact, a deeply amended.
The organizations of this investigation considered interesting the idea of paying money to some countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant for granting subsidies.
However, these ideas are not originating in Brussels but in Prague.
"The fact that we have no sea is disabled.
We will ask the European Union for a reimbursement." Thus, in 2004, the Minister of Agriculture in the time Jaroslav Palas (Yahroslav Palas) expressed.
He argued that, due to our bleeding production, the State was recovered with full stocks that he had to then export.
According to Palas, the EU had to pay us millions of euros because the Czech Republic is far away from ports.
Finally, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech demand and organized a call for offers for the purchase of bottle from countries without maritime access.
The subsidies for the obtaining of grants were proposed by the Ministry of Local Development addressed by Minister Pavel Nśmec (EU-DEU), which should, in concretely, be used to prepare subventions requests granted by Brussels.
The EU states: "Weird regulations are rare."
If the regulations are often critical in Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the functionality of the Union, as well as in the field of its general development, are employed in place.
For example, it is more serious, according to experts, the problem of the use of EU subsidies for projects that have absolutely nothing to see with the strengthening of European integration, but which was imposed by Member States during the budgetary negotiations.
The fact that Czech Republic, such as other countries of the Union, is struggling in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (which is not always winning) causes emotions in the Czechs.
If in the end of six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomoucké tvarśky" for the call "Tuzmskу rum" which retreats with us in the 19th century, our producers had to replace it by the name "Tuzmák".
Only cancer sugar products, and not on the basis of improvement sugar, can the designation of rhum.
In the official list of the EU registered products, there is now a company of worldwidely known fertilizers such as Feta or Gorgonzola, Lübeck's masspane or Parme's footboat, the carpets of Karlovy Vary ("calovarské"), Pohoṣṭelic and Tśebo (Pohoṣṭelickī a Tśeboský capr") and the slaughter of śatec ("chmell").
Pardubice's epic bread (Pardubickī pernic) and the garages called "Hośice Cornets" may also be proud of their Community mark.
People want me to save the Republic, but I am only a amateur, Mr Okamura stated.
Mr. Senator, how do we have the idea of presenting the Presidential elections?
It's not to be Senator or President that accounts for me.
If everything worked without problems in our country, I would not be a candidate anywhere.
But I don't support to see how the country has been thrown since the last twenty-five years, that the fleeters are not under the cuts and taxes and the age of the departure.
I had no ambition to become political.
But when I see something that doesn't ask me, then I try to make a solution to change it.
And as I have over 40 years and that I am independent, no party member, I have no other solutions to influence the situation that I have to present to the presidential or senatoral elections.
You've entered the Senate, but you're fast on the road for the Chasseau (N.d.T.: presidency seat).
Doesn't you turn that way to those who chose you?
I always said I will start in the battle for the Chateau in accordance with the results of the senatoral elections
Then I explained that if I was elected by Senator, I would present the presidential elections.
My purpose is not the function, this is only a tool that I can achieve my vision.
That is why I need the largest influence and the largest mandate.
The problem is not only as a nation we return to the bar or before our television post, but we also ask all those who try to make changes.
This adds the press that casts the reputation of people and confusions the freedom of word with the freedom of lie.
For example, I have stated that I support journalists or that I have been Jiśí Paroubek's adviser.
Let's come to your visions.
You have undertaken the fight against the Chateau with the subjects of material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive fiscal statements beyond twenty-five million [CZK].
You must change the law in this way.
As President, you do not have such power and only the Senate in its entirety can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I was a citizen, I made pressure to make tourism guide activities a liberal professional, I gained a cause.
The problem is the policy: when someone arrives from the left or right with a good project, it is quite rejected and it delays the citizens.
As an independent member of no party, I have much more chance to obtain support of all Parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of power, without categorization and partisan dogma, to take from each party what is best for our country and to apply it.
You're going to be a man of right or left?
From a Czech point of view, I have the impression that people put me on the left.
For me, that it's a little left or right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we were going out of the front.
What I mean is not that people are left or right, but assembling people.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common well, even though it is proposed by the Communist Party or the ODS and I did so impartially against bad ideas.
Do you think you're angry when someone tells you that you're a popularist?
But what you said not prove it?
When you develop a planned business in a business, you also have a certain best goal and a vision.
You're trying to get closer.
Some may call this about popularism, but all the proposals I have spoken have been implemented by the world and the recognized experts.
But without the Parliament's support, you are only slogans.
You're not going to survive long in policy with that.
Do you think that if you go to see people and talk to them, you can, for example, impose material and criminal responsibility?
I don't have any other option.
I must be convinced by politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to raise them into my camp in order to put it into place.
If I was elected by the President, it would not be a problem to send my request to the Presidents of the parliamentary parties to legitimate the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, officials, judges and lawyers.
Then they should explain why they do not want it.
If there is a strong personality that identifys abuse, it will be possible to pressure on the political scene.
For example, take the election of the President to the direct suffrage, which has been obtained by the press of the public opinion.
I admit, without embassy, to be an amateur, not a genie or a intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I have been launching politically, and I try to get the support of the majority for my program.
I'm trying to advance things alone, and if it doesn't go, I'll stop in six years and I'll go back in the private sector.
It's a little like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that one person can't do the difference, so I'm going to see a number of personalities to ask them to also present the senatoral elections.
I met Radin Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
I, at least, supported the research journalist Jana Lorencova who revealed fraud at Saturday.
I was presented to me because people are really incontinent, but now I'm hospitable.
Six percent of people have not voted and what they did mostly gave their voice to a representative of the stablishment.
We are only two independents in Senate.
People have chosen a Senate that could difficultly imply changes.
Despite all, I will fight for my vision, for example, the election in the direct demand of maritimes and region preferences.
Are you thinking of founding your own party?
No, not yet, because I have no time to check if the past of each potential member is unfavourable and then I have no financial means.
I have no more money for my presidential campaign, I have just twenty thousand on my "transparent account.
You don't have money?
You're talking about fiscal statements, what's your?
I consider about 60 million the value of my personal goods.
I have in Prague a terrain of a value of 25 million, a apartment of a ten million, another apartment valuable with 8 million, an art work collection of about 10 million, a Aston Martin that values 3,5 million and a skoda Superb value of 1 million and a few million on my account.
I have a Aston Martin, because it was a child's dream: I always loved James Bond, who runs in the car, was galactic with women and fighted against the evil and abuse.
You run in Aston Martin, you have a patrimonie of a value of 60 million and you don't have money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but don't you want to invest your own money?
It isn't very convinced.
I don't have 15 million for this campaign.
Should I tell me?
I have already invested 2 million and half in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsor shows well that my program is not a great interest.
I don't have the obligation to pay this campaign of my pocket.
My campaign costs are globally covered by the reward that I receive as Senator.
But I couldn't live, for example, pay the English school of my son that costs 300,000 per month.
If my only goal was to win the money, I will not present any election.
So you will continue your business activities to live?
Have you not stated that you would put your activities in sweetness?
But this is not linked to the amount of this payment.
As I promised it, I was partly reducing my activities.
For example, my adjoint will take the direction of the travel agency in spring.
People want me to be a Samaritan who save the Republic.
But I have to live with something.
What was your usual month salary when you were entrepreneur?
I won and I continue to win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I was the President, I would end my business activities.
You will find this interview in the Sunday edition of the Prava newspaper.
The architectes of the MVRDV office show that the real adventures are not only a imagination case. To convince it, it is enough to convey Spijkenisse and the mountain of newly established books - 2 photos
"I think that this building is marvelous, he makes very future, finally something interesting to see," Lisette Verhaig, a passenger on the lowest coast of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computerist in a great neighbor company, said to us, "Yes, it's really nice, this building."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has Internet, a iPad and e-books.
Today, nobody else goes fully in one of these ringard libraries, isn't it?
Spijkenisse, a village town that has nothing to cross the doors of Rotterdam, has a very special record.
The community of 80,000 souls shows the weakest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to give some neurons to the brain, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and to reproduce the seven fixed bridges that contain the euro tickets in the form of sweet small sweet sweet beton.
The success of cultural offence has remained limited.
So the city authorities found that there was only one way to get the hand on statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, from the Rotterdam MVRDV architects office, was the manager of sweet and fully-speed and often cynic buildings, accepted the project with its usual flag and was presented in 2003 with five books under the arms and a switch on the face.
And while the jury members looked again, deconcerted and shocked, Maas, faced it, completed his books of choice by order to make a pyramid, and ended his talks with active arguments by a: "Community girl!"
This is my proposal for the Spijkenisse Mountains, or, as you say, the Boekenberg!
9 years later, the mountain of EUR 30 million has been cast out of the ground.
The building is included in a revitalization project also includes a subterranean parking, a supermarket, a post office and a few mixed buildings and houses for a total of 50 rooms.
Start November, the book mountain received the second price "Best Library of NL 2012".
Moreover, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is how this small tern bourgade, which until now has nothing more to offer only a postmodern area and a swimming layer of a white façade, which invites them to think that they open a lattery, is enriched by a modern architecture work.
The most important is that Spijkenisse has now the first public cultural building of his history.
The long way to read
First impression: Eldorado of the book under thickness ring.
Of course, a staircase transports you to the heart of the massif, but the real joy of reading and architecture will open to you when you gather the ground of the building to discover its topography.
The whole internal drink is light and clear, the land in Dutch and the electrical revergence speak without equivalence the language of the municipal public places.
Urban atmosphere is perfect.
We're already looking for public banks, dogs and little kids and girls playing at the bathroom.
And all books, books and books.
" Normally, library radios are along the façade and in the middle are a large and dark room, which is often unconfortable and unpersonal," explains Willy Maas.
We have completely buried the classic space configuration and opened internal read spaces to outside.
The inside of the book mountain has been adjusted: the offices, the Internet library, the missing club, the environment center and the building's technical center.
A special beauty resides in the black rays of the library, which are soon lambris, soon balls, soon scatter lamps.
A new experience for the view, touching him and shoot it.
Even architects and engineers of the enduring building do not want unknown materials.
"We want to work with recycling materials", says Joop Trouborst, the head of the project at the community of Spijkenisse, in an answer to the Standard.
This is how one day we found in a cold agricultural company a ad hoc waste from the agriculture.
In the Netherlands, the synthetic membrane of a millimeter of escapes is used as substrate in the shoes and fields for years.
It's a good market, and we're winning time.
The membrane end is used for one or two seasons, then we can cast it.
For the library, the membrane was included, for the first time in such quantities, in plates of a four-cent centimeter spacing.
Under the effect of heat and pressure, the " Landbauplastic " (KPL) color changes and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, including a new car and sport chains.
On the top of the 105 walks there is the top of the mountain.
At about 500 metres, literary coffee offers us an impressive view on the city, but also the Dutch crochets and pool ficus.
They create an atmosphere, but especially contribute to the maintenance of the ideal level of humidity of the literary mountain.
Gifts for the New Heart
"It's incredible, but despite all the surfaces of view, this building is a ecological model project", says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is regulated by geotherapy.
While the mountain of books is located under a glass wheel, the sun illuminates just a little time inside, even the beautiful days of time.
The wooden powders mounted through comparison to the green façade serve for sun, intercepting a large part of the radios.
The environmental atmosphere is very pleasant.
The totally automated stores are loaded from the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the above-mentioned seventh intelligence, has already been risked to enter into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already here.
Cynthia Bogarde, a traditional Chinese physician professor, describes even the Boekenberg as "the finally found soul" of Spijkenisse.
A few weeks ago, during the anauguration, every citizen was invited to give a book from his personal library.
This measure allowed to compose the empty of the library that was not yet completely guaranteed (which accounted for 70,000 books).
The concept is a success.
Radios are out of all parts.
For architect Winy Maas, " there's nothing worse than a widespread library."
"I think that our invitation has created a certain relationship between each citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's only for decoration."
This is how MVRDV has reached the master's discipline, called, in the professional garden, "the creation of identity".
Spijkenisse wrote a new page of literary history.
Even if it can appear young and little educated.
This is finally a new start point for the birth of identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a greater role."
Germany has chosen the abstention during the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, the expert of relations between the United States and the EU, this decision puts Berlin into a delicate political situation.
German Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had announced its intention to vote against the request of Palestinians to obtain the observer state status to the United Nations.
But then she chose the abstention.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve what the Israelites did in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be careful, since it has special relations with Israel.
But I also think that it does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to affirm its independence, however, to be too critical towards Israel.
In the insurance in Libya of March 2011, Germany also chose the abstention in the vote on the establishment of an air exclusion zone.
Finally, NATO implies this measure.
Is Germany difficult to adopt a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason is that Berlin is in revision of its external policy, trying to get away from a policy to thus defined by the Americans and to establish a German external policy.
Furthermore, the lack of coherent and common policies within the Union complies the situation.
The Germans therefore have a number of fronts.
We are waiting for them that they play a more independent role, but they have not been used there.
I think they still thorough to find this role, but they are on the way of a foreign policy "more normal".
A external policy, such as in France or Great Britain
What then exactly means the term "normal" for the Germans?
It shows the will of adopting independent positions of the United States and European partners, including in respect of national documents.
I think the German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, therefore by exports and relations with certain regions such as Russia, China or the Near East.
Germany's economic interests are in a certain measure different from those of the other major powers: this is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests affected Germany's position in view of conflict in the Near East and abstention during the vote of the United Nations?
Germany first has major importance in the Near East, especially in the Golf countries.
This is why Berlin must be guarded not to harm public opinion, but also to the elites of the Arab countries.
There is no doubt that it is a determinant element.
However, I would not agree to be too important because it is not just a single relationship.
But in any case, it is a determinant element in German strategic reflections.
Is Germany at night with his relationships with the United States by choosing abstention when important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think Europeans and Americans are perfectly understood by the German position.
That is why I think that fraction is not so serious that it was in the case of Libyan matter.
It may even be more respected by Germany.
Indeed, Germany demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests should be taken into account.
In Europe, the opinions on the Palestinian initiative are different.
On the contrary, the United States announced their voice of a clear voice.
Do these opinions differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences because of the American internal political scene.
I believe that the Obama Administration makes a secret evidence of a great understanding towards the European position.
But in view of the country ' s political configuration, the Government cannot, of course, defend its position publicly.
I think the real differences of opinions are not so large that they always seem to be.
If you look at the relationships between Obama and the first Israeli minister Netanyahou, you will not bear in mind that Obama is far away of enthusiasm towards Netanyahou's policy.
Is Germany difficult to conciliate its close relationships with Israel and the United States, on one hand, with the position of the large European partners, on the other hand?
I think that's not easy for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little more simpler for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, but today, it is not the case.
They cannot therefore be included in a broader political line and must confirm their unique position.
That is what they do today in the question of the euro.
In my view, Germany will take the future a role of locomotive and encourage Europe to adopt a European position.
This is not simple for Germany, in particular because of the relationship with Israel.
This question has always been delicate.
But I think that the Germans are well aware of the fact that they must play a role that marks more their independence.
Germany is seeing to play a role of weight actors on the international scene, would Germany only want to play a key role?
Or is it still difficult to play first plan roles?
Germany has not always been habitat, and it is still uncomfortable and, for obviously, the country has always tried to play a more important role.
For example, if we look at the euro crisis, it is noted that, at every time Germany decides to worry more, many anti-American feelings are heard.
This doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
In fact, it is always the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Germany is in a very delicate position than the United States.
It must compose with neighbors and very different opinions, and it is not easy.
Today, the impact of the United States on European policy is only to reduce, but now the EU does not match this empty, then who is it?
The Germans will simply play a more important role.
And even if it's not pleased to them, even if it's unpleasant to them and if they are just less appreciated, it's life!

"Marke Protection" in China: when Puma and Armani becomes suddenly Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are known marks around the world.
Armani Polo... what's really the matter?
Next this name is hidden an officially put mark in China, but that has nothing to see with the original company.
The brand played such a protection as the company that carries the name cannot be complained.
And even if she could, it is not sure that she would win the cause.
"There is more difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," explains Thomas Pattloch, lawyer at the officer Taylor Wessing specialized in violation of the right of ownership in the Eastern East.
Each week, a new file arrives on my office.
The imitators need only a few additional letters to be able to register their brands.
Thus, instead of Gucci, we register Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, we register Prada-Kny.
German enterprises are also copyed into all the legal equality, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sports articles.
Pattloch opens a class in which the records are made at the Pekin Marks Office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company posted the Zegna DF Puma mark, a firm name which was artificially created by a part of the name of Herménegildo Zegna, the mode house.
This is a known fact that the Chineses have become the champions of the world of copy and the violation of the intellectual property.
In the large cities, commercial centres are found at several floors that are only sale in contrafactures.
However, the cases of Pattloch are different: his employees are loading to attack the fact that the Chinese mark office officials officially confers to Chinese companies the right to use a namement that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speaks of "Bang Mingpai" of the parent mark.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
It is with that term named women who are married to rich men.
Chinese authorities say nothing to reprove.
"That's bad for business, it must be fighting against this tendency", requires Pattloch.
"The brand is edulcorated, the uniqueness is disappeared, the reputation discounts are great."
Financial losses and justice costs are counted in millions for the sectors concerned, especially in respect of cost-free farm products.
According to the CLSA market analysis company data, China represents, with an annual volume of EUR 15 billion, the third global market of luxury products and the most rapidly developed world market.
However, it is not easy to raise the suspicious records of the mark register and costs these procedures.
These lasts can durze up to nine years, and the waste is never certain.
Pattloch reported the cases in which the court rejected the complaint, as after a long period, the criticized designation became a "reality of the market".
Pattloch explains that if the complainant has no chance, it may even be obliged to pay the money in the plagiary, because he would be naked to his mark in China.
In this area, it's sometimes the law of the jewelry that dominates.
Religious cases are also related to graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the Sany chanter machine manufacturer, the same company that came to save the manufacturer of beton Putzmeister pumps.
That's the reason why Chineses can use a emblem that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, the purchaser of Volvo, used before a blue and white logo that remembered BMW's. The conflict was resolved and Geely had to modify it.
The Lacoste Model House had lost against the Pragiers of Hong Kong and Singapore who had reorientated the view of the famous Crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of nothing.
However, the CTMO Marks Office in Peking admits some difficulties in 2010 because of the lack of personnel and space.
However, the office would be held last year of a "emergy situation in the labour movement to a recovered normality".
Thus, the number of non-trained opposition procedures would have decreased by 22%.
About 57.000 cases of this type would have been closed, which represents an increase of 75 per cent compared to the previous year.
However, 81.500 procedures remain in the office.
Cost action
As often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1,4 million mark deposit requests, almost a third of which was more than 2010.
According to the Office, it is a record and this means that China is the tenth consecutive of the classification for the number of new deposites in the world.
This would also be for the total number of legal marks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the office had accounted for 1.8 billion yuan registration law.
In other words, each record reported in average EUR 1,280 yuan, or EUR 160.
A more legal battle costs, such as shows the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For over seven years, the company fights against a Chinese plagiary.
Of course, the Germans have obtained that the illegal manufacture of vehicle components was suspended.
However, the employer was able to maintain his Chinese rights on the Freudenberg mark.
"This is our fault, because family names cannot be protected in Germany," she explains, Hanno Wentzler, President of the Director of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Marks Office therefore rejected the objection of the Munich.
Freudenberg certainly gained a cause from the following two institutions, but the opposite party continues to fight until now.
Monitoring is being placed
Today, the case is in possession with the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is trusting, he believes in a positive issue of the case and benefits the professionalism of the judges.
However, he adds: "The procedure is long, tried and costs much time and money."
It is also difficult to evaluate the internal costs. Archive services had even to review the acts of the last hundred years to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg had even proposed a "grand sum in euros to six figures" to resolve the crime.
"This is what we see what this represents for us", says Wentzler.
The dangers of the Extreme-East are even threatening to disappear to Europe.
This would be the case if the imitators of this region would be the exploitation of non-protected marks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to put the name of Freudenberg in Germany for a chain and kitchen production company.
The company had long abandoned this sector, but has even been able to prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "The monitoring is deployed."
Pattloch and he advises German enterprises to prove a great carefulness in their trade relations with China.
In their view, it is not enough to fill the international trade law, foreigners should, instead, "register all that is possible to be protected", says Wentzler.
The costs may be much more important than those in the register.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses the battle during the last act of his legal drama, the company should pay license rights to the counterparty for the use of his own name, as explains Wentzler.
Or then, we lose our place on the market segment.
World Day of fight against AIDS: shooter of skin, sing, help
The Chorale Imbongi repeated in Heidelberg, and the AIDS orphans of Swaziland are joyful of their arrival.
This is the story of a link that is much more than a distance of 8,733 km.
First, we're shooting from the feet: cowboy boxes, baskets, scarpins for ladies and mocasins for men, and they're looking for the rythm in shocking the ground of the feet. They're so fast, they're finding it.
One, two, three, four.
Then, the voices of the songers are slow - high, low, dark, and above -, they take themselves, engage and follow.
Fiete Hopf, 29-year-old orchester head, almost lost his shoes of shoes when he directed the orchester with his sweets of a wild sweet.
We're lunch tonight, the Chorale Imbongi repeats a new song in the music room of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology.
Fifty songs and songs from 23 to 69 years of age have come from the genetics in human doctors at home.
"O'Obani" is not an easy piece, each chorist has different words, all in a very exotic language: the sallou, a language speaked by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some regions of Swaziland.
Be helped to help
UNSIDA, the United Nations AIDS-related programme, estimates that 34 million people around the world are attracted from disease.
23.5 million live in South Africa.
Swaziland accounts for 245,000 infections.
Furthermore, more than 40% of the population are severe.
180 orphelins of the AIDS village of Esitjeni found conversations in Germany thanks to the "Voices for Africa".
70 of them are frequently a secondary educational institution.
For 15 or 20 euros, it is possible to be parrained.
This sum guarantees money for school child, school uniform and warm daily food in the Gogo Centre.
Subscribe means in slaughtered "contor of stories" or even more "loyal songer".
Nobody can speak smoothly in this region, but everyone can sing it.
For nearly 10 years, the chorale repeats the songs in this foreign language that it has brought to Germany to make it to its native region: South Africa.
Because at 8,733 miles (8,733 km) from Heidelberg Island, in the Northwest of the Swaziland Kingdom, it is the village that depends on the vocabulary power of the German chorale.
40 per cent of persons reached
The village has about 2,000 people, some living in a modest swimming floor or land and most of them are children.
More than 300 are orphans, because HIV has brought their parents.
In Esitjeni, there can be a smaller scale of males that enable Swaziland: the highest HIV infection rate and the lowest life hope in the world according to UNICEF.
The population is almost never accepted by the male circumcision, a measure which, however, guarantees a decreased reduction of the risk of half-infection.
More than 40% of the population in Swaziland is carried out of immunodeficiency virus and it is not rare to die in the middle of the trend.
During a group journey in Africa in the spring 2005, the chariot was able to discover the village. The Imbongis especially saw many children in the street where he missed not only parents’ care but also all: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without school diploma, there is no prospect.
At the beginning, only some persons who were able to pay a few euros every year so that they could send a child to school and provide a warm food every day.
But until a year later, the chorole founded "Voices for Africa", a association that has been careful for almost professional ways of the AIDS orphans.
Failure on sexually transmissible infections
What are the most common sexually transmissible diseases?
Among bacterial ISTs, syphilis, chlamides and blennorragie (or gorgeate).
Current IST is HIV, human papillom virus, genetal herpes or hepatitis.
The powder and the galle belong to the parasitarian IST.
What are the mainly relevant groups?
Syphiliss and blennorragie often appears in men who have sexual relations with others.
The Robert-Koch Institute believes that sexual contacts between men are at least four cases of syphilis on five declared in Germany.
In the heterosexual adults, infections related to chlorides, trichomonase, candiosis (fogic), blennorragie and human papillome virus are commonly transmissible sexual diseases.
The inflation rate of HIV between heterous adults is relatively low in Germany, but some 20% of the new HIV infections are observed in this group.
In young people, there is a higher rate of infection related to chlamides than in other population groups.
According to European observers, the three quarters of all infections relate to youths from 15 to 25 years of age.
Moreover, in Germany, human papillome virus is common in youth.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not obliged to declare all sexually transmissible diseases.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of syphilis cases had been more than 10 years old: the number has been from 1.967 in 2001 to 3.698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections decreased.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of a tenth per relation to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of sexual disease?
Infectional diseases may cause abuses at the level of genetic organs, urinary pains, white losses, low wind pain, and the appearance of buttons and cuts.
However, they do not regularly cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How can you protect yourself?
Preservatives may reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason is that pathogenic agents of sexually transmissible diseases may also be transmitted by lubrifiant infection or by extreme corporate contacts.
As a result, experts recommend each person who often changes sexual partners to regularly review.
Most of the rapidly disappointed ISTs may be healed and late sequences can be avoided.
Thanks to discussions, donations, but especially to the funds that gather the shoes through the whole Germany, the means are accumulated.
"In all, we already sent about 200,000 euros in Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, Association Chairman.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a safe woman of himself and who always obtains what she wants, managed the money from Germany.
It also ensures that orphans are well achieved, in one of their grandmothers, for example.
Gogos, so we call old women in saloo, are the village pilars.
Some of them welcome up to 14 orphelins, they offer them a toilet and ensure that they make up each day at school hours in their uniforms.
The orphelin who has no more is welcomed in a safe place, at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as well as the two coffees who prepare them every day for more than 200 children afflicted.
Furthermore, "Voices for Africa" has created a colture school and allowed the construction of two polars. With the concours of the American Health Organization for PSI, the association organized HIV detection test for many people.
This will not be its own, because even if disease is well visible in the whole country, it remains a subject of table.
A king and his 14 wifes
"The AIDS is a real table," says Annette Lennartz, "for this is a subject that touchs sexuality."
It is quite curious from a country whose king has 14 official wifes.
The last absolute monarch of the black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for its excessive life style.
Poligamia in place of democracy.
These cases sanctioned by the State, inter alia, are responsible for the rapid propagation of HIV observed in recent decades.
Migrant workers also disassembled the virus through the country.
However, there are preservatives on each street round, adds Annette Lennartz, "but almost no one uses them.
The culture is different, flesh against flesh."
In order to promote some cultural exchange, Imbongi's cousins go together on their way every two or three years in South Africa and emphasize skins of nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that the number of inhabitants of the black continent still know the time of the apartment.
The bus filled with whites that sing in African language is a sign of recognition, as it leads not only good humor and joy, but sometimes slows a laugh to a few redoutable border guards.
The bus always brings them to Esitjeni, where the kids visit their girls.
Even if it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni Valley.
"Come to Esitjeni, you will find it from light", people say there.
And after a trip of 8,733 miles [8,733 km] of bird flight, back to Heidelberg, before these shoes that slept from the foot in the Bergheimer Street Repetting Room, the light is also found.
Messenger: NASA discover the glass presence on Mercure
The Messenger's study reported evidence of the ice existence on the Mercure planet.
The glass swimming pool could reach 20 meters of swimming.
The NASA American Space Agency tested the existence of glass on the Mercure Planet.
Although this planet is nearest of the sun, it refers to the glad water, as explains three studies published this Thursday in the specialized "Science".
The Messenger's study reported evidence of the existence of a glass cover in the shadow area.
This cover would be a spacing of at least 30 cm that could go up to 20 meters.
The water is probably from cometes or maybe asteroids that would have haired Mercure.
However, nobody has linked between the discovery of water and the hypothesis of a life presence on the planet, explains the scientist in Chief of the Messenger son, Sean Solomon.
The temperature of Mercure can reach 426 degrees of Celsius.
The discovery could help to understand how water and other essential elements of life have occurred in other regions of the sun system.
Unexpected people of our planet, sounds, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
In time to another, they send images to the earth, such as small interstitions through which the unfinished is observed.
The image comes from a photographic device developed by German researchers from the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our sun system, as well as the native planet Cerès.
As Pluton, who orbits around the sun behind Neptune, Celeste is not considered a planet, according to the new definition of the term of the 2006 International Astronomic Union.
This detail of a infrared picture taken by the telescope Spitzer shows a "familiar portal" of the innumerable star generations: the oldest stars are in blue and the red points, more difficult to identify, are the "new-nabe" in the universe's accommodation room.
The telescope Spitzer found this area where the stars are born, baptized "W5", a well-known name, in the constellation of Cassiopée, at 6.500 light-year-old years.
The NASA Spitzer Telescope photod the flamboying star of a star in death.
The circle in the form of beignet is composed of elements that the star designed when it dies.
In the nebulous Trifide, at 5,400-light years of Earth, the gas and powder forms new stars.
Spitzer's telescope photod this galactic kitchen room.
The Pleiades, sweet stars also called "the seven sisters", can be observed in the novel eyes during the night.
However, the telescope has more colours in value.
On this red picture, the Nebulous of Hellice, like a red eye, look directly at the spectacle.
It is a 700-year-light year in the Verseau constellation.
His comparisons with a earth-wide continent have valued the title of North America.
The combination of the normal photo and the infrared photo allows to observe a spectacular thickness.
Only the infrared detectors of the telescope Spitzer have been able to capture a image of the new star in its entire beauty.
One of the largest emblems of the astronomy is on the creation of Saturne's rings.
One theory is that the ananals are the remains of a Saturn Month that disappeared 4,5 billion years ago without leaveing traces.
One of the biggest and net photos that had taken the Hubble telescope is the one of the Tourbillon Galaxie.
According to the teeth, the photos of the spiral galaxies may become true art works.
The photo published by the European Australian Observatory shows the Trifide's nebulousness in the Sagitator's constellation, a number of thousands of light-years.
The name of Trifide comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divised, shared in three), because three powder trails divide the heart from the place of birth of the stars.
Astronomen photod the prims of a cosmic characterization in the Constellation of the Serpentar: at 400 million light years of the Earth, two fusion galaxies slow to each other, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble Telescope observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like technical abreviations, you can use its "Australi fire route".
The photo of the spatial telescope Hubble shows a detail of the Iris's nebulous, in the constellation of Cephée.
The nebulous is 1,400-light-year-old and is composed of powder grains that are ten times a hundred times smaller than the current house powder.
This photo was developed from the optical and radiographic clouds taken by various telescopes.
There can be seen the circle composed of black trails that is located at 430 million light years of Earth.
Space Telescope photod this group of galaxies baptized Arp 273 for NASA.
Scientists named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebulous, the group of young stars is the most luminous of our lacquered way.
The heavenly beast always born new stars.
These star clouds, which are linked to the Rosette's nebulous, also create in the constant number of young stars to 5,000-light years of Earth.
In this galaxy on light radiates and lost from a small black strike, there is no powder yet, there is only gas.
Scientists think that he was born little after the skin, when the universe was composed of hydrogen in most parts.
Our view on the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope had been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galilée uses it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the views of optical telescopes have not stopped pregnancy and thanks to them, it was possible to see more far in the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the telescope Hale de la Mont Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope of the world.
The look at this image had a diameter of five metres.
In Arizona, in the United States, the Binocular Telescope Large.
It allows to observe the universe through two views with each diameter of 8.4 meters.
The wind of the Great Canary Telescope in La Palma, on Canary Islands, is large. The view only reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The view of South African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmentated in order to make economies.
The diameter reaches the same around 11 metres.
The inconvenience of the economic construction method is that telescope is set at the vertical angle, which is limited to mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also set at the vertical angle level.
His personality holds its great light collection capacity.
Despite a relatively small sight diameter, this capacity approaches those of the world’s largest sights.
Scientists listen to the universe to search for extraterrestreat signs using the Arecibo Radiotelescope (Puerto Rico).
This radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Any owner of a computer may help the "Search for Extrarestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence") by giving the machine the ability to calculate.
See the Australian European Observatory (ESO) in the Chinese Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("too large telescope"), a dignified installation of his name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can light the average infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the ESO site in Chili.
His main view should reach the impressive size of 42 metres. It will be composed of nearly 1,000 view elements.
However, the telescope will not be able to take clips before 2018.
By 2007, Keck's two telescopes on the Hawaii volcan of Mauna Kea were considered as the largest world.
They would tree two views of a diameter of 10 meters each.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea's observation that observes the sky with the Subaru Telescope and the IRTF.
A new gigantic telescope should also be built on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of its look will reach 30 meters.
This illustration allows it to administer.
However, the images of the most important space are from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he booked images of the distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler is looking for exoplanets, mainly those who are habitable.
NASA announced on 2 February 2011 that it had found 1.35 candidate planets since the beginning of the mission.
This photo illustrates the latest preparations before the launching of the space telescope Kepler.
Space Telescope James-Webb (JWST) will be sent in space as early as 2018 at the edge of Ariane 5.
The first view of the infrared spatial telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
The telescope will, in particular, find the light designed by the first stars and galaxy after the slope.
Scientists think that the South Mercure pool also opens from the glass.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, because Messenger orbits much closer to the North of Mercure pool.
Radar data indicated the glass presence on Mercure for decades.
Thanks to the launching of the Messenger Audio in 2004, the first to orbit around Mercure, scientists now have the certainty of it.
Get daily boaring, and live up to 168 years
In the South of Azerbaijan, many people reach ages of the Bible's patriarchs.
There is even a museum of long-evity.
An investigation on a country, where there are relatively young to 97 years of age.
In the South of Azerbaijan, many people reach ages of the Bible's patriarchs.
There is even a museum of long-evity.
An investigation on a country, where there are relatively young to 97 years of age.
The travel in the Talysh mountains is a scattered romanticism.
Over the many road tournants, the small bus swimming along the wooden collines, torrental rivers and modest firms.
Everything is green and fertile, we would almost believe in the Black Forest.
But we are here in the depth of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran, just a few miles (kilometers) in the south of Azerbaijan.
It is here that the Caucasian ethnic group of the name of Talysh, about which we don't know great-chose, if they are perfectly talking about Persan and Azeri, and they have a very long-term evity.
Lerik.
The small town with its too aggressive architecture of the Soviet era that does not agree with the pintoric mountain landscape.
The European tourists are rare here, the traffic from the capital of Azerbaijan, Bakou, is too punishable.
We need eight hours to pass the 323 kilometers, because the road is only one way.
The province has not yet benefited from the legendary riches that the country must have its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48 years old, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist.
"Bakuu has become famous in May thanks to the Eurovision concours, and the next year, there will be the celebration of the oldest people in the world," explains Fatulayeva.
It is direct from the museum of long-evity, the only museum of the world.
We can discover the life of about eight decades of Talysh in the region that have more than 100 years. Fatulayeva shows us a black and white photo.
Here, my grandfather, he reached 120 years old.
Another child at 136 years
But the opposite star of the museum is Shiirali Muslumo, a herd who had been 168 years old.
However, there is no birth act.
And when you think that the oldest person documented had 122 years of age, Muslumov's age seems more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," Specific Fatulayeva.
The man would have married three times and had 23 children. 136 years old, he would still design a girl.
Should Shirali Muslumous be inflicted in a few decades by calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at Rostock's Max-Planck Institute, also heard of the man at the great age of Central Asia.
"There are astonished people who live in some regions of China, Japan or the Valley of Hunza in Pakistan," explains Scholz, "in Sardinia also there are men who live unbelievablely old."
However, it is impossible to establish a scientific evidence because of the existence of documents, without having a civil status register.
Each day, a founded barber drink
It is, however, that people in the Lerik region often reach a age of the Bible’s patriarchs.
Today, 20 people have more than 100 years.
What is, therefore, the reason for long-evitability in the southern of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the arari tourist leader, explains that Talysh has special genes.
On the contrary, Fatulayeva, the museum director, thinks it's a matter of food.
However, it does not seem to be pleasant, from a nutritional point of view, that the rich foods in the Talysh heat, which loves flesh, bread, and especially milk products, and whose many are daily drinking a founder drink, are good for health.
Or is this the simple life mode that protects young people? In Cengemiran, a small village near Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
With 97 years of age, she is relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lived in a modest wood house, as it is typical to see it throughout the Caucase region.
It is sit on the ground next to a white, which shoots the content unless.
Eight people live here under a single toilet, among which one of Mirzayeva's sons and a girl, who are for a long adult.
Two little kids also play in the house.
In the kitchen, you're preparing the tea for invites to serve in typical weapons in ventre.
The white dents of Mirzayeva are perfectly aligned, and under its folk they hide long treasures of a blond that his son reveals us with fierity.
I always laid my hair with milk, and so I never lost them and they keep their color.
"I have never used shampooing," adds Mirzayeva.
Monthly retirement is sufficient to live
She has always eating what comes from its own firm: tomates, land pommes and small fish.
For all my life, I never bought the smallest food in a supermarket.
Then she talks about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after the Second World War.
But everything improved when the "good father" Heydar Aliyev took the commands.
The language of the propaganda is in the mouth of a old lady.
However, the worship of the paternal figure of the nation, a man who, however, directed his country as a dictator, did not know almost the limits in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, his son Ilham succeeded after him.
Whatever it is, the older people of Azerbaijan do not know the suffering.
Mirzayeva receives monthly 230 manits (around the same amount as in euros) for its retrait, a sum that guarantees a good life train in the region.
And maybe the son of Mirzayeva's long-term grising is right: "the elders play great respect in our culture."
They're the center of the large family, they're loved, careful and happy.
That's a good reason to live as long as possible.
Human Rights in the Constitution
Revolution renews in Caire.
Rival manifestations reveal the deep part of the country.
The draft Constitution based on the chariot is violently controversed.
The Egyptian President is not aware of emotions.
We have to succeed in the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility towards the people and to God," he said to the state television.
His speech was intended to the whole people, but especially to Christian Cops, free, Muslims clear and laïc.
Because all of the members of the confusion and unsuccessful opposition are afraid.
They fear a theocratic on the Nil in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brothers.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost apologizing, having timely limited the competences of the Constitutional Court and extending the seats "to save the revolution".
However, Egyptians and the world do not really know what to save this 61-year-old engineer, titled by a doctor of the South California University.
Will the court's power be reversed?
The 234 articles addressed to the host by the assembly constituting an Islamic majority of 100 people at a night force tour of 15 hours are effectively worried in a certain measure.
As in previous constitutions, the project prescribes that the jurisprudence stands on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word "principes" mean?
It was and it remains a question of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that Islamists use the vague formulation and the margin of legal maneuver which involves to apply a more strict interpretation of the charia.
In any case, it is that it takes to think a new article introducing that, as regards all the issues touching the chariot, the Al-Azhar University must be consulted. The institution is the most important Islamic institution of the country and its radius on the entire Sunnite Islamic world.
This may, however, not forcedly mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative device, which would actually lead to the entire establishment of the judicial power.
Many points in the draft Constitution are to be interpreted
Another problem is the likely maintenance of the military court.
During the rule of Moubarak, these courts were employed to repress the opponents.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The State must also be read in the project, protecting "the real nature of the Egyptian family" and "promoting its moral and values".
From a legal point of view, the formulation is so slow that State institutions may even control the content of cinematography and literature.
Of course, it would only work with censure.
Furthermore, no article guarantees the equality of men and women.
Instead of that, another article prohibited to open or disseminate the prophet Mahomet or his sentences.
On the contrary, the article does not define what is a crime or how it must be punished.
Any doubtless is the lacking formulation to hear that it is prohibited to "obtain people".
Is it enough to draw a load of the President or tell a slaughter in the detriment of a lawman?
Many points are therefore to be interpreted in the project submitted to the vote and, according to his own words, the object of a referendum to the Egyptians will be "soon soon".
"Revolution turns back"
The opposition is mobilized for weeks against the digital summer of Islamics.
Thursday night, tens of thousands of manifestants gathered together in an inhabitable consent on the Tahrir place in Cairo, promised to cut the chariot before she entered into force.
"Revolution renews and we'll win", she launched Hamdin Sababai, arrived third to the presidential elections.
The Nobel Prize of Peace and former Chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradai said that the Constitution project was "to go into the peoples of history".
On Twitter, the immediate message service, he accused Morsi's partisans to want to promote a "putsh against democracy".
"If he declares the referendum, we'll go to his palace and turn it back," Jasser Said said, a opponent.
"We are not still inflicted, the blood of our brothers is not yet lost," said the Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a political man and a member of the opposition.
In addition, several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, which would lead to its nullity.
"The Coran is our Constitution."
On his side, the Muslim conquest, well organized, called to an anti-manifestation not on the Tahrir place as a precautional measure, but on the other river of the Nil, where a large prayer was organized before the University of Caire.
Women, who were buried and parts of the salafists, who participated in them, scanned: "The people claim the application of the law of God."
"Lift our country!" they asked Morsi, claiming that "the Coran [their] Constitution."
A fight for the sovereignty of the symbolic place Tharir, where everything started, had soon generated a similar situation to that of civil war.
Of course, that's what Morsi's partisans wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brothers stated that the opposers to the Constitution project, as well as its parties, were expressed high and strong.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide by the directions to take the country.
The project of Islamics will certainly bring the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned only once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry against the constitutional process that had had to extend until February and include all social forces.
The lawyer of the Human Rights of 48 years and the President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brothers when they were in prison or before the courts under Moubarak.
He did not because he shared the world's concept, but because human rights are invisible for him.
That's why he was shocked, judged and imprisoned.
"And now, the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution," he regrets during his interview with the world am Sunday.
Morsi's enlargement to the three powers has denied the lawyer.
These measures are critical towards democracy rules and will generate a new dictature in Egypt.
"In the place of strengthening civil society, the President denied him in fact all his powers," said Saeda.
However, a democracy cannot work without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels long-term, including the international community, which looks at the battle between the various political ideologys on the Nil border with a mix of curiosity and nervousity.
That could be paid.
A demonstrator on the Tharir place holds: "You're coming to a monster that it's no longer possible to control you."
The Norwegian Rafisk: is it the most horrible fish in the world?
The five million people in Norway benefit from one of the highest levels of life, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country ' s success be linked to the appeal of locals for extremely oweing fish?
Take advanced dusts.
Place them in the midst of a smooth and salt foot clothes.
Wait a week.
And you're getting the swimming shooter of the Rafisk, one of the most arrested destinations from Norwegia.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, around 3 hours from Oslo.
He sneaks, the landscape is spectacular - and this odeur, all represents, imprisons the air.
The rakfisk is composed of salt salt and fermentated in water for a period - according to the odor you want to exhale - that can go up to one year.
When the darkness is installed and it is cold, the Norwegians gather in mass to attend a festival here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this unbelievable culinary speciality.
"You eat creed, then you'll have a aquavit drink," explains Havard Halvarsen, full-time local pump that is also called "Raakfisk General", responsible for the festival management.
About us, people spend small fish pieces and cover a large amount of wood.
"Certain people prefer the aquavid to rakfisk", adds Havard.
The wood kills the wooder.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can avoid taking it under your nest, it's not bad - it makes think of a suicide that had been over a long hours in a bus.
The rakfisk retreated at a time when Norwegia was poor, before the refrigerator was invented, the fish was shocked into east water barriers, then slowed in autom.
Then, during the winter, once well fermentated, the fish is out and - without doubt with the senses of améndris by the alcohol - eating.
At the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mainly migrating to the United States.
Today, populations are rapidly developed - more than 13 per cent are immigrants, affected by full employment, high salary and a full health system.
Sweden, their old rivals, whose country was not so rich than Norway, pass through the border to come to work.
The rakfisk is considered something important, a vital element, even though, of the past of Norway.
That's part of the cheapest plates.
But it's cheer - a small blue pipe or a sandwich will cost you 10 € each.
Norwegia does not often speak of it in international times, but it is not for him to move.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the extreme racist of right that struggled 77 people, including women and children.
When they call this murder, they talk about "the incident of July 22."
The Norwegians are hard to accept that in their peaceful country, one of them could have made such a barbarian act.
Since the beginning of the 1970s, Norway must be rich to its oil and gas industry, one of the most important world's.
"But the oil is not the only reason that justifys our success," explains Anna, our servant, the blonde hair, and the eyes of a transparent blue, the image of the northern well-being, with a rakfisk plate on the hand.
We are - how you say - careful people.
His English, as the majority of the people who live here, is perfect.
We're disappointed, we don't like to note.
Norwegia has managed its oil riches with a lot of prudence – all of which, except a low amount of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When other countries cut money through the windows, in the years that have led us to the international financial crisis, Norway has maintained the cordons of its well-bearing snack.
"When we can ski in winter and make the randon in the past, we're happy," says Anna.
"It's to forget the rakfisk," adds it into a smile laugh.
I'm standing down under the snow, and I'm doing the cheese to buy me what to eat - I had my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a hamburger composed of alan, a real discovery, is excellent.
But tonight, the fish shooter is all over.
The hotel in which I stay is one of the many places where we serve Rafisk for dinner and where you can vote for the best of them - or maybe for the most horrible one of them.
There is a TV emission where the presenter takes a pavillon, rounded by rakfisk seats.
We would believe in the competition of the Eurovision.
"What scene have you given to the best fish, in the mountains Thor-Juergen?"
"We see our points, Havard."
We hear rise and applause.
A man fell from his chair, maybe because of the aquavit abuse.
Or maybe it's because of fish emanions.
The Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto knows a difficult start.
While the President of Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing to take its functions in Mexico, Will Grant, from BBC, is interested in the difficulties expected and at the expectations of the people, which are many.
Road circulation in Mexico is particularly bad at the current time.
In a town where enterprises are legion in normal time, a security bar has been established since Monday, blocking several key road access in the capital and causeing a real chaos on the roads.
However, the objective was not to prevent persons to make up their work, but to prevent the manifestants to reach Parliament.
The next Saturday, the new President of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidency to become the new President at the head of the nation.
A complicated task is expected.
The economy of Mexico is well-established, the results that the President, Felipe Calderon, must be issued, but the country is under drug war which has already costed about 60,000 people in six years.
"My Government has made the commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," Mr. Pena Nieto to President Barack Obama in the Ovale Office just a few times this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal.
Before cocovering the American President, Mr. Pena Nieto was a Governor of the Mexican State.
A very poor and tentative state that enters the capital. On its prediction land, the opinions about this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the bucolic Common Valle del Bravo, for example, it is registered in the memory of all.
Locations contribute to the development of tourism and infrastructure in the community.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new authors of M Pena Nieto, a significant improvement has been made to these roads, otherwise bosseld and filled with crevas.
wooding plates of his name are increased outside a new sporting complex and a impressive interactive museum deduced to climate change.
"We account on him to establish sustainable changes," said her friend and political partner Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the Congress and the Pena Nieto party, the PRI.
In terms of security and economy, we hope a real change that our country is so necessary.
After 81 years without the power, the PRI was developed in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The member of the Congress Olvera admits that, after 12 years ago, outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations in the party regarding Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the criticism of opponents reversing the new President to miss charism.
He's a whole, very active man, with an excellent vision of the country.
He's an excellent stateman, and he, above all, knows listening.
However, it is not always the image that people of their former Governor have.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known under the name of Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the landways of Valle del Bravo could not be slower.
Hidden under the autoponts of the authors, it is, in particular, a bathroom of the city of Mexico.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Soon in the year, military forces were called to fight drug gangs in the neighbors, and women ' s violence is particularly serious.
In a narrow area, the body of tens of women killed in the past two years was found in the delay.
More than 1,000 women were killed in Mexico, while Mr. Pena Nieto was a dominant, a higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez, a tristely famous place for the number of innocent women who have been killed.
Mr. Pena Nieto's delegators say that instead he did not end the problem of murdered against women when he was in function.
In the worst, they accused its administration of refusing to see the reality in face.
In a beton house, typical of this rounded neighborhood, Irina Buendia fights to keep his laugh when she shows me photos of her disfellowshipping daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version has been a suicide made by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
"When I came home to her, he seemed to me that his body had been laid", says Ms. Buendia.
Signs indicated that she was struck, and the body strict was already loved.
While his mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana hath the wall, next to a cross that contains the word: Justice.
However, this is exactly what the family has not seen.
The authorities treated me as if I was a old manner, a problem fault, a smile.
They want us to accept what they say and fight.
"But it's not normal that there are so many irregularities and oppositions," she stated.
When President Pena Nieto receives his samedie escape, the President will be able to accompany its responsibilities.
Decades of thousands of families were affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years, and the new President promised that it would be priority for its mandate.
"I hope he will be so good as President and when he was the Governor," Olvera stated in Valle del Bravo, a member of the Congress.
However, it is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza are worried most.
Bradley Manning didn't claim bad treatment, claims lawyers.
Prosecutors are trying to oppose maltraction revendications that Bradley Manning had been victim of the detention.
The prosecution is on the detention of Manning in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
Defence wants to classify the case on the reason that the sequestration of Manning has been under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of having issued thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to demonstrate, on Thursday, that the soldier Bradley Manning -- accused of being the largest fleet of confidential information from the whole history of the United States army -- missed many occasions of complaining about the bad treatment he claimed to have been subjected to his military detention.
During a interrogator with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, the Procureur of Maj. Ashden Fein stated that there was no complaint on his treatment by officers during its nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia.
The interrogation -- during a hearing, the defence submitted a request for the Maning case to be classified by the reason that the sequestration had been under extremely difficult conditions and made a sufficient punishment -- took place a day after Manning tested his request to suicide during his detention.
This analysis of military information, arrested in June 2010, was accused of derogating thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was their source.
During the Friday hearing, Fein examined with Manning the forms that the officers had filled after their meeting with Maning during his detention in the Military prison of Quantico, where he was submitted to a maximum prison isolation of July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked questions to Manning and reported his answers.
When Fein said the formularies, Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment that he had reserved was "excellent" and that the treatment he had had been generally "too professional".
The formers do not have any complaint for bad treatment, although the officers directly interrogated about his carceral treatment, said Fein.
Manning responded that he had regularly expressed concerns about certain problems and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and said that they would take care of it, but they did not consider the problems.
"They wrote "no problem" (only addressed the concerns) and, however, it did not mean that I had not raised problems", said Manning.
The military judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Maning why he had not been complained of his treatment during a meeting in January 2011 with the Special Committee that was meeting to evoke the self-defenced thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months ago.
Manning answered that his intention during the meeting was to modify its restrictive status indicating a "risk of hurt".
The military said that they had assigned him this restrictive status - a level below the monitoring approached for the risk of self-defence - for the protection and security of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was fine, and I wanted to take this status to benefit from a better quality of life of my view," said Manning.
Manning witnessed on his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was arrested for about two months before being transferred to the military prison of the Military Corporation in Quantico, Virginia, July 2010.
He said that he was thinking of suicide when he was in Kuwait and was shocked once because of heat.
He added that the fact that it was not held to know what he would happen to or what happened in the rest of the world was very anxious.
"My world was reduced in Camp Arafjon at this castle," said Manning, Thursday.
I thought I would die in that box.
Once in Quantico, Manning said that he had passed the most clear time in a small cell - at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours - without company.
Manning also added that the only objects he had were a mathematic, coverage, tongues, clothes and his lunetants.
He tried to stay in move, because sleeping or staying long during the day was contrary to the regulation.
Manning also explained that when he tried to sleep, he had a light in the eyes, slowed outside his cell.
If the guards did not see his face when he returned the night, they wake up to see his face.
The lawyer of Manning made a formal complaint for treatment by Manning in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, April 2011.
On Thursday, the judge also put questions to Manning on a allegation reported in his Tuesday witness -- that after being forced to sleep all night in Quantico cells, it was forced to keep up in front of the gardens and other detentors a morning during the call.
Manning tested that at no time, he was not allowed to cover with a cover during the call.
During the questions of the judge, Friday, Manning said he had decreed the order of his guard that he had to leave his cover that would have been able to hide his nudity, but he acknowledged that no one had commanded to leave him.
Manning witnessed that he had been forced to sleep in the past night, because he would have tried to prove a officer that he wasn't a danger for himself.
Manning had said to the office that he could use the elastic of his slip or his tongues to hurt, but he had not done it.
In that night, Manning witnessed that his subventions, his tongues, and his lunetts had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take account of the experiences he had experienced during his detention and that he would considerably reduce his sentence if it should be recognised before a martial court, a prosecution that should be held in the beginning of the next year.
Defence stated that Manning intended to be punished by less serious crimes and to fight for other extreme burdens.
The hearing should return this weekend, with lawyers who should argue that the detention conditions were justified.
Pentagone confirmed that Manning was incarcered in accordance with the Regulation which regulates the conditions for all detention in Quantico.
The chiefs of accused infringement against Manning include the flight of public goods or documents, the confusion with the enemy, providing the illicit publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information on national defence.
If all the guilty chiefs are reserved, it supports the perpetual criminal reconciliation.
My identity crisis mexico-American
He said that many have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
The Mexicans tend to smile those who have gone; they remember the difficult periods in Mexico, said it.
Navarrette says that the Mexican Americans will be taken among two worlds.
When a recent journey in Mexico came to the hall, before customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Two ways were indicated: one for the "Mexicans" ("Mexicans"), one for the "Extranjeros" ("Estrangers").
I stayed inmobile for several seconds, don't know what file I'm leading.
I grew up in the centre of California, where I was called "Mexican" all my life.
This is an ethnical qualification, as well as my friends of Boston use when they say "Iranians", or my friends from New York when they say "italy".
Then I became a Mexican American.
But here, it was Mexico.
And, on the earth that saw birthing my grandfather, there is no need for special qualification or union trading.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, enough to manage a holding in one or another language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of an Indigenous, and I can't lose my American actor.
Then I took my American passport and I went to the "Strangers" file.
I thought at that time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet their prediction themes are immigration, drug and trade.
Pena Nieto also wished to talk about the growth of Mexico's economy, which is one of the reasons that enable mexicans to stay in Mexico instead of risking themselves in the United States.
He wants to go to the United States and Canada, and to create a Union for Trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is able to continue the war against drug cards in Mexico, although he had not provided more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with amertume.
The majority of the Americans probably never thought that in 1848, the United States slaughtered Mexico and forced its leaders to cast the half of their territory in writing at the point of fire.
But for the Mexicans, who reflect in terms of centuries, and not in minutes, the memorys are all over.
So, as an U.S. official formulates the less critical towards Mexico, you'll start to hear -- in Mexico's press, and among the elites -- complaints about how Americans have reached the sovereignty of their neighbourhood.
And the children in Montezuma are looking for the bag.
However, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is the country with more than 35 million Americans living in the United States.
Do you want us to discuss the issue of the ambulance?
There's a lot.
Mexico has its winners and losses, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for which the country does not offer it.
The only reason that explains the great number of mexican ancients in towns such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at a given moment, in our genealogic tree, a person may have found no chance in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And most often, this person corresponded to a type of profile -- a skin skin, little taught, it was a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we live in the United States dream that we are going to good schools and that we have good situations, we must never lose the American dream that we live, not the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes struck, but our loyalty is clear.
We agree to the United States.
We also know that a part of the Mexican election among the leader class does not love us.
The feeling is reciprocal.
We recall them a humiliating defect and they are like if we were lower and not sufficiently mexican individuals.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our relationship with Mexico will never be sufficiently strong.
For them, our existence is synonym of failure.
If our families hadn't failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never be gone.
And we wouldn't find out of the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but as lost souls.
My wife, born in Guadalajara and who legally migrated to the United States while she was a child, recalls that there are frictions between the Mexico and the Americas, because the Mexicans are more stronger towards their identity and the Mexican Americans.
Although she is an American citizen, she feels to be part of two countries.
In addition, many mexican Americans I do not know have the impression of being part of a country or another.
We love the music of the Mexican group, the North Tigres, but also the Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of the two worlds, but we're not raised in any of the two.
In Mexico, we are considered as Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered as Mexicans.
And now, to make a little more complex the relationship, as I learned during my stay, some mexican leaders and a part of the intellectuality want to approach Diaspora.
They want mexican Americans to work as a reward ambassadors for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We must explain to our American partners that Mexico is a superbe country that must absolutely visit and put pressure to political leaders to strengthen the relationship with Mexico.
Yeah, of course.
That won't happen.
There's too many amertumes.
And if we consider the inequality of wage, corruption and violence related to drugs, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You'll have to slow you alone, friends.
It's normal.
If some Mexicans are still not ready to forgive the United States in the way they treated Mexico a century ago and half ago, they should therefore accept that some Mexican Americans always want to be treated as long as their family members have been treated.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I didn't think.
Sweet, new Middle East
The stopping fire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Can there never be a sustainable peace between the Arabs and the Jews in the Middle East?
Another blood flow seems to indicate that such hope is simple.
While the same shuttle arguments to know who started, ten buildings were reduced in powder; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelites were killed; and for the first time, the slaughtered rocks of Gaza came near Tel-Avi, the Metropole of Israel, and the sanctuary city of Jerusalem.
However, although the Israelites and Palestinians seem to be blocked in their former conflict, the Middle East is in full change.
The Arab spring has completely been flying in shocks, and the sweet or not, the Palestinians and the Israelites are traced by this regional slaughter.
Maybe their fight will be a little more intensifying.
However, there are all reasons for thinking that this could help them to get out of this mortal impairment.
A war that doesn't lose nor winner
First, it seems difficult to prove optimism.
Even though the stopper granted on November 21, the fights of this week have strengthened the force partys, both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has led to Gaza since 2007, will have forced the Israelites to abandon, even though Gaza has tried a rabbit.
Having killed some of his leaders and recovered the 1,7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most poor and overwhelming coins of the planet, Israel did not have been able to destroy the Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas wins the land on the Western Jordan, the other part of Palestinian currently in the hands of the Fatah rivals, the other most moderate Palestinian faction.
The Hamas leaders could also say that the time is their alliance.
The influence of Arab Islamics in the world is increasingly stronger, and Hamas has become rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a regional power in full shore, once the most nearest Islamic alliance of Israel, has taken and caused Hamas; and as the Qatar, one of the most rich and most dynamic states in the Golf.
The Hamas members pledge and say that the credible Islamist spends around Israel from Lebanon, north in which Hezbollah mixed his rule, through Syria, where Islamic rebellies can turn Bashar El Assad, and to Jordan, where the Hamas allies threatens the king.
And the most important, on the south flank of Israel, the mount of the Muslim Brothers under the President of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, from the nearest and most central of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the depot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
On the contrary, the Muslim Brothers are cousins of the Hamas, and their leaders make it easier to the public view.
In the future diplomacy, Hamas can be a major actor that could not be even excluded by Israel and America.
During that time, the parties in the hard line of Israel will take the contrary conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was transferred into box.
The Iron Dome interception system has proved its effectiveness and many Hamas mixes have been destroyed.
The Israelites will be able to sleep on their two ears - for a certain time.
In the terms of diplomacy, America renews its indefect support; and many European countries have opposed Hamas to be the origin of the last race of violence.
However, in particular, Israel prospered, in particular under Binyamin Netanyahu, the first minister, who fully ignored the peace process.
Although the shoes of Gaza have been killed by the Israelites since 2004, Israel has been dispersed by the suicide attacks, in particular through the separation barrier that implys on the West Jordan, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and which protects the Jewish colonies that continue to expanse despite their illness in the area of international law.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose party Likud has fusioned with a more Belgian party, the of the leader Avigdor Lieberman at the approach of the election of January 22, has the nice party.
Why should these Palestinian fichs strive to give them a state?
If they were leading to West Jordan, wouldn't they launch rocks, as their companions did in Gaza?
It is preferable to keep them behind this wall and shoot them when they get out of the head.
Maybe the partisans of the hard line will take it; but it may be that the Arab spring changes the woman.
Although Islamics taking the power in Egypt and otherwise appreciation for little Israel, their priority will be to attack problems in their own countries.
The Israeli defence budget is more important than that of its four Arab neighbors gathered.
Starting a war with local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to arrange their economy.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get the fire stopped what is good - and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelites should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world that becomes more democratic, the free of the Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder that is intended to explose one day in Israel's occupied territory - a little like the bus that has explosed in Tel Aviv this week.
Democracy has already been democracy in the Jewish state, and the demography is exacerbating this problem as Arab population increases.
Blood missions against Gaza every two or three years to sound the Hamas will have a diplomatic price.
The two sides need to be covered by the outside.
The answer remains assigned by reasonable people from each side, and by most of the external world and by the newspaper: two states, with an end of the territory by Israel in exchange of security.
A small and short-term hope is that the stop of fire will give the opportunity to external persons to defend this cause.
Egypt, who is now to meet to end the arms movement to Gaza, as the same as Turkey and Qatar, is better than ever to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the borders of 1967 with land trade and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs of the Foreign Countries should also make pressure on Hamas and Fatah to join themselves.
This would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian status than the next proposal for a pseudo state to the United Nations.
Mr. Obama also interested in what Israel accepts to negotiate.
During his first mandate, he did not present his own peace plan.
Returning to the White House, he seems to be reiterate to establish one.
It's a very strict vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital outcome for America.
This is through a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
The laws for neutral cigarette packages have entered into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of sick organs recover the dark green packages that are all identical, except the mark
This law entered into force in Australia is the first world, the logs and colors were replaced by a dark green olive and horrible photos of sick organs and representations of children and children whose diseases have been caused by the smooth smoke of their parents.
Out of different photos and health warnings, the only difference between the packages since this Saturday is the name of the brand, printed in small characters on all packages.
It is the most strict regime in the world in the field of smoke packaging.
The Federal Government stated that the goal was to dissolve young people from smoking by removing any glass representation.
Studies showed that if people haven't started to smoke before the age of 26, there is 99% of chances that they never start.
"When they are very young, children understand the message verified by the manufacturers through their brand image," said the Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plibersek, quoting studies, for example, that children associate the logo coron of a logo to a princess."
Even though Australia records the lowest rate of tabagism in the world, and if these changes have a little impact on the benefits of multinationals, other countries consider a similar approach.
The smoke industry has pressured this law.
Tabak manufacturers said that this would renew the black market trade, which would facilitate access to smoke less chere.
"The negative consequences will develop from this legislation," said Scott McIntyre of the British American Tobacco Australia.
China's and Indonesia's false cigares will produce more contraface cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others said that this law had dynamicized their activities.
Sandra Ha de Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, declared that the request for smoke students, including silicone to mask the horrible packaging, has been strongly increased two months ago since British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan have reacted to the law and lost before the High Court of Australia.
He stated that Zico has sold 6,000 grossists and is expected to renew stocks.
For us, the business is good.
The only innocent, the experts say, is the popularity of social media and the population trace targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws prohibiting TV advertising, sports sponsoring and obligation to dismiss the cigarettes, the marketing of smoke is currently online.
Australia has banned publicity on the web by companies and local sites, but it cannot prevent foreign websites to do it.
"If you work in the smoke marketing and you have only a small vitrine to promote your products, the Internet is the uncontrollable place," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in the contributions of some lambda citizens to marks on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We should ask if it is a simple citizen who love Marlboro cigarettes and which has been the pain of making a video, or whether it is an agency's marketing campaign?
British American Tobacco Australia stated that the industry focused on the new regulation in force instead of marketing.
The industry went to pay Ukrainian, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to contest these new decisions of justice - these countries stated the WHO that trade is injustly unfair, although there had no significant trade trade with Australia.
A WTO decision should be taken in 2013.
Plibersek said that the Government had held discussions with other countries on similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to obligate the packaging warning photos in 2001.
Now, these warnings are presented in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More serious laws are currently studying in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
Photos don't worry about me.
I'm ignoring them.
"You're taking a cigarette and you're sharing the package," Victor El Hage said at the time to buy a package on which it contains a leg tumor photo.
To be frank, the only reason why I'm gonna stop, it's my little girl.
James Yu, generator of the "King of the Pack tobacconist" in the centre of Sydney, said that the uniformity of packaging makes it difficult to range the packages on the packaging.
"Before, I need a hour to download a colis, now, I need four hours," said Yu.
"The government was only forbidden for them a good time for all and we would say OK, that's good, we stop and put the key under the door," he added, upsetting the arms into the sky.
In a constantly connected world, it may be good to shut up.
I passed five hours in a airport during the Thanksgiving period, because our airport had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the arrival of another airport.
Therefore, I had enough time to think about the theme of the poor.
I won't lie you.
Pass a half day in an airport to wait for a flight is quite angry, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (less you forget the shops of free duty).
However, even more, some universities and experts specialized in the development of the child makes the nervous.
It's perfectly normal for us - and our children - to spend time in time, they say.
This forces the brain to take interesting ways, or to feed creativeness.
And as most of us are constantly before several types of screens, we do not know the benefits of the nervous.
So should we welcome open arms?
Yeah.
And not.
But I'll go back.
First, as many people were, I thought that the nervous was a recent phenomenon, especially since we had more time free.
But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, Professor of Greece-Romain History at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The swimming snake is very far," he said.
On the walls of Pompei are Latin graffiti that call the smell, they return to the first century.
Then there is the definition that we give to the innumeration.
The problem is that he has been defined and discussed in different ways, John D. Eastwood, a generous professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada.
After having paid many publications and submitted the idea to a group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have defined the renewal as a experience that consists of "to want to do something, but without reaching a satisfactory activity."
What differs from the pathy, he says, is that the person is not taking a job well as wanting it.
With apathy, he says, there's no desire to do anything.
What is in the heart of the nervous, he said, is "the interruption of the attention process, associated with malicious humor and the feeling that time passes slowly."
The nervous can be strongly like a depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if these two can be linked, people who are inclined to think that the problem comes from the environment or from the world, while depressed people think that the problem comes from them.
Sometimes it is possible to think that we are inquiring while it is actually a problem of concentration.
In the context of their study, "The Unentgaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" published in the magazine "Perspectives on Psychology Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues showed an older experience in which participants listened to the castle, the voice of a person in reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard, from the side room, the too high sound of a TV emission that had no report, others just heard the TV emission, and the third group did not hear the sound band.
Those who heard the TV at a low-speed sound level said that they were more angry than the other two groups - they were worried to concentrate themselves, but they did not know why, and assigned this problem of concentration to the nervous.
When you are trying to concentrate on a difficult or pregnant task, an interruption of attention can lead to the innumer, Mark J. Fenske said an accepted professor of neuroscience to the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the research authors.
Instead, when you do a smooth task, "Come looking at objects on a mounting chain, music can help you not smell you."
In fact, he says now, we know that when we are tolerated or struck, these gests, often considered as signs of renumber, are actually a good way to remain physically more alarmed.
"The studies showed that children who are allowed to giggle learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to stay without movement," said Professor Fenske.
We all swear each day or the other - the late of my flight, a shooter with a monocorn voice, a specially sweet movie.
But some people are more likely to be injured than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a "predisponibility scale" in the 80s.
The scale includes confirmations such as, "Dearing the tasks I do, many of them are repeated and monotones", and "I have so many interest centres that I don't have time to do."
Using such a scale, researchers found that the boys tend to shine more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and especially need many and varied stimulations.
But in general, adolescents are rapidly broken.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a individual and community development professor at the University of Illinois, conducted a experience during which he contacted about 400 adolescents and their parents seven times a day through a beeper.
He pointed out that 32 percent of the adolescents would declare to school and during their home duties, while 23 per cent would declare that they were not at school.
Instead, 3 per cent of the parents declared that they were denied.
Professor Larson said that he did not know whether the percentages of today's income, or 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that " adolescence is a period in which he has reached its highest level", in particular because children and adolescents have not much control on what they want to do.
If I ask my question, is it good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, to parish or to abuse some substances to pass time, as the study shows.
Instead, many philosophs and writers launching a link between the innovative and creativeness, Professor Vodanovich, who has studied the problem for over two decades.
"The nerves are the way the brain found to make you know that you should do anything else," said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at the N.Y.
But the brain does not always know what is the most appropriate thing to do.
If you smell and use this energy to play guide and kitchen, it will make you happy.
But if you look at the TV, it will make you happy in short terms, but not a long term.
So if your child is slow and you give him a iPad, he will no longer forget, but he won't learn to take care of himself or self-regulate, says Professor Fenske.
And "this is authorizedly passes from a situation to another," he says.
Your child is not only learning to divert, it gets more control of himself in other areas.
I don't think we should be glorified.
As I don't think anymore we should criticize it.
It feels that they generate activities and technologies are the goal to which we should get.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
"We need to smell us more often, but the smell swallows an accurate and fronistic desire to be connected to something that has a sense," he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and appreciate the time of stop.
"In a environment where we are constantly hyperstimized," he added, "that is difficult to find ways to start in something when the sound stops."
In the Colorado no Directive on the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19-year-old, student in a Colorado university and foot player, is accused of something that will soon become legal in his state: the possession of marijuana bottles and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said that one day, in September, he and some friends were on the board of a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a comparison to the ownership of drugs and materials that can be used to its consumption - smaller crimes, each of whose amendment is $100 - and a comparison date.
"We are treated as criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is it one?
During the weeks of incertitude that followed the Colorado's vote to legalize the consumption of small quantities of marijuana for his personal use, the response to hundreds of businesses involving a low use of drugs depends on more than the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving marijuana use have been classified immediately.
Police services have stopped infringing adults under 21 years of age for smaller marijuana possession, since the law will enter into force in the coming weeks.
But lawyers in Colorado's most conservative circles called to accelerate existing marijuana business and continue to inculcate those who have it.
Similarly, several cities from Denver to the Western mountains are currently voted to prevent the opening of marijuana sales in the country in their neighborhoods.
"The things evolve so fast that I don't know what we're reserving the future," said Daniel J. Oates, the police chief of Aurora, east of Denver.
Washington State regulatory agencies are also unfair to questions.
They are searching for directives on the installation of a authorisation system, authorised to produce, produce, distribute and sell before the date of 1 December 2013.
They say that the Colorado, which is sweet or not, is advanced in most states of marijuana regulation, first of all regards the use of therapeutic purposes and now in terms of personal use.
"The Colorado has a more regulated market, and it is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, DC State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, recognize Mr. Smith, can do more than suggesting what works.
"There is no reality on which we could base, he said.
The Washington law, called I-502, takes effect on 6 December, which leaves a legal vide of one year, while the permission system will not always exist, while marijuana ownership will be legal.
At this time, practical questions remain in suspension: how to balance the state mandate that guarantees appropriate access to the approved marijuana and prohibits the installation of cannabis sales in a 30 km radius around a school, a park, a game field or a crystal.
"There are no more difficult places than the urban areas to install a approved trade in cannabis, including in the Metropolitan Zone of Seattle," said Ben Livingston, a chairman of the Cannabis Legalization Centre, a recently formed research group.
On November 21, the police chief Oates sent an email to his officers announcing that the "atorneyCity" (Representative of the Public Ministry) would not continue to the 21-year-old persons who have small amounts of marijuana, and that the police had to stop infringing persons for this type of crime "in immediate effect".
Head of Oates said that the police would apply the new judicial decisions that regulate the activities of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and that it would continue to continue to pursue drug traffickers and dealers.
In Ward County, north of Colorado, the "atorney district" (Republic Procureur), Ken Buck, is a more strict vision.
After the vote, he said that his office would continue to take care of marijuana's owning business, mainly in order to make pressure on users so that they may be disintoxed.
At the present time, 119 persons are inculpted in possession of 56 grams or less marijuana, but many of them are objected to other inculptions.
" Our office has the obligation to make progress against those who made a crime that, at the time of the facts, was a recognised crime," said Mr. Buck.
The reactions were even complicated in rural places such as the Mesa Council, where voters rejected the initiative for the restricted consumption of marijuana.
The police in Great Junction, the largest city of the cottage, does no longer compare adults for the possession of limited quantities.
The representative of the Committee Public Minister, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to classify all matters of marijuana detention.
"I have no impression to lose my time to continue to apply the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 per cent of the voters of Colorado have supported the measure, the provision of a legal and government framework for marijuana's personal consumption is not an adjustment.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in various United States cities show the deep ambivality among local officials in terms of legalization of marijuana.
"This is a cultural barrier" with the representatives of the public Ministry, Sean McAlister, a lawyer of Denver, who represents the accused consumption of marijuana and expressed as a local portal of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws).
"There have been a good part of their lives to continue in justice to those consumed from marijuana, and also, they have bad to accept that it is legal," he stated.
As first states to treat the limited consumption of marijuana at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and Washington state are in place to become a case of drug legality.
While defenders and representatives of the State provide a new border of legalized sales, they are concerned about the directives of the Federal Government, which are always the sale and culture of marijuana as federal crimes.
Defenders of marijuana's legalization hope that the Ministry of Justice will ceder.
Despite some mediated arrests of patients under therapeutic marijuana and sellers, the federal government has particularly allowed marijuana sales in the Colorado, Washington and 16 other states to operate in the Colorado.
If it is true that the police is not probably going to put the doors to small drug sacks, it is strong to see that it is opposed to marijuana's authorized sales of personnel authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, an elderly political advisor of Obama administration.
Many Colorado cities have not expected federal authorities to act.
Before the votes, some local administrations have approved moratories regarding the creation of new marijuana sales, even though only one year's report.
Last week, the city of Montrose obtained a 6-month moratorium, and should put this prohibition next week.
"We don't want to find us in a situation where a permission is granted to someone and then meets a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal Council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the Community's vote instead of the State's vote.
Many of the questions are taken.
Petronella Wyatt: I was dismissed and excluded from Oxford, because I was a "Tory" (conservator).
It is not only the students today that are attacked for their opinions.
So far as I remember, I've always been able to enter the Oxford University.
My father and my elderly brother studied in what was for me a great place of knowing, a kind of Greek amphithetor of modern times that stimulate the two pillars of civilization, freedom of thinking and tolerance.
However, two weeks after I was installed in Worcester College at the end of the 80s to study the story, I decided to make my arms, caused the first scandale of my life.
My dad smiled and smiled.
My friends were unconscious.
The Evening Standard magazine claimed that I had left this university because I had objected that students of the first cycle had sexual relations in the room next to me.
The author A. N. Wilson stated with facency that I was part of after being forced to drink in deceived taxes.
The truth was less funny.
I'm gone.
Yes, I went, because I had been victim of intimidations and made the object of constant brimades.
Not because of my name instead of another, nor because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for a single reason, and in this shock of self-destining, I was victim of a racist and barbaric behavior: my regret father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influenced advisor of Margaret Thatcher and I was part of the Conserver Party.
Why do you say it today?
However, recent studies revealed that a new generation of right-side-center students suffers the same type of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hate of students Tory in Oxford is as the last week, some of them required protection of their rights, as well as gays, disabled persons and ethnic minorities.
Corpus Christi College's conservator members said they were "isolated, personally attacked and feeled unwanted" because of their political opinions.
They wish that there is a representative within the university Committee for Equality to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
The recent documentary of their situation was not facilitated by BBC 2 "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("The country of wonders: Youth, Intelligence and Right"), dedicated to the policy of students, which deployed the "Tories" as extreme and neonazis.
There was, in particular, the student Joe Cooke, former President of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), which moves to Rolls-Royce, wooded a completely armed and moved with a chromeed head cane.
In other universities, conservator students say to be treated as emitted legs of the establishment of higher school costs."
Luke Black, a 20-year-old vice-president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, stated a Sunday newspaper "what there is an upper left party in universities.
People think we are like the Bullingdon Club without even have met us."
Samuel Roberts, 21 years old, student in history at Corpus Christi, who proposed a movement for more protection, said that such a climate is "inconfortable", and Stephanie Cherill, 19-year-old President of the OCCA, said that there was a deterioration of the attitude of JCR members towards people who are in the center of the right.
"This is a obstacle to the freedom of intellectual discussions, as well as to the well-being of members," she stated.
I was the only one to think about this during my first weeks in Oxford.
I entered in September 1986, then I was 18-year-old and a paralysing timidity.
The hate of the conservator party was very virtuous.
In the previous year, the university had voted to refuse to agree to Margaret Thatcher - an old student - a honourable title, due to the reduction in the financing of higher studies.
The atmosphere was charged by stalinic vibrations.
Since the first days of the week's welcome, when the new students learned with others and teachers, I had a front-good of what would happen next.
I found that teachers did not only participate in sarcasms to the students of Tory, but also enjoyed them.
It was like the policy on minors, privatization and opposition of the Government to sanctions against the Apartment in South Africa in the woods of classrooms.
The first sarcasm I was victim was about a translation to the English of the 18th century texts, and I was not prepared there.
"My Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt, "before translate the first paragraph."
I lost my feet.
Pitt, a little man in the sweet face, was easy to take it.
"Is that the Quecherists refuse to learn the French or are they just stupid?" asked he.
Other students have rid.
The laughs burned my eyes.
"I suggest you to take French courses during your free time - finally, if you're not too busy to make friends," he launched out of your happiness.
I'm back to my room, unconfortable.
When dinner this evening, I was sit alone, then I felt a slight card on my shoe.
It was a second-year English student named James, who presented himself as OCA member.
"I know who you are," he said, sweetly.
I'm so scared of it.
Everybody suspected to be a Tory (conserver) is taken for target.
It's already hard for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be harder for you.
Most young Tory claims to be workers.
Later, at the local pub, I tried to hide me.
I stressed that I did not agree with all that Mrs. Thatcher said.
This strategy failed.
A student in the first year of philosophy, political and economic sciences who had, iranically, studied in Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pork."
You're contaminated.
Other students repeated the retrain.
I was perversive, selling.
"How do the Torries do love?" asked one of them.
They shrink each other, isn't it?"
I feel like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the seventy years.
Would I just have a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people who share the same view points only after the night's fall?
Should I become Labour and restore my opinions?
The next three years would be like a purgator of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly professor Tory was Norman Stone, a modern history professor, who taught in my university.
He was hatred not only because he was a conservator, but also because he was advising in the external policy of Thatcher and one of his speakers.
He wasn't almost there.
He hated this provincial and insignifiant place, as well as his accession to the marxist-determinist view of the history.
In 1997, he accepted a position of professor at the Bilkent university in Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not gonna be happy here", he said to me.
I started to make the ship between Oxford and the house of my parents in London, finding refugee with my family and my more open quoted friends of mind.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and I explained why.
He was incredible.
During his studies in Oxford, in the 40s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said patentically.
They wouldn't do this, not in the city to dream clothes.
Even my communist friends had unreproachable ways.
He was laughing in the eyes.
Let them have a chance.
I'm sure it's to taste you.
That would smell my heart if you left Oxford.
Faced by my frequencies travels in London, my emotional resistance has gradually deteriored.
A friend, also Tory, succeeded in pressure and rejected his convictions.
During a working meeting next week, when another teacher of history suggested the world's most seriously, that I was "a enemy of the people," I decided to do so as much.
I was admitted to be victim of the brain lavage of my parents and to treat them "old fools".
The repeat has been short-term.
It's my father who cut the last clue of my oxfordian circle.
At that time, he wrote two columns in the Murdoch press every week.
My door was locked.
I stayed in my room, and five minutes later my continuers left.
When they went out, I made my bottle and I took the first train for London.
I've never come back.
You can treat me with sweet powder.
But no 18-year-old child should be victim of such intimidation in a school institution.
The most tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 first Ministers Tory, but also benefits from an incredible reputation of equality and freedom of thinking.
"Valentino prefers the eligance to notority"
In the context of the Exhibition "Valentino: a Master of the Couture" inaugurated this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian cottage customers.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elisabeth Ire of England, is the only place of the British capital to welcome an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The cottage acknowledged it during the anauguration of "Valentino: a Master of the Couture", a prestigious retrospective, which met more than 130 high-coal models for its bed house in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his enemy Italian accent.
This exhibition is the honour point of a story with the only protagonist is "her" Garavani, but that could not be written without his famous customers.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and by the nobless.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until 3 March, there is a impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the artism cream, from the princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing by the princess Maria-Chantal de Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exhibits his personal memorys such as the troops of his social ascension: the modest coast of the city of Voghera, north of Italy, at the island of the international jet-set.
There's nothing bad to love the kingdom.
"And least, they don't shut their cigarette megots on your magnificent buts as it makes some stars of pop music," says the barone Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 70s, we both lived in the Alpes, and we were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives generosity and elegantness.
"We all worshiped to be invited in his Gstaad chalet," explains the ex-ween of "Heini" Thyssen, a friend of the past beauty as Marella Agnelli or Eugenenie Niarchos.
Valentino always prefered the eligance to notority.
And even so, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, with a Valentino model
The argentin mannequin, Valeria Mazza, has no longer forgotten the charism of the cottage.
several years ago, after a breakfast on the Place of Spain, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were a twenty-five of people, among which Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We saw and felt his mind in every detail of his apartment, in decoration, food, music.
"After him, each invitation felt important and appreciated, he recalled the " top model ", which began working with him during the week of the High Coupe in Paris in 1995.
"He will never pass in mode, because its creatures are art works," it ends.
Noblesse-line Defiled
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsession but shared love.
He loves the higher people and with the largest titles, and they also love it.
One of the Sunsett House's galleries was transformed in a wide glass of seventeen meters, which proposes to exchange the roles: the visitor takes the place of the mannequins and must develop on the podium to admire a "public" of Valentino's main creatures, such as the sizer that Jackie Kennedy had chosen for his marriage with Aristote Onassis, the costume of Monica Vitti in "La Notte" or a sleeves in the meat and shoes belonging to the imperial Farah Diba.
Among this public of mannequins, you can find names like Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria van Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norwegia, Rosario de Bulgaria or Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and cottage in 2006
Many of his customers say that the first clothes of Valentino are like the first love, "unable to forget".
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pantalone, a chemise, a gilet "gilet" and a cloth of the auto-winter 1971-1972 collection.
"It's a gift he had done me," Naty Abascal said, one of the kitchen museums.
"I prefer him to all others for his feminity, his great love of women, and because he undermines our beauty," adds the former duchese of Feria.
I love the colors he uses, they're lighting and lighting the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Patricia of the Jovpaola d'Arenberg can no longer forget the first time she brought a Valentino model.
When she was adolescent and lived in Italy, she decided to have the age and the opportunity to take one of her night clothes...
Finally, it was possible at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard of Line.
It was a red evening wheel, with a flight shoe, a dragged busting and a shock to fall.
"It was a dream becomes reality," said Rodrigue of Arenberg's live.
"Valentino is indifferent to the mode, it is obsessed by the modern," explains the Italian aristocratic who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess of Arenberg keeps the shoes of the coast with "the largest care, because it is not only a shooting of the night, it is also all the memorys that it is in the car."
The "king" of the mode
The great end of the Sunrset House exposure is the marriage robbery of Marie-Chantal Miller at her marriage with Paul of Greece in 1995.
There were four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the cottage calls its coasts) to achieve this swimming swimming pool with perles, 12 different kinds of teeth and a trail of four meters and half.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the superior authority of the specialized press, this robe represents a historical fact of the high crowd of the end of the 20th century, "the return of the customers of the high society".
Obnubiled for years by the "noblessing" of nobless, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavalier di Gran Croce (the largest distinction in Italy), Cavalier del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letter, decorated from the Legion d'Honneur, Garavani cumules both the honors and the spouse of his customers.
"It's refination, his calm, his careful and perfect aspect have always saved me in the eyes," recognizes Arenberg.
The last time I saw it, it was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was sit on the table of the Ribes Comtesse, one of my grand friends.
"He was unconscious, the years have no effect on him."
If it's a princess who tells him...
The hardest work in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, Indonesian volcans risk their lives and health by taking 70 kilograms of sufre through scharted stone routes.
There are people for whom the work is a hell and other who are literally working in hell.
This is Anto Wijaya's case, one of the 400 min. who wins their lives by taking the sufree of the Kawah Ijen vulcan, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It must work every day until the end of the clause, where the sulfur gas coming from the earth is solidated at the air contact.
After collecting large soft rocks, which hold up over 70 kilos, he installs them in two bamboo shops that he loads on his shoes through the escaped roads.
There are only 250 meters up to the top of the volcano that culminates at 2,386 metres, but the swimming ports take more than 40 minutes to gravize this distance, at a tortue height, watching the balance and measureing their steps to not throw and drop into the precipitation.
They know that a false man could cost their life, as it happened to a French tourist who took a dead break in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
The smaller Kawah Ijen wins €5 centimeters for each km of extract sufre.
Once on the top, it flows a way between tourists who picture them as if they were circle beasts, and punishing the weights of the carriage, they walked 3 miles (3 km) to the balance that a mineral company installed a little in contrabass at 1.850 meters of height.
This is the PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that operates the volcan since 1960, and it can be said, its employees, to which it pays 662 Indonesian rupes (5 hundred euros) per kg of sufre.
It then sells it to the petrochimic industry as this mineral is very present in the daily life and is used to manufacture bottles, artificial fires, cosmetics, dynamics and even white sugar.
"When we transport about 70 kilos, we win about 46.000 ropees (3.8 euros) to each trip," explains Anto, which generally performs three trips per day.
Everyone takes 3 hours and ends up, but it allows it to win 138.000 ropees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a poor for such a human effort, it's the trial of what he would win in the fields.
"The income of minors is very high here, where the coffee collection is paid by EUR 15,000 per day (1.20) and where the average monthly payment is of two million ropees (167 euros), says the portor who worked as a maçon on the Bali tourist island.
On the basis, his salary was of 75,000 euros per day, and the job was not so difficult, but Anto returned near his family to Banyuwangi, a nearby village of the volcan, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is so indifferent that it was that I was married to a young Bali girl, where they are Hinduists, and I brought it to Java so that it turns to Islam.
Anto suffers of asthm, breath with difficulty, everybody constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gas.
27 years old, he was three of his life to challenge the danger on the Kawah, but the sufre has already started to pay the facture, even though it covers the face with a mask and the doors of special gants.
Anto suffers of asthm, breathing with difficulty, everybody constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases rejected by the volcan.
That's the price he must pay to continue his dream.
"I'm going to work more than two years, because I want to open a boutique or study Spanish or French," he promises in a English more than acceptable.
Unlike life, this young sympathy and intelligent could be tourist guide, server or receptive in a hotel, but instead, he does the work of a mule.
He shares an insaluble wood mass with other portors every day, because the sugar does not stop swearing the night when his black color becomes blue and brilliant in the middle of the darkness.
Under the darkness, Anto descends into the clause by lighting with a small lamp covered in his castle, that he himself purchased himself with his own money.
Some 400 portors load the swimming cart on their floors from the back of the clavier.
In spite of its comfortable benefits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of the sufur to economize the costs and provides no equipment for the drivers who work on their account and are payable to the weight.
Moreover, they do not touch one of EUR 30,000 rupies (2.50) of majority by photo devices, more than 15,000 ropees (1.20 euros), that the customs of this natural park are factory to tourists who come to photograph the volcan and its human mules.
"This work is done for the beasts, not for humans," protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old porteur who works in Kawah Ijen for thirty years, since he left the college.
It can be able to take up to 110 pounds, and it is sure that he will not stop working "and he can" because he needs money to get his 3 sons from 10 to 18 years of age.
I won't take my retreat, I'll die here because the volcan is all my life.
While the sugar hurts the gorge and smells the eyes when the wind turns and smells the mines in the shoes of smoke that goes out of the volcano, they are so enduring that no one claims to suffer serious diseases... to which they obviously add their usual respiratory problems, arthroses, pains in the genus and shoes, deformed by the weight of the carriers.
By balanced the cart on the sound, Uninik, 53 years old, can only load 50 kg.
Each day, his companions and his companions earned 15 tons of volcano softer, which three cars carried to the park of Tamansari, 18 miles (18 km) from there by a shock of shocks shocked by the bad herbs.
"I will not take my retreat, I will die here because the vulcan is all my life," Uninik says by opening the mouth well, cutting several missing dents.
The elderly of his five children, 30 years old, also works as sophisticators.
The time passes, but the persistent poor of generation is one of the most difficult houses in the world: the human mulls of the Kawah volcan vulcan.
Singapore child research to save the economy
Singapore is responsible for the lack of children on carriage, stress and the cost of ownership access.
"The population of Singapore must develop."
I'm a husband and a patriotic, you're my wife and a patriott, fill our civil duty and give us life!
It may seem uninterviewable that these words come from an advertising for menth pills, but even though this, or maybe thanks to this, the video has become a YouTube powder chain in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The words are from a rap group that uses local references such as "Alls put a polychinal in the fire" to move from the Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the video advertising agency, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a pleasant way thanks to this advertising.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music so that people would "deserve national duties".
It is intended only to the Internet, so we could make it pleasant and pleasant.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the area of birth, so we felt that it was a theme that we should address.
We knew that the government had tried several things like starting parfums to the pheromones or organizing speed-dating nights.
Many of these ideas were creative, but they did not have strongly functioned.
So we have said the following thing: what more creative to solve this problem than to make a rap song?
1,2 children
The Government of Singapore does not take it as far as light.
It costs $1,300 per year in policy to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A measure of the Government for marriages and fathers granted up to $15,000 per child, extends maternal allocations and distributes tax benefits.
But all this had little effects.
Singapore is a rich and high-scale-technological city of South Asia, also known for the conservation of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore’s birth rate, in accordance with its national population department, is currently at 1,2 children per women.
The last time it was found above 2, as the renewal rate was in 1976.
So why do Singapore have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the Marriage and the Family of the National Population Division, claims that it was to be a "more education" and "a larger choice of career opportunities".
"This allowed people to have a larger range of options in terms of life and priorities, beyond marriage and the Constitution of a family," she explains.
These changes in social standards contributed to the increase in the number of cilibs and to delay the marriage and birth, resulting in a decrease in birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy in order to radically increase immigration against the reduction of the population has created a sense within the local population.
In Singapore, there are web sites that enlarge a deceased xenophobia against new immigrants, especially against the Chinese people who are accused of shooting the loans down and not to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also identified as one of the reasons for which the party in Singapore has known its worst election results last year since independence.
Since the elections, they tried to correct the problem with the establishment of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the loss of the birth rate has known effects on economic growth in a country, tax revenue, health costs and immigration policy, the example of the Singapore also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, this began to touch the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities began to control the number of small apartments known under the name of "shooting wood", which could be built in certain areas in the city.
These apartments have a surface of 46 meters and their sales have a lot of success.
However, the authorities are concerned with the fact that they can promote a lifestyle of civilians and discourage the promotors who want to build large families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the Immobile Society EL Developers, claims that his "shooting Boats" is much more fast than the largest housing.
They are more popular, in the sense where these accommodations are built much faster than those of larger size.
For this reason, it's much more rewardable for our treasure.
However, he acknowledges that new standards provide more clear instruction to the promotors, which was put forward to swimming in the raw if they wanted to propose too small housing in a project.
Trop of stress
Singapore is a city of State.
If these new regulations could be a step towards the increased national birth rate, discussing with the Singaporeans working in the centre's financial district, it seems that they would not have many effects.
"The people are extremely stressed, the houses are sweet, as well as education, that's why people get it later," says a young framework.
Others may have children.
"But for me, it's important to be able to have my money and my time," we say another youth of twenty years.
Man and women mention their career, stress and cost of access to property and education, such as reasons for preventing children.
Thus, although the Government is trying to convince his citizens to have children, when it is to make children, they are the Singaporeans themselves who have the last word.
What is private outside line is online
Confidentiality
In accordance with the Dictionary of the Royale Spanish Academy, it is the quality of the private domain or "the area of private life we can protect from any intrusion".
What is the private domain for less than 16 years?
How should this definition apply in daily life and social networks?
Does it understand the dangers he expresses by discussing on the Internet events he would certainly not share out of line?
The magazine El Periodico interviewed five young boys, aged 10 to 15 years of age, frequent users of the toilet.
In four of these cases, they associated the term "what is very personal" on the personal and "password and user name" when they applied it to social networks.
"I will not declare my most personal secrets in a post," says Jorge, ten years old, when he tries to explain the meaning of the private term on websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has a account for two years.
"This are very secrets, my mother can know them but not everyone," he says.
On FB, I'm posting good images or games.
I'm also talking to my friends.
"I will not share one of my photos or someone who would do the wicked," he said.
The young boy recognized that it was bad to publish obscene photos, dishonored persons, crimes, or to write humilious or violent comments.
Jorge ensures that he knows his 35 friends on FB and his nine members on Twitter.
Most are family.
Her mother is actually part of, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express and write interesting Twitters.
"I don't know if they answer me, I'm just posting", he adds.
"Social networks are pleasant, I can speak with distant parents or with my friends in rapid way," he says.
He claims that he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
He won't trust anybody who would recommend a foreigner.
The case of José, 14 years of age, is different.
The adolescent has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask on this last, he admits not to know 20 of the people registered on his list of friends.
"I don't worry because we have something in common, music for example," he says.
According to the young boy, no one made advances to him nor requested her address or phone number.
"If they put my pressure or demand it, I would just remove them from my account," he recognizes.
José was subscribed to Ask after reading a Twitter recommendation.
The experiences today known under the name of cyberharcely are not foreign to the young man.
A neighbor of one of my friends was raised on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he assures.
The victim, according to José, did not close his account.
"He just passed it in private profile."
It then explains a series of manipulations to set its account safely.
In the difference of Jorge, this young man would post photos of knowledge in inconfortable or pregnant situations.
Yeah, I'd do it if I was hampered or nervous.
"If I know that it's cyberharcelement," he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, professor of English and licensed education and learning, considers that, in order to orientate children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"Internet has occurred as a way to search for information but, with the appearance of these sites, the game rule changed", says it.
Porras states that the Academics Marc Prensky, who has a pedagogy master in Yale University and author of the book "Natifs and Digital Immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives, they are, children and young people who are born with technology.
"We are the numerical immigrants who have to teach them there, while we're alone in learning," she says.
He acknowledges that the theme is complex, "for we ask them to have a criteria defined on what is appropriate or not to disseminate, publisher or tell to a age where they do not need maturity to do it."
"We also ask them to be selective, while what is the most important of them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach confidenciality to children and adolescents is to use issues that make them reflect.
"They say not to do it doesn't serve anything," she says.
Then, Porras records some examples: there are things you wouldn't tell a foreigner, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would that like you that they publish a photo of you like that of a friend you published?
Do you know what the others publish on you?
When you identify photos of holidays, do you ask others the permission to identify them?
And also, do everyone need to know what you're doing at each moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they must act online as they do it out of line.
These are the same rules.
"In the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, this must be similar to social networks," says it.
Surveillance
Stuardo Guardia, professor of university, primary institutor and educational adviser, says that parents are aware of the conditions of use of social networks.
They will have solid bases to discuss with their children about the implications of the opening of an Internet account.
"For example, the age and what it is allowed to share or publish it," he said.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remember the children that the foreigners do not need to talk.
The Unasur Summit ended without the Lima Declaration
The VI Chairmanship of the Union of South America (Unasur) has been completed today in Peru without that the Lima Declaration has been public, although it has been previously announced and theoretically adopted by the seven representatives present.
Efe several times tried to access the document signed at the VI General Meeting of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency reported that it would be distributed after the end of the Summit, and then stated that it would be published at one point on the Internet site of the Peruvian Government.
When they were asked on the text, they reported that his content was expressed by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief statements at the press.
The access of journalists to the Summit information has been constantly limited.
During the day, only the video without the presidential assembly's sound with the message "private session, limited audio" was distributed in the press room.
The few information that circulated among journalists were given by the press attachments of some of the Unasur Governments that attended you, with the exception of the Peruvian parliament.
The only document published during the day was the list of the present chairmans, which caused a certain male in the hundreds of journalists of various national and international media that claimed more important information.
Later, the Peru Presidency sent an email to the media with the Summit 'End Declaration', but it was the talk of President Humala and not the official document that concluded the Summit.
In October last, the Peru was the host of the third Southern America Summit (ASPA) and, at that time, although it was requested by press, it had not been distributed the statement called Lima also, as it had previously been announced.
On the official site of the ASPA, it is possible to verify that the document was published in March last month.
In the two international forms, the Peruvian authorities have tried to establish safe transmission systems for all journalists, but have limited maximum information.
The Summit also concluded with the Chile and Peru ' s Joint Agreement to accept a judge of the Hague Court which has a different border between the two countries.
The Presidents of the Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chili, Sebastián Piñera, were meeting at the regional performance and said that they would respect the decision of the CCI to hear the plaiders of the two parties in the proceeding that Lima tried to fight Santiago and that began Monday in the Hague.
"We shall respect and execute the greed that will resolve the differences we have today before this international court," said President Humala, next to his Chile homology.
"The Chile has always been, and will continue to be a country respecting international law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and tribunals," added President Piñera by giving a hand to the President of Humala, next to the two countries.
The confirmation of the two Chairpersons submitted to the CCI has been held after the Columbia has denied this week the Bogota Covenant by which she agreed to submit to the decisions of the International Court, after a decision on maritime limits with Nicaragua that it would be seriously wrong.
The Summit held without the presence of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the decrease of his former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the presentation.
The Chairman, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for opening the debates in the morning and closing the sum after midday in Lima.
The mandate read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that 31 project lines were established among South American countries for a total of $17 million of investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he pointed out that the UNASUR countries would establish “important steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship by developing agreements on residence permits”.
He informed that actions would be made to improve cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and internationally organized crime, actions for better accessibility to medicines, the access to the Internet to the whole of South America and to assess the risks of natural disasters together and effectively."
With a crisis Europe, "Economic consolidation (Late America) must not have a triophalist matrix but must help to increase our productive matrix and to enter a better future for our populations", concluded the President Humala.
"We have decided to have a group of 31 embryotic projects that improve the connection of South America's spaces, particularly in rural and border areas, together with our countries and generating new economic circuits", said the Peruvian President at a talk.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five were related to Peru and were on the cross-border ass of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two were seeing a more important connection with the Ecuador, although it had not provided more details.
Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation of Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process of that country will allow its reintegration within the United Nations Union", which is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and well-related relations with its neighbors, is another theme addressed at the Summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said, before starting the region, he hoped to meet his homology of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, the next Saturday in Mexico to discuss the calming of maritime difference through a judge of the CCI requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (same), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega", said President Santos.
"We will review all these ways, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua that will ask for a discussion with this country," said it.
"I hope I can tell President Ortega that we will resolve this as the most civilized and respectful way possible," added President Santos.
The Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they have planned to assist the new President of the country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, within the Summit, the ministers of the Bloc Defence will be first meeting to adopt the 2013 Action Plan, which will enhance dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of the Unasur, although this last country is suspended.
Peru ensures the Presidency for the time of the regional block.
"The South America must learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship", says Rafael Correa.
The Chairman of Equator, Rafael Correa, stated today that the creation of a common citizenship was a goal for which "South America, in this case, had to take example of Europe".
President Correa, who participated in the VI Summit of the United Nations South America (Unasur), located in Lima, declared the State TV, Peru, that the Europeans were "interviewed at the Second World War" and at other conflicts, "but now they were almost a patriarch".
In this sense, he defended the draft establishment of South American citizenship encouraged by the Member States of Unasur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers must be reached in any South America country, as it is already the case for the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactional areas that we want to belong to the past," he warned.
Furthermore, the Equatorian President has demonstrated the reconstitution of the United States of the United States (EEA) to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Sexen States and to take into account the signatories of the San José Pact on Human Rights.
Those who reverse the ears never compromise anything, instead, we, the South Americans, have all signed it.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Human Rights Commission is in Washington under the financing of the United States", he stated, by expressing the political asylum granted by the Equator to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa ensures that he does not regret his decision, because he did not trace his principles, but he, on the contrary, respected his "democratic values and human rights."
He concluded that at the time, " there were suspicions found that Assange would be extracted to a third country and that his proceedings would not be respected."
He also criticizes the Swedish justice that requested it to submit on his territory to a presumed sexual offence, while "the Sweden's own legislation allows to do it by videoconference, which could be done since the Equator's embassy in London".
Correa stated that there was a risk that Assange's mental and physical health deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the embassy told me that he had a small pulmonary problem but nothing serious," said the Equatorian President.
It is possible to deteriorate its physical and mental health by being closed in a small space without being able to exercise free air.
"That works on the health of any one," he concludes.
Correa states that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Equatorial Embassy of London, which would be the assignment of an extra-conduct that would allow him to become in Ecuador, is among the hands of the Great Britain, Sweden and European Judiciary Authorities, and he stressed that it had been discussed in London to find a solution to the opening of the WikiLeaks founder.
We are not negotiating with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there are permanent discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and European Judiciary authorities because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a number of procedures with various European authorities", said he.
And he thinks "if the Great Britain would grant the out-conduit from tomorrow, it would end."
And if Sweden, as it allows it to make its legislation, and as it has already done in other cases, would ask Mr. Assange in the Embassy of Equator in London, or the question would be resolved by Skype tomorrow.
Correa benefited from reaffirming as a defender of the freedom of the press and expressed that what he would not tolerate was "the mediated, the bad faith and the lies that disfellowship the freedom of expression".
"The largest enemy from the freedom of the press are not the wicked or perverse political men, but the bad journalists at the wages of aviation, changing and extortion," he stated.
Under this angle, he welcomed that this is not the type of journalists "not the bankers or the geographic and bourgeois countries that domain in Ecuador" and, instead of putting in front of his choice, "he would enhance the revolution to continue the way and bring the good way."
Correa also supported the decision to keep the paraguay verse within the Onesur at least until the next elections, arguing that the body "deserved to be firm and not tolerated the opportunism and trials of deceased State", since in fact, "he destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguay democracy".
Moreover, the Equatorian President considers the desire of its colombian homolog, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate the maritime limits between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of Haye, which will strengthen Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
At the time, this judgment is not respected.
This is a problem between South America and Central America.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be exceededed by the will of progress together.
We need to solve them in their whole to overcome them and go before.
At the same time, he expressed confidence in the right resolution of the complaint on the maritime borders opposed by Peru and Chile within the same court and said that it was useful that Latin America would introduce international authorities if the two countries agree to accept such a firm judgment.
In reference to the possibility of his presentation as a candidate to the future presidential elections in Equator, in order to blame a third consecutive mandate, he stated that it had the possibility "with much optimism and joy, although it is sometimes sufficiently difficult."
Correa assured that, if he lost the primary of February 2013, he would be removed from public life.
At the personal level, the power has never interested me, but in situations as injust as those of Equator, this socio-economic poverty can only be solved through political power.
"My political movement believed that it was me that guaranteed this possible victory but we must accept this responsibility," he stated.
If I win, it would be my last Presidential mandate and I will then be removed from political life.
If I never forgive us, I'll do it.
"It's my decision," he said.
Correa also refers to the new medical treatment of the President of Venice, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I came to discuss with the Vice-President of Venice Nicolás Maduro and said that a routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a rejection of the health status of President Chávez," he commented.
Today, the Head of Equatorial State has participated in Lima in the VIe Summit of Heads of State and Government of the United Nations of South America (Unasur), which has concluded by a call to better regional integration in order to support progress, equality and security.
The diseases related to AIDS are today due to a late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when the test result was confirmed: seropositive.
"It's like if the sky had shooted me on the head," he said, referring to himself at the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make "my punishable" in vain.
The young man hid him to his family.
He decided to load himself alone of his sickness and began to inform himself about his subject and his loading was like he was to celebrate his 43th anniversary.
It is, without doubt, one of the older patients of the HIV Unit of the Guadalajara Civil Hospital in Guadalajara (HCG), in which it was found in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio lived with human immunodeficiency virus (VIH) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s, where there were many doubts, little treatment choice and more stigmates.
So, even the director of an ISS clinic avoided telling him "for he was without voice".
At that time, having AIDS was synonym of death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, while ignoring their illness, many people are still coming when virus has already caused damage, "uppressed" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the AIDS appearance in the world, in all cases after the first cases reported, "the great victory is now that the survival of a patient has started an appropriate treatment and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same", said the Head of the HCG Unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, and he takes a reference to that information was valided in April of that year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infection and experts in HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists concluded that AIDS was no longer a mortal disease, but that the number of years of survival and life quality depended on the effect level of the immune system that had presented patients at the time of diagnostic, with better perspectives for those who do not consum drugs: up to 30 years of CD4 of 200 and up to 50 years for those who have a rate of 500 CD4.
To speak simply, this means that for someone who had a positive HIV diagnosis for 25 years, "as it will remain under control, he can live without problems until 75 years of age," explained the questionned scientist.
In order to replace this progress in its context, we need to know that the hope of life of Mexico is now a mid-76 years of age.
If it is true that mortality has decreased significantly in the past few years, in Mexico, the number of deceased AIDS follow-up cases occurred in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (see UNAIDS annual report), but 60% of the patients reported on the national database are deceived.
Only in Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths have been killed until May of this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs is universal since 2005.
So why is there still death?
I think the problem is not from access to treatment.
That's how I see him, that's what happened in our hospital.
In the past 12 years, we have never missed medicines, the problem is that patients arrive in very advanced cities because they do not know that they are infected, or then learned to advanced disease cities.
It gives us an indiscutable fact "9 patients on 10 are coming when they are already present a opportunist infection, which is necessary to have a greater impact on global mortality, is to achieve diagnostics more precocely and, therefore, to propose massive detection tests, to all persons requesting it."
The specialists and members of the Council of State for Prevention of the AIDS of Jalisco (Coesida) agreed on its proposal, as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who had to do his detection test in a private laboratory, just because a friend had done it and that, despite his young age, he was already AIDS and suffered from the AIDS sarcome of Caposi, a cancer tumor that is one of the current complications.
All changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die, and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, it's better than I get three times a week," they say, it's not my case.
The change has been profitable, I eat well, I'm doing the exercise, I take my medicines.
To this day, his parents only know that he suffers cancer.
I have a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have many activities, travel, I have an active sexual life, but co-responsive, I take care of me and the other person," says Fabrizio, who accepted to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his witness, those who have fear today, at the walk of the World Day against AIDS.
What they do with the test, if they have taken risks, more they will know if they are serious and better, and if they already have the diagnostic, they must know that we can live like everyone, as responsible for them.
His message resumes the slogan of the AIDS fight in 2012.
Conservations on the container
There are many fosters between health programmes and ordinary citizens, supporting Ricardo Salazar, a journalist of Guadalajara who has caused HIV.
And the largest residence in prevention.
In all places given to this, "we have actually increased the distribution of preservatives, before one or two, now we are given 100 packages, which is very good, but it is, however, that there is still, some have no access to preservatives," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections, adolescents are found.
The question: "What are you going to do?", made with sarcasm and valuable judgments by social workers, guidance advisers, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that adolescents do not want to hear, safeguard the journalist.
It proposes to reorientate this inefficient distribution; not only the preservatives are sold to the counters, but they are found in the distributors of public toilets and in places that are frequent for young people.
It is not to encourage promiscuity.
It is no longer to pay the girls and motel, as the Governor Emilio González had answered when he was asked if there was a distribution of preservatives within his administration.
"This is not how sexuality works, the best is providing preservatives to already sexually active persons", he stressed.
Numbers in Jalisco
13.435 cumulated cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
The State is the fourth country State in number of new cases and cumulated cases of AIDS and 13e for HIV diseases.
92% of contaminations are sexually, 6% per bloodway and 2% per perinnatal ways.
50,000 people live with HIV, as for each case, there are 4 or 5 persons who don't know it.
A ratificated judge by a United States Court ignores the restructuring of the debt of Vitro group permitted by a commercial failite in Mexico. The scenario causes a preceding fashion for all national companies with ramifications in the neighbouring country and with problems of solventivity.
Consequently, the procedures for survival of companies authorized by Mexican law are not valid in the country on the steeled bathroom, in contrast to international agreements.
On a practical point of view, the case taken to the judge was held on June 15 last by Judge Harlin Hale of the Court of Facilities for the Northern Texas district, left the Mexican society without defence against the possibility of embargo of their properties outside the Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow the main manufacturer to see Mexico to introduce the United States Supreme Court on three inconsistence.
First, while the judge of the cause states that creditors must register in accordance with the United States Faility Act, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal, settled by the New Orleans, claims that the main procedure is the formalized commercial failite in Mexico.
The first point would include deniing international procedure cooperation in cases of insolvency of undertakings with transnational profile.
Indeed, the model law of the United Nations International Trade Law Unit was established to this end by taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrary.
Secondly, the judge states that without inter-social votes recognized in the critical mass of trade faillite, the debts contracted by Vitro towards the mother society, most of which could not be obtained for restructuring.
However, Mexico laws recognize that possibility.
In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan.
There is a half-douze examples, including Agremex and Commercial Mexico, of which the Federal Institute of Commercial Facilities had guaranteed debts.
Furthermore, it is sure that, since the votes of the branches remained, Vitro's creditors who were fighting against this in the United States courts, namely, "vautour" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, had not been obtained by the majority.
The vote would be 45 votes against 37.
A date is occupied by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro was burned for the difficult situation since 2008 without stopping the serious economic crisis faced by the United States to affect the costs of the country.
For the moment, the company of the family González Sada will interview the same call court to take place in its entirety, namely with the five judges, since only three were voted.
The insurance appeal shall claim to be non-profit and require the revision of the proceedings by a superior instance, in that case, the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The worst thing is that the Court has ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of the Curiay friend ("ami of the Court") in which Vitro was detailed the procedure followed by the Act on Trade Faility, reporting that it was free of conventions signed by the two countries to put it at the same level as paragraph 15 of the United States Facilities Act.
It also notes that the country has increased the United Nations Commission principles on International Trade, i.e. the rules for cross-border insolvency, which guarantee equality for debitors and creditors.
Carambola of two parties: they are Vitro and they are assigned to the country.
General balance
The complaints of the Association of Aviation of Mexico against the former patron of society, Gastón Azcarrraga Andrade, have been held in silence for several months, which was accused of fraudulent administration, the Syndical Association of Aviator Pilots has already faced problems.
The instance, Chaptered by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, came to submit a criminal application against the National Banking Commission and the Values accused of infringement to justice.
According to him, the Inspection Authority systematically refused to provide information to the Prosecutor General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the entrepreneur to remove the IXE 198 million weight from the Aviation Bank.
The funds would have been used for the purchase of actions of the Professional Administration of Hotels.
As everyone knows, Azkarrraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posdas hotel chain.
They sit the Dragon Mart

Hector "Hetin" Reyes "The basketball is my whole life"
The "Hetin" ball throater, Reyes, has been over 60 years of his life in relation to the field and, thanks to him, traveled in the whole world.
Many people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of the local basket as large as Hector's "Hetten" Reyes.
The reason is that before a cerebral hemorragia condemns it to the routine routine in 2008, Reyes has been subjected to this sport over 60 years, that it is as a low-link player, the national basket team player, the management and leader of the national team, the BSN, with the Bahamon Vaqueros, or as President of the Basketball Federation.
"I have brought several boxes in the basketball all over my life, and even several in the same time, as when I was President of the BSN, Director-General of the National Team and President of the Federation for the 1990s," Reyes recalls at a visit from Firsta Hora at Bayamón, where he resided with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
"The basketball is my whole life."
Reyes doesn't exaggerate when he makes this confirmation.
The walls of his home, almost all decorated from photos and memorys that remember its quote outside standards, witness.
Baamon in the heart
From all his memories, those who are most affected are those who remember him as a player within the Vaqueros team in the middle of the 50s to 1982, after having been 15 years as co-manager or manager of the team.
"Cela was my best years, which I had best benefited because I had the opportunity to participate in eight Vaqueros Championships since 1967, as a manager, co-manager or leader.
This makes many years of satisfaction, including the five deputed Championships from 1971 to 1975.
I was then retired at the Championship in 1981, the year in which Jerome Mincy entered into the BSN team.
From there, "Chuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the head of the team," says Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who was leading here and found at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me: "I have a player costly for you, it measures two meters.
You want it?"
That's how to start Mincy, one of the best players that Puerto Rico had.
Bartow then recommended me Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and was one of the best drivers.
I remember him said if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to bring a championette, Gausse would help us try to get another back.
He joyed the Vaqueros Championship with Gausse, but only at distance because he was already the great maneuver of the Federation in 1988.
At that time, he would prefer to benefit from his charges and charges from the Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we first brought it to the United States during the 1989 pre-olympic tournament of Mexico.
Then, there was the World World of 1990, where we arrived fourth and where we had had to report the bronze medal if this Canadian judge had not made us rejoicing the last match, Reyes said.
Is the World Team of 1990 the best national team you've seen?
It is part of the best, as well as those who fighted the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite is the of the Cuban Panamilian Games in 1991, when we brought the gold and we put a race to the United States team, which was quite similar to the one who had returned the bronze during the Worldwide.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculino" (Ortiz), but also the young people (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, Leon brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend in the world for a problem of genoux.
A team that may not be the best in terms of individuals, but she gave us a gold medaille and a great joy during the Newcene Pre-Olympic tournoi in Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Paul Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner Rolando Hourruitiner in replacement of players suspended by the Mare of the Plata, we returned the gold against all pronostics.
What was the best player of Puerto Rico?
Uncertainly, this is Piculin Ortiz.
His statistics at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as Piculín did.
And this without taking into account his trajector in the different links he played.
Who was the best portorican leader?
It's very difficult to say.
We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armageddon Torres.
In young people, I love Leo Arill's work.
What is your greatest success within the Federation?
As part of the most glorious time of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the NSA was up to 17 teams in a season.
What are you gonna do?
There are things that I would like to establish, such as regionalization of minor categories.
For example, Ponce's boys play only in their area and face teams of the other island coins during national play-offs.
Today, youths are traveling and playing too much while this is not strongly necessary.
I have at least seen the advantage of binding certificates and courses for leaders, field staff and arbitration.
That makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
Generally, I listen to music, look at my time clips on YouTube, I benefit my little kids, and, at times, I'm siting at basketball games.
And of course, I benefit from my wife's companion, Isabel, who has always been on my sides.
Larry Hagman's Actor's death
Larry Hagman, born 21 September 1931, was worldwide known by John Ross Ewing's main role, which was known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he was incarcerated a man of business without sculptures, roots and manipulators.
Larry Hagman, whose role of snipped oil, J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of snake in the 1980s.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who was returned this year in the role of J.R in a new "Dallas" season, was deceived on Thursday nights of cancer complications, according to a reporter of the family sent to the associated Press for Warner Bros., production house of "Dallas".
"Larry was returning to his loved native city of Dallas, playing again the iranic role he loved the most", said the family.
Larry's family and his neighbor friends were with him in Dallas on the holiday of Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who interviewed his wife's role in the original series and later, was with Hagman when he died in a hospital of Dallas, declared his press attachment, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all those who knew him.
He was creative, generous, sweet, sweet and talentous, and he'll miss me much.
"It was a person of exception and he lived in the back of life," said Gray in a communication.
The doctors had diagnosed a hepatic surgery in Larry Hagman in 1992 and recognized a lot of bus for many years.
In 1995, he had been detected a malicious tumor in the fire and he had been shocked.
A few years before "Dallas", Hagman was known to the television in the role of a normal type in the "Jinny of my dreams" series distributed by the NBC chain from 1965 to 1970.
In that way, he was the role of Captain Tony Nelson, a astronomy whose life was transformed when he discovered a seducidant genie, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and that he had returned to his home.
He also played in two commodities that have remained a little time at the antena, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among his roles in the cinema, the critical roles are found in "The group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But this was thanks to his magistrate interpretation of the detective J.R. that Larry Hagman had known his greatest success.
The dramatic series of the CBS chain on the Ewing clan and their neighbors were distributed from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who killed J.R.?", invented to maintain the suspension around a full episode of emotions in which Haagman's personality is almost killed, generated speculations in the whole world and millions of dollars played in paris.
Thanks to this, among others, the series reached a hearing record at this time.
When the response was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million televisioners were in the mean front of their screen and made "Dallas" the second divertissement program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million televisioners.
It was J.R., Christin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him up.
J.R. was pregnant and then threatened to condemn him of prostitution if it did not leave the city, but others had also reasons for attacking it.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable man but in the charismatic smile: a malhonned entrepreneur and a unfaithful wife who tried to interrupte his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what would be to be epitaphe for J.R," said Hagman in 1988.
We should write: "The honourable citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only part he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-protagonist of the original series, recalled that Friday of Hagman as a man "whood, both on the small and lives."
It is unforgettable, and unreasonable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the heart of each of us, who had the opportunity to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" have been distributed just a few months ago with a great success on the TNT chain.
The record of five episodes is already finished for the second season, and one sixth is being achieved, reported the chain.
For the moment, nor Warner no TNT chain has reported how Hagman's death will be integrated in the series.
Original Fort Wordh in Texas, he is the son of the actor and sing Mary Martin, who knows the celebration with classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a youth when she gave her the day in 1931 while she was married to the lawyer Ben Hagman.
He took his first steps on the New York theatre scenes at the beginning of the 1950s, then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
That's where he met the Sweden's young decorator Maj Axelsson and he married him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived many years in the Californian city of Malibu, where he lived in many celebrations.
In 2001, he mentioned his memories "Hello Darlin": Tall (and absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (France: Hello Darlin): J.R's impossible memories)
"I haven't written anything in this book that could hurt someone or affect it in any way," he said at the press at that time.
After his bleeding, he became an active military of the donation of organs and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist in the concerned patients.
"I advise them, I reward their trust, and I come with them when they come to work and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer them a little comfort, such as "Do not be afraid, it's not easy for a little, but it's okay."
He was also fighting against smoke and participated in several campaigns.
A course treating the "the Fine of the World" comes to start
Each week, students explore philosophysics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germes and climate warming.
This semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Charmen decided to give a course at the end of the world, he knew that he was launching an unreasonable hame: the end of the "grand Depth" of the calendar Maya on December 21, which refers to many people as the evidence of the end of the imminent world.
But Professor Charmen had no idea of what was expected in the following months: the catastrophic Sandy, a fiscal gouffer that some called "The Armageddon of Debt" and a growing conflict in Israel, the place where Christian theocratics at the end of the time thought that the apocalypse would be deployed.
"I didn't realize that this would be the most apocalyptical semestre I never known," said Professor Charme this week at his students of the Rutger-Camden University (New Jersey).
If we analyze what happened in the world today, like if we were 30 days later and we were talking about it, it was a very good time.
And it must be remembered that what is bad is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.
And it is not the only professor to give courses on "the end of the world" this semester, which will, in the theory, be the last of the history.
In Temple, Adjunct Professor Barry Vacker deals with the course "Medias, cultures and ends of the world".
Each week, students explore philosophysics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germes and climate warming.
"We analyze this because these ideas proliferate with time," he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios leads a certain human behavior.
If nuclear weapons fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, war could be cut off.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared with examples of real life.
"I tried to inform my students about what was possible, likely, believeable and impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of the University of State of Pennsylvania, Professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjoint professor of History of Art and Anthropology, have done a team to give a course, just called "The end of the world".
"We add "2012" to have the opportunity to give the course again, if the world would not disappear", said Professor Restall.
Despite the "imminent disaster", students must study, create projects and carry out their final reviews.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final examination will be carried out the old of the Apocalypse, which does not leave students from another choice than to work "to the evening of the end of the proposed world", said Restall.
The courses have been quite popular.
"He was complete in two hours," said Restall about his course for high-level students, composed of 35 students.
We received posts by email several weeks before the beginning of the semestre, from people who asked if there was still a place.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting ones.
"I'm fascinated to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves," says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student of religion and social age, originating in Haddonfield, New Jersey, the University of Rutger-Camden.
Because the fear of the Apocalypse, that it is secular or religious, is only a question of comfort, or absence of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a student in Psychology and 25-year-old nurse, claims to have seen all the pharmaceutical films.
"I never heard about a course that taught this matter," he said.
I appreciate it.
But no students asked, and still less a professor, said to believe in the end date of the world of December 21.
"Our first project was the maya prophecy, and in a certain way we have discredited it", says Julie Zegle, student last year in Temple, 21 years old and originating West Chester.
Mayas has never predicted the end of the world, it is only a key date on the calendar, said Restall.
But I agree that there is anxiety related to the apocalypse in Western culture, which makes people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a shore of these speculations.
"In other places of the world, people don't think about this," he says.
This is in most of the anglophone world.
Joseph Duugherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Sala, who gives courses to the Philippians this year, quickly answered when he was asked if he knew that we were given the courses on "the end of the world".
"The Philippians do not participate at the end of the world", he answered us, as if it was an exception from an superior authority.
We've got a thanks for Dad.
Restall notes that at the end of the years, many dates were spoken of the last judgment, and he states that if nothing happens on December 21, "the people will start thinking immediately on the next date" or philosopher about the fact that 21 December marks the beginning of a period of seven years at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date to light.
Many of us said they thought they were going to celebrate the end of the world.
"Fourday, I call friends and we strike together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student student.
