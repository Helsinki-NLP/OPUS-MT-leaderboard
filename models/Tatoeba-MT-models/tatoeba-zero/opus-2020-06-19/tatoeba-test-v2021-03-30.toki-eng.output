Anal sex or anal intercourse is generally the insertion and thrusting of the erect penis into a person's anus, or anus and rectum, for sexual pleasure.[1][2][3] Other forms of anal sex include fingering, the use of sex toys for anal penetration, oral sex performed on the anus (anilingus), and pegging.[4][5] Although the term anal sex most commonly means penile-anal penetration,[3][4][6] sources sometimes use the term anal intercourse to refer exclusively to penile-anal penetration, and anal sex to refer to any form of anal sexual activity, especially between pairings as opposed to anal masturbation.[6]

I want my sound and my name.
I know the moku and the screen of Mom.
I'm trying to smell the jan pop.
I'm going to shoot him down and I'm swearing.
He's smelling, and it's gonna make me that smell out.
He's dark, but he's sweet us.
Let's try, I'm laughing up.
Mommy's gonna be the same.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm cut up and take a leg.
I know my sweet shoes. You smell me.
And Elopa stripped him, and we: the sun he swim and the ma.
I slew thyself, and we; and I sweared the stone.
But it's a big pound, but I'm taking it.
That's the sweet snake.
He's going to get us to Waton.
I don't know him.
Pun.
