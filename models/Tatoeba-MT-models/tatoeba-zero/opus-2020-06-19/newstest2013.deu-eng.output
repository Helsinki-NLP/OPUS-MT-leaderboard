A Republican strategy to join Obama's re-electment
The representatives of the Republicns justify their policies with the need to combat electoral abuse.
However, the Brennan Center last for a mytho, confirming that election fraud in the United States is more rare than the number of people killed by the slaughter.
The lawyers of the Republicans have registered only 300 cases of electoral abuse in the United States in 10 years.
One is sure: these new provisions will affect the participation of the election.
In this sense, these measures are partly undertaken by the US democratic system.
On the contrary to Canada, the United States are responsible for the implementation of elections in each State.
In this sense, the majority of American governments has been declared new laws which are subject to registration or urgency procedures since 2009.
These phenomena were important after the elections of November 2010, where 675 new Republicn representatives could have been signed in 26 States.
Accordingly, 180 legislative proposals were introduced only in 2011, which limit the exercise of the election law in 41 States.
The new election laws require the elections to present a light image and a evidence of the United States citizenship.
Furthermore, these laws are reduced by the periods for the premature allocation, which is invalid to declare the right to be registered as elections on the electoral day, and the State citizens vote the election law for which a court case is entitled.
Before the elections of 2006, the United States did not request the electors to present a light image reference.
Indiana was the first state of the state who had taken one of the such demands.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the United States confirmed in 2008 the Constitutionality of the Indiana Act.
The Republicn authorities intended to extend this practice to other States.
During the last two years, they promoted legislative designs in 34 states with which the elections were obliged to present a light image reference.
It is important that the U.S. citizens, in contrast to Quebec, do not have a universal reference card such as hospital insurance cards.
In fact, 11% of the U.S. citizens have 21 million persons who have no information from a government authority of their State.
Furthermore, five million Novels have no indication in 2012.
However, more than hundred dollars are often paid to the necessary evidence.
With the new restrictions, young people, minorities and persons with low income are insufficiently affected.
In fact, 25% of the Africans have, 15% of people with a revenue of less than $35,000, 18% of the citizens over 65 years and 20% of the elections between 18 and 29 years do not have the necessary light image.
That's still enough.
Students who are viewed as electors who have their voice for democratic candidates are not allowed in several States to use their light image information issued by their institutions.
On the other hand, the same Member States allow the members of Angel or Jagd agreements to choose more for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these associations for elections.
There was no State for the choice of the State citizens before 2004.
Arizona was the first state of the state which introduced one such demand.
Since 2011, twelve States have adopted laws that request the electors to demonstrate their State citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Spanish votes.
Because it is on the hand that two of three Spanish electors are to prefer the Democratic Party.
Furthermore, the Republican legislators in 2011 have promoted eight Federal States laws which have been made the registration of elections on the electoral day.
Furthermore, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide their choices for help to register themselves.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns in the election registered in the general elections of 2004 have contributed to register about 10 million state citizens.
The measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the share of the registration of neo-electors in 2010 compared to 2006 by 17%.
Furthermore, the Republicn lawyers have adopted laws in five other states to reduce the period for the premature period.
For example, in the 2008 general elections in Florida 33% of the elections that were previously chosen, Africans, although only 13% of the electors of the Federal State were elected.
Similar applies to the Spanish population.
The latter only made 11% of the elections, but 24% of the citizens who had previously chosen.
On the contrary, the whites, which represented 76% of the electors, only 46% of the choices chosen in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their appealers have endeavoured the adoption of laws which limit the registration of the electioners.
several legislative designs have been blocked by the veto of the democratic governance.
The U.S. General law engaged in implementing the most enormous laws.
They were able to limit the damage partly.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have adopted laws that require a light-screen form.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will, unfortunately, denied the exercise of the election law.
Democratic critics tend to adopt the partial political nature of the adopted laws and consider in them clearly the impact of the results in the countries employed for 2012.
A report of the Brennan Centre of 2011 shows that those States who have adopted these laws are 171 of the 270 votes required in the election-member body to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with consciousness that these amendments of legislation in the election system will have significant impact on the results of the election election in 2012.
But one is sure: these new provisions will affect the participation of the election.
In this sense, these measures are partly undertaken by the US democratic system.
Prostatatic fuels recognition: should the test be made or not?
In fact, the PSA test is wise, sometimes, to mislead results, with false negative or even false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical attacks.
This leads to stronger teeths of the already undetermined men to carry out early recognition tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We got the opinion of two experts.
In the studies carried out in the United States, there were numerous factors between the control groups, so that it is difficult to interpret these data and give clear recommendations.
A further study, this time from Europe, concluded that there was a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early recognition.
This study has also shown that the probability of the education of metastasis is up to 30 to 40% when no early recognition was performed.
So I recommend the test from a 50-year-old or 40-year-old age when you have a direct relationship that has already been ill with prostat reabs.
Many of Africans also have a higher risk.
The most important is to take the right decision when a cancer disease was recognised.
There are cancers that are aggressive and other indolent.
The patients should really be aware of the risk of his cancer disease by showing the possible options in which prostat can be treated if it does not affect life quality on long terms, and in these cases, they are decided to be actively monitored.
Today, many men who have recognized cancer are not treated because their cancer is not aggressive and no threat for their life.
They are proposed for an active monitoring and are offered to be treated when the disease continues.
The criteria for a decision, who should be treated and who is not.
However, I recommend the implementation of the test.
But most important is to talk to his doctor to determine whether it should be performed or not.
In cooperation with the international urology society, Movember has developed a tool that is possible to evaluate the PSA tests and parts.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no wonderful means to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress in the research, the adoption of a healthy way of life remains the best way to reduce the risk to heal.
It is estimated that 30% of cancer diseases could be prevented if all would eat well and move sufficiently.
"If no smoking anymore, this value would increase at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, speaker of the Canadian cancer society.
However, it is estimated that about 10% of cancer diseases are caused by disorders.
Many remain totally unexpected.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tabak dependence remains a priority, despite the decline of the number of fums.
The smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of lungs cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It hurts the health of humans.
"Actually there is 1,5 million smokers in Quebec," the speaker André Beaulieu regrets.
Munitional data: 10 years after smoking, the risk of cancer is reduced by half of the smoke.
The weight
According to Canadian Cancer Society, overwhelming and addipositis also promotes the slowness of disease.
They seem to increase the risk of breast-, grimmdarm, mastdarm, sperm, sweet skin and skin cancer.
"The research shows that a regular physical activity is protected during the whole life of grimmdarm cancer," he adds.
Food
The organization also recommends to limit the supply of red meat.
In too large quantity, it increases the risk of healing to a grimm or massive cancer.
It should also be measured.
The conservation of meat by pulling, troops, or salts may lead to education of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body cells and lead to cancer development," he says.
Vitamine
In recent years, several scientists have studied the relationship between vitamin additives and cancer.
Your investigations aren't now clear.
After the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E are opposed.
While a study revealed the reduction in the risk of prostatatic drugs, another increased.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer was also not clearly shown.
Moreover, Mr Beaulieu emphasizes the importance of speaking with his doctor about his concerns and his family precautions.
"The implementation of an early recognition test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs Boson analyzed
The proclamation of the likely discovery of the Higgs Boson last summer has brought a certain view, and this is for good reason.
It is believed that this boson is not less involved in the mechanism that is responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last part of which the existence of the standard model - our best or "minutely wrong" declaration of nature and the behaviour of the material - was predicted, but is still not observed.
But for the physician, it's not completely sure that it's really about the Higgs.
We know without the shadows of a doubt that we have a real new part, and that it is strongly different from the Higgs Boson predicted by the standard model.
Furthermore, this seems to be confirmed by new data that have been presented in Kyoto this week in a large physical convergence, but there is no further data to be completely secure.
However, let's say that it's actually about the Higgs, because it's likely only a low risk to smile, and we're looking at what's going on.
There is a pregnant law in this world, which affects that two objects can not exist at the same place.
It is not possible to hide this rules - and try not to be too strong because you're gonna be hurted.
Because even if the physics are a very strange world, it is found that they also apply to such a law: the Paul's exclusion principle, which indicates that two parts are not able to place the same room at the same time, if they are in the same "quanten state" in which this "through" exists in the great and whole of their properties.
The physicians start to share the parts in two categories.
There are the good citizens who are called Ferrenia and obedient to the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the bosoms move, a bad band of anarchists who are nothing holy - in any case not this principle, which means that they can actually be located at the same place at the same time.
These bosons are involved in two groups, according to the Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Labs, which is absolutely surprising: the mesons we are not treated here and the "contract parts" by which the great forces of the nature would be distributed, and with which the Higgs Boson would be somewhat related.
But it must be emphasized here that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures as you can.
If you are able to read this chronic, then only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banity: the photos or the "light part" that is the "boat" of the electronic magnetic power.
Indeed, if a part of an electrical load accelerates or changes the direction, the electromagnetic field will be "stricked" in this place, like a kitchen stone that has been cast into a teacher.
This "distortion" consists of an electronic magnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and these waves are nothing else than a photo and thus one of the bosons "Trader of the power".
Field Stables
Similarly, for the Higgs Boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "stoped" so that this boss is shown.
However, the higgs field is very stable than the electronic magnetic field; the rider must reach very high energy, a little comparable to a frozen thick, which could only be shocked by a very large rock.
The large Hadron Collider is a ring with a range of 27 km! - to reach such energy.
The analysis with the electronic magnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
They are in fact not all parts and not all materials that interact with the electronic magnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a paper would never hold on the fridge.
And at the same time, not all parts with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while the others (as otherwise the photon) do not have mass.
What can all these research now be good, Mrs. Plamondon asks?
For science, they will also be able to review the standard model (SM) and to investigate the physicians all differences between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
Otherwise, there are many physicians who are most likely to hope that such disappearances are found, since the smallest difference is opening a door to a "new Physic" and could stop some of the model.
It must be said that the last is still large, since there is no declaration for weakness (ups!) and the dark material that forms about 80% of the material of the universe (repeat ups!).
However, the CERN has not been found such derogations until now.
Impacts
The impact of these research on general populations is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to accept that there is no injury.
Moreover, in the early 60s, the Laser Pionierers did not have the shock of the Bell Lab that their works would solve such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
Indeed, the murdered physician Willard Boyle, who worked in the Bell Labs, where the Laser was found in the 1960s, and the 1962 itself developed the first long-term layer (the first was pulled) - said that the Laser was first considered as a "Laser player".
You're going to think about...
Furthermore, applications can also be provided from all instruments of research.
For example, Willard Boyle has developed a small light sensor during its works in the optic.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor today serves all digital cameras worldwide as "auge" and has put him 2009 the Nobel Price for Physics.
Of course, this does not mean that LHC's activities will have to change our life, but it means that you can never really know it...
Palliatian farms - the best way to die...
With its Committee for "Deads in Honor", Quebec recently discussed the heavy question of the end of life.
The debate must be reinscribed in short, although a draft legislation is prepared.
However, there is still much to do in this important topic.
Le Devoir tried to look closer to this.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. still lived in his apartment in Monteregie.
The prostatatic rabbit, who surrendered him, had left him a duration of two years.
"He gave me five years of life, I did seven years," he said half in his bed for Palliativ Gadbois Victor in Beloeil, where he was coming on Friday.
"But it's always a shock, you can't prepare it," he says.
The disease makes its work: an unexpected weakness prevents him to go alone to the toilet and even to eat yourself.
On the table before a sweet dinner sit down, he wants to appoint to help himself to eat.
It is courageous to smile him, even to speak to the aliens who are busy to him, to bring him his medicine, and offer him a bathroom.
The courage of the ordinary death.
"My biggest desire is that you can heal my disaster, since this is humble," he shares.
A few hours later, the team found a medication for this evil.
"In the course of our life we learn that a man pinks in the stairs," said Peter Brodeur, psychologist at home Victor Gadbois.
Return in childhood phase is unacceptable for certain people.
"The matter of the ability of the person," a backup states it.
Because many people who work in the Palliatian Hall find great events in the midst of this decline.
Patients who are placed in the home for Palliatic Gadbois Victor are all suffering from cancer.
You have a maximum life expectation of three months.
In this stadium, they will not exceed by the doctors and sick sicks who care for them, with such called "healths".
For Ms. A., 89 years of age, the worst fear to die "conscious and smiling."
But because of the disease, I really learned my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I didn't want any more in life," she says before she accepts that you're putting her a mask that helps her at breath.
Nevertheless, in the next days she waits for a last visit to her son, who comes from Italy.
In home Victor Gadbois, you are offered with a group of voluntary body workers and helping at food.
The Palliative Board will then be used if there is no other possibilities.
To train the death employee.
In Quebec at 11.700 inhabitants comes a bed for the Palliat clubs.
It's very little when you take into account that we're all going to die one day.
Here, the life will be continued under the best conditions, says Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
At the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
You are granted to the dead side, after desire, a lion with Brandy or Pepsi.
Diabeticers do not need to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of the day.
Last night, we have served Mr. X a beer who died during the night.
Tonight, his son will strike the beer into the feet of the dead.
"We help familyes and patients simultaneously", reports Director Nathalie Savard.
In home Victor Gadbois is not a day like the other.
In addition to a 93-year-old man who enjoys the last family meeting in the court and is well based on his headworks while you get to his honour, a young man of 36 years died by his parents, his wife and his two small children in tragic way after he tried to survive.
"The three to five beds have always been involved with cancer patients under less than 45 years of age," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients in home Victor Gadbois are from their residence place, 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative duties
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative work, i.e., to an affliction that should be lifted by patients when the end station has reached their life, both at home, in hospital or in a household.
And several organizations, such as the home Victor Gadbois and the society for smiling palliative palliatives in Montreal, specialize themselves more or less exclusively on cancer patients.
Exactly this great inadequacy in the healthcare Quebecs ensures that several in the Palliative College specialized doctors are concerned with the adoption of a law on death aid and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifest has been signed in the circle, which has been signed by prominent personalities of Palliativ's Palliati Philippines, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, to see their resistance to a such initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the health system Quebecs is not enough to ensure that all right to high-quality palliative workers are entitled to overcome death aid before you are accepted.
Soon, she says, I have seen a patient who had suffered 14 days with great pain in the emergency without having taken action towards her leverage.
I am afraid that patients only want to die because they do not receive appropriate health care.
And at the same time, several disorders have been treated by their patients, despite the worst prognosis of their patients to the last day.
The survivors of Helen Richard were at least when she broke a shocking chemotherapy.
When I told my officer that I would break the treatment, she answered me that she was sorry that I had taken the battle, she told me.
But she told me that I'm at the end!
No Onipotent Pflege
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who have requested to die are grateful for this desire has not been given after their pains were covered by a team of palliative workshops.
However, it should be clear that palliative employees in the treatment of pain are not omnipotent.
After Elsie Monereau, Leader of the Palliative Employees of the Society of Monreal Palliative Palliatives, 8% of the patients do not speak to a pain treatment.
Thus, at the end of the life, the doctors are often back to the terminal degradation that continues to cut the patients spotically or permanently until the time of their death.
We can't do so longer than if we do this side of suffering.
Patients without pain dysfunction will always have the possibility of restraining this terminal seed.
Patients whose pain is not painful, all say the same word: "I want to die."
But that doesn't mean pregnant, "I want you to smell me," but "I want to be cut off my pain."
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism of Canadian Health Institute.
Real estate channels great size in Quebec
Employees of the Roadbuilding Agency, firms of the building company, money funds of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia are told every day what they know about a great "system" in the construction industry, officers, politicians, workers and mafioso.
A "industrie", which was very costly for the tax number of Quebecs, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's wonderful how the system has been destroyed since you have taken drastic measures", said Jacques Duchesneau, deputy in Quebec and former leader of the police of Montreal.
The skandal was found by him due to an initial investigation of distortion in relation to the contracts on road construction in Quebec, which was only contrary to the former Prime Minister.
The "Ducheswave Report" launched a direct connection between industry, secret financing of parties and assessment of officials.
"Seen from the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he stressed that the Ministry of Transport was divided to the contracts a billion dollars alone, because some of them gave their instinct to receive their shares!
The Charbonneau Commission, "it has already taken two citizens", adds, in the hope that you have been able to show the tactics behind the individuals.
A 2011 called into life, permanent anti-corruption unit
The 2011 life-related anti-corruption unit is also undergoing great efforts with its troops to economic, research and analysis of the government.
In addition, police members of the "Marteau Group" who have been influenced since 2009 that the "Canalization Cartell" of Montreal remains more continuing in the art of the contracts...
In the last few weeks, she has pursuely investigated households and accused of fraud and corruption against communal mandates such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, the citizensman of a city.
The next list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who was just returned from his office as the chief of Laval, the third largest town of Quebecs.
It is suspected to have repeated the exchange of public contracts in the exchange.
On the other hand, the engineering of Montreal's road construction office was expressly accused, as well as Italian entrepreneurs, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Z area.
Lastly, it has been noted by the Commission by declaring the functionality of the "system" for the retaining of public contracts.
He himself has paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal for a committee connected to the mafia, which transferred the money to the Montreal Union, the party of Master Gérald Tremblay.
Mr Zrang has had his hand in the whole of the 2000s, with more than 88.000 Canadian dollars (a. 68.000 euros) to provincial parties, especially those who were at the time of the power.
He also intended to have organized illegal resources for the former liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Canadianization contracts whose costs were artificially discharged by him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption was unresolved.
The former Builder Gilles Surprenant describes this by the Commission in 10 years: in ten years he received the firm's gifts, invitations to travel, golf turns, restaurants and Eishockey games, as well as the cost of $736,000 as an opponent for changing contracts whose cost was artificially limited.
Other officials of the roadbuilding office have demonstrated that they were smelling by maintaining the accounts with false additional services in art by 30 to 40%.
In addition, a civil minister, Martin Dumont, accused of Mr Tremblay, that he had seen a shadow budget that filled his boxes with black shoes.
As a result of these enthusiasms, Mr Tremblay came back in the beginning of November, which triggered Montreal in a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first members of Montreal, the alarm.
As citizensman of the city district Rivière-des-Priries, in the east of the island, settled from 2010 against the sale of a community base that for $5 million was purchased and sold for $1,6 million in the booming real estate market.
70% black payment in the election campaigns
The survey, which is lastly implemented, says that it is "in a faden that allows it to understand the functionality of the systems undergoing by aminces to stop the evil and approve the debts."
She says that the procedure is painful but positive.
However, we are in order to smell the wounds, only one for Montreal's determination unit, as well as a supervisory to prevent the return of the fragile practices.
How to make you clean.
Regular.
Jacques Duchesneau notes on the other hand that "secure of hundreds of millions of dollars have stolen", but especially thinks about the role of the "managers who are over the tactics in the images" if they were not in the fraud!
From 70% black payment in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he said: "It was said that this is only a weak decrease of reality."
The Government of Quebecs proposes to limit the costs of the parties to $100, which would therefore not change the situation: "When the electoral contributions are not strictly limited, black payment will be in the policy."
He recommends a complete revision of the system for the delivery of public contracts and the financing of the parties: "We can't deeply fall; through we go to the things with courage, we can rebuild the house on a stronger basis with more controls and laws."
If this story hurts the international view of Quebecs and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau requests those who laugh to make a look in their own court...
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
In this season you adopted a new scale with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
You can explain it through a personal view, but also through the new PSG dimension.
Great players have come.
I will make progress every day at her side.
The technical personnel has also given me a lot.
These elements encourage me every day to improve my game level.
And with a game this is easier.
Everything's going very fast in the football.
But I don't want to smell.
Since my starts in the center of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine until my game time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made progress slowly.
So you use the competitiveness introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new entries of this summer are intended to make games very high levels.
You also know that every training unit is expressive.
This makes a player like me to offer the shoes and wants to give his best.
Moreover, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my game position.
He is supported by co-trainers as Claude Makelele, who played on the same position as I.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Surely.
Acinglotti's respect for all technicians.
There is no comparable person in the link 1 currently, and it is among the best trainers of Europe.
He looks back to a rich experience and wins many titles with spectacles.
He had a contact with a big player.
I think he will win another title in Paris.
In January, I brought him a encouraged conversation.
That's why I just took me from a assault series.
The confidence he has put in me is also a statement for my performance.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took us the place of the Pitcenter.
But we're in the maintenance.
One of our most important goals is the League Champions: we have qualificated us in this way for the acetilfinal.
What is the objective of the Agreement in this competition?
We'll try to come as far as possible.
From now to now everything is possible.
However, we will have to contact our words against very good Europeans.
First of all, we want to be our first group before Porto so that we can turn back the acetelfinal as a home game.
Can the PSG become a major European agreement in short view?
He already has the budget for...
In order to become a large European agreement, Paris has to win and make a name long-term.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG provides the resources to adopt concrete forms of this project.
Would it be a great misconduct to not win the title in Liga 1 as this was in the last season?
Of course, this would be a great deal.
This year, we are really in the heart of resigning this title.
In the last season, we were closer to it.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to bring the victory.
We have finished the season with a very strong performance.
We closed 79 points.
Normally, you should be master with 79 points...
But another manage, that of Montpellier, has achieved a better season.
I think this year is the right thing.
Even if the large dimensions such as Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are ringing around the title, I think we have the evidence of winning him.
Do you think that the media is waiting too much from the PSG?
In view of what is invested and the players we have, it is normal that many of us are expected.
We accept that completely.
However, if we win in a home game against Troyes 4-0, and we still find something you can think about us, this is something frustrating with security.
You're wondering what people still expect.
We could never win each weekend with 4-0.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to make a game concept.
A manage builds up with time.
In the League Champions, we have proved strength.
Consider Manchester City, an agreement that has not been able to qualify for the axel final, and has also performed huge expenditure!
As regards the invested sums, you were believed to play break with 15 points prepassing!
This means that our enemies and the French mastership would be left out of eight.
Lyon and Marseille, who weren't good in the last season, were bought by this new PSG.
This shows that the link 1 is quiet.
I hope we will be the laugh winner in May and say that we have finally won them, despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be completely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So better you're talking about "Tratan's dependence."
That means that Ibrahimovic is power-stark and many towers shoot.
That's why he came and proves that he's the star of the Ligue 1.
All over there where he played, he led to his eyes that he's a great player and a world star.
We respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the persons who turn him to him.
What he did is really extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their game level.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders world, allows all others to make progress.
How have you experienced the EM 2012 with the French nationality?
Like an enthusiasm.
It was in my heart to participate in this EM.
Unfortunately, I was hindering my injury to exclaim a little time of game.
I've seen things that I've been strengthened.
Today I can make good games in the nationality.
This was my hope since my baptism with the "Bleus".
From what happened in Ukraine, we have taught our teachings, and today we need to make an illustrative behavior.
What opinion do you have about the first months of Didier Deschanmp at the sight of "Blue"?
He has achieved a lot of promised results.
We have a good position in the WM qualification group.
The national trainer is strict, close to the players and strict to win.
Like it was Laurent White.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
White had reached his goal by he had qualified us for the EM.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the "Blue" to Brazil.
Is this a shock game in Spain on 16 October (1:1)?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has been used for everybody else.
I have never experienced a comparable game in my career before this meeting in Spain.
With Bitcoin it is possible to pay and sell without bank
The contrast of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between the parties.
Furthermore, as often in these technologies, a political vision is incredible: the conviction that the current monetary system established by bankmonopols leads to financial crisis.
Indeed, the Bitcoin founded by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (and more in $, Euro, etc.) and a protocol for safe exchange like BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network, about 200,000 transactions were already undertaken.
Some thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a spend or as a payment fund.
After the Bitcoin course reached a maximum of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, he went up to $2 months later before he received about ten dollars today (the courses are listed on the Bitcoincharts.com website).
There is no particular impression in comparison with the world trade of real currencies or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "excellent currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies, such as the "credits", which are used to advance in a video game that can be wined or buyed by games (and sometimes turn back).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, the trade is controlled and processed every time by a central authority.
With Bitcoin, all network notes are simultaneously conservators of the account book, checker, money employees and buyers and salers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually placed between two email addresses in a form of email.
With the difference that the user can choose another address for each payment, which guarantees the anonymity.
A series of data related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can review the authenticity of the transaction.
Using the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the treated bitcoins are available in the public account book distributed in the entire network.
The crucial step is to introduce this new transaction in this book.
This is about a mathematical task that is started on the computers, with the winner who is a type of provisional central banker, the privacy has to add this additional line.
It's a sequence of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and clear electronic finger print.
The computer "adopt" the new transaction and adds a number before the whole "hacked".
The goal is to find the number that meets a special finger print (more none at the beginning).
If this number was found, the other buttons can be checked without any of the right.
The transaction is therefore permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the finger impression.
If one user wants to pay two times very quickly (for than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions from the network would be validated and the other remains without linking, as both threshold presses have different.
The computer that solved the task receives 50 bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is regularly half, probably before the end of 2012.
The Bitcoins in the round are therefore limited to 21 million, but it is possible to share to a hundred billion system, which allows a certain playspace...
Furthermore, the difficulty of the task will be increased with each improvement of the account performance.
The life of the network has already been high and deep.
The websites that provide Bitcoin services were attacked and stolen the Bitcoin devices.
"The useful weakness office does not relate to the actual protocol," says Peter Noizat, who just introduced a paymium, which is a company for payment with real money and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports about the possibilities of the currency through this anonymous service.
Nevertheless, Bargeld also decreased this squad.
Important actors such as Wikipedia reject the costs of this type.
Others like the Blog platform WordPress are accepted.
Soon Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel have analyzed the account book and showed that almost 80% of Bitcoins are not around.
A "Mega final sale" was started in November.
"truety thousand dollars were shocked", Jon Holmquist, who works for the Coinabul company, converts Bitcoins in gold.
Peter Noizat, who is also the author of a book on this currency, believes the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His Paytunia system corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or an uncontact payment with a mobile phone, but Bitcoin uses Bitcoin to verify the transactions that are more valuable.
Furthermore, the holder has managed its identity and may therefore be anonymed.
The system can be easily implemented by handlers, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just need to specify a address that can be "food and recognised" by a phone, gives Peter Noizat that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend in which hierarchic systems are overwhelmed for the most horizontally orientated systems.
"It will take some time until Bitcoin is carried out, but 2013 might be a point of shift", he prognoses.
The ECB, in its report, also proposes a new assessment of the different today's high-speed risks in the case of success of this currency.
We're out of Afghan.
And then?
French troops have left their responsibilities in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US should be followed at the end of 2014.
It is at the time that the Afghan army recovered the ownership of its territory, and that the Afghan people decided to decide their future without expecting everything from us.
We have particularly punished the Afghan farmers by seeing them as terrorists.
And himself with our 88 murdered soldiers, as well as the lost and injured.
The Taliban is from foreign extremist, former leaders fled to Pakistan, but often from farmers who refuse a weakened foreign presence as at the time of the Soviet.
They want to defend their centuries of age and archaetic traditions, even though they have been connected to Dschihadists, Pakistanians, Arabs, Usbeks and Tadshikians.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local cities, the latter will not be there when the Western countries are discreted.
The disappearance of the French troops from the fund point in Nijrab, which I have observed by a heavy planted hill with mandel trees, which was financed by French credits correctly.
The swimming car and panzer convoices of Hub slaughter have reached cabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014, it will not be given any of the Talibans in Kabul.
From 1994 to 1996, the conditions changed.
Cabul was empty and the country was overwhelming because of the struggle of the various groups of the war.
Their authority was then considered as a type of release and return to security.
The Afghan women have paid the price for obscurantism of the farmers overwhelmed by the Al-Qaida organization, but their situation has not been improved until now.
Ancient Mudschaheddin, the Afghan government and the present Taliban have the common desire to maintain women in a subdeputed position.
The most important personalities of the anti-Sweden war have come back to the power of 2001.
They have become businessmakers by calling the government's bases to sell them as a buildland to refugees from Iran and Pakistan and thus benefit from the massive United States transmission of contracts.
They've been calling, and most of them were not even involved in the fighters.
As I have heard in the campaigns, people want to be a government that does not come from work.
Many young people want to leave the country, as well as those who could benefit the American applications: Capital flight is significant.
Young people have sat the war and their ideology.
During their exhibition in Iran or Pakistan, they had contacted the modern world, and have met their benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years; Kabul now has 5 million people, which is one fifth of the total population.
In the cities, state schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people who do not want to return to the obscuratorism of the only parties or to corrupt certain leadership forces will need to provide jobs.
All, even the armed parties, are covered by mobile phones; the television with its Turkish series that are a modern world will be seen.
A army is now.
Should the authorities whose order authority will be considered legitimate?
The former commander of the anti-Soviet fight is already trying to restore the milizens in the province which will be deleted by the central government.
Afghan, the mountain country with strong local identities should benefit from a certain decentralization, for example, of the Western Nations, but by decreasing the office of the Ministerial President, which has been since the Constitution of 1964, the United States wanted to make a centralized State with a strong presidential government.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, in particular to the elections planned for April 2014.
However, his country has been depending on foreign aid since the 50s and for a long time before.
Industries have not been rebuilding, functionable steel equipment have not been available and important watering systems have not been repaired.
All is imported; notwithstanding from fruit and vegetables is nothing produced.
The private initiative is taken priority.
In a country that was based on war for 30 years, it would have been necessary to control the infrastructure.
The plant was distributed that Afghan had an incredible soil value.
This strengthens even the impression that the Western countries were only in place for their power.
Without energy to process the iron or coppery in place, or without transportation vehicles for a mountain export is not possible.
The Chineses have already left the coppermine of Mes Aynak, let the international architectors (funded by the World Bank) make their expansions on the huge buddhist places and remain the most important employees of the province.
One day, it will also be necessary to rebuild normal relations from Afghan and Pakistan, which are widely dependent on the exports and exports.
The disappearance of the French fighter was concluded on 20 November.
The new Cooperation Treaty provides the continuation of traditional assistance: girls and youths, Institut for French at universities, French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural sectors, support of the Archeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic) has been established by the Ministry of Civil and Military Actions, which has been established in twenty-thirds of mountains people, carried out a number of common works and measures for the sanction of agriculture and enabled a small French non-governmental organization to try to win the "hears and spirits" and to achieve the impossible task of compatibility of aid and offensive actions.
These works, for the many local workers needed, have helped to emphasize the situation: consumption, burns, drinking water, restoration, fruit trees, land protection and increased agricultural uses.
What Subvention will we allow to return from two billion euros after military expenditure?
A more discreet budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are often harder in the size of more than 2000 meters.
In the message, twelve written requests for small agricultural projects from communities of the province of Capisa have been introduced.
In order to free farmers from the situation carried out by foreign groups, which is their desire after their own statements, the continuation would be lower, well-controlled and directly related civil aid to their benefits.
A Constitution with the Breakfast in Egypt
This is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egyptians relating to the Constitution declaration which will temporaryly grant him the unlimited full power, more than you shared, he decided to put everything on a map.
For the surprise of all, he announced that the Constitutional Assembly will be adopted on the next day by its final vote.
Only one week ago, the Head of State had granted two additional months for the end of its work.
Egyptians have now been based on a text that has been changed for almost two years, which weaks the institutional stability and leads to a legal interchange.
This new initiative has been made only for a further scope of the country.
For his enemy, the Chair in his "autocratic delirium" he continues to "speak his word" and "the right with feet."
On the side of his favorites, it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible and to accelerate the transitional process.
A reference should be held within 14 days.
A very short period that the brothers are forced to reject their projects to explain the text section for the Egyptians.
For the Presidents, it is also a way to restore its public and democratic legitimacy while the Protest is in the whole country.
After confirmations in an interview with the American Weekview Time seems to be convinced that Egyptians will be welcome.
At the time of the Egyptian people with this retreat, a Ultimate will be set to a different vote: "If you are right for my draft, or I hold the unlimited full power", the last should be finalized after the Constitution.
85 most Islamic members of this Constitutional Assembly have adopted the text last night in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the liberalians has not been pursued by the request.
Shortly before the Constitution's declaration, they were denied since they believed that they were not able to bring their views to the application.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or civil society have also treated.
To achieve decisionability last morning, 11 persons were added in all eyes, substantive members.
Some are very close to the Mosle Brothers.
It is not surprised that the articles were mostly adopted in one way.
On the other hand, commenters argued that the only difference of views of the day... was expressed in the hour for prayer, since some members of the body of the opinion were that the Pendelarium of the Constitutional Assembly was not exact.
The text, which has been adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2 of the Constitution of 1971, with all attention, remains identical with the Constitution and states that "the principles of the Charia are the main source of law".
The Salphistic Party, for which the establishment of the Islamic law is an important demand, had hoped to replace "the principles" by "the rules" which would have made a more strict application.
For Islamians, the fact that this article has not been amended, a evidence for their good will and for their respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
The "slightness" reiterates the Liberals, which are only viewed as a propagan attack.
Because they follow the Islamicization of the Constitution on other articles.
They have particularly recognized Article 220 at the eye of the University of Al-Azhar, in particular with regard to the review of conformity with the Sharian laws.
According to Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, this is unreasonable, since "the people who are requested for an opinion have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here you can see the first sign of a theocracy."
Moreover, the fears of the liberalians are given to the fact that the next factor of this university should be less than the present.
"Actually, there is no concrete religious commitment.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the State of Burundi.
The majority of the legalists who have worked at this text are not Ulema, but academics who are trained in part in the French system," said Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral work on the Egyptian Constitution Transition.
However, it is clear that "as regarding Article 220, the terms used are rejected to the religious chat.
In particular, here is regard to the "Fiqh" [Islamic law practice, e.g. Red.].
And in the future, the question of how much civil leaders are able to decide about it."
In addition to his religious aspect, the last night adopted text is strongly criticized due to the extensive power that he grants to the President of the Republic.
Moscow brothers argued that these comparisons with the former regime are significantly reduced.
Another conflict point: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the desire of the military, the examination of the defence budget will not be submitted to the Parliament but to a national defence Council.
It will also not be prohibited by civil procedures in military courts, as it had requested the organizations for the defence of human rights.
The latter also share their fears in terms of the text which they consider as an threat to freedom.
The real file of the Blasphemy will be maintained, and drought are now banned, which serious consequences of the right to free opinion, especially for the press.
Moreover, there is no article on the protection of women, underlines Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
Your view is the only positive point of view that the ban of the punishment by article 36 is the prohibition of the torture.
This word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President had to express the television last night, demonstrations were planned for afternoon.
The representatives of the Head of State shall be marked on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists expect the holy places, the nabel of the world and a sea from the sun
The idolatry land unions the glory of Bible truths, modern comfort and an untrained nature.
AIF calls you the five most important reasons for a visit in Israel.
Before the holy places
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It means that everyone who bless in this river receive God’s blessings.
Galilea is the place where Jesus completed his miracles: the change of water into wine on a wedding feast, the go into the water, the style of the sea and the fishing cap.
Before here, Jesus appeared his disciples after the resurrection.
However, most of the sacred ones are found in Jerusalem.
Faithful acting here is the suffering road or crossway of Jesus Christi (on Latin: Via Dorosa).
The path begins at the Roman Festival of Antonia, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old city to the Grabeskirch on the mountain Golgotha, where the crossing place, the saltstone and the grabe of Jesus.
Here, according to the Christian view of the Nabel of the world, is symbolized by the salvation of mankind.
The crowd of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem is on the place where a Christian legend was taken according to the tree, from which the cruce was made for the crossing of Jesus.
The holyest place of the Jews - the Klagemauer, the rest of a temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people from different believers are left with desires that then go to fulfillment.
A travel to the height
The ruin of Massada was the rest of the secret hiding before the enemies that made the Herodes of the Great in the year 25 C.E. for his family.
They are at a rock door in the mountains in 450 meters height over the sea level.
Only mountain increases can reach the ruins from their own power.
Everybody else brings a air seat to this historical hill.
In the north of the country in 1600 to 2040 meters the famous Ski area Hermon situated in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can get there with a shuttlebus.
The ski points have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to a old legend, the Jewish gods were able to live on the bargboard.
Visit unique museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
Only one trip can not be seen by all of them.
However, at least five of them should be visited.
At the same time, the Israeli museum is close to the Knesset (Parlament).
There are old Qumran manuscripts or rolls from the dead sea, found in rock clouds in the Jewish wilderness, and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exponents.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also a valued visit.
There is the collection of works of printers and expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modelleni, Chagall and Picasso.
In Akko you can visit the museum at Bad Al Basha, which protects several samples of old Turkish bathrooms with sculptures of the then visitors and bathrooms.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum where you can admire Dali and Rodin sculptures.
There is no museum leader or subvention lands.
The entry is free, and the costs are denied basically.
The fifth Museum, or the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, speaks of one of the most afflicted chapters of the history.
The most excited division is the thinking of the children, which has been built for the memory of the 1.5 million children destroyed in the concentrations and gas shops.
The entire darkness is in the presence of the room.
The stars are shocking.
And the names of the Jewish children and the lands where they die.
Ukrainian is also mentioned there.
Do something for health
The three most important rebuilding areas of Israel are located on the easts of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Every three places there are swimming pools, water parks, delfinaries and oceans.
It is surprising that in the Red Sea also is assembled in the winter months, since water temperature is not below 21 °C and the air is warm until 23 °C.
The dead sea is even warm and there will be worshiped over the whole year.
On the other hand, this unnormal sea with a situation of 417 meters under the sea level is the most deepest sea of the world.
His twin blue water has a high salt content, which makes it even unlikely on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is nice.
Visitors are present for treatments in use of salt water (natural salt water) and healing smell as well as treatment of skin disorders, allergy, asthma, eczems, artritis, bronchites, sugar disease, and to support strapaid nerves.
Try the secrets of the age
These secrets are the old town of Tel Aviv, the town of Jaffa at the Mediterranean coast.
With this city, the famous sea road, the Egyptians, Syrians, Anatolians and Mesopotamias were linked.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
Consequently, Noah built his archive right here, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with which he lived in this place for a long and happy life.
Tourists like to break through the close gases named by starmarks.
Fortuna should keep the legend after all that touch the walls in the gas with its star signs.
In Jaffa, you can visit new couples from all Israel and even other countries at photo terms.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herodes, you can strive through the Roman theatre and strive the celebration of the cross.
In Roman times Caesarea was the most important city of Judas and residence of the Roman Statute, including Pontius Pilatus.
In carefully restored theatres today are recorded concerns and operators.
List of features for tourists
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your bad English knowledge: about 30% of Israelites speak Russian.
The money in the travel is no longer in euros, but in dollars that can be changed simplely in schekel (actual change rate: $1 to $3.8 scheme).
In the city you're going forward with the bus, but in Jerusalem there's also a fast road trails and in Haifa the only U-Bahn line of the country with six stations that connect the suburb to the top city.
It is precisely a sub-State Railway.
A driving within the city costs independently from transport 6 schemes, which is sufficiently inclusive for a driving from up to 1,5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, in Israel the Saturday began.
The markets and business are closed from freeday to sunset on Saturday, and the public transport is resting.
And on Sunday morning starts working night.
In many coffees, restaurants and guests, only more coffee food is used, which is excluded from sugar meat, sea products, fish without shoes and foods that contain both milk and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between various courts with hammer and meat, supper and desserts (also prepared with cocoal milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, various softs, fried bottles of grain and herbs (flables) and fruits and vegetables.
In the streets of the cities of Israel there is no tragic dogs.
For this, there are many pleasant shoes that strike in the streets.
Tonight you can even see her sleeping on the showers of parking cars.
The cats may be cut places and don't say No to Leckerea.
A car costs between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs additional $15 per day.
And bicycle delivery costs 15 schemes per day.
Income cards for museums are costing in the cut 30 skele.
In numbers
In 2012 more than three million tourists from the world of Israel have visited Israel.
The majority of the employees and visitors came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the United States and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists in the Gelobte country, with a increase of 51% in the comparison period in 2010, before the decrease of the visa obligations on 9 February 2011.
"The great and powerful" leads to Moscow: Migrants expense money for language
While Members and citizens are discussing the benefits of the law on binding language tests for migrants, criminality is already acting with false certificates
Annual 13 million guest workers are in Moscow, Sankt Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are the citizens of the Central Lakes: Usbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkey.
Its only goal is to win money for the maintenance of the families living in the home.
On 1 December, a law entered into force, which should, according to each employee to a test that is aware of the Russian language.
This scheme is only applicable to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the Community housing industry and in the private trade.
However, the tests with time, according to the Federal Migration Authority, are to be obliged to be at the future for all guest workers.
This is not only the language tests, but also the tests in Russian history and the basis of legislation.
Speech knowledge must be demonstrated for both maintenance and prorogation of work permits.
Exemptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian official language is.
At the same time, persons who have received their training products and diplomas before the crash of the UDSSR in 1991 are excluded.
Intelligence, problems and protection of rights
The totality of the test agencies will be among the Egyptians of the Pushkin Institute for Russian language, the Russian University of Volkslife, the Moscow's State University, the San Petersburger State University and other Russian high schools.
Migrants can delay the tests in all cities, and now more than 160 respective centres have been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the test was supported by the Members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
However, before the entry into force of the law in the press, citizens asked the following question: What really brings the whole thing?
What changes brings the prescription to demonstrate speech knowledge, both for Russia and for guest workers?
In particular, he agreed to speakers of the Migration Authority, it goes to reduce the number of pregnant workers.
"Thank now speaks about the protection of the rights of employees", says the Chief of the Delegation of the Federal Migration Authority in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelew.
However, your rights must be protected before their departure.
Only a organized recruitment will solve for 90% the problems of foreign workers.
On problems, immigrants have no professional, education, language knowledge and medical attention.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migration without speech knowledge will be reached with wicked views, shooting him in a dark, close barack with twenty-five months without food and documents, and swallowing him from 12 to 14 hours on day.
We reach many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home you will be promised, and when you come, you will be involved, get their places taken and don't receive the promised loan", confirms the head of the Tajik Migration Authority, Tolib Schwaripow.
Don't shoot, boss!
However, many citizens of the Central Asian Republics who want to win their money in Russia to do not only to dominate the language of the target country, but also not in their own language.
Of course, it is not so debt as much as the evil: only few turkmen, skins, and smokes can also lead to a reasonable basic education.
Because there is no more money in their families to eat the children, for they are able to buy their clothes, shoes and schools.
As adolescents, these children will then take the first opportunity to carry out money.
"It's hard without speech knowledge", they give.
"You feel low and less."
Citizens' law stress the following important aspects.
The test is only required to delay migrants with legal status.
If you don't have this status, there is no test and therefore no official work.
However, the majority of guest workers continue to be illegal in Russia.
"True Welcome" or "Access to Invalid"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to get an official status in Russia.
The reason is that bureaucratic guards and, of course, the language difficulties.
Moreover, the legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand Rubel.
A false registration can be made soon and only for a half thousand.
The employees of Russian police know that our documents are most false and we are not registered, and then there are cases of pressure.
"You want one or two hundred rule for cigarettes and tea", the Tadschike Umed Hushkadamow expresses against journalists.
"Don't look at the costs for wrong papers."
On the day in which the law was in force, it pointed out that not only the register documents of migrants could be false.
Some false certificates that demonstrate the conclusion of the speech test have already been arrested by the Federal Migration Authority.
The false papers were printed with a common color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive this: each migrant who hoped to save the tests, paid seven thousand rubels for the document.
This is more than double than the costs for the official test: this costs an employee three thousand rubels.
As the most direct task is to protect the corruption system so that certificates are not simply purchased, both officials and citizens are agreed.
For the moment, the guest workers who are first through the test can only be promised to receive time for a language-based course.
Furthermore, new agreements will be offered without language knowledge in areas where no active understanding is necessary.
Internal Ministry ignored illegal weapons markets
Legal weapons for crimes extremely low
The Russian internal Ministry sets up a consolidation of the weapons law for private weapons owners.
In this way, the authorities respond to the most recent events: recently blessed in sleeves on marriages and seven deaths at the amokok of Moscow jury Dmitri Winogradow.
The police wants to prohibit the driving of non-mortal weapons in the public and to replace the age of shooting weapons from 18 to 21 years of age.
The proposal supported the Chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Corruption, Irina Jarowaja, and promised that the changes in the weapons law are presented in the course of the Duma.
Not all are satisfied with the view that Russian authorities want to fight the problems by 'relating the slaves'.
On the Internet, a open letter was issued to provide the prosecutor whose representatives - representatives of various weapons associations - were called by the authorities to take a distance from "unless reliefs".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, expressed by the lawyer, Wasilij Lesnikow, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, 142 crimes were prosecuted with the application of the registered weapons during six months in 2012, while totally 1,168 thousand crimes were registered for the same period.
The publishers of the open letter are convinced that the proliferation of the law for the private weapons owner shall not stop being used on the black market.
Now, according to the suppliers in Moscow, you can find any possible weapons for little money.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs emphasizes that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Manufacturers: from the factories to the Official
The weapons got over several channels on the black market.
There are five main channels, speaking about a former supervisor Victor Baranez, who was in the Ministry of Education and in the general table ten years.
Screenshot of a website accepting weapons orders
The first channel is the army or military, i.e. weapons stolen during the battle in the castle.
"The weapons were stolen by both Russian officers and the cowboys themselves," says Baranez.
On the second channel, illegal weapons will be stolen by orders of criminals.
Baranez explains that there are weapons that were stolen both from the police's weapons rooms as well as directly by the employees of the Criminal Training Authorities.
Other illegally sold weapons are out of military weapons camps.
In many army camps, it was often explosions.
" There is evidence that in some cases it was the Branding Office for the lack of weapons," said the former militaryians.
In accordance with Baranez, a contribution to the black market also provides the weapon producers.
"Another day there are numerous private refrigerator manufactures that do not hold the international competition and therefore weapons under the weapon on the black market, especially in Moscow," reports the experts.
Another channel of the black market is the smuggle.
In particular, many pistols and shoes come from poor countries like Kirginia.
"There is a own, sometimes manual production, as well as a mafia that organizes the smuggle", explains the former military members.
Where are the weapons?
Experts calculate the share of each of the five channels in the delivery of the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was addressed by the Centre for Problem Analysis and State Management.
The experts analyzed reports of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Federal Service for State Statistics, Criminological Literature and publicly available information on portals on the subject of weapons.
The overwhelming part of the illegal weapons is the investigators in accordance with the army and the legal protection authorities.
The twenty-first of all weapons on the black market were through the obligation of responsibilities in their work with weapons, says in the report.
The data of the researchers are 17% of the weapons from conflict areas, 14% return to the weapons of the weapons production, and 5% of illegal expansions.
A salesman of a weapons load that does not want to be nicely called, ensures that weapons that are found in illegal expansions have been purchased for a long time.
According to him, the handlers are more frequently slaughtered in a weapons camp.
Over a phone rid is buyed a weapon, for example a pystole from the type TT.
The weapon is issued and transmitted through the sample.
"The handler brings the weapons into the city and sell it there for 900 euro per piece with two magazines," he said
"The police, of course, knows about all decisions and therefore leads to the plan to discover crimes through regular control purchase by handlers offering illegal weapons," adds the sales advisor.
"With in the Luxusload."
Sellers and sellers find the most commonly known ones.
I had seen my websites and blogs when someone was noted on me, and I proposed to come to the "Begowaja Station" station where a person would wait for me, who took me to a certain place where we could negotiate the price.
The price for the weapon I've just been there.
Military Commentator Victor Baranez
"To purchase a weapon, I need a known person who has contacts," said the Seller. "I have so a known person, but I don't trust him."
There are handlers on the markets, but there's a need to go and spend with a code like "Iwan Iwanowitsch, which allows you to express that the daughter has lost a dent."
I am even present at some slagrinds about a famous person that I trust.
He gives me the slagringe only because he knows I don't forgive him.
Newlins search for weapons on different ways.
Victor Baranez, an ex-military, tried to purchase illegal weapons in the middle of the 1990s, when he wrote a article on this subject.
The Schemas did not change him.
He got a photo album in which "all possible" was formed.
"I felt like in the luxus loan," remembered the military.
The buyer does not get the cat in the sack but can try everything.
I purchase not just as potential customers but drive with the seller in the forest, and there we make a goal.
"I can shoot there, and if I am convinced that the weapons have a good shooting, we're negotiating with each other," the expert describes the action.
Buy from sofa
Internet research machines show search results on sites and groups in "V contacts" where weapons are offered for different purposes.
There are no papers needed, nor personal meetings.
"He needs only the suitable amount of money", says the advertising newspapers on the website "Campfpitoles or arms."
There are users to open your orders and ask questions.
Does it also sell to minors?
"Naturally without license", users ask "Iwan".
"Search a TT. Moscow," says the Lakonic demand of "Fedorenkow".
The Federal Security Service recently disrupted numerous web sites, and buyers who want to buy the weapons are going to the service to the network.
People come like hungry fish at feeding and countries then in Siberia and can see coal
Headquarters and former military agent Victor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: the website is normally registered in the foreign area, and Russian laws do not find application.
The responsibilities shall take the orders.
The buyer transfers the money over a bank auto.
"The answer he receives a photo and a description of the hiding of the weapons", reports the publisher of the common organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitrij Kislow.
Victor Baranez emphasizes that you can get empty to the end and get back to the guest when you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently disrupted numerous web sites, and buyers who want to buy the weapons are going to the service to the network.
"The people come like hungry fish at feeding and countries then in the siberian work camp and can look at coal," he says.
A Makarow for 100 US Dollar
In purchasing illegal shooting weapons, experts must be acquired with prices from 100 to 900 US dollars.
According to Dmitrij Kislow from the "Pravo na oryzhie" organization, you can buy a pystole from the Makarow type for $100 to $300.
You have to wait until half months.
The weapons are issued in military arms camps of oversights with medium ranges.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the number of crimes with illegal weapons in all Russia in the period from January to October 2011 recovered by 7% to 22.9.000, while the number of discovered cases of weapons, munitions, springers and spring plants was 7.8%.
In the United States, fat and supermarket employee
Each fourth US youth is ever sit behind the box of Mc Donald's
In the past days, there were massive protests in the United States against low salts in Walmart and restaurants' branches like Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Nobody can predict whether the Protests will be further swimming or whether they are soon out the air.
Protests are supported by associations and several links-based joint organizations.
In addition to the increased increased losses from simple Walmart and Fast Food employees, the Protestants follow the goal of establishing workshops.
This sector of the economy has not been workingly organized.
46 cents in the year?
The protests started the winning week after thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, in the United States sales, which locked millions of customers, which leaded to handling.
To this day, some Walmart employees whose target group is low and medium-sized income were in the world.
Walmart sells all products, from winds over jagdgewears and autobatters to steel sweaters, eggs and milk.
The product in the Walmart Filiales is nearly 8 to 27% favourable than in large supermarkets.
Thus, many of the low payed Walmart employees have been purchased only in their own workplace.
The prices and the trade arrangement made Walmart one of the largest enterprises in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart is often able to sell the good so good because the employees are badly paid.
The latter also claims about serious working conditions, for example, lacking gabel staples or handscanners.
The protest participants in the "Black Friday" requested payment increases and expressed their faults that the contribution to the health insurance was increased from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
A typical Walmart employee who pays 9.5 US dollars the hour, couldn't give this increase, said they.
Scientists from California University in Berkeley report that if the company increases the average payment of $12 hours, it would cost $3.2 billion.
They are about 1,1% more than they are sold for money now.
If Walmart fully turns the loans on the customers, every buyer would cost them only 46 cents more.
For a year, it would be for them for more expenditure today of only $12,39.
Walmart's claims are satisfied that it was only in nine Federal States to Protests and that they did not delay any loss to the company.
The Black Friday was held at 8 a.m. on Thursday until midday, and in this period Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
Overall, the Walmart casses carried out at the "Black Friday" nearly 100 million transactions.
The speaker of the company, Dan Fogelman, pointed out in an interview on the left page of Huffington Post, which totally "hereinafter than five" Walmart employees understood the work and protest only "a further PR-trick" of the society organized by the protests.
"Free Kasse!"
The Protests continued this week in New York, but their goal was not Walmart-filians (which wasn't expected in this continuous city and therefore there are nowhere), but McDonald's and other precious restaurants.
McDonald's says that the company sell billions of portion, and yet you won't pay a hospital day, and you will not pay for your honest job!
Jumae Williams, member of the New York City Council
The minimum wage is at $7.25 according to federal and New York legislation at $7.25.
In Fast Food Restaurants, the minimum loan will be increased and increased, but not too strong, and the average of its simple workers in New York 8,90 US Dollar gets the hour.
As far as she won no one in this tired town.
As far as it is possible to get so little money in New York, I am incomprehensible.
There was a time in which almost four of all American youths after school at McDonald's theke were behind the theke, but young people still lived with their parents.
One saw the main source of income or planted to stay there long.
Now, at interviews with employees of McDonald's permanent people, they have to come out with this loan and sometimes have to eat their children.
On the other hand, in the Wall Street Journal forum, there is a comment that is not responsible to get children if you don't know how to eat them.
The participants of the Protest, which started on Thursday 6:30 tomorrow before McDonald's 40th Street and Madison Avenue, requested that the cassists and kits of fast-food restaurants receive a minimum wage of 15 US Dollar, which is more than a doubled breakfast of the current minimum loan.
They continued to demand the education of workshops in the Fast Food Branch.
The U.S. Law prohibits the undertakings to establish this goal in the way and to decrease or resolve partnership members.
On the other hand, the company management does not make it easy for them.
However, the creation of workshops in the fast-food sector is also difficult for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high personal fluctuation.
Unfriendly
Lautstarke Protests were also found before many other Fast Food restaurants in Manhattan.
The high point of the protest was a congregation on midday before the McDonald's at Times Square, where some local democratics spoke, including the member of the city Jumae Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it sell billions of portions, and yet you don't have a hospital day, and you will not be paid for your honest work!"
The demonstrates also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, a civilian candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "what should together support the Fast Food employees in order to receive a fair reward and to achieve the economic well-being that every New Yorker benefits".
According to New York Times, this was the greatest action of her in the history of the American Fast Industry.
However, only hundreds of people were in place where weitems are not all employed in the Fast Food Branch, where they worked at ten thousands in New York.
It is still not to stop whether the cell of these proteins will be mobilized all the mass.
"The brain can only be lowly overlooked."
The theme of the extensive reality in modern technologies is commonly identified by the line of a special brighte.
First, Google presented a functioning model in the summer at its annual conference, then was known in November that Microsoft also logged a relevant patent.
In conversation with the leader of the group of interactive 3D technologies in Microsoft Labor in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, however, it is clear that the brille was just a leading station for scientists of the company.
It is able to manipulate virtual objects in the air with blue hands and to create virtual surfaces.
- Please describe what research your group works.
- We are working with the interaction of human and machinery, but we want to expand the borders of this interaction.
Since now, humanity has remained largely shooted in the phase, where with pixels worked on flash screens, which sometimes be touched.
However, we want to expect 5-10 years and predict the radical changes of this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are progress, and today no xbox will be sold without kinect, as everyone is interested in movement control.
- What's going on in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, many are still playing on the flash screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system gets more data) could be improved, the output has not yet been decisive.
We are trying to change this to work in real three-dimensional demonstration systems on the basis of various technologies, including projections.
We need to leave the computer world into our physical world and make them more fascinable.
However, it is necessary that not only the user is recognised, but also its environment.
Then we could add the real world much easier by virtual objects.
And first of all, we should be able to lose this shocked Virtual Reality help!
- What do you think about language control?
She's popular, but isn't she being overlooked?
- It is not sure that the Allzweek resolution is not because it poses questions on the privacy because you do not always want to inform all persons about his actions and desires.
In fact, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but everyone in their specific nice.
For example, we worked in the field of control of objects on public places at a project where we experienced with short and cuts, instead of loading goods.
The beasts were recorded not by the object camera, but by a band that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but theoretically could be reduced to the size of a arm offer.
However, the future, however, belongs to mixed control types, such as gestics and languages.
- How is that?
- We would ask me, for example, to rise this spudel doses?
They said it and said it at the same time.
- Normally, I just say it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to recognise.
- Do you want the user to adapt to what a machine can lead at any time and what not?
- Not uncertain, but it's about a mutual approach.
I think that in the next time we must work, especially in the development of new sensor types, which will enable us to make reactions of persons more accurate.
This can be, for example, laser sails, because they offer a good solution in the depth, which is very important.
- What requirements do you set out from your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors at modern cameras?
Is there no solution, depth or something else?
- The present generation is basically a good start point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixel would not be bad with a speed of 1000 fps.
But the main cases are not the megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and deep.
As we see, all the current technologies are not good enough for us, since the developers of the algorithms have more work.
It must not only be taken into account during the X and Y, but also along the Z axis.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
Human movements are extremely dynamic and open, the current 30 fps are too few for animals.
Stephen Betishes developed in our laboratory in Redmond a conductor with a regular delay of processing between 1 and 100 billion times, where the current commercial sensors are closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of human and machines.
For my work, I needed exactly such a device, only without conduct control and with more images per second.
- Should the number of cameras not be increased?
- Kinect currently works with three "cameras", with one of which actually is a infrastructurer and the second is a recipient for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a normal RGB camera.
It does not serve to calculate the length of the object.
More cameras could probably solve the problem...
Or strengthening the problem, because more calculations would be needed.
It would be a flexible, kinect-specific system where we could play with different cameras to determine how it helps us in the three-dimensional determination of a position.
- If I remember me right, Microsoft, in contrast to Google, presented his bridges not the public.
Do you not think that, in terms of the application of the technology of expanded reality, the brill has the best perspectives for every day?
- Of course, it is not appropriate to keep a smartphone in the hand, but I think that the greatest variant would be a "changing" reality in which we could switch through a cloud of the brill on the smartphone,
The brill is a personal gadget and there is its strength (Privates can only see you), but also their weaknesses, because an extensive reality by Brille prevents you to work together with other virtual objects.
- Let's think a minute that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is available not only by Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also by normal deaths.
There is a problem on the critics of this idea often indicated: There is no feeling reaction!
The hands don't feel anymore!
What answers your group wants to give to this invitation?
- In my discussions, I often say that the extended reality represents the seventh interaction between human and machinery.
I think that the eighth interruption could be through the integration of taxi approval.
A interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as a little uncommon projection.
She takes great pressure!
However, there are also technologies that are actually designed to give the "imageers in the air", for example, generate the interference of certain Ultraschal Rails in a particular point where the fingers are located, a feeling that is still weak, but still as someone put over the handballs.
There are also burns for hands that affect nervous changes in the fingers, and that is also a potential direction.
- Have you tried to list the brain?
It thinks that it feels what it should feel when it's just seen something?
- That's a good idea, so we didn't try it.
There is a further task we have to fight for a long time, a person who is physically in a closed space, he is located in an open, practically infinite space; here we are working on concepts with land countries (other than in Fitness Studios), moved platforms and large clouds.
For now, the brain can only be readily overwhelmed, and there are many years of work before us.
Indeed, this makes the work on the area of virtual reality for a researcher so attractive: In many themes we're just starting.
Owners instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the "Petersburger Avantgarde" project, which is deserved by the people of the city, which forms the prior garden of the art and culture.
In the list read, high-range representatives of Petersburger Artscene, whose successes were out of the borders of the city and find the acknowledgement often in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new herd of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city is known by Kirill Miller, the pink of the red beats, which are at the Russian Museum, once at the summer garden, at the scene tests, or on snacks.
Whereever the images of Kirill Miller are also posted, they find great human mass.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburger social philosophical artists who created new myths.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant personality of Petersburger Avantgarde at the end of the 1980s or beginning of the 1990s.
He is also a man of the city and smile by his presence on the street, his fellow citizens a laugh in the face and take care of them for good laundry.
Shortly ago, he was shocked a drehorgel and became a Petersburger Drehorgel player, since he finally feeled ready for this difficult role in regard to his artists, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in glass or Turkey in the city?
I chose the red color as a model designer that is different with the optic and image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artist, image advisers and society.
In the society, everything that disappears from the grainorm, aggressions and bad behavior.
But I want to come through my prominence with people.
Each of my past prookations was an invitation to talk.
- When did you know that you should be mad?
- In a exhibition in the Newski culture, where my work was carried out.
I mean, I have to go on this way.
Then the time of the old free, but not officially recognized times ended at the time, and new and free times as I was unreasonable.
I was pleased with the eyes of the new generation, so with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina"; then it was "Puschkinskaja 10", and then it was just one time.
I'm going to the theatre, to mode, to music, in fact to all, except the literature.
And all the things were connected to your classic clinic was important to stay in the middle of Petersburg culture where the best artists should be gathered.
In 1995, I placed a room in Puschkinskaja 10 and there was a musical-art club for Boheme, the house of Petersburger Boheme until renewal.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzzzz, and I remember how Snur with his "Ucho Van Goga" project came there.
Snur and his friends read simple songs for play-back, tender trikots, and also belonged to the today advised composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group began to play life, it became from her "Leningrade".
Trachtenberg modernized many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it started his big career, but he learned the bases with us.
The "D 137" gallery or the "Griboedov" club also have their origin in the art clinic.
Dorthin went to our employees and guests.
I'm a hero of the last century, as a culture still means something.
In 2000, there was an investigation in the press on which it was called "Persistence of our city".
I won in the category "Charest of the Year", and I was starting at the top point.
It is not easy to work in new times after old rules; I am a man of the truth, honestity and culture of the last century.
Today, it is easy to be famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without giving a cultural contribution.
Your work has an unreconscious style.
- Many of my images are real perlens and make clearly expressing the actuality and the intensity of the thoughts.
I'll have an exhibition with the "The Russian Museum as Clowns."
Clowns are unscheduled.
Before I was social, but now I'm painting it and prepare for fear to be so.
In a clown, it loses everything and loses his tragic.
I love the Groteske, and I have great ideas.
Let us save the world, for example, by prescribeing that everyone has to be full.
Now everyone observe the clothing and orientate on the east and not the inside of man.
But maybe you don't have to give a man the hand, but you should shoot him into the face.
The exhibition disappeared by the clothes.
We saw you in the role of the city tricky player.
Who, if I don't?
- Can you also be good commercial art?
- Today, commercial art must be careful, careful and smellful.
We'll see the ceremonies of cultures.
Before the people formed large groups: the Bohemians loved the one and the simple people.
Now there are micro communities, and it's hard to cut everyone away.
I'm not a single dollar note that everyone likes.
Now, you have to tell me who you're going to be.
Now every Kurtstar has about 100 adherents.
- At Stas Michailow's arrival, but several thousands!
- The women left to him, where the sexual and social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people come and not 10 thousands, so there is less management, money, and everything is based.
I've got attachers, and the most important is not to blame it and not to destroy the achievement.
In my youth, I asked these pictures that even in a series with the works of Falk and Larionow.
I started with pictures that normally come to the end of the career.
Today there are often misunderstandings.
It means spiritual culture and consumption.
Consumption has no culture, that's something different.
I am a man of the past culture and I was born with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and dismissed money to be able to cut back.
That's the culture I'm assigned.
- Kirill, was Petersburg missing?
- Good cultures.
It is said, people of the culture.
But not everyone of them can be cultural.
It was different in the real rows, because the cereals may not be a lot of culture, but they understood that the right experts are necessary.
In Moscow there are now good advisers.
In Petersburg, we have whom the experts may be, but they will be disabled, since there are higher experts needed to evaluate the first ones correctly and free their way.
Now it's only the own shock.
The same applies to the error, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not all take the timely art and therefore have to find other museums.
What is Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the capital of the culture; there are many more cultures in Moscow and a corresponding pool.
On our stones can only grow hard.
We need a cultural soil, for for example, we have more writers than readers, and that's not right.
In Europe there are many new people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
It's much less with us.
Arts must be back modern, as at the beginning of the last century.
The project is financed from supports of the city of Sankt Petersburg
Birth in the world
Earth is in danger.
Earth warming or conjunction with killer steroid.
Karawans of space ships with earth-residents on board are searching for a replacement plan.
To save humanity, is the important question how we can continue in the weakness or on the replacement plan?
There are many options that I don't think.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least live hypothetical.
"After Mars and Venus," the scientific employees of the Astronomic Sternberg Institute Wladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on the Mars are compared to life friendly, a temperature of 500 degrees is dominated on the surface of Venus.
Life would be only in large height or in the round trails of Venus, so in all.
The question of continued planting in all were first treated by researchers regarding the Flora.
A half years ago, experiments were performed with plants.
The fourth generation of the horbited herbs did not differ from the earthquakes.
It followed the shift of insects, more accurate of changing fruits (Drosophila) in orbit.
In 1979, the Watch Tower was sent to the world to investigate how the weakness effects on Embryos’ development.
It developed a very normal kitchen.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the kitchen must find a stop; it must stand on its legs and start moving", explains the laboratory leader of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems, Wladimir Sychew.
Without a fixed substance, the cups will be shocked.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborns were completely decreased.
The kitchen did not respond to light and laugh.
Four days later, they died simply.
"We left the cups ten times and then put the whole thing, because it is simply impossible to work there with them," states Wladimir Sychew to have experienced with the cups all over.
The last wheel shop with animals fly in the orbit 16 years ago.
In spring 2013, the experiences are continued.
However, on the biostellite "bion", there will only be similar species.
There was a experiment with Rattes that were already shocked to all.
In principle, there was no special finding.
"This was just with the biostellites, but once again it was only a individual experience, and research needs to be continued," said Wladimir Sychew.
After the loading, the world space routes have been shocked.
The difficulty of continuing in the world's space could not be solved until now.
The task is hard.
The animals that are left from their natural life space simply cannot follow their continuing plantation.
On the contrary to animals, the human might be the principle.
Homo sapians are too attractive and can create a similar emotional background.
Such experiences are not implemented from ethical considerations.
But women have been flying to all for 50 years.
The largest risk was in Tereskova.
The most value of humanity is the women's body.
Our Möss fly from this, and nobody on the earth could answer the following question: Does it overcome the world space?
Can they bring a child to the world after this flight?
“Another answered this question,” said the room veteran Watch Tower.
In June 1964, only one year after its world space, the first woman’s cosmonautine, Valentina Tereschkowa, became a daughter.
The father of the child, Andreian Nikolajew, was also Kosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in all, Swetlana Sawizkaja, who was in the Orbit and even worked outside the space vehicle, was a son.
However, it remains a risk.
We've only been very little cosmonautes, in which everything went well after long flights and they've been healthy.
"Besides, more dangerous is it itself at flights in the Orbit," concludes Cosmonaut Waler Poljakow, the Herd of the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation.
But humanity must be looking for new ways in biotechnology, raw protection and producer artificial gravitation.
The hydrolaboration in the Cosmonat Preparation Center is a obligatory station during the flight preparation.
Here, in Swedish condition, the cosmonauten Routine wins for the work in the open world space.
The water represents the weakness.
Even if adult water is pleasant, it is a foreign environment; but sweetling water is a natural element.
It is like the small ionian witness that life in the country was decreased to the ocean.
There is a relationship between the fact that a child is located about nine months in the slaughter of the mother in the fruit water, and that it can be easier to get water.
In principle, it is logical, since the birth is only two weeks of skin.
"It's too little time to forget something," said baby-friendly Master Marina Aksenowa.
While weakness is a lot more natural condition for a newborn child, the woman does not have a weakness.
In the state of weakness, the muscles of bottle and beverage are slowly returning, and it also depends on the ability to express the child.
All right, we're going to do this by means of help.
For example, the birth could also occur in a special chamber to express the child.
"And what happens then?" said the uncertain question of Waleri Poljakow.
On the other hand, the child also needs an artistic weight.
Without the sense of earthquake, the body can't train the skelett and muscles.
A newborn child in orbit cannot be shocked as an adult to train in a loading deal.
He will simply lack what is essential for his life.
"This experiment, which we are in common, is the birth of a child in a foreign environment, leads us to a disability to bring a fullly unreasonable people to the world", says the Director of the Bioethic Mises of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems, Igor Pestow.
Before the birth of children in the world is only theory.
But at any time, it will be reality when the earth-residents in their space ships are cut into a far planet that will be the home for their descendants in all their birth.
NKU Chief: Control of the Black System failed by debts of policy
Czechland has public contracts on good control institutions and appropriate laws, however, returns to its application.
In the discussion for Aktualn.cz, this is the Vice-President of the Supreme Control Labour (Nejvyší controlní úśad, NKU), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be used right - and this is my view not the case," Kal comments the current situation.
A similar result seems to be a common control by Czech and German testing.
As a negative practice game, he introduces the setting of Prime Minister Petr Nečas to sug. "Schwarz-system".
The Prime Minister said that the ODS would not defeat the entrepreneurs with controls - is the system now prohibited or permitted?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is legally banned, then the President cannot just come to the government, and the control law which is now the control of the compliance of the law is in his activities", says Kala.
At the meeting of the Control Committee of the Deputy Chamber, you have spoken about a joint Czech-Deputy project in which the laws of both countries relating to public contracts were compared.
What was that concrete?
This is a parallel test that we have started about two years ago.
Only said, it is that European legislatives are determined how public contracts are undertaken, and the national legislation will build, and finally there is still a practical application.
This has all been compared to each other, and although the test is not yet closed, we could find extremely interesting differences. Generally, the laws in us may even be something "stricter and perfect", the real application is better in Germany in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not sufficient to keep new and more accurate rules, and it must also be considered with the actual application of the law.
How can the project be helped? What does you get from this project?
Such a common control could help us to stop pursuing us continuously in order to pursue the laws and to reduce and deteriorate weaknesses, if this is not likely to be particularly positive.
Economy means buying something to a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding unlawful areas or criminal acts.
But the reduction of levels for contracts does not guarantee that we achieve this goal.
Maybe it's even that we're just taking the system in this way with excessive "papier crom", and those who are looking for the sweet in the system have significantly easier to use the system than the weaknesses remained higher.
They are talking about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Republic.
How does the control system operate in Germany?
Is there a similar authority like our NKU here, or does the system work differently?
As regards the authorities, the German Pendent on NKU of the Federal Account Court, which is built similarly with us and also through a colleague, which is only formed something different, but in principle both authorities are working similar.
The competences are also comparable to a certain measure, but Germany is a federal State, i.e. these accounts are also in the individual federal countries, which differs from our German system.
The BRH is only to control the federal resources, which corresponds to our State resources.
The public funds, which are managed by us by the areas and communities, are under the control of the country account rates.
What about the German legislation is the easier than our?
I would generally compare this without concrete information, but indeed, Germany is often called as an example, but it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is better.
Maybe it seems to be better there?
This is not true, but as he said: I don't like such comparisons.
It is still noted that those countries who are an example have to fight with problems.
In other words, they had no cooperation with our authority, did they?
What about the Czechian legislation, which importance for your authority had to renew the tax law, do you already feel any effects?
In view of the fact that this new is in force for the first short time, it does not have the effect of our tests.
Since our controls are slowly carried out, you have to recognise a certain delay here.
The effects of the preparatory phase of the future controls are to be examined and analyzed by almost 14.000 public contracts - the changes will be understood by itself, as we change the weak values that have changed the conditions for certain types of description, etc.
Do you see the adoption of this law more positively, or is the system with further office?
I think that this law will be a step in the right direction and hope that this adoption is confirmed.
However, the problem is that the rules will be "stricter" and cannot be maintained anymore.
The persons subject to an examination against the force (e.g., in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) shall therefore take account of each non-compliance with the tax law of the budgetary discipline.
But is it a sense to make the law more strict?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and misuse the system, and not punish those who have started a form error, which do not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system only makes the officecracy more pressure.
Where's the way out here?
First of all, let us tell which way it is not targeting.
The Prime Minister said unexpectedly that the ODS would not rejoice the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "shvarz-system" - what is exactly what does that mean?
Is the black system now prohibited or permitted?
However, a law must have its validity, and if something is legally banned, it cannot just come to the President of the Government, and the control law which is now the control of the compliance of the law is in its activities.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the thing," but he cannot say that we do so as if nothing.
The transposition law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain operations, and it is also correct for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, however, it is also tragic when the biker is excluded with the best offer alone because of form errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be used right - and that's what I think is missing with us.
On the streets, it is unified ice plates, but they are sweet.
On the streets of Czech Republic, there are partly snow and iron plates.
However, the roads are well travelable, with increased care.
Karlsbad
In the area of Karlsbad, the streets were well travelable today, together with dominated snow and icelands.
Temperatures slow up to -5 to -10 °C, on the day, it should be something warmer.
In the region there is no longer, and in the depths, only one sneedeck remains a thicker.
Nevertheless, there are some 30 cm snee on the snakes of the floor.
According to the details of the central road waiting, Nebels was limited to view.
Current R6 and the roads of the first road class in the region are now unlimitable.
For example, it is offered to bridges where the trains are required and slightly.
In the same case, all roads of the second and third road class, including mountain roads, are available.
However, on these roads, there is a semi-oriented or experiencing neighborhood.
In particular, in the higher area, it has therefore been offered increased attention.
Bezirke Pardubice and Hradec Kralové
In some streets, it is dangerous because of ice floors, in higher lakes, and in the mountains is located on the streets with a swimming swimming swimming swimming swimming swimming, the roads and train directions on their websites.
Railways warn driving before ice floor, which may be particularly higher in the area of Pardubice.
It is particularly possible for transporting the second and third road classs in the Lanškroon, Ustí nad Orlici, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Möto.
The roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snee is particularly on the streets in the Riesenberg and in the mountain of Orlicke hory.
A exhibited snake is located on the streets of the circle Rychnov nad Knśnou and Trutnov.
In Eastern trees it is overwhelmingly sweet or heat, and it remains widely free of shock.
The temperatures move between -3 and +1 °C, it is a weak wind.
Nearly Pilsen
The roads in the area of Pils are well travelable today, however, locally has increased attention, and the pathway is adjustable to the weather.
This is frozen on the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees under the heat point.
As it has been done before and then cut the temperatures, it may be on the roads to iron floors.
It is also necessary to communicate with nebel, but it will improve the vision in the daily course.
These information are from the central roads.
D5 is practically unlimited, but higher attention recommends the road metros between 80 and 131 km.
The trains of the first road class are overly swimming, but frozen.
However, in the southern of the circles and tachov, it can be sected to icelands.
The vehicles of the second and third road class are weight, and therefore the reference to possible sections is also applicable.
The drivers should mainly be careful about the less frequented roads in the Bohmerwald area.
Near Olomouc
With sneematch, drivers today have to be acknowledged in direction of the high places in the Oleomouc district.
After the use of shipping vehicles, Sneematsch remains on the path śervenohorskee sedlo as well as on the road in direction Videlský kśí.
Tonight snakes slowed the roads to use, in the shumperk surrounded information of the road management around 3 cm new.
In the other areas of the area, the trains are mostly unlimitable.
"The Circs Šumperk remains in the high places even in the sneeest.
On the swimming passage, the drivers need to recognise in direction Jeseník with sneematsch," said one employee of the road management Šumperk today against the Agency.
Their colleagues in the circle Jeseník also had to get out of the night, according to their information, the roads are free and naked to the heights of chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc circle, the roads are unlimited, but the drivers need to walk carefully in wood boards, since the trains are still featuring here.
Bezirk Ústí nad Labem, Province Liberec
In the northern pools, the roadways are equally several badly available road sections.
Besides several places with snee or ice floor, the mountain roads from Telnice to Knínice are locked in the UI N.K. in accordance with the information of the transport police.
The temperatures remain in deep levels below zero, so that the snow and iron will be holded on the streets. From the depths, especially in the south of the Bohem Mediterranean area, there are no problems reported, and the streets are normally swimming.
No transport disorders have been reported until the time.
It is reported, in particular, from the surrounding of Štōti.
According to the details of meteorologists, there were ideal conditions in the night - day over rain and swimming snow, in the night unwanted sky and Frost.
The main lines and the road I/13 at the border of the districts Ústí No.L. and Liberec are reported bad transport conditions.
The switch of the road between Telnice and Knínice was necessary because of the east pressed by the sneelast to the trains.
Šimon Ornest: We want to collect positive energy on our concerts
What do you think about the need to happen in less than one month of the world?
This is one of the disaster messages that we like to start people so much.
With our band The Tap Tap we make it easier and say that we are the only band of the world, which can collect sufficiently positive energy to keep or prevent the world.
In December, you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the world.
Can you present our readers the project closer?
This is a country-wide beneficiary session that we have planned for two years.
For this, we want to use the marketing potential of Maya Customer whose end is prognosed for 21 December at 11:10 tomorrow.
On the day before, on 20 December, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava are placed at 21:00 p.m.
The end of the concert is to be around the time, to which the Maya calendars end in a time zone of 12 hours before us.
From whom is this idea?
It is likely to be from me, and then we have completed the idea together with our graphic Honza Augusta.
We would like to collect not only sufficiently positive energy to prevent the world's interruption, but we also want to think together with the public about what state we have given this world once our children.
On the end of Maya Customer, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, Taxes and Key Championers against the world's interruption, with which the buying of www.e-tap.cz can also support us.
The band The Tap Tap has also included the sog. Hymne against the world interruption with the title "World interruption".
Soon today, the hymne is very popular on YouTube. Are it also available on the Benefiz Concerts?
Surely, but at the end, it predicted that everything is cramped and that the world's interruption is not happening...
The Hymne should be sweet by all interviews at all three concerts simultaneously.
In addition, the hymns will live together in a direct holding of the Czech TV.
The text of the Hymne is of Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main image of Jesus in the video clip, also sing Xindl X with...
How have you come to cooperate with both?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultures, which involves that we realize many benefits events and concerts...
We are trying to connect these people intensively to our projects.
This has shown that most of us are interested in cooperation with us, and they have enjoyed it.
What is the purpose of resolving the concerts against the world’s decline?
For the establishment of the barrier-free education centre Studeo, where we have been working together with the United Tap in the Jedlička Institute for six years.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly employed by lectors that help them in various free-time activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the resources to visit the lectors, we want to help them in this way.
In the context of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, it is to be a building in which we enter this project.
There are several groups and interviews in each concert.
What criteria have you seeked this?
We wanted to set up a program that applies to all generations, including children.
For example, in Praga, Chinaski, Lesbian support, Illustratsfer with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiōí searchī.
Any more learning on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "great events" also planned for the future?
In May we take the first time to the Prayer's spring, and for this concert we also provide an interesting program with interesting guests.
The next year, we would like to come in the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are already in the U.S. -- this would also like to be connected to arrivals in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not just small, until you have already occurred in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
However, the Tap Tap is a group that consists of people with disabilities.
How do you handle these travels logistic and organized?
It's not so bad as it appears at the first time.
Five of our members are roll shopping drivers, i.e. the roll kitchens have to be transported in the bathroom. Of course, we need to switch many instruments and other bags...
Nevertheless, it has always been struck without problems, tySA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us that I sometimes have been a part-time surprise.
Even in Moscow, where we were very long, there were no problems.
With your foreign trips, you have a comparison as it seems to be in the individual countries with barrier freedom, how you look around there with disfellowshipped people, etc.
How have you experienced these things?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities in which everything works better than us, we were just in Russia’s Witnesses that everything is still in the East.
Instead of Prague, Moscow is not absolutely disfellowshipped, where it is still uncommon when someone is walking in the roof store alone in the city center.
There is not even a self-consciousness that you have a roll shuttle, for example.
Happily, there will also be crimes that are trying to develop the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way should we take towards the developing countries?
There's still a lot of things we're going back...
However, it is still noted that the improvement of the situation is always depending on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely normal that people also have serious difficulties move themselves into the public room, go to the museum, they can use toilets, etc.
But it is not just normal that there is a larger group of people active in the social events, where we are a little predicted with the band The Tap Tap Tap to the West!
The respect of public and barrier freedom is a matter, but only when we come from our series of important sports, artists, players, politicians or lawyers, the things will really start to change.
Eventually, this is only the cases of particularly desirable personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular. But if we return a few years: What has you motivated to build a band in 1998?
From that time I started as an overseer in the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in working with something intensive.
And since I am a musician, and I play saxofon, I found a music AG together with a colleague.
Well, and with the time, this is how our moderator, Láṣṭa Angelovič, is trying to say something other than controls.
But in the last few years, the band was known, or do I?
It is true that we have helped the cooperation with known songs, and we have also started to get active for us.
We have become aware that if you do something and this is not to see outside, the own performance in certain sense does not exist.
Thanks to the EU supporters, we can also provide good lectors, high-quality devices, etc.
Was it your goal to bring it to the Tap Tap so far?
From the beginning, I realized the potential that you can act differently.
In the showbusiness, today it is often copied by one of the other.
This is in its logical way, since all new ones are carefully viewed and first accepted after a longer period of time.
There are only few really unique things, and I'm going to say that Tap Tap belongs to it.
The first impression that the observer has most is, of course, suffering; this is just natural...
But this suffering is absolutely overwhelming, because people with disabilities are not unique and abandoned things that we should regret.
There are people who live a full life and can develop, if they have the necessary resources.
I always say that if people with disabilities happen, this is not only a progress for themselves, but for the whole society.
Have it also helped you to be a strict leader, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you must not take compromise in many things and require certain disciplines.
But I think this is completely normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and when they find that they have two times the week tests, they need to complete preparation phases and carry out a lot of time on concerts, then the shock is in a lot of rapidly.
But it works all over, in every band, seriously work and wants to achieve something.
The Tap Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them were from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Laáśa Angelovič.
We're a open group, people come and go, that's not possible to prevent.
Whoever has the will and the joy of the machine is always welcome with us.
Find place on the day before the prognosed world interruption, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00 p.m.
Events are: Incheba-Arena/Prag, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czechian bands and other musicians
All three events will be connected to the conclusion by Live-scling and it encounters a common interpretation of the Hymne "World Interruption" of the Band The Tap Tap Tap.
The objective of the concert is to include the resources to provide a multifunctional cross-border education centre that should be in Praga in the Jedlička Institute. Spending point: 25 million CZK
The entry costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free, cards are available for sale at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the world space.
Poland was held at a ministerial meeting of the European World Space Organization of Member States as the twenty-first member of this World Space Authority, and Poland was the second member of the former East Block (on the Czech Republic, which was member of the ESA on 12 November 2008).
In 1994, Poland began close cooperation with the EESC and participated in several EES projects in the following years.
Poland’s path in the world was freely started.
Shortly before the Second World War, the Poland cosmos were embarrassed with the space vehicle, not always understood by understanding.
For example, I recall the report of A. Šternfeld of 6 December 1933 in Warschauer Observatory, in which the author had thought of his pioneer work "Eing to Cosmonautic".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (e.g. 1905) left the listeners cold, and after years, Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had interested in his work.
Šternfeld won in 1934 for "Eing to Cosmonautic" the price REP-Hirsch established by Robert Esnault and André Louis Hirsch.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) was later a major warfare of the astronomy and the space journey.
In Poland, he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis world-wide recognised contribution to the development of the space passenger was acknowledged by the name of one of the clatters on the earthquake side of the month following him.
Prepared in 1925, in Poland was built a rail train dryline for which a raketen operating was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the project and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rats should be used for starting or breathing the dragons.
The information to this end is only from the temporary press.
In 1933, Poland’s infantry began to be treated with shocked shocks.
The research work conducted the Comórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Professor Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
The transmissible documents show that the research was predicted until the stage of practical tests.
The investigation was then freely interrupted by the inmarge of the German fight force.
In 1937, in the press of the Ing. Rohoziīski projected a photo-electronic jagdrakete, and next year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietzna i rakietobomba lolnicza" of the author of Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared in the following year.
Both projects were discussed with the military use of the raketen operation.
Shortly before the war, all projects for military use of raketentechnology were coordinated by the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Committee Doradczo-Naukowy).
The Committee was established in 1937, but its work was completed by the beginning of the war.
Another article on the space journey appears after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Railway Society (Polskie Towarcystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first consideration of this company is held in November 1954 in the magazine Problemy, where four major articles of the space journey are issued.
The article of Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal for the creation of a space transport company.
At the time there were the first projects on satellite technology, and it was expected that the research of the world space would have the future.
In 1956, the Polish Railway Corporation was working to join the International Railway Federation, founded in 1951, and in fact the PTA was a general member in autumn 1956.
The next year, the first President of the International Railway Federation, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959).
He was in 1959 until his death.
Since 1956, the PTA participated in the development of extremely successful meteorological rats (Rakieta meteorologiczna), the first Poland rakes for scientific research.
The first man, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, followed on 10 October 1958.
Raketes with a maximum airline of 1800 m were about 80 cm long and were not totally 5 kg.
Later, a improved version of RM-1A was built, and 1959 began in the Bśdów-West aircraft test with the RM-2 second stairway.
The rat was 1,4 m long and was about 11,5 kg.
A further stage of development should already be able to provide real scientific work - the rats RM-34 should reach a flight height of up to 14.5 km and be used to observe high winds.
However, in 1962 the further development was established.
The first rakes of the type RM were the meteor-1 rakes developed in the 1962-65.
The rat was designed as a two-through race, its total length was 510 cm and the start weight was 32.5 kg.
These rats were developed three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differ from each other in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The meteor-1A rakes have a transport room with 0.4 litres, meteor-1B more than 0.34 litres and meteor-1C over 0.62 litres.
The maximum flight height was at all three types 37 km.
In the 1965-1968 Aviation Institute, the Meteor-2 Rakes was developed, which began the first flight test in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a profit rate of 10 kg in a height of approximately 60 km.
Then the versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
In 1960, the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) was also followed by the establishment of a national COSPAR committee on two years later.
Poland also participated in the World Space Research Programme with Soviet Satellites, and in 1978, the Poland pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut.
The adoption of the Law on Common Works is not a solution.
In the past week, the Constitutional Court found the Law on Common Works.
In public, this decision was a vital discussion.
It is certainly interesting to consider the problem at times a broader perspective.
The liberalized economic systems in the EU and globalized world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
Finally, this means that individual people's economies are in a permanent conflict.
This is why the principle of free trade and free, unlimited movement of the private capital, which goes into hand with unreasonable financial speculations.
On the basis of the great differences of the value of work (TV), it comes to price advances.
This means that the manufacturer is a state in which it tries to exist by importing favourable goods in economic competition by providing the competitiveness to reduce the market share and increase its profits.
In large measure, this means for most enterprises to make their manufacture in the foreign, or to buy their business, but it is a high unemployment in countries with comparable high work costs.
The private capital does not have a social responsibility and no responsibility for the unemployment caused by it, it is necessary to increase the State expenditure.
This will continue to strengthen the fact that the employees are absolutely unwanted to pay their taxes and to replace the general economic and social damage caused by them.
This situation is generally known, so that concrete statistics are overwhelming at this place.
The inconsistent practice of the private capital creates a situation in which the Governments are able to join competitiveness, in order to slow up the social level of their own population, and thus locate foreign capital in the country.
In other words, governments provide their own population without regard to the social consequences of the private capital.
This is particularly expressed in amendments to existing laws.
The objective of these measures is to force the own population to accept the dictate of the private capital, in particular in the loan area.
This is one of the long-term unemployment burdens, others by enhancing the rights of the employee.
The result is growing poverty, as well as more differences between arm and kingdom.
In Germany, there are a few years of public food allocations for arms who are not able to earn their own work.
The number of interested persons is already in the millions.
In order to increase the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases in which employees receive such a low payment that the State must reduce their income to the minimum of existing.
A such scandal was also found in the case of the aid forces employed in the German Federal Day.
The speech measures in practice of all the Southern EU countries will, of course, depend on the same condition in which people are able to immigrate under the pressure of catastrophical absorption of their social level (which was the case in the 19th century), or to give a decline on the border of society, and to hope that any private investment capital will be flown into the country.
This is naturally the question where this capital comes?
If it comes from another EU country, the poverty from a country to another will only take place; or the capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco, Egypt and Africa, employees are working for a burden of European wages.
This concerns the entire Latin America.
Liberal theories and media indicated that the State should not participate with capital in its own population economy and that planning is leading to economic catastrophia.
The private capital is strictly at its point of view that the State is not able to slowly enter the economy.
But then you must ask whether the private capital does not affect the policy and thus the whole State in its own selfish sense.
This is the clear answer: Yes.
The evidence for this is the existence of a practically all-powered and global lobby in all States.
The result is a doubtful situation in the area of corruption, mutual preference, legislation, which is practically strict, but is nothing punishable.
In Germany, the situation is that a State minister has no financing, closely with the industry, is undertaken by the preparation of legislative projects.
These legislative proposals are then adopted in the Federal Day.
All violence is not anymore from the people, as it pronounces the Western Constitutions, but from strong financial groups that present their own interests.
Of course, the liberal democracies are now rapidly in a situation as they described Appian in their work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at Césars and Pompeius times: "The State has been declared for a long time, and the employees were arrested by violence.
On the smile payment, by the illicit enquiry of benefits or with stone and sword.
The corruption was uncomfortable, and the people began to speak with already baptized voices to choose... "Those with characters did not have to be elected for employees, so that the State had no consultation for eight months after this decline"... "The only medicine in this serious situation was a single rule, and that a strong man should be chosen"... Appian thought to Pompeius, but then the strong man was finally César, which the democracy had already been replaced by the only rulership.
As shows, the today's society is found as well as in the antiquity on the unrespectable preference of the own benefit, without regarding social interests.
The private capital is no longer able to recognise and carry out the benefit for the whole society.
The result, as today, is an unfair decade of elites that do not seek to deeply reforms.
The cause for the incidence of the fasism and communism, therefore, must be seen in the unprecedented liberalization of the economic systems in the 19th and 20th century.
From today's state, the delay of these regimes can be viewed as a certain suspense for liberal democracy, where the next round is already signed.
Especially catastrophe is the fact that today elites are the possible losses of hundreds of thousands of human lives, humanitarian and social disasters, whom we are already witnesses, and the crimes against humanity, as we know them from the older and new history, in full ignorance.
The adoption of the Law on Common Works is not a solution, at least not to duration.
The pressure of global and European economic competition will be forced to continue to search for ways to press the social level of the population below.
This trend is therefore a system.
The only solution is a political and social reform that increases the capital participation of the State in the economy, increases the impact of the citizens to the government and deteriorates the monopolisation of the private capital in society.
Israel: Labour of Chaos.
"...what nothing comes from violence, or may ever come out," sting in the song fraggle, whose most important verses in Refrain, say: "that we don't forget how deteriorate we are."
"If my sons didn't want wars, don't give it", the dead Good Snaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, said in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza stretch, there was a number of reactions.
Those who are behind Israel and argue their right to self-defence while they call the Palestinians as terrorists; others reiterately support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli State, with the banned civilian murder of Palestinian Arabs and the State of Israel as a terrorist.
I don't want to write to this place whose resurrected waves of the murderer and who is victims; finally the people today, including the self-administration areas in the current political situation and have not experienced the start of violence itself.
It is me to open the view of the readers behind the cults, seeing whom the 95 years of spring (called from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small iceland in the Middle East.
My thoughts are partly based on accessibility historical facts, others are driven by this and go from my own understanding, who or group of people affects the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is in the main line a history of the fight against the power.
In each era, we can draw an Alexander to the big or a Napoleon.
What is less likely to be, is the question whether it was always these personalities itself, which specificated their steps automatically, or whether someone was behind their throne who led their actions to a predefinite goal.
We must realize that we live in a time where the richness of the world is concentrated in the hand less individuals, and that this concentration of money and the power that comes from it has not occurred within a generation.
Under these astronomic rich families, you can call as a head of the crak (I don't know whether there is someone else over them, but I don't close this) - the Rothshilds.
Many of them are not written.
Of course.
The first Press Agency (Reuters) has been bought by the Rothshilds in the 1990s to connect the connection of their name with high-criminal acts, in which the establishment of their power, the reduction of their property or both.
The Rothshilds are involved nearly all the central banks in the world, and against the countries where they do not participate in the central banks, they lead to wars or struggles to them (for the transition to Afghanese were seven countries after the transition to Iraq, there were five countries who remained only four after the Structure of Ghaddafis, where Russia has entered its Central Bank in the interim period).
Those who always tried to resolve this family had to pay with their life.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothshilds Bank of America as a Central Bank, began to give up own (sprich: state) bank notes and was killed in 1865 in a theater.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue his own banknotes and wanted to develop the FED – he was killed in 1963; the deputy Louis Mc Fadden was banned in 1936 after he wanted to defeat the FED because of the global economic crisis in 1929.
The global powers of the Rothshilds leaded to formulation of a plan for the detection of three world wars by Albert Pik, a freemaster of 33th and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war aimed to eliminate the great monarchical states of Europe, by the second war, the colonial rule of the United Kingdom should be broken, and the third war aimed to reduce the world population to about 0.5 to 1 billion people (one such number would ensure for their ancestors and their luxus and would also not consume so many resources), to create a universal religion (Ecumenism is nothing more than the present) and finally leads to overcome the absolute power.
The methods with which the group of the richest families work with the Rothshilds is the exclusion of a crisis and the afterward offering a solution (order from chao - order from the chao).
However, these solutions are wrong and are always leading to the deterioration of the situation (see the foundation of the EDF, so that the crisis as they have been resolved in 1907).
After the murder of the Habsburg Throncycler Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian Zarenia through the revolution of Bolswicks.
The First World War ended with the urgent, military and economicly unfinished capitalization of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian Zarenian war was no longer necessary), then resolved the Mediterranean Great Power of Austria and Hungary.
In order to simplify the Second World War, the bankers had to create a late conflict situation through the policy by engaged in Germany with giant war repairs; by creating the condition of a weakened mass, so they had to be undergoing the Germans only a sufficiently strong leader, named the debtors and offered simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multinational state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which should also take the function of a five-colon, and also closely to develop war.
In the end of the 19th century the Rothshilds started the foundation of the ionistic movement, where one of them tried to create a Jewish state, as possible on the historical area of Judas with Jerusalem as a capital city (Rückkehr to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration already mentioned creates the condition for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; it became the first part of the Arab population.
Terrorist attacks were on both sides.
The Second World War was out, and if Hitler was gone from the chain where the international bankers had opened to him, or if everything was able to be able to estimate, the suffering of the Jews in the concentration stocks of the European Community is difficult to create the condition for the recognition of the Jewish State through the world.
Israel was founded in 1948, and also prepared by the war repairs against Germany for the Second World War, the call of Israel's state represents the creation of the brandpoint for the third World War.
The Jewish people will be like in the Second World War as victims in the first combat line, this time together with the Arab and Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a great lab, a source of war and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also international (the only thinking about how the people are shared in the covenant and the enemy of Israel).
Who is the guilty and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites, where the unrighteousness is solved only in an unlawful spirit of violence, which was at the beginning of the hundred individuals and their strives for global power?
There must be a distinction between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, but the international bankers in Israel are put to the choice only with us, the people.
The present Prime Minister of Israel, the Falk Netanjahu, is a typical example of a fascism-based policy, the international bankers who do everything to solve a war with Iran, which, as faced by Iran's membership in the Shanghai Organization for Cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan) could soon extend to a global conflict, and which is due to the control of Iran only 2 miles from the wide road of Hormus, about 20% of the world's oil supplies, could come to a devastation of the world economy.
In the light of which the words David Rockefellers from 1994 appear: "The only thing we need is a quiet crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
In their imagination, the new world rule is a world of rulers and slaves.
A world where the rest of human population serves a small group of financial aristocratics.
A world where each newborn is implanted for birth a chip to undertake this kind of total control.
"And it makes the little and the great, the riches and the poor, the free and the servants all gives a shock to their right hand or to their thresholds that no one can buy or sell, because he has the wrong sign, the name of the animal or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom! Whoever has understanding, who overcome the number of animals.
For it is a number of men, and his number is sixty-seventy."
The Argo film: If it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a demonstrating Islamic student in Teheran was the US message and took 52 diplomates as a smuggle.
For their release, they requested the extradition of the smooth Shahs Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was fled after the revolution in the United States, who kept the Patronat over his regime over a decade.
For the American Government, there was no positive way out of this situation - it could not be able to cut the shadow over board, as this would have been a massive damage to the confidence of their associates in other countries.
At the same time, she was not able to engage in Iran where the revolution was in the establishment of a theocratic regime to implement the release of the wheels.
It was a serious smile for the call of the unified States, and then the Fiasko in the violent attempt of freeship was worse.
The arrested diplomates were finally released after 444 days after negotiations were issued by the Algerian Government.
The shift of the legs called at home a wave of solidarity and anti-iranic estimates.
The Debacle in Iran has contributed significantly to the distortion of Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan in 1980.
The film Argo of the Registors and Against Ben Aphleck describes a episode of this story that the United States deserved a small part-party seat.
Six messages workers were flewing before the message was put.
This ended after numerous complications in the residue of the Canadian Botschafter.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities to bring refugees out of Iran, helped them a extravagant history to cover their true identity - they traveled with Canadian places as a member of a film stage that was available in the Drehorte for a scientific fiction film.
Combination of the genes
The expert for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, developed, also required the cooperation of Hollywoods.
In order to believe the appointment, articles appeared on this film project in posts, press conferences were held, and the flexibility production society had a real office.
The details of this operation were long secret. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Applecks film is a special combination of several film generators.
On the one side, he is a realistic politrist, but at the same time also a "Caper Movie", namely, the history of a progressed husaren room, such as the film of the Ocean's Elevens.
In this way, the level of stimulation of the film - on the one side, the documentary scenarios from Teheran (in the title sequence are shown iconic temporary photographs, and there are no major differences in the film review of the same situations).
On the other hand, the lockest passengers from Hollywood, which are irone and easyly oversight.
And then there's still the scenes from the CIA Center and other institutions - men at the board, on the official stream, on the phone...
Ben Appleck is a remarkable new start with this movie.
From a spectacular player, a respectable governance has become, and it is now not the goal of Iranian comments.
Argo is his third game film after the Krimi Noin child game (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the Triller City without Gnade (2010).
At the same time, it is the first movie of Appleck that does not play in the secret boston of the government.
The scene for the atmosphere of the place was part of the characters that deleted the previous films of this register from the standard Hollywoods.
However, Appleck shows this scene also in Argo where Teheran is played by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play on the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have actually occurred - the start of the struggle of the message is very impressionable in their oversight, and there is, however, the feeling of consciousness and inevitableness that involves whenever the story moves.
A similar effect is also achieved by Affeck with his team in fixed scenes (the wrong film tab on a baser in Teheran).
Too much to many places
The Governor also had to deal with the fact that the story was not actually offering a lot of shocking scenes in the film.
But he works successfully, while he sometimes helps the reality - which does not always act so elegant (the scenes where the threatening crisis on the airport in Teheran is used by a telephonemat in America, or also the persecution year on the starting trains, efficacy is planned).
The weakness of Argo is its all-wide relief required by the need to show too much action in many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood workers, but their figures had been more than room, and they are not alone in the film.
Applecks film loses something to the power. It's a movie that can be followed with a certain interest, and it is possible to control the design and the retro style that has been remembered in the 1970s.
However, it is only difficult to smell.
It is, however, sufficient when remembering a life - piece of history and as a evidence of how the ideas of all powerful and all-known secret services are.
Directives for the removal of airballs, bananas and circumstance
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which is a survey every year on the most absurd bank costs, has decided to register the competition of the "Abusive Regulation or ideas from the EU's shopping loan".
"After this idea, we had the most long-term plan of the EU to introduce a 40% of women in the management of large European companies", said Patrik Nacher, who cares for the organization of this survey, against the Pravo newspaper.
For example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the harmonisation of the insurance courts for men and women is presented under the designated insurances.
To this end, women in life insurance benefits because they are objectively a small risk for insurance companies.
"Incredibly unbelievable accidents from the EU changing may be named until the end of this year.
The real vote will then be followed until the end of February 2013," reported the Poster.
The contraventional regulations of the EU include, for example, the binding combination of bioethanol fuel that is naturally harmful, the ban of the reliable checksilber thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of this dangerous substance, or the directive on the size of hair bottles that have been significantly obtained in this year.
In the past, the factic prohibition of the use of the term "butter retreat" or also the foreign ban on sales for cows.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU Appeal Council often decides on the pressure of this lobby from trade and industry, whose demands in Brussels are regularly represented by one or more Member States (for example, Czech Republic is currently trying to implement the demands of veto drugs).
Lobby interests also found that bananas of the highest trade classes in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and not have a "anony of compliance".
The European Commission defended the argument that they would only harmonize the unilateral national standards that would defeat the trade.
The standards relating to fruit and vegetables were already indicated by the EU against the resistance of certain countries that the above directives would lead to the promotion of food.
A candidate for the victory in this investigation may be the EU Regulation in the last year, which must be paid under the sale of airballs in order to indicate that children under eight years of age should not be able to overlook the airball without oversight of an adult.
The EU was involved in a American study, which is the leading cause of children under airballs.
A similar restriction is already applicable for children up to 14 years in use of annual markets.
Curiose accidents are also home
A directive relating to the European officials, which takes a official function in the EU, may not use the name of Macedonia, and is to say, instead, FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server was appointed in cooperation with the Liberal Economy Association Laiß Faire, in addition to the insurances, also the EU Regulation on the extent of foodstuffs in the field of a Member State.
In this way, the EU set the maximum level of food arrangements, which were held on the day of our EU access to the Czech Republic.
Czechlands then exceeded, for example, the volumes set for pylz conservation, which threatened us to a high financial punishment.
The organizations of the survey also stressed the idea that certain countries should receive money in order to have no sea, but the idea to give aids to aid payers.
These ideas were freely not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We're not aware that we don't have a sea.
We will be invited to return to the EU,”, explained in spring 2004, the former Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (~SSD).
He argued that the cereals had been very high and the public loan was overcome according to the so-called intervention purchases.
Since Czech has another way to sea ports, the EU should pay for us hundreds of millions of euros.
Finally, the European Commission was so far that they organized an appeal on the purchase of cereals from countries which do not have access to the sea.
Contributors for subsidy grants requested the Ministry of Regional Development under the leadership of Minister Pavel Næmec (US-DEU) should, in this regard, be funded to be taken in Brussels.
EU: Wearing Regulations are the exceptions
However, the regulations in the Member States will be easy towards the goal of the criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate and thus to enhance the efficiency and development of the whole European Union, considering that some experts are more acknowledged.
There is a more serious problem in view of these experts, however, the EU supporters for projects which have nothing in common with the proliferation of European integration, which have been undertaken in the budget negotiations of individual Member States.
Emotions also call for the fact that Czechs have to be similar to other Member States in Brussels for the right to use specific designations of traditional products and not always win this fight.
Although Czech was able to defend the term "Olomoucké tvarśky" after a six-year-old battle with Germany and Austria, our manufacturers had to turn to the Inland rule (Tzemskýr rum), whose tradition was returned to us until the 19th century.
The name Rum shall only be used for products of sugar distillate, not for sugar products.
In the official list of the products registered in the EU, the company of the world's famous fatigue and Gorgonzola, Marzipans or parish machinery, also the carlsbaders, the carpets of Pohoṣṭelice and Tśeboō, or the Saazer Hopfen.
With a EU market, the Pardubicer Libkucks or the Hoo-icer roles can be broken.
"The people want to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," says Okamura.
Mr Senator, how is the idea to candidate the President's office?
I don't want to be Senator or President.
If everything works without problems in our country, I wouldn't claim anywhere.
But I can't see how the Republic has been slaughtered for 20 years, as the Defense is free, while people will increase taxes and pensions.
I didn't have an ambition to become politicians.
But if I see something that I don't like, then I try to propose a solution to change this.
And since I'm over 40, and independent and partial, I have no other possibility to affect things than to claim to the senator or the President.
In the Senate, you did it and then on the way you went to the barg.
Do you not return to your choices?
I told me all the time that I will take the fight on the barg after the Senate Selection result.
Afterwards, I have precisely said that I will be candidated to the President's office, if I would be chosen to Senator.
My goal is not the function, but the function is a tool that I can realize my visions.
For this, I need a lot of influence and a powerful mandate as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we switch as a people in the kitchen and before the television, but that every one wants to change something.
In this way, the media who want to smile the honor, and who change the freedom of the word with freedom.
For example, I was noted that I would take journalists or that I was advisers of Jiśí Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
The fight against the Burg has included these of the material and criminal responsibilities of politicians as well as with reciprocal statements on more than 20 million chrones.
You have to change the laws.
As President, you have no competence in this regard, and only the Senate can put forth legislation proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have set up that the travel leader remains a free purchase, and that could be implemented.
The problem is the small-scale policy - if someone comes from the right or left with a good proposal, this will be rejected, and this is only the population.
As an independent party, I have a widely larger potential to win support in all the parties represented in the Parliament.
My benefit is that I can take from every party the best for our country without shooting and partys.
Do you see as a man in the policy more right or left?
Czechic view seems to me that people see me more left.
For me, this right-links danks is very important.
It's important for me to continue.
It's not me if someone hears to the left or to the right layer; I want to connect the people.
I still support any good solution approach, even if this comes from the KSōM or from the ODS, and I will also ask me against bad ideas.
It misses you when someone calls you as a people.
But don't you confirm this by what you just said?
If you set a business plan in a company, then you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And you want to approach this.
This can be called as a population, but all the proposals I have spoken are already working in the world or have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in Parliament, you are only slaughtered.
And this is not long-term in the policy.
Or do you think that if you are only talking enough to the people, for example, to carry out material and criminal responsibilities?
I don't have any other chance.
Politicals, journalists and publicity try to make them on our side to implement these objectives.
As President, it would not be a problem for me to call the President of the Parliament's Party on the television in order to safeguard legally the material and criminal responsibilities for politicians, officials, judges and State advisers.
And then the appeal should say why they reject it.
A strong personality, which refers to misconduct, can exercise pressure on the political scenes.
Take only once the direct choice of the President, who was a service of the public press.
I'm very clear that I'm an amateur; I'm no genie or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find associates for my views and visions.
With the policy I just started and tried to find support for my programme for the majority.
I always try to judge the things itself; and if it doesn't hurt, then I'll go back in six years in the private sector.
This sounds a little like we should save Okamura Czech.
I'm not a salvator.
I know that I do not reach anything alone; therefore, I have spoken with several known personalities about whether they do not want to candidate for the Senate.
I spoke, for example, to Radin Jančura, who refused for labour expenditure.
In addition, I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencova, who covered the fraud in the trade with easier heat.
My candidate began with the condition that people are deeply unpleasant, but now I'm not sure.
Six percent of the election authors have not been taken to the elections, and those who have passed have chosen most of the representatives of the Stabilisation.
We are just two independents in the Senate.
People have chosen such a senate assembly that changes will be very difficult.
However, I will fight for my visions, for example for the direct choice of the citizens and the headquarters.
Do you think about the creation of a own party?
I did not think about this because I have no time to check the past of any potential membership, and even have no money for it.
I have no more money for the President's campaign; my transparent account is only 20,000 CZK.
You don't have money?
Are you talking about ownership statements, how do you see?
My privacy is estimated by about 60 million CZK.
In Praga I have a baseball with a value of 25 million, a apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, a art collection that is about 10 million, and a Aston Martin for 3,5 million and a skodu Superb, which is about a million. Then I have another million on the account.
At the other time, Aston Martin was a child traum - James Bond always struggled me as he went in the car, galvanted to women and struggled against the wicked.
You're walking a Aston Martin, have a possession of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but your own money you don't want to invest in it.
It's not just convinced.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
I'm going to make some debts?
I've already stolen 2,5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my program is not too interested.
And I'm not able to run the campaign out of my own resources.
The costs for the campaign are based on my content as a senator.
But from the senator's content I couldn't live alone; so I could not finance my son the English school that costs 30,000 per month.
If I just wanted to get money, I wouldn't like anything.
So do you continue to work as a entrepreneur to have your expenses?
Didn't you tell you that you will return these activities?
But this does not share with the height of the content.
As I promised, I took part of my activities.
So, for example, my supervisor will be in the early year of the travel office.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saved the Republic.
But I have to live from something.
What monthly income were you as a entrepreneur?
It's still that 200,000 to 400,000, and that's still.
However, as President, I would set up my submissions completely.
The complete conversation is available in the Summit Output of Pravo.
The MVRDV architects show that the real abenteues are not only in the head - the example of picches and the recently created bookberg - 2 photos
"I find the building sweet, it looks futurely, and finally there's something interesting to see", says Lisette Verhaig, a passenger on the road.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a neighborhood, means, "Doch, it's beautiful, the house."
But I'm wondering why we need a bookshop today.
All have Internet, iPad and e-books.
No man is still voluntary to this old style Bible, isn't it?
Spijkenties, a little tough sleep cities before the Tower Rotterdams, is another registry holder.
The 80,000 people's community is the lowest education rate of all the Netherlands.
A few years ago, in order to deal with this stupid situation, you decided to contribute to general training and to build the seven fixed bridges represented on the euro appearances as well-sized steel beet ministries.
The success of educational opening was limited.
And so the Titans recognized that there was only one possibility to become the statistics Lord: a library should come!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdamer Architecture Office MVRDV, master of the great cooked balken diagrams and producer of wide, often cynic buildings, took the matter with habitat validity and appeared to the competitive hearing year 2003 with five books under the arm and a grins in the face.
And while the Jury still was shocking to look up and shoot with the axles, the fresh Maas switched his readed dimensions to a pyramid and ended his actionistly understood words: "Life city community!"
That's why he's my proposal for the bookberg of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Buekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euros are shocked.
It is part of a revitalization project, including the deep garage, the supermarket, the post and a few cross-border accommodations with a total of 50 apartments.
The bookberg was exhibited by the second price "Best Library of NL 2012".
Moreover, the project for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012 is named.
This is the unfair small-scale of small town that had not even been offering than a postmodern football zone and a unconsistent sweet house, behind which white fassades would be able to swim a molecule manufacture for a part of temporary architecture more richer.
However, in particular, skins now have the first public culture in the history of his existence.
The long way to the book
The first impression: Bookerdorado under cocktail.
There is a lift that leads through the midst massive, but the true space and read rejoiced with the smiling point of topography.
The rounded internal space is light and overridely, the burned klinker grounds and the elegant road lators speak uncomfortablely the language of a public city place.
The urban environment is perfect.
You're already looking at Parkbank, dog and football kids and girls playing.
And overall books, books, books.
"Only, the booking rules are around the fassade, and in the midst there is a large, dark room, which is most insecure and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We have set the classic space configuration on the head and set the read area of inside to outside.
The inside of the bookberg is used: offices, internet library, chat club, environmental center and housetech centers in the middle.
A special joy are the black books rule, which once shift, rounding times, a styling country.
Optics, haptics and gentlemen are foreign.
Even inflicted architects and buildings protect the head of the unknown material.
"We wanted to work here with recycling materials," said Joop Trouborst, a project leader at the city community, on demand of the standard.
And so, in a fresh agricultural industry one day, we have taken a suitable disappearing product from the agricultural.
For many years, in the Netherlands, there is a millimeter of millimeters of artificial fleet on fields.
That's valid and efficace.
The thin textile holds, two seasons, then it's rifle for the sperrheel.
For the library, the fleet was first pressed in these quantities to four centimeters of dick plates.
Under heat effect and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) is a dark, homogeneous, loadable material that slows up to new cars and a sports shock.
After 105 steps, you've been started at the top.
At the end of the about 500 meters long shift in the literature coffee, you will be rewarded not only with a fantastic view on the city, but also with Holland crochets and covered ficus trees.
They care for atmosphere, but especially for the correct air temperature in the literature area.
Buy for the new soul
"It wouldn't believe, but this house is, despite the many glass surfaces, a previewed project in ecology", says Trouborst.
Heating and cold is heat with earthquake.
Although the bookberg is under a glass tour, the sun itself seems only short in the inside.
The width wood liners, which want to be glass fashion, serve as a observance and a majority of the sun infiltration.
The space climate is very pleasant.
The rest of all automatic roles.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptics from the IT branch, already shocked the path into the new bookshop.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, which is called Boekenberg, "the longest overwhelming soul".
The reason: To open a few weeks ago, each resident was invited to sell a book from his personal file.
This first is to be filled with the optical kitchen in which it is still not completely equipped with 70,000 pieces of library.
The concept is ongoing.
The rules are completed until above.
"There is nothing worse than a half more library," says Architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation every resident has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just the ring.
In this regard, MVRDV is the progress of the king disciplin, which is called at the expertise office.
Spikes wrote literature stories.
So young and unfavourable can also be.
This is finally a point of approach for identity.
Szabo: "Germany must play greater role."
Germany has contained the vote on the adoption of Palestine's vote.
According to Stephen Szabo, experts for US-European relations, Berlin balances this on a slight diplomatic degree.
German Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had first reported that it would vote against the application to a observer status of the Palestinians at the United Nations.
But then Berlin was gone.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelites did in Gaza.
However, Germany must be careful because of his special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time I believe that it does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - however, without being critical to Israel.
During the stay in Libya in March 2011, Germany also endorsed the vote when it came to establish a flight prohibition zone.
This was finally implemented by NATO.
Is Germany difficult to address a clear position in important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is that it just turns its foreign policy, but it is away from a policy, which has been managed by the United States towards a German foreign policy.
It is unfortunate that Europeans do not have coherent and uniform policies.
The Germans are therefore opposed to the fronts.
They are expected to play an independent role, but they are not deceived.
I believe they still play their role, but they are on the way towards a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy as they have France or British.
What means a "normal" foreign policy, which is concrete from German view?
It shows the willingness to relate to national interests also to positions that are independent of the United States or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy, such as exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China and the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are different from the other major powers, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests affected the situation in the Nahost conflict and the vote in the United Nations?
At one point, Germany has large paragraph markets in the Middle East, especially in the Golf States.
The public must therefore be careful, but also the elites, not to shoot in the Arab countries.
This plays a role in every case.
But I wouldn't like to take too much weight, that's not a very single relationship.
But it plays an important role in German discussions.
Has Germany damaged his relationship with the United States by engaged in the important decisions of the vote, such as in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe and even in the United States there is a great understanding for the German position.
This is why I don't think that this was such a dramatic break, as in the libyical question.
It may even be a certain respect for Germany.
It is noted that it will be taken seriously as an international player and should be considered its interests.
There are various views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
However, the United States have clearly spoken for a veto.
Is there opinions between the United States and many European nations?
As a result of the American internal policy, these varieties have always existed.
I think that the government under Obama will have a lot of understanding for the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government may not, of course, represent this position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not even so large as they are ever appearing.
If you look at the relationships between Obama and Prime Minister Netanjahu, then Obama is not so excited by the Netanjaus policy.
Is Germany difficult to harmonize his close relationship with Israel and the United States on the one side and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other side?
I believe that is so hard for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little more easy for the Germans if it gives a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not now the case.
So they can't be part of a broader line and need to take out things from their own position.
They do it just with the euro.
I believe that in the future, Germany will take a leading role towards Europe to a European position.
Of course, this is not just for Germany, because of the relationship with Israel.
It was always a fantastic topic.
But I think the Germans are clear that they must play an independent role.
Does Germany itself look as an important international player - would Germany really want to take a main role?
Or is Germany still involved the leadership role?
Germany is not still inclined to play a greater role in this country, because of the obvious reasons, it is still hard to play a greater role.
For example, when we look at the Eurocrisis, each time Germany takes a greater role, the different anti-South feelings will be free.
That's not easy to the Germans.
This is in fact the old problem: you don't want to be round from finish countries.
As you see, Germany is in a very harder position than the United States.
It must be acceptable for various neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
Now the impact of the United States in the European policy continues, but the EU does not fill this vacuum, who remains there otherwise?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Even if it doesn't like them, it's unpleasant to them and makes them much unloved - it's life!

"Marke Protection" in China: If Puma and Armani soon becomes Chinese
Armani is a world-known brand, Polo Ralph Lauren also.
What's Armani Polo?
In this way, a totally official title in China is hidden, but nothing has to do with the original companies.
However, she enjoys protection as long as the real namers do not complain.
And then it's not clear if they're right.
"There's always more difficult for foreign countries to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer at the officer Taylor Wessing, who is specialized on protection rights violations in television.
Each week, a new case is on my desktop.
The posters already have a few additional letters to enable them to log in their brands.
So, from Gucci simply Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada, you can take Prada Kny.
The German companies are also legally copyed in this way, such as the Sports Artist Manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with entries from the Market Office in Peking.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company protected the trade mark Zegna DF Puma, a artistic name which was also located at the house of Hermenegildo Zegna.
That Chinese world masters are known in copy and in the last painted spiritual property.
In the large cities there are several shopping houses that are almost exclusively sold fatalities.
But Pattloch's cases are different: in order to his mandate, it is noted that Chinese undertakings from the Markenitz are officially obtained the right to use a title which is already protected anywhere else.
The Chineses call the "Bang Mingpai", a driving brand.
The word runs to "Bang Dakuan."
In this way, women are common and rich men are slaughtered.
The Chinese authorities are not conscious of any debt
"It's businessful, you have to fight it", says Pattloch.
"The brand is defeated, the single setting disappears, the image damage is a huge."
Financial waste and the process costs of the sectors concerned are in the millions, especially in the case of growing advanced products.
According to the CLSA market research company, China is with a volume of 15 billion euros in the year of the third largest market for luxus arts and the fastest growth.
However, the removal of dubian entries in the brand register are difficult to reach and go to money.
By nine years, the procedure can be introduced with indefinite start.
Pattloch reports cases in which the Court of Justice declared that after the long period of the announced name to "marktrency".
If the applicant has Pech, he should even pay the plagitor for his mark in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes this is the law of the drunk.
Renounced cases are also related to graphic elements.
2009 Daimler lost a legal strict with the Sany machine manufacturer, the company who recently overcome the German Beton pump-building puzzmeister.
The Chineses may therefore use a emblem that differents Mercedes stars until today.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-wheel logo that reminded BMW; the war was shut down, Geely had to change it.
Model manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against postmers from Hong Kong and Singapore, who saw the famous Krokodil in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any fault.
However, the Markenamt CTMO in Peking indicates that there was a low-scale staff and space reserve in 2010.
However, in the past year the "notification situation in the labour end has been returned to normality".
So it is 22% of the stock of unprocessed income procedures.
Fast 57.000 such cases have been completed, 75% more than in the previous year.
However, in the office, there were still 81.500 replies.
At the same time, much costs
As often in China, the numbers are impressed.
In the past year, more than 1,4 million market protection applications have been introduced to CTMO, almost one third more than 2010.
This is a record, and it is noted that China starts the list of new advertisements in all the world for ten times.
This also paid for the stock of all valid brandmarks, totally 5,5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion Yuan had been adopted on expenditure.
It simply means that any registration in the lock of 1280 Yuan or 160 euros costs.
Nevertheless, a variety of costs is shown in the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For over seven years the concerts are fighting against a Chinese plagictor.
However, the Germans could find that their illegal manufacturing had been extracted by implanted motor vehicles.
But the poster continued to ensure the Chinese rights at the Marke Freudenberg.
It has itself been disappointed because family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, President of the Management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munchen.
The Markenamt CTMO showed that the muncher was back.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg had been right, but the processor continued to fight until today.
You have to be able to switch up
Now the case is depending on the Supreme Court of Justice.
The committee is convinced to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and endorses the professionality of the courts.
But he also says, "The procedure is extremely useful and costs us a lot of time, money, and nerves."
The internal expenditure was unlikely that the company's firm archive had to take care of several hundred years of old data to prove evidence.
Freudenberg, five years ago, offers the side a "heighten euro amounts" to be accompanied.
"Dran is seeing how much the value is to us", says Wentzler.
The dangers in the television threatened to rear to Europe.
Then, if the immunists are safely protected brands there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to login the name Freudenberg for Schuhe and Leder.
This business field has long stopped the concert, however, he could suspend the registration.
"They must be upright", says Wentzler.
And as well as the lawyer Pattloch, German enterprises were very careful for businesses with China.
It is not rich to leave international market rights, but the foreigners should "all things that are likely to be protected, even in China," as Wensler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more tolerated than the registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg subscribes the last act of his marketing camera, then the contrary side should be paid licenses for the own name, the Witzler declares.
Or we will be dragged from the market in a fragrant segment.
World Aid Day: Stampfen, singen, help
In Heidelberg, the Chor Imbongi and Swaziland experiences AIDS weapons.
The history of a connection that overcomes over 8733 miles.
First, there's the stamp: cowboys depth, basketball shoes, damn pomps and gentle lipper searching for the parking ground, find it fast.
A twenty-third.
Then the voices of the songs slowly shout - Old, Bass, Tenor and Sopran - are threatening, disrupting and persecuting.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old ancestors, had it almost from his shoes when he joined them with his wild beasts.
It is Montaday, in the music room of the Institute for Medicine Psychology in Heidelberg, the Chor Imbongi is a new song.
To the fifty songs and songs, between 23 and 69 years old, from the human genetics to the houseman.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple part, every chorstim has another text and it is still in a very foreign language: Zulu, which is spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Auto-Assistance
There are around the world around 34 million HIV infected, which estimates uniid, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS.
23.5 million people live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, there are 245.000 AIDS wheels.
More than 40% of the population are positive in this case.
For 180 AIDS weapons in the village of Esitjeni the United Voices for Africa Paten has found in Germany.
70 of them visit a continued school.
For 15 or 20 euros in the month, a patent can be taken.
It guarantees the child's debt, school unit and a warm breakfast daily in the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means Zulu's historical accounters or even loving.
The Bantus language fluctuous can no one speak in this room, but sing.
Since nearly ten years, the Chor songs have been in this foreign swimming language and brings it back and then returns to where they are originally coming: in South Africa.
Because 8 733 km from Heidelberg airline, northwest of the Swaziland Kingdom, there is the village of Esitjeni, which is from the German Stimm George of the Chores.
40% are infected
About 2000 people live there, some still in simple lehm and strohs, most of them are children.
More than 300 of them have no longer parents because they have been produced to the HI virus.
In Esitjeni, in the smallest, Swaziland is sick: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectation worldwide, according to Unicef.
Infringements of men who are obviously reduced the risk of accumulation will not be accepted by the population.
More than 40 percent of people in Swaziland have the immune sweet virus in itself, to die with a mid-third of death is not rare.
During a joint African journey in spring 2005, the Chor found the village, especially the Imbongis saw many children on the streets which did not only miss older care, but simply all: food, clothing, education.
Without the school, you have no opportunity in a poor country.
At the beginning, it was still the private commitment individuals to send a child to school for a few euros in the year and to allow him a warm breakfast on the day.
But a year later, the Chor founded the Covenant "Voices for Africa", which is almost professionally careful about the AIDS channels in Esitjeni.
Facts on sexual transmission
What are the most important sexually transmissible diseases?
The bacterial STI contain syphilis, chlamdians and Tripper (Gonorror).
Frequent viral STI are HIV, human papilomavirus, herpes genetic or hepatitis.
The filthrace and snakes belong to the parasitarian STI.
Who are the main groups?
Syphilis and Trippers are mainly present with men who have sex with men.
The Robert Coch Institute shows that at least four of five of all Syphilis reported in Germany are transferred by sexual contacts between men.
Theeroexual adults are often predictable sexually transparent diseases in chlamidaen infections, trichomonates, candiosis (Pilz), tripper and human papilomavirus.
The dissemination of HIV is relatively low in the country under the theerosexual adults - however, round 20% of the HIV renal infections caused to this group.
Through adolescents, chlamdien infections are significantly more frequent than other population groups.
After European surveys, three four hundreds of all infections of young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
In this case, human papilomavirus are often presented in adolescents.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmissible diseases are binding.
The number of syphilis infections has been doubled by the Robert Coch Institute in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of HIV new infections is back since 2007.
2011 there was about 2700 cases.
This is about a ten less than in the year before.
What symptoms indicate on sexual disease?
Infection diseases can be caused by shoes in the gental area, complaints at urination, flow, underbase pain and blondes or goods.
However, they often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unobserved.
How can you protect yourself?
Condomes can reduce the risk of packing, but do not provide 100% protection.
Because, in part, the injuries of sexually transmissible diseases may also be delivered by smererinfections and close body contacts.
As a result, experts recommend, in particular, regular investigations in often changed sex partners.
Before diagnosed, most of the TSIs can be improved and the latest results are avoided.
By patentships, costs and not lastly the guests that the Chor comes in the whole of Germany, some come together.
"In total, we already sent about 2000,000 euro to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, President of the Agreement.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-conscious and translating woman, managed money from Germany.
She also cares that the wheels go well, about one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as you call the old women to Zulu, are the foundations of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 hours, give them a towel over their head and ensure that the children in their units appear recently to school education every day.
Nobody else has come to the Protection House of Khanyisile, a single woman who is in the same way paid by the Convention as the two kitchens that cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
Furthermore, "Voices for Africa" has called a neighborhood in life, built two hairhouses and organized together with the American Health Organization PSI that many have made a HIV test in the village.
This is not self-consciousness, because this is evidently also the disease in the whole country, and it is the most loved to die.
A King with 14 wifes
"Aid is a absolute table," says Annette Lennartz, "for it has to do with sexuality."
Indeed, it is rare in a country where the king has officially held 14 wifes.
The last absolute Monarch Blacksaw Africa, King Mswati III., is known for its extreme life style.
Poligamie instead of Democracy.
Among other things, this stately sanctioned life form has been debt that the HI virus has been so rapidly expanded in the last decades.
But also the many channel workers that carry the virus through the country.
Free condomes give it to every edge, says Annette Lennartz, "but those are not used.
The culture is another - flesh to flesh."
To promote the cultural exchange, the Imbongi-Chor travels all two, three years together through the South Africans and sing sing full weight, fighting, confidence and black self-consciousness, many of which are known in the south-south of the black continent still from the times of apartheid.
A full white bus that songs in a black language sing - so much acknowledgement brings not only stimulation and joy, but also some green border soldiers have struck a few traces.
The journey always leads to Esitjeni where the songs visit their fathers.
Even if you find the small village on landcards, in the Tal of the Ezulweni flights it is more known.
"Go to Esitjeni, there's the light," people say there.
And when you return the 8733 km airline to Heidelberg, you see it lighting there.
Messenger: NASA discover the Eis on the mark
The Sunde Messenger has found evidence that there's a ice on the planet.
The iron ice should probably be 20 meters dry.
The NASA Railway Authority has demonstrated the existence of Eis on the Planet Merkur.
Although he stands next to the sun, there are also frozen waters, such as three studies published on Thursday at Sunday in the "Science" specialist.
The Sunde Messenger has found evidence that there is a irondeck in the permanent shadow of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and maybe even up to 20 feet.
The water probably came from commits or maybe even asteroids that were covered on the mark.
No one had the fund of iron but related to the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger Son, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the marking can reach up to 426 degrees of Cellsius.
However, the Funds could help to clarify how water and other stones of life have been achieved in other areas of the sun system.
Uncertainly from the earthly citizens are sounds, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix to investigate the depths of the world.

One of the greatest and hardest accommodations of the Hubble Telescope: The Whirlpool galaxie
After coloring, accommodations of Spiralgalaxes will be real artworks.
The inscription published by the Southern European weather shows the Trifid levels removed by several thousands of light years in the star image.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifius (third parts, three dimensions), since dark staubs are three parts of the flattering heart of the stars.
In the star image, the astronoms have photod the offers of a cosmic carboat: 400 million light years away from the earth, the nuclears of two different galaxies will be collected and are uncertainly collected with each other.
These stars-building marked the Hubble telescope in the Spiralgalaxie M83.
Who does not have technical delays, he may call it to the South Fire Raid with its sight names.

In this hell rare galaxy with a small black loch there is no steel, but only gas.
Scientists estimated that he was just a few days after the urcnale that was found in the universe.
Our views in all: The most important telescopes
The telescope will be found by Hans Lipperhey 1608 - even before Galileo Galilei set it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the sculptures of the optical telescope were always greater - and the views they deliver are always deep.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope of the world.
The spiegel, here in the image, had a average of five meters.
In Arizona, the large Binocular Telescope is located in the United States.
It allows sights all over two skins, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The lives of the Great Telescope Canaria on the Canary of La Palma is riesing - only the spiegel is 10,4 meters in the diameter.
The spiegel of South African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmentated - to expend the costs.
However, he reached a diameter of about 11 meters.
The part of the favorable construction method: The telescope is fixed in its height ring, and therefore limits its movement.
The Hobby-Eberly-Teleskop in Texas is also fixed in the height ring.
His speciality is the high light collection power.
Indeed, it is sufficient - although comparedly small sculptures - to the largest sculpture of the world.
With the help of a radiotelescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers listen to all after extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
The "Search for Extraterreal Intelligence" (SETI) may help each computer owner by providing account service.
See the observatory of the European Starwarte (ESO) in the Chile Andean.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - which makes his name all honour.
With its total four spectrums the television can also light the average infrastructure spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is planned on the Chile ESO Observatory.
The main level should include 42 meters and will be compiled from about 1000 spring elements.
But with images it is to be recruited early 2018.
By 2007 the two Keck Telescopes were the largest of the world in Hawaii Vulkan Mauna Kea.
You're just offering two spheres with a average of ten meters.
The Keck Telescope is part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which still looks close to them with the subaru telescope and the IRTTF in heaven.
The Mauna Kea also has a new, huge telescope - with a thickness of thirty meters.
Here it is to surprise it on a illustration.
However, the main impressions from all are provided by the world space telescope Hubble.
Since April 24, 1990, there are images from far worlds.
Since March 2009, the World Space Telescope Kepler is looking for extrasolar planets, especially for those living.
On 2 February 2011, Nasa was announced that 1235 planet candidates were identified since the beginning of mission.
In the image, the last starting preparations are documented on the world space telescope Kepler.
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be shooted at the edge of a Ariane5 rats in all early 2018.
The primary level of the world spatial infraroutelescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: it should be searching after light of the first stars and galaxies after the urnnall.
Scientists believe that there is also the South Pole of the Merkur Eis.
However, there is no reliable data, since the messengers are closer to North Pool towards the planet.
Radar measurements have been reported for decades that there is ice on the mark.
By 2004, the Messenger sound started - the first who created the marker - has now awareness of the scientists.

In the south of Aserbaidschan, many people have a Bible high age.
There is even a museum for long life.
Search in the country where 97-year-olds are still young.

Search in the country where 97-year-olds are still young.
The driving through the Talysh berg is to be called Wildromant.
The small bus is cut over the curvenic streets, crossing closely controlled hills, swimming rivers and simple farm houses.
Everything's green and slight, you could think you're in the black walde.
But this is the deepest south of Aserbaidschan, the border to Iran is just a few miles away.
Here lives the Kasachian people of Talicia, which is not well known, except that they are perfectly persic and asercic and very long-term.
Findstation is Lerik.
The small cities of Swedish times, which are not going to be in the Malean mountain country.
Tourists from Europe aren't coming here, to be obvious, the driving of Aserbaidschan's capital city Baku.
For the 323 kilometers, you need eight hours, because the road is only simple.
The divine riches that the country thanks to its oil in the Caspian sea have not yet come here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the census for tourist attraction.
"Baku was famous in May with the Eurovision-Song Festival, and in the next year we have here a festival of the oldest people of the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum for Long Life, probably the only in the world.
Here is documented the Vita of about eight twenty-third Talizen from the area, which is older than 100. Fatulayeva shows on a black weight photo.
This is my grandfather. He's been 120 years old.
In the age of 136 years, a child has been witnessed
However, the murdering star of the museum is the Sharali Muslumo, which has been born 168 years old.
However, there is no birth survey.
And in view of the oldest documented person who was 122 years old, Muslumo age seems very doubtful.
"1805 he was born here in the region, 1973 he died," explained Fatulayeva.
The man had been married three times and had 23 children, in the age of 136, he had to have witnessed a daughter.
So Shirali Muslumo has been calculated for a few decades at his age?
But also Rembrandt Schulz, a age researcher at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard from the high juveniles in Mediterranean.
"In some areas of China, Japan or Hungary Tal in Pakistan, there are also many high-alternants", said Scholz, "you lives very many old men in Sardinia."
However, because of lack of documents, there should be no scientific evidence about the age, in particular the state registers of persons.
Every day, smooth Butter
But the fact is that people in the region are often reaching a Bible age around them.
There are now 20 people older than 100 years.
Why, then, live here in the south?
The Asian travel leader Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talischen.
However, museum director Fatulayeva believes that it is in the food.
However, the calculation of the calorian costs of the Taleans is so healthy, the flesh, bread, and especially milk products, and from which many of them drink a glass smooth butters daily, appears not just likely from food science.
Or is it the original way of life that people are young? In Cengeiran, a changing seed near Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
With its 97 years of age, she is still young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, who is intended to have 143 research, lives in a simple wood house, which is typically for the whole coast region.
She's sit on the ground with a butter fass that rolls and rolls in a swimming way.
Eight people live here under a toilet, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both are older ones.
Two little kids smile too.
In the kitchen, you will prepare the guests of the tea that is served in the typical, smooth armadu vegetables.
Mirzayevas white dents are perfect in Reih and Membered, she hides in its head-to-top long, dark-blood teeth that her son is proud of us.
I've always got my hair with milk, so they never left me and holded their colors.
"Shampoo has never used", says Mirzayeva.
Monthly interests are sufficient for life
She has always eating what she had from her own court, tomates, cards, herbs.
I haven't purchased a single time in the supermarket food throughout my life.
Then she talks about her man who was in the army.
The worst was in time after the Second World War.
But everything was better than the "loved father" Heydar Aliyew overcome the ruder.
The Propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of a old woman.
However, the cult that is run to the paternal figure of the nation who ruled his country as a dictator is little known in Aserbaidshan.
He was on the power until 2003, and his son, Ilham, went over the ruder.
There is no note under Aserbaidschan's old.
230 Manat (which the same amount in euro), Mirzayeva receives monthly as interests, a amount from which you can live well.
And maybe the Mirzayevas also had a long time of brilliant son: "The elders enjoy in our culture of high quality."
They live in the midst of the great family, are loved, careful and are happy.
If this is not a reason to stay as long as possible
The word "man rights" lacked in the Constitution
Revolution is returned to Cairo.
Revalising partnerships in Cairo reveal the deep spacing of the country.
The future constitution with the Charia as a basis is strongly overcome.
The Egyptian President did not get away with Pathos.
We need to make the transition.
"And what he comes, is in my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said in the state view.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but especially to the Christian cops, the liberals, declared Muslims and Sakulars.
Because they all have feared that, until now, they are unforeseen in a convicted opposition.
Be afraid of a state of God in the rank of the grace of the powerful Muslim brotherhood.
He had, so Mohammed Mursi said, almost apologizing, interimly shared the competences of the Constitution Court and extended his competences "to save the Revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer wants to save a doctorate title of the United States University of South California, the Egyptians are, the world is not all clear.
Should the judiciary be considered?
Indeed, the articles 234, which have been covered by the Islamic 100-traditional Constitutional Assembly in a nightly 15-stage parforcerit, are partially concerned.
Like in previous Constitutions, it is also the draft, the legal practice based on the "Islamic law principles".
But what's "principes"?
This was and is the case of interpretation and it is to fear that Islamics will be used by the weird formulation and by the corresponding legal space for a more strict interpretation of the charia.
This is nearly a new article added: in all the matters concerned, the Al-Ashar University should be put into charge, the most important Islamic institution of the country, with great radiation force in the entire Sunnitic Islam.
This must not, but it may mean that clergy monitors legislation, which actually had the proclamation of the judiciary.
Many in the fairly-sufficient draft is an interpretation case
It is also problematic: Civil military justice must continue to keep maintaining.
These courts served during Mubarak's rule on the interpretation of oppositions.
After the struggle of the dictator, up to 11.000 civilians were armed.
The State should also, in the draft, protect "the true things of the Egyptian family" and promote their moral and values".
This is legally so wearing that public institutions with this article may even control the contents of film art and literature.
In the clear text, it means nothing else than center.
No article otherwise expresses the equality of men and women.
For this, another bans to ruin or disbelieve the prophets Mohammed and his messengers.
And what is a reproach and how it is to be devoted remains unclean.
Similarly, dubios has the "prohibition of people".
Is there a carriage of the President or a witz on the costs of a lawyer?
Explication cases, as many in the draft, the musi is subscribed and will be presented by the Egyptians to the vote.
"The Revolution is returned."
The opposition has been formed for weeks against the overseas of Islamics.
Ten thousands gathered in an inhabited meeting on Friday on the Tahrir plate in Cairo and ordered to bring the Charta into case, even before they could enter into force.
"The Revolution is returned and we will be blessed," said Hamdin Sababai, third-party of the presidential choice.
Peace Nobel Prices and former Chief of the International Atomenergy Authority Mohamed El-Baradei explained that the Constitutional Project heard "to the Müllberg of History".
via short news service Twitter, he argued to want to lead to a "Putch against democracy".
"When he calls the referendum, we'll go to his palace and shoot him," said the opposite jaser Said.
"We are not still angry, the blood of our brothers is not still guilty", the Egyptian media cited the opposition policy Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced that the referendum would not want to monitor what would be wrong.
"The Koran is our Constitution."
The well-organized muslim fraternity was on the contradiction, but not on the Tahrir plate, but after a mass prayer on the other Nilufer before the university of Cairo.
Many of the safid women and attendants took part in it and called: "The people demands the application of God's law."
They called by Mursi: "Save the land!" and rebuked: "The Coran is our Constitution."
A fight for the highness of the symbolic Tahrir plate, where all its beginning was, would have been resurrected in the similar states of civil war.
This was obviously not the risk of the Mursi's attachors.
Muslim brothers explained, both the opposers of the Constitution and the Prosecutors would have expressed themselves clearly and clearly.
Now, be the time to decide the people at the election round, in which direction the country is to go.
A majority of Islamic projects applies as safe.
"The word of human rights is not even before."
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this constituted Constitution process that should actually go to February and join all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were under Mubarak in prison or in court.
Not because he would share their world view, but because human rights are unpartial for him.
For that he was tried, condemned, arrested.
"And now the word of human rights isn't even in the new Constitution," he claims in the conversation with the "Wolf on Sunday."
Muri Machta Extension to all three violences in the State let the lawyer resign.
These measures are clearly violating democratic rules and Egyptians will lead to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening the civil society, the President sets it in fact unfortunately", said Saeda.
However, without civil society organizations, a democracy cannot work.
Saeda feels alone, even the international community, which considers the ideological orientation campaign at the Nile with a mixing of new and spanishment.
It could be broken.
A demonstrant on the Tahrir warns: "You have a monster that you can't control again."
Rakvisk from Norway: Is this the worst fish in the world?
The five million norwegians enjoy one of the highest standards of life - not only in Europe, but in the whole world.
Can the success secret of the country have something to do with the local appetite on a very angry fish?
You take a selection of overwhelming kitchen types.
They are placed in the midst of a swimming, sweet sports clothing.
And she got her a week there.
As far as you have to imagine, Rakfisk is one of the great delict Norwegians.
I'm located in the small town of Fagernes, just three hours away from Oslo.
There are dark, spectacular landscapes here - and this hard degree in the air that simply doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfisk is with salt, which - depends on how to smile his fish - is made up to one year in water.
If in Norway the darkness comes over the country and the weather becomes more slower, Norwegians will become a festival here in Fagernes, which is now really worthy speciality.
"With it spirit and then swim it down with a glass aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local firewave, but as a named "Raakfisk-General" also the festival.
To save us small fishermen and take large numbers of alcohol.
"Many people like the Aquavit more than the Rakfisk," says Havard.
The spirituosis can disappear the skin.
I'm buying a few cups.
If you avoid taking the ramfisk close to Nasen, he's not bad - like Sushi, who has a long bus road behind himself.
Rakfisk is the product of a totally nice, sweet-friendly Norwegian era, as it has not yet been refrigerated, and fish was restricted in smooth salt water.
In the deepest winter, he was then taken out after long closing and, unfortunately, deteriorated by alcohol-defect senses.
Before a generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to seek to leave their country and to turn their country mainly into the United States.
Today, the population grows rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, closed by a flowering labour market, high losses and a comprehensive health.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, which was not too long ago more rich than Norwegians, strict immigrants.
Rakfisk is seen as a matter of importance - as a more essential, even a strict part of the Norwegian history.
He belongs to the thirst courts that you can buy here.
But in fact, it's all costing here - a small glass or a sandwich costs 10 euros.
Norwegia does not often make it in the world press, and most people seem to't worry about it.
There is still a hate to call Anders Brevik on the name - those racial extremists, who shooted 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, it's only about the "prevention of July 22".
Norwegians are hard to accept that someone is capable of such brutal murder in their peaceful country.
The main responsibility for the current riches of Norwegia has been the growth of one of the largest oil and gas industry in the world since the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason why it's so good to us," says Anna, our kitchen, who distributes round tablets with riif rackfisk, and represents the northern ideal with its long-blood hair and the blue eyes.
We are a - as we say - a supervising people.
Your English is exactly as the majority of people here makes.
We're not very awesome, we don't like predatory.
Norwegia is very careful with its oil riches - a large part of the sectors is invested in a special fund for future generations.
In the years until the world's economic crisis, all of them were struggling with money that they did not have, Norwegia closed his money offices.
"When we can walk in winter ski and walk in the summer, we're happy," says Anna.
"and of course eat Rakfisk," she adds with uncertain laugh.
I stood in the snow and put me for another court - from Rakfisk I have enough.
So a Elch-Burger is something else in any case, the sweet meat is smelling.
But on the evening, the Stinkefish is on the food plan.
The hotel in which I log, is one of the several events that organize a rakfisk diner, with the guests for the best - or maybe the consumer seats are the most strongest - fish.
There is a Live-TV screening to a show master switched with flights that is rounded by spaers with rakfisk.
The spectacle shares the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What number of points have you there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgers?"
"There are our points, Havard."
You're kidding and laughing.
A man falls from his steel, maybe overcome by the Aquavit.
But maybe it's the strict dark of the whole fish.
Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto is before difficult start
While the future President of Mexico Enrique Pena Nieto is prepared at its official meeting, Will Grant analyzes the challenges that he has faced and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently the transport is very bad in Mexico.
Even in better days, this is a constantly hidden city, but on Monday was created a ring of steel, which switchs several major roads in the capital city and ensures the streets of Chaos.
The objective was, however, not to defeat the Pendler on the way to work, but to prevent demonstrates to achieve the Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new President Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the Presidents and take the leadership of the nation.
He's before a complex task.
With the separate government of Felipe Calderons, Mexico has been able to earn economicly well, but the country is in the face of a drug war that has been costing 60,000 people's lives in the last six years.
"My government is strongly engaged in reducing violence," Pena Nieto explained in the Oval Office at the United States President Barack Obama in the beginning of this week.
I will propose a new security strategy with which we can achieve this goal.
Before he went to the US President, Pena Nieto was a Governor of his home state in Mexico.
In this close, wide part of the country that is the capital city, the opinions on the new head of State are shared.
A direct man
For example, in the small town of Valle del Bravo, you can remember him.
People of the holiday place write to him the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can walk on one of the trains to build the Pena Nieto and represent a great improvement towards the blue, helpful roads that it has ever been given here.
Plakettes with his name are also outside a modern sport centre and a impressive interactive museum to climate change.
"We are waiting for real and continuing changes from him," his friend and political partner Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a Congress Chairman for the Pena Nietos Party, who works PRI.
In particular, in terms of security and economy, we hope that we need an interesting and real change that our country needs so urgently.
After 81 years of power, the PRI was dissolved by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The Congress Deputy Olvera indicates that the party has been a large expectation for the Enrique Pena Nieto for 12 years outside the presidency of Los Pinos.
The proposals of the opposition, the new President, lacking the substance, rejected.
He's a very direct man, very engaged and has great plans for the country.
He is an excellent stateman, but especially he is a person who can hear.
But on the other side of the State, many people do not share this view of their previous governance.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the spotted streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden by autobahn translations and is a city of Mexico itself.
And the problems in the community are of crucial urban nature.
In the beginning of this year, the military was enabled to fight drug groups operating in the fourth century, and violence against women is a particularly accurate problem.
On a fleet of Brachland near a large milk deposite in the last two years, only the body of twelve murdered women left.
During the official period of Gouverneur Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were killed in Mexico, a statistics that itself relate to the city Ciudad Juarez, which is guilty for their violence and murder for innocent women.
The critics of Pena Nietos are the view that he has not at least addressed the problem of women's murder during his office.
But in the worst case, his government closed his eyes before the problem.
In a beton construction, typically for the departured neighbor, Irinea Buendia fights with the tears when she shows me photos of her killed daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana, 2010 self-mortal.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her life threatening.
"If I came home with her, it seemed to be kissed her body," Senora Buendia remembers.
There were signs that she was shocked, and the body star had already been used.
While her mother tells her story, Mariana looks up on us from the wall. It is located next to a cross that brings one word: righteousness.
But exactly this, like the family, has been sweared to her until now.
The authorities have treated me as if I'm a girlfriend, unhappy judge, Nörgler.
They want you to simply accept their sentence and hold the mouth.
"But this is not possible if there were so many forms and defects," she says.
If President Pena Nieto accepts the presidential binding on Saturday, he also takes a great responsibility.
Ten thousands of mexican families have been employed in the past six years of violence crime, and the new President has promised to take care of this problem in his office.
"I hope he's as President as the ruler," says the Prime Congress Deputy Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But precisely, the families of victims in Ciudad Neza are worried mostly.
The State Authority stated: Bradley Manning did not have a deterioration of mistreatment
The State Authority responds to the Provisions of Bradley Mannings, being misleaded in prison.
The consultation is addressed to Manings' time at the Military League in Quantico, Virginia
Defence aims to disappear the appeal because of serious detention conditions
The free of the US Army is proposed to have thousands of confidence documents
On Friday, the State Authority has tried to find that the armed free Bradley Manning is accused of the greatest integration of confidence in the United States history - a number of opportunities to condemn the crimes that he had been suffered in militaryly.
At a cross-secretary hearing at Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein explained that documents for weekly visits had been held by prison officials during Manning's nine months of prison in Quantico, Virginia, no complaints on his treatment.
One day before the Cross Covenant, which was suspended by a request of defence for detention - Maning was already sent sufficiently punished by the hard prison period - he had suggested that Maning would have been sentenced to the Suicide in prison.
The Secret Service Analyst of the United States Army arrested in June 2010 will be proposed to stole thousands of confidential documents in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks never confirmed Manning as a source of information.
In the hearing on Friday, Fein and Manning went through the form that the officials were filled with Maning during his arrest in Quantico Military prison where he had seen in a strengthened prison condition from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Maning questions and writed his answers.
When Fein asked him on Friday to the forms, Manning said that he had estimated the treatment through his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the institution in total as "sever professional".
The forms, so Fein, did not have any complaints on maltraction, although the officials Manning had directly asked for his treatment.
Manning answered that he had expressed his concerns awarely and the officers would have talked to him and told them to treat it, but they did not have been logged.
"He wrote (on the discussion of concerns) "No problems" and this does not necessarily mean that I didn't say anything," says Manning.
The judge, Oberst Denise Lind, also asked Maning why he did not evaluate his treatment when he met with a committee that had to investigate the suicide dances mentioned by him in a form for a few months ago.
Manning answered that his hope during this meeting was to put its observation status on "prevention of violations".
The military said that it was the restrictive status of him, which is a stage under the self-assault, to him and to the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince workers that it was good to me, and obtaining the observation status to prevent injuries (...) to achieve a higher quality of life from my view," said Manning.
Manning said that on Thursday, he was arrested and sentenced to Kuwait, where he was held about two months before he was entered in Virginia in July 2010 in the prison of the Marine Basis Quantico in Virginia.
He said in Kuwait he tried the suicide and became unconscious because of the sweet one time.
Don't let you know what happened to him or in the outside world.
"My world slaughtered on Camp Arafjon, together with this kitchen," said Manning on Thursday.
I thought I would die in this kitchen.
When he was moved to Quantico, the majority of his days passed in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
Only a matrat, a box, Flip Flops, clothes and his bricks have allowed him.
Manning said he tried to stay in move, because on the day it was banned to sleep or just get up.
He's got to sleep with light that enters from outside into his cell.
When he turned around the night and watched his face no longer, he was shocked to turn back.
In January 2011, Mannings' law endorsed formally against treatment of Manings.
In April 2011, Manning was held in the Fort Leavenworth Military fee, Kansas.
On Friday, the Judge Manning also asked an accused that he had taken in his statement on Thursday - so he had to sleep a night naked in his cell in Quantico and have to be shocked in a morning department before watching and other prisoners.
Manning had said he had never had the opportunity to turn around with his box during this decade.
In the interrogation on Friday, Manning acknowledged that he closed from a command of his watch that he had to leave the box with which he could be checked, but he gave nobody to ask him.
On Thursday, Manning said he was forced to sleep in the past night and tried to show a officer that he was not a threat for himself.
Manning said to the officer that he could use the bond of his sub-hose or his Flip Flops to harm himself, but this did not.
In this night, Maning said that his sub-hose, Flip Flops and Brille were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that, at least, the judge takes into account his injury experiences and will be drastly reduced, he should be condemned in his negotiations before the military court. This has been adopted for the beginning of the next year.
The defence has indicated that Manning should be acknowledged by a lower complaint, while other accused points that are considered to be extremely observed.
The continuation of the hearing is used for this weekend, and the State Authority is expected to justify the conditions of sentence.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning has been maintained in accordance with the provisions applicable to all prisoners conserved under the highest security arrangements in Quantico.
The claims against Manning are the benefit of the enemy, the unlawful publication of secret information on the Internet, the transmission of national defence information and the chain of public property or documents.
If he found in all cases of charge, he threatens a long-term prison penalty.
My mexican-american identity crisis.
Many people were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to condemn the migrants - they call them hard times in the memory, he said
Navarrette is the view that mexican Americans have been captured between two worlds
On a recent journey to Mexico, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the pass control when the unreasonableness made in me wide.
Schilders appeared on two expectations: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicaner"), one for "extranjeros" ("Other countries").
I was there for a few seconds, uncertain to whom I should give.
I grew up in Central California and was called "Mexicaner".
An ethnical currency - exactly as my friends are called in Boston "Iren" or my friends in New York "Italians".
Later, I decided for "Mexican American".
But this was Mexico.
And in the home of my grandfathers, there was no need for cults or swifts.
I was just a American.
I speak Spanish at least good enough to tell me in this language to both ends of an interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a mother languagester, and my American actor will not go.
So I took my American travel pass and put me in the skin for Extranjeros.
I thought about that moment this week when the future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet President Obama.
At the agenda, all the subjects that you expect when the heads of these two countries were addressed: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in speaking about the growth of Mexico's economy, and it is a reason for the Mexicans today with also high likelihood in Mexico, instead of migrating to the United States.
He wants to associate with the United States and Canada and create a North America's trade block in the form of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto shouted to continue the war against the drug cards, even though he did not call details about this.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complex and full resentment.
The majority of the Americans probably never have a single idea of the United States in Mexico in 1848 and forced the country’s leadership under a continuing force to leave them more than half of their territory.
But for mexicans, who are in the centuries and not thinking in minutes, memories of this event are not to be overlooked.
So, when a US government official is only a mildest critic at Mexico, it is heard - in the mexican press and under the elites of the country - of complaints about how Americans are limited to the sovereignty of their neighbourhood.
And the children of Montezum are on the war.
But the greatest challenge of Mexico is in reality in relation to the more than 35 million mexican Americans who live in the United States.
You're glad to talk about residues?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason why so many people of the Mexican origin in towns such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at one point one person in our stam tree - maybe a parent or large part - wasn't offered an opportunity in Mexico and emigrated in Northern direction.
And in most cases this person spoke to a profile - dark, unformed, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our faithfulness applies to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now live in the American dream, visit good schools and have received good jobs, we can never lose the eyes that it is the American dream that we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity is sometimes disappeared, but what about our loyalty is not the case.
This is clearly applicable to the United States.
We also know that many members of the Mexican leadership do not like us.
This is based on mutuality.
You see us as a sweet temper and look at us because we are not sufficiently mexicans.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our bands to Mexico will never be strong enough.
Your opinion is that our existence is a symbol of the disaster.
If our families weren't slaughtered in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And then we wouldn't see that we'd be taken behind the seed, with an accepted life in the United States, but we'd lose somewhere.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara, and as a legal child in the United States, remembers that there are disappointments between mexicans and mexican Americans, because the Mexicoans have a clearer idea of whom they are - and the mexican Americans take this wrong.
While she is a US citizen, it is a part of two countries.
But many mexican Americans, I know, have no feeling to belong to one or another to another.
We love the mexican band Los Tigres del Nord, but also Bruce Springsstone.
You enjoy the best of both worlds, but no one is ruined in it.
We will be seen as Americans in Mexico.
And in the United States we will be seen as Mexicoians.
As I should learn during my travel, there is something that makes this relationship still more complex: some mexican leaders and parts of the education citizens want to re-accepte their connections with diaspora.
They want to use mexican Americans as a provisional "botschafters" for Mexico, which represents their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great it is to visit this country and to exercise the political leadership to intensify their commitments to Mexico.
Now.
That won't happen.
A lot of painful feelings.
In view of the unfair income distribution, the unfair corruption and the drug administration, many of us are not so sure whether it is really a great country.
I'm afraid you should be alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States for the treatment with Mexico for the past half of the century ago, they must also accept that some mexican Americans have been treated so long as their family members have been treated.
Hmm.
Maybe we're "Mexican" as I thought.
Old feet, new Naher East
The weapon stand between Israel and Hamas could be an unexpected fundamentals for peace
Can it ever give persistent peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest blue events seem to replace such hopes in the Keim.
In the midst of the ordinary debts, countless buildings were placed in a shock and asche, more than 140 Palestinians, most civilists, and killed six Israelites - and first of all, shocks of Gaza in the nearby of the Israelite Metropole Tel Aviv and the sanctuary city Jerusalem.
However, although Israelites and Palestinians seem to be captured in their historical conflict, the Middle East changes to them.
The Arab spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and if they want it or not - Palestinian and Israelites have become part of these wears.
This may only lead to more blood injuries.
However, there are reasons for accepting that the mortal patch situation could finally find its end.
A war that will not be lost or winned
At the first time, optimism seems to be different from the current situation.
Even if the weapons standing agreed on 21 November, the fighters have strengthened the harvest on both sides.
The leader of the Hamas, the Islamic movement that has controlled the gaza stretch since 2007, is deemed to have reduced the Israelites, although its grouping itself had to cause great losses.
Although several Hamas leaders were killed and 1,7 million people of the gasstrif in one of the most desolated and nearly poorest edges of the planet, Israel has not been able to destroy the Hamas until now.
Indeed, the Hamas in West Jordan, which is controlled by the rivalizing, slightly discharged Palestinian Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could conclude that they have the time on their side.
As Islamics in the Arab world have winned influence, the Hamas has been able to get powerful and rich friends on their side.
Turkey, a resurrected, regional power that first became Israel's an english Islamic association, has taken for the Hamas Party, just as catar, one of the most rich and dynamic Golf States.
Jubilant Hamas leaders believe that Israel is an Islamic halfmond, from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Himbola has the power over Syria, where rebells could be a growing Islamic repression before the destruction of Bashar Assads, until Jordan, where Hamas associates threatened to the king.
In particular, the increase in the muslim burdenship under President Muhammad Musi in Egypt, the most powerful and most important Arab country, at the southern flag of Israel, has continuously changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the luxurious despot, the Egyptians until the end of 2011, had only a few years left for the Hamas.
On the contrary, the brotherhood was disfellowshipped with the Hamas, and its leaders depend on people's faces.
In future diplomatic negotiations, the Hamas could be an actor that could not be reduced by Israel and the United States.
However, the Israeli Hardliners will allow a decisive conclusion.
Military views have no risk anymore.
The Israeli Raketen-related system, "Iron Dome", has been able to shoot, and many of the hamas rakets have been destroyed.
At least one time Israel can sleep more calm.
In diplomatic view, the United States have noted their position, and many European countries have responsible for the latest violence classs.
Israel has been good in the past few years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has ignored the peace process in large parts.
Although rats from Gaza's troops since 2004 have been killed by about 30 Israel, the country has remained relatively free of self-defects - not lastly thanks to the slaughterers in the Western Jordan, and therefore, in the main part of the existing Palestinian State, which protect the Jewish seeds that have been declared for civil rights, but continued to be developed.
Netanyahu is good there. His Likud Party has joined himself in the front of the elections on January 22, under Avigdor Amorrman with a further combating group.
Why are these Palestinians also shut up and leave them a own state?
If they actually have controlled Western Denmark, would they not be able to defeat rakes as their partners in the gasstrip?
No, it's better to keep them behind the wall and punish them, they should have the head.
It may be possible to use the hardlines, but the Arab spring could make them a strike through the account.
Even if the Islamics, who are now sit at the power of Egypt and other countries, have little left for Israel, they will first focus on the difficulties in their own country.
The Defence Seat of Israel is greater than his four Arab neighbors.
A war with the local supermaster will not only help the new Arab governments in the establishment of their economy.
That the Pragmatic President Mursi joined Barack Obama to reach a weapon stand, it could be a promised sign - and may symbolize the start of a new era.
Israelites should also think longer.
While the rest of the Arab world takes spectacular steps in direction to democracy, the Palestinians will continue to have their self-determination rights - a powderfass that will, uncertainly, explose a day in the Israeli regions, just as this week a bus is explosed in Tel Aviv.
The underpression is now understood by the democracy in the Jewish state, and the growth of the Arab population will only increase the situation.
Blood missions for the restraint of the Hamas in the Gaza tribes are increasingly requested for their diplomatic tribs over the years.
Both sides need an inclination from outside
The right answer is that of the most discreet representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world, and of this newspaper: two countries in which Israel depends on areas of security.
The hope - for the near future - is that weapons are more influenced by foreigners to implement this solution.
Egypt must now stop the weapons delivery in the Gaza troops together with Turkey and Katar and is better positioned than before to convince the Hamas of the idea of a Jewish State on the basis of the borders of 1967, complemented by the region and a common Jerusalem.
Foreign Arab nations should also move the Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian State than with the request for the United Nations observer status.
Obama must also contribute to the movement of Israel to negotiations.
During his first office, he summoned the idea of his own peace plan.
It seems to be removed in the white house as if he was also cut into participation.
But this is a deplorable, short-scale perspective.
The United States have an important interest in a stable Middle East.
And there is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws for uniform smoke packages shall enter into force
Health warnings and malicious body parts on neutral green packages that are equal to all tobaccomarks
The world's first laws for uniform smoking and tabac packages have been entered into force in Australia. In order to replace marks and colors by neutral, olive green deck, which are also printed with drastic images, which are sick parts of cigarettes and ill-smoking skins and children.
From the various health warnings and images one day, the only difference between the packs in the brand names which are printed in the same, small letter.
This will lead Australia to the world's most strict schemes for smoke packaging.
The Australian federal government wants to take young people from smoking by eliminating the glasing image of the tabak consumption.
In this way, the government shows that people who have not yet started to smoke with 26, there will no longer be 99% likelihood.
"You can see in children of youth that they understand the message to try to purchase the tobacco concentrations with their brand image," says Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Plibersek, who quotes studies that showed, for example, that children associate the crown of a logos with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia shows one of the smallest smoking rates in the world and changes will only be lowly affected by the profits of the multinational concerts, other countries already have similar steps.
The Tabaklobby fighted hard against the laws.
Thus, with the laws, it would benefit from the black market trade, which leads to enhanced and easier access to cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious and uncertain consequences", says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian fabrics will offer a widely larger number of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, however, say that the laws have endorsed their business.
Sandra Ha from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, notes that the demand for cigarettes and silicondecks have been enhanced since the British American Tobacco Concerns, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco two months ago on the Supreme Court of Justice, with their appeal to the laws.
Zico has sold up to 6.000 units in large trade business and waited for new resources.
It's a good business for us.
As a result of experts, the hake is in the popularity of social media in exactly the population group in which the plan is addressed.
A number of Australian laws have banned smoke centers from the TV, it is forced to take them as sports telephones and the majority of handlers have to make smokes in business. Now the shopping has been changed into the Internet.
The Australian government has prohibited Internet access through local enterprises and pages, but does not have any influence on international sides.
"What Tabak markets and has only a small area to make its products, the Internet does not go through", says Becky Freeman, researchers at the Sydney University.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has found an increase in experience reports on marks that have been produced by "normal people".
You should ask the question: Is this just a private person who finds so big cigarettes that it even takes a video - or has a marketing agency to do so?
The British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry is focusing on marketing to put together with the new laws.
It has even been so far paying Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to fight the new rules - those countries are opposed to the World Trade Organization on unjust trade restrictions, although there is no greater trade in countries with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected for mid-2013.
In accordance with the Pliber Ses, the Government has conducted discussions with other countries that consider similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country that proposed photo warnings.
In the midst, these were extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More laws are settled in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are fierce.
The pictures do not affect me.
I'm simply ignoring them.
"Man simply takes a kip and shoots the shooter," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette chair, on which a photo is printed with a mouth tutor.
Really, there's only one reason why I'm going to stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the "King of the Pack" in the city of Sydney, says that the unique packaging has slowed its regular compliance.
"I used a hour to order a delivery, now I need four," says Yu.
"The government had to simply forbid smokes completely - then we had said to us well, that's what we'd do", he adds.
In a permanent electricized world it is beautiful to be slowly
This thanksgiving I passed unexpectedly five hours in the airport when our aircraft was cut off because of mechanical problems and we had to wait on another flight.
So I had enough time to make me a few thoughts about a long-term.
I don't want to lie.
A half day on the airport is waiting on a flight, it's quite nervous - even if books, magazine and iPhones are available (and of course free tax shopping).
But even more academics and child development experts lead to longewile than something positive.
If it happens after them, it's for us - and our children - all right, it's timely to be slow.
In this way the brain will be able to lose in interesting courses, which is possible to promote creativity.
And as most of us today are almost constantly staring on one or other screens, the benefits of the longwill are not more profitable.
So should we welcome the long-term army?
Yeah.
And no.
I'll be back again.
As many people, I have always found that longewile is a relatively current phenomenon that has developed with growing free time.
But Peter Toohey, Professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not see this.
"In fact, the long-term has a very long story," he says.
The house wall of Pompejis makes a Latin graphic over the longewile, which returns to the first century.
And then there's the question how we actually define longewill.
John D. Eastwood, a associated professor of Psychology at the university in Ontario, Canada, is the problem that Langeweile has been defined and discussed on live species.
After long lessons of research literature and the presentation of the idea before a group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that long-term than the experience, "a satisfied activity, but this is not possible".
It is therefore different from Apathie that the person is not occupied but wants to be.
However, with the Apathie, it doesn't make any effort to do anything.
The key survey of the longewile, he says, in a "reducing the attention process, paid with bad laune and feeling that the time is just slowly forgotten".
Long-term can almost listen to it as much as depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that, although these two conditions could be associated, slow people see the problem in their environment or world, while depressive people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we believe that we are slow, even though we have only difficulties to concentrate on us.
In its study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - to German about: "The inactive understanding: The definition of Langeweile under the aspect of the attention", which appeared in the Section in September in "Perspectives on Psychological Science", suggests Professor Eastwood and his colleagues on a previous experience to hear a band with the participants.
Some groups heard a sound television program from the nearby space that had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it on low volume, so that it was little real, while the third group had never met these devices.
The persons who were not listening to the unexpected television had to spend more long than the other two groups - they had problems to concentrate, couldn't find reasons for this and write their difficulties in the long-term.
If you are trying to concentrate on a difficult or encouraging task, you can cause attention to longewile, says Mark J. Fenske, a associated professor for Neurow Societys at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
However, if you are performing an innocent activity - "as searching for fatal products on a factory transport group, music can be enabled and helped to feel unexpected."
Indeed, he says, now we know that urgency calls and critics, often interpreted as signs for long-weight, can even fight them by remaining physically more attentioned.
"Studes have shown that children who can swim, learn more and keep more information than those who are able to be sweet seeds," says Professor Fenske.
All of us will be a long-term - my late flight, a huge voice speaker, a particular enthusiasming movie.
But some people are easier than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers developed in the 1980s a "scale for long-term accidentality".
On the scale, words like "That things I need to do, repeat themselves and are monotones" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything."
Using such scales, researchers have found that young people are openly skilled than girls, so Stephen Vodanovich, Professor for Psychology at the Westflorda University, especially in terms of the need for more and more external travels.
But in general, adolescents have a very shocked shock.
In 1991, Reed Larson, Professor for Human and Common Development at the University of Illinois, conducted a experience in which he contacted nearly 400 adolescents and their parents by seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32 per cent of adults in school and household officers had been delayed, where 23 per cent of which were not in school.
But only 3% of the parents were able to feel slowly.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he didn't know whether the percentages have increased or cut off in respect of long-term.
However, he is sure that “the youth will be particularly slow,” mainly because children and adolescents do not have a great impact on their daily end.
So back to my original question: Is Langeweile healthy?
Sometimes not, because, in extreme case, it causes people to take extreme physical risks and to lose the luck game or drugs to lift them - that has shown studies.
Otherwise, many philosophs and authors investigate the relationship between Langeweile and Creativeness. This view is Professor Vodanovich, who has been investigating the topic for more than two decades.
"In the longewile, the brain wants to say that you should do something else," says Gary Marcus, Professor for Psychology at the university of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what you should do.
If a long-term and use this energy to play and cook guitar, you'll be happy.
However, even though television can take care of happiness, it is long-term.
Hence, whoever is able to have a iPad, he can take it from the long-term, but he has not learned to maintain himself or control himself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "Selbst control is transferred from a situation to the other."
The child learns not only to hold up, but is also more self-controlled in other areas.
I don't think we should be selected long-term.
We should not also see them critical.
Instead, our goal should be to enjoy our continuous activities and technology reviews.
Professor Eastwood's right to it.
"It sounds like you should be swimming to us, but longewile is the slight, inevitable desire to do something sensible," he says.
He believes that people in truth are just looking for a way to stop and relax.
"In an environment where we are continuously overstimized, it is difficult to work when the laugh is once shocked."
There is no clear guideline for the new Marihuana law in Colorado
The 19-year-old Community College Student and football player Anthony Orozco is located in the south of Colorados for a court that will already be legal in this State: the possession of some less marihuana broken and a phenomenon with which he smoke.
According to Orozco, he and some friends traveled in a September with the car in Lamar near the borders to Kansas as they were held.
After the police officer Marihuana found in the car, Orozco was loaded for the ownership of drugs and drugs - covalent crimes that are injured everywhere with a punishment of 100 US dollars - and received a court term.
"We're gonna be treated like crime," says Orozco.
But he's also one?
In the uncertain weeks following the State's decision to legalize small quantities of marihuana for own use, the response to hundreds of smaller drug crimes is less than law than the location.
Hundreds of orthodoxes that turn to Marihuana are already left here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
Police authorities do not follow adults for a smaller ownership over 21 years and this is legally allowed when the new laws enter into force in the next weeks.
But state lawyers in the conservative areas Colorados have announced to follow existing marihuanadelics and continue to dig people in court.
At the same time, several cities agree to prevent new, stately licensed marihuana business in opening in their communities from the capital Denvers to the West Mountains.
"This situation continues so fast that I don't know what will happen as next," said Daniel J. Oates, head of police in Aurora, which is Eastern from Denver.
And regulatory authorities in the state of Washington are ratifying the head.
They waited for an orientation aid to establish a license system for production, manufacturing, sale and sales of drugs, and have so far before 1 December 2013.
In Washington there is a view that Colorado is predicted in any case by most states about the regulation of Marihuana, where the drug was only legalized for medical purposes and then for its own consumption.
"The Colorado has a more regulated market, so the State is good to orientate", says Brian E. Smith, speaker of the Supervisory Authority for Spirituals in Washington State.
But Smith also provides that no place or system can do more than serving in the sense of a large leadership.
"We don't have a real presence case we can follow," he adds.
The Washington Act, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December, also forms the end point of a green zone where the State License System is not yet existing, but the ownership is legalized.
And incredible practical questions must be cleared at this time - for example, how the state provision of a "acceptable access" Marihuana is intended to agree with the prohibition of cannabis businesses around 300 meters of schools, parks, playing places and children's care institutions.
"Whenever there will be more difficulty to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Baling area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, speaker for the "Center for Legal Cannabis", a recently established research group.
On November 21, Head Oates sent his employees in Aurora a email in which he explained that the State lawyer would not follow smaller marihuana crimes in persons over 21 years, and that the police will "a immediately" not seek punishment for this crime.
Head of Oates added that the police continued to implement urban requirements to regulate the farmers of medical marihuana and would continue to follow drugs.
In Ward County in North Colorados, a more strict view is held by Ken Buck.
After the vote, he agreed that his authority would continue to follow cases of Marihuana's owning, mainly to move consumers to displace.
Today, 119 persons should be responsible for the possession of about 50 grams or less Marihuana before court, although many are also accused of other crimes.
"Our authority has the obligation to follow infringements in which it was to be punished at the time of a criminality," Buck replied in a statement.
The reactions are even in places such as the rural Mesa County, where the elections refused the Marihuana Initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the country crowd, has no longer shown adults for the possession of smaller amounts.
Avocat Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, however, also decided to not allow all the existing ownership procedures.
"I don't believe I lost my time to apply the right until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of the electors in Colorado supported the measures, it was already clear that it would not be easy to agree with the personal consumption of Marihuana with the complexities of government and the legal system.
And the opposite reactions in the whole State fostered a deep subsistence towards the large green experiment at day among local officials.
A "cultural barrier" is a civilian lawyer from Denver, a lawyer from Denver, who is a lawyer for Marihuanadelics in the court and acted as a speaker for the national organization for the reform of marihuana.
"They have conveyed a great part of their lives to pursue the laws of persons that they cannot still accept legitimation," he believes.
As the first States, treating smaller quantities of marihuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are treated as national models for the legalization of drugs.
While preachers and State officials were prepared for a period of legal sales, they were nervously waiting for the federal government's instructions that would continue to deal with the sale and construction of Marihuana at federal levels.
He hoped that the Ministry of Justice will be deemed to be given by the law enforcement movement.
Despite several careful arrests of consumers and sales of medical marihuana, the Federal Government has granted the sale of medical marihuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other States.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy officer of the Obama government, is the view that criminal officials probably will not be entered into doors to take smaller numbers of drugs, but may be resolved under the new legislation, legally regulated Marihuana.
several cities in Colorado did not even expect the federal authorities to act.
Before the election, some local community administrations accepted Moratonia for new Marihuana business, although they could only open for a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the west, decided a six-month ban, which probably was adopted next week.
"We don't want to go into a position where we license someone and then stand on a large problem before the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city Council.
Our community has voted against this legislative amendment.
We are talking about what the community has decided and not about what the State has decided.
There are still many questions open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was sent from Oxford because I am Tory
Not only university students today will be attacked for their views
It was my biggest dream to get a place at the Oxford University.
My father and my old brother had visited the university that I first had for the world’s largest knowledge star, for a modern Greek symposium that promoted the largest pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks after my arrival in the Precester College, the end of the twenty-first years, I had planned to study the story - I had packed my coffee again and thus brought the first scandale of my life.
My dad put together in snakes.
My friends were confused.
In Evening Standard, I would have gone because I had had a problem with compliments in the closed room.
The author A N Wilson declared slightly that I would have left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged taxes.
But the truth was less fun.
I'm gone.
Yeah, come away, because I was in a systemic mobing and threatening.
Not just because of my right name, or because I had come from a private school.
It was only a reason for me to be found - a reason that seemed to be such anxious and grauseful: My medieval death father Woodrow Wyatt was an important advisor Margaret Thatchers and I prefer the Conservative Party.
Why do I win this right now?
Now, the current reports result in a new generation of students of slowly entitled rights under similar persecution.
The organized and growing hass on Tory students in Oxford has developed a number of such dimensions that, last week, a group of them requested the same protection of equality, deficiencies, and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus Christi College will be admitted to them, because of their political views, "oft active isolated, personal attacks and for an unwanted declaration".
They call for a place in the Equipment Committee of their colleagues to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Incredible her situation was represented by a recently extracted documentation on political students on BBC 2, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and the Right," the Tories was an extraordinary and Neonazis.
It was shown by the former president of the conservative student association of the University of Oxford, who went to a Rolls-Royce, and proclaimed with silver and silver snake.
Other universities say conservative students, they are considered as "siny tables for the introduction of higher study costs".
The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice-President of the Conservative Students Association of Nottingham University, took place in a Sunday period: " There is a growing leftness at universities.
People believe we're like the Bullingdon Club, without even have learned us."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and 21-year-old student in Corpus Christi, who launched the search for greater protection, is the view that such a climate is "ungenehm". The 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, designed President of the conservative student association of Oxford, has observed a growing refusal to students in the JCR.
"This represents a danger for the intellectual discours and for the well-being of members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly protected 18-year-old man, I was arrived in September 1986.
The hair at the conservative party had reached its height point.
In the past year, Margaret Thatcher - a former student - had no honor titles in high schools.
The atmosphere had even been shocking stalinists.
In the first days of the first seventh session, at the new students and the tutories, I received a preview of the future events.
I experienced that the tutories were not just dumbing towards the disappointment of Tory students but even joy.
Political topics such as mountain workers, privacy and refusal of the government of sanctions against the Apartheid-South African regime found their way into the hot rooms of the Tutorium.
In my first events, I should translate French texts from the 18th century to the English, and I had not been taken to what should happen.
"Miss Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (middlely killed), "true the first paragraph."
I got it.
Pitt was a little man with a face like a sweet, and very sweet.
"Remember those avengers to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students shocked.
In my eyes, the clouds smile up.
"I propose that they take a few French hours in your free time - so if you're not too busy with your social activities," he urged Pitt.
I returned to my room with a heavy head.
Tonight, I sat alone at the college at dinner when someone made me easy to tip on the shooter.
It was a English student in the second year named James, who was a member of the conservative students association.
"I know who you are," he said friendly.
Unfortunately, it's how it is.
Everyone who's suspected to be Tory will be cut off.
It's too bad for me, but they know that your father Margaret Thatcher is near, so it's gonna be worse for you.
The majority of the Tory Prime Ministers offers to be composers of the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I tried to disappear me later.
I found that I was not in all points with Mrs. Thatcher.
This trick should be shown as a result.
A student in the field of philosophy, policy and economy, which was ironely visited by the Eton College of Conservatives, said to me, "You are the daughter of a fascist."
You're angry.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and crazy.
"Who have Tories sex?" asked me one.
They're shooting together, right?
I felt like homosexuality had to feel before the United States' liberal legislation.
Should I like to lead to normal life at Oxford university?
Should I just be able to meet after the darkness?
Should I apply the Labour Party and stress my natural efforts?
In the three years before me, I was deceived before my spiritual eye to a fire of respect and isolation.
The only tutor who was open to recognize himself as Tory was Norman Stone, Professor for temporary history, who had his seat in my college.
He was not only hate to be a conservator, but also because he consulted those in external policies and had written for them talks.
He was just rare.
He hated the place, found him provincial and small carded and rejected him for his marxistic-determinist perspective.
He adopted a professor at the Bilkent University in Ankara in Turkey, 1997.
"You will not be happy here," he said to me.
I began to sneak between Oxford and the house of my parents and found refugee for closed friends and family members in the city.
My father told me I hated Oxford and why I did it.
He seems unbelievable.
During his time in the 40th century, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said small.
So they would never do anything, not in my city of the dreaming towers.
Even my communist friends continued to have an immigrant manner on the day.
His fired eyes were checked.
Give me the whole chance.
I'm sure you're shocking.
It's gonna break my heart if you were going.
Increased by my often traveling to London, my emotional resistance was weak.
One of my husband's friends, also the Tory-Ambassadors, had shown the pressure and made his convictions.
During a tutorium in the next week, in which a further shooter was seriously observed, I am "a enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Although I was in secret before the shame, I agreed that my parents had undergoing my "the brain wheat" and called her "ancient idiot".
The facilitation was only a short time.
It was my father who took the last nagel in the stores of my Oxford carrière.
At that time he wrote two columns per week in the Murdoch Presse.
My door was closed.
I hid me in my room, and five minutes later my household was opened.
When they went, I packed a coffee and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You can call me a weird sleep sleeves.
But no 18-year-olds should ever suffer from such injury and integrity in a educational institution.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university that not only raised 14 Tory Prime Ministers, but is hidden up to this day after an unproduced call of equality and thinking freedom.
"Valentino's Eleganz of the Famous"
On the exhibition "Valentino - Master des Couture", which was opened this week in London, speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian moderators.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I from England, is the only place in the British capital, which is the hosting of a exhibition over Valentino Garavani.
This has recognized the designer in the opening of "Valentino - Master of the Couture" a great retrospective for which more than 130 cloths of the skin couture were built by his "maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palast," he says with his unchanged Italian acent.
This exhibition is the end of a history which is the only protagonist "il sir" Garavani, which could not be written without his distinguished client.
Valentino has always been fascinating for the stable and far-sized world of the edel.
In the first room of this exhibition, which will be seen until 3 March, there is a variety of private letters and photos with the signing of the most excited aristocracy, starting from Princess Salimah Aga Khan, over the Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memorys as Trophäen of his social involvement from the decent modemactors in the city of Voghera in Northern Italy to the idol of the international jetsets.
Be loved in the skin, you don't have to be departure.
"Only, they don't get their skins on your magnificent tasting, as it makes some beautiful fashion shoes from the popsic," says Baronin Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 70s the two lived in the Alpen and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, magnificent and elegant guest.
"We all enjoyed when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," the Exfrau of "Heini" thyssen explained closely with forgotten beautifuls such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always presented the election of famousity.
But he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a clothing of Valentino
The argentian model Valeria Mazza does not forget the Charisma of the Modemachine.
Many years ago, we went to the house of Piazza di Spain to Rome after a modern view.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Each detail of his apartment, decoration, food and music was recognized and felt its influence.
"All inviters felt important and loved," remembers the "Top model", which began their trains at the week of the skin Couture 1995 in Paris.
"He never comes out of the mode because his designs are artistic works", she finally says..
Modenview of origin
The life of Garavani is not a history of gratitude, more than of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House was converted to a glorious and 60 meters long-term swimming stage that offers a role: the user takes the place of the model and turns out to admire a dreamly "Audience" that leads to the master works of Valentino, such as the clothes that Jackie Kennedy chose for their marriage with Aristoteles Onassis, the costumes that the Monica Vitti took in "La Notte" or a mantel from the Kaiser Farae Dibae.
In this post of model pup, the names such as Sibilla de Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Modemacher, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I can remember perfectly.
It was a hose, a hemd, a Westen type "Gillette" and a Jacke from the Herbst/Winter Collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the museums of the designer.
"I'm seeing him all others because of his great love for women and because he highlights our beauty," adds the former Herzog of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and understood the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and leaders of the Patricia Mode de Giovpaola d'Arenberg can also forget the first time when they stood a Valentino.
When I lived as a teenager in Italy, I was dreaming about having the age and the opportunity to take one of his evening clothes...
The end of the 1990s finally came.
I bought my first Valentino clothes for a festival in the close of my vetters, Prince Edouard de Line.
It was a red clothing with fly rock and a draped superparty with a decollency that makes his name honor.
"It was a real dream", says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino does not depend on the mode, his property is untimely", explains this Italian aristocratin who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princesssin D'Arenberg keeps their evening clothes of the modemacher "with absolute sorgfalt," "for a cloth is not only a cloth, but also the related memorys."
The "great" of the Mode
The great end of exhibition in Saturset House is the wedding clothing of Marie-Chantal Miller for her marriage with Paul de Grecia in 1995.
Four months work and 25 "Ragazze" (such as the modemacher called his neighbors) were necessary to provide this eighth colored seed clothes with Perlen, eight different strikes and a four-four meters long Switzerland.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the Supreme Authority of Specification, this clothes was a milestone in the skin coture end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the top society".
For years with the "shout" of the Elite, Valentino is now her best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest reputation Italys), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Art and Letter, excited with the honouring lection, culminates Garavani as many honors as each of his customers.
"I'm always his refination, his calm, his buried and perfect eye," says D'Arenberg.
I saw him last month ago at a gala end at the Museum de Orsay.
He was on the table of the beauty Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of me.
"He was fascinated; the time does not leave any shoes to him."
And that's a princess...
The most difficult work of the world: the human workshops of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the indonesian vulkans play their lives and their health on a game when they take 70 kg sleeves over the steel, stone paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others work in hell.
This is the case in Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 mine workers who gained their lives by taking swivels from the Vulkan Kawah Ien east of the Indonesian island Java.
To this end, every day he must grow down on the ground of his crater, where the swimming gas is enhanced from the earth in contact with the air.
After he broke large stones that can swim up to 70 kilos, he carried them into two bambus shoes on his shoes through the stones.
Although there are only 250 meters to the pit of the vulcan, which is up to a height of 2386 meters, but the shooted brakes need more than 40 minutes for the rising in the crown time, while they keep the balance and need to take care of their steps so that they don't shoot and shoot them.
You know that each step can cost his life, as this happened to a French tourist, who cut down the parts of the Kawah-yeen in the past years ago.
The mining workers of Kawah Ijen win 5 euros for each kilo swimming pool that they are rebuilding.
Besides, they spend the way between the tourists that they photo as circles and walk with the swimming swimming swimming swimming swimming up three kilometers to waage, which made a mining society a little further down on a height of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been using the events in the vulcan and (not better said) its workers who pay 662 Indonesian rupies (5 Euro cent) for every kilo Sweefel.
It then sells it to the petrochemical industry for 10,000 rupies (83 euroscents) because this mineral is widely distributed every day and is used for the manufacture of steel olive oil, firearms, cosmetics, dynamits and even for the swimming of sugar.
"When we normally take 70 kg, we receive some 46.000 rupien (3.8 euros) for every way," explains Anto, which makes three trails in normal cases on the day.
For every route, he needs three hours, which he has completely done, but at the end of the day he has joined 138.000 rupien (11.5 euros).
What seems to be a miserable loan for such an inhuman effort, but the three-face of what he would benefit with the field work.
"The daily salary of mining workers here, where the coffee is payed (1,2 euros) on the day and the average monthly income of two million rupies (167 euro) is very high," explains the band who worked before on the tourist island Bali.
There he won 75,000 rupies (6,2 euros) on the day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto is with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near, and that is because of a reason that is so important as the shoe in Indonesia: "I married a girl from Bali where they are Hinduists, and I brought them to Java to convert them to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, often shocked and his eyes are shocked because of the harmful gas.
The 27-year-old Anto has been a game of life in the cowh Yeen for three years, whose shoe has left the first shoes with him, although he covers his face with a mask and special bridge.
Anto has asthma, breathed with difficulty, often shocked and his eyes are shocked because of the harmful gas from the vulcan.
This is the price he must pay for the achievement of his dream.
"I'm going to work here for two years, because I want to make a load or learn Spanish or French", he promises in a more than just acceptable English.
This sympathical and intelligent, but young man who has been punished for life could work as a tourist leader, Kelner or at receiving a hotel, but instead he does the work of a trageel.
He shares a sharp wood shoes with other shoes each morning and is awaited at two hours each morning, because the sweet also springs the night, where his characteristic yellow color in the darkness slightly.
The shadows sweetly, he slows in the light of a small shooting lamp on his hero that he purchased himself from his own money in the crap.
About 400 crowds were loaded the corners with sleeves on their shoeter on the ground.
In spite of their great wins, the mining society has not mechanized the swimming construction in order to spend the costs, and provides the machines working on its own account and payment by weight no equipment.
You also have no part of the 30,000 rupien (2.5 euro) assault by photo device, which the guards of this natural park together with the income payment of 15,000 rupien (1.2 euro) from the tourists that come to photograph the volcan and human tragesels.
"This work is for the animals and not for the humans," protests Madrusin, a shift of 42 years of age, who works for three decades since leaving the school at the Kawah Ijen.
He is able to take up up to 110 kg and ensure that he continues "for the time it goes", because he needs the money for the education of his three children between 10 and 18 years.
I'm not going to the pension, I'm going to die here because the vulkan was my whole life.
Even if the shoes swing the shoes and eyes the eyes when the wind slowly turns and the mines workers into the shoes that rise from the crap, the men are so hard that no one complains about serious diseases ... of course, except the usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, pain in the skins and skins on the shoes that have converted from the weight of the crowd.
With the corb on his back, uninics with 53 years of age can only be able to take 50 kg.
Each day, he and his friends cut 15 tons of swimming pool from the vulcan, which is transported by three LKWs through a swimming pool between the shooting to the camp in Tamansari in 18 kilometers away.
"I'm not going to be in pension, I'm going to die here because the vulcan was my whole life," Uninic explains, when he opens his mouth far away, in which some teeth lacked.
From his five children the elder works with his 30-year-old age as Sweefel.
The time is forgotten, but poverty takes generation into a generation in one of the worst professionals of the world: those who work as human losses in the Kawah Ien.
Singapore needs babys to save the economy
Singaporees are responsible for having no children, on the career, stress and the costs of real estate and children's education.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I'm a patriotic husband, you're my patriotic wife: We fill our citizenship and we make life!
It seems unbelievable that the versions are part of the advertising for Minzbons, but, however, - or just so - they became the beginning of this year in Singapore to a viral video on YouTube.
The rates are part of a rapper song, which the local speech, such as "sleeves" will be a "bao" (Laib) in the pars, to make themselves quiet over the low grain rate in Singapore.
The BBH advertising that has turned the video is the hope that the advertising slightly reaches a pleasant way to take attention to the problem.
His creative leader Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the power of music to bring people to comply with its "national obligations".
This is just something for the Internet, so we had to make it sweet and sweet.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst parts of the world, so we realized that this is a subject to what we had to care for.
We knew that the government had often tried, such as the marketing of parfum with pheromones or the organization of Speed Dings (speak fleet).
Maybe many of these ideas were creative, but they did not lead to success.
So we thought, why do we not do anything as creative as possible to face this problem, for example, a rap?
1.2 Kids
The Government of Singapore is who is not easy to take this topic.
Each year, it provides 1.300 US dollars for political measures to engage citizens to get more children.
A government package for marriages and parents is granted up to $15,000 per child, extends the maternal vacation and distributes tax benefits.
But everything had little success.
Singapore is a rich, high-technological city state in South Asia, also known for the conservation of its governments and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the plant rate is currently at 1,2 children per woman.
The last time that this rate exceeded 2 - what is known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't Singapore get more kids?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National People's Authority, says that this should be returned to a "better training" and "more career changes".
"This has enabled people to marry and have more options for life goals and set priorities, except a family.
These changes in social responsibilities have contributed to a higher number of individuals and to the members of the Council and Heritage whose result is in the reduction of the burden rate in Singapore.
A migration policy that aimed at a drastic increase in migration in order to achieve the reduction of the population, residues in local populations.
In Singapore there are websites where the poor Xenofobia is against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese people who are criticized to keep their loss low and not integrate.
The increase in immigration will also be considered to be one of the reasons that the Government party in Singapur has achieved its worst electoral results since the independence.
Since the elections have been tried to correct the problem with higher contributions and expenditure for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the burden rates are known to the economic growth of a nation, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policy, the example also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to reach the construction of so many small apartments.
It also has an impact on the housing market.
The Cities Development Authority has thus started to control the number of small apartments known as "shoots" and to be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a large sales suite.
However, it is concerned that they can promote the lifestyle of the single ones, and that the construction companies are decreasing to build large housing for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, director-General of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his "shootings" would make a lot more faster than greater living units.
They are so popular, and the units are faster sold than the larger living units per day and even weeks.
This makes them better for our Cash Flow.
However, it provides that the new standards give the developers more clearly guided by obstacles before they wanted to build too many small habitat units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could provide the way to increase the national burden rates, the discussion with the Singapore workers in the financial area is to take that they will not have a great impact.
"The people are strongly stressed, the accommodations and the education are also more money, because it is slaughtered by many," says a young manager.
The children can get others.
"For me, it's important to have my own money and time," one else, about 20 years old.
Man and women leads their careers, stress and costs for property and education as a reason why they cannot have children.
The Singaporees have the last word when it is about to get children - there is still much to the government.
The offline Private offline is online private
Privacy
According to the Wordbook, it is the property private or "in its area of the private life where the right to protection is available before any type of infusion".
What's private for someone under 16 years of age?
How is this definition applied on its daily and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he expressed when he knows the situations that he would not share in real life?
The periodic interviewed five adolescents between 10 and 15 years of age, often undergoing the network.
In four of these cases, they linked the term "what is very personally" at the personal level and "to the password and the user", when they applied it to the social networks.
"My deep secrets would not be known in a post," says the ten years old jorge when trying to explain the importance of "private" on websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has two years on accounts.
"These are very confidence secrets, my mother may know them, but not all the world," he confirms.
On FB I load beautiful pictures or images of games up.
I also have my time with people.
"I wouldn't share photos that aren't from me, or by someone who makes the dog head," he says.
The boy is clear that it is wrong to publish obsessed photos, nacks, crimes, or political or violent comments.
Jorge assurances to know 35 friends that he has in FB and nine followers in Twitter.
Most are associates.
And the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I reported to Twitter to express me and write interesting Twitter.
"I don't know whether someone answers me, I call them only high." he adds.
"Social networks are sustainable, I can quickly speak with friends in the television or with friends."
When he answered that he would never take an invitation of an unknown person.
Even if someone recommends a stranger, he would ignore this.
The case of the 14-year-old José is different.
The youth has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he does not know 20 of the people he added his friends list.
"This doesn't horrify me because we have something common, for example music," he says.
After the kid's indication, no one did him or asked him after his address or phone number.
"If someone threatens me or she asks from me, I just remove him from my user account."
José reported to Ask after reading a recommendation in Twitter.
The boys are unknown experiences that are known today as Cyberbullying.
The known friend of a friend was pressed in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He has never learned who it was," he assured.
According to José, the victim did not close the user account.
"He just made it private."
Then he explains a number of steps to set a user account safely.
Rather than Jorge, these photos of famous people would be highlighted in unprecedented or painful situations.
Yeah, I would do this if he's our sympathy or I want to take him out.
"Af I know that this is Cyberbullying," he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, teacher of English with high school schools in education and learning, means that to orientate children and adolescents, it must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks.
"The Internet was a media for the search for information; with the appearance of these pages the game rules have changed", she says.
Porras explains that the Academiker Marc Prensky, owner of a master piece in Pédagogic at the Yale university and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants", formed these terms for the declaration of the phenomenon.
The digital natives are they, the children and adolescents who have grown with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants they should teach where we still learn."
He explains that it is a complex theme, "for we want them to have a definitive criteria on what distributed, published or said, and this is in a age where the skin is not sufficient for it."
"He should also be chosen if it is the most important of them to be popular to have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the experts, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents what is privacy to ask them questions that she brings to think.
"They say they don't have to do it, don't work," he says.
Then Porras calls some possibilities: There are things that you wouldn't tell a stranger. Why do you then do it on the Internet?
Or: Does it take you when you publish a photo of you, how this you published by a friend?
Do you know what the others publish about you?
Did you ask the other persons for permission when you labeled photos of holidays?
And another question: Do you all know what you're doing at any moment?
Another point is to give them understanding that they must act online, how they do it offline.
It's the same rules.
"Anyone outside the Internet acts with respect, personality and other principles, and the same need to apply to social networks," he states.
Monitoring
Stuardo Guardia, university professor, primary teacher and scientist adviser, comments that it is unbelievable that parents read the social network directives carefully.
When they understand all sections, they have solid bases to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what you can share or public", he explains.
According to Guardia, the children must be reminded of the lesson "You should not talk to foreigners."
End of the Summit of Unsur without publication of the Declaration of Lima
The 6. Meeting of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publication of the declaration of Lima, which was previously announced and should be signed theoretically by the seven present governments.
Efe reiterated to reach access to the signed document at the VIth Orderal Meeting of the State and Government heads of the Unsur. Sources in the State and President's Office initially shared that they would deliver it after the clausure, however, they explained that it would be published on the Peruvian Government's website.
For questions on the text, they pointed out that the content of the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, was presented in short statements to the press.
The access of journalists to information on the Summit was limited at all times.
During the day in the press room, only the image of the President's headquarters was transferred without sound with the message "private session, limited audio".
The few information circled under the journalists were obtained by some of the Governments of Unsur at meeting, but not by the Peruvian press speaker.
The only document that was distributed during the day was the list of participating Presidents, which prompted more information by the hundreds of journalists of different national and international media.
Then, the President of Peru’s media sent an e-mail to the Meeting's final statement, but it was about the declaration of Humala and not on the official document to the end of the Meeting.
In the past October, Peru host of the gipfel South America - Arab States (ASPA) was also published in this case, even though the press was the so-called declaration of Lima, which was previously announced, too little.
On the official website of the ASPA, it may be convinced that the document was published at the last service day.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that information systems for journalists would be available, but they were limited to access to information at a high level.
The Summit also ended with the common commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Court of Justice of Den Haag, which constitutes a border conflict between two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, were meeting during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would take the decision of the IGH that began to take place on Monday in Den Hague, in the process that the Lima against Santiago had to listen to both sides.
"We will follow and execute the judgment of the differences we presently present this International Court of Justice," said Humala together with his Chilean opposition.
"Chile was, and is still a country that holds the international laws to seek peaceful solutions for strictness, concludes and undertakes the international courts," adds Piñera and greeded Humala with a hand pressure before the two countries.
The confirmion of both Presidents that they would be subjected to the IGH, following a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which had seen a serious error, had a complaint against the Bogotá Agreement, where it agreed to submit the judgments of this International Court of Justice.
At the meeting, the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, who has been excluded from the Unsur since 2011 after his President Fernando Lugo has not taken part in the meeting.
The guest President Ollanta Humala opened the meeting on Sunday and ended the meeting short after the midday in Lima.
The Head of State leaves the concluding document, which reported that 16 decisions were taken and the project lines for 31 projects between South America's countries were established over a total of $17 billion.
He said to the decisions taken that the Unsur countries will be "decisive steps towards the goal of a South America State citizenship, which we extend the decisions on residence rights".
He shared that measures would be prepared to "measur the cooperation in the fight against insecurity in the cities and against organized, transnational crimes, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and the Internet to low prices in all areas of Southern Rhinois and to act jointly and efficiently in the case of natural disasters".
With the crisis in Europe, "the economic consolidation (the Latin America) should not take triumphant trends, but should be used to extend our production performance and to make our people a better future."
"We have decided to give a number of 31 emblematic projects priority to improve the space connections in South America and especially in rural and border areas... and thus join our countries and solve new economic forms", said the Peruvian President in a reader statement.
These projects would also be five Peruvians who were on the Querachs of the Coast to Brazil, and two of which should be able to ensure better connection with Ecuador, although it did not have any further details.
The final document also refers to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve for its rebuilding in the Union of South America", which is currently excluded.
The need to remain an integrated region for well-being and peace and well-being relations was another aspect that was highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, expected to treat respectfully the maritime conflict after one of the IGH in question in Bogotá on Saturday in Mexico.
"That may be I'm going to meet with President Daniel Ortega on tomorrow," said Santos.
"We will all review these ways - they are not exclusively, and the Nicaragua Agreement also requires discussions with Nicaragua", he said.
"I hope to say to President Ortega that we will be civilized and respectfully treated as possible," said Santos.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they are intended to be attended by the new President of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As a part of the Summit, the Defence Minister of the Block on the adoption of the Plan of Action for 2013, which is intended to strengthen the dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, even though the last country is currently excluded.
Peru has the Presidency at the time of the regional block.
"South America must learn in the integration of the citizens", says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common State citizenship is a goal that "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who took part in the sixth meeting of the Presidents of the Union of South America (Unasur), held in Lima, declared the public television in Peru that the Europeans were “in the second World War and in other interferences” and "we are now a paternal country."
In this sense, he defend the project to create a South American citizenship that prevent the Member States of the uncertainty.
"The free movement of citizens and employees in all South America countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community, is important, but there are still reactional sectors that work back to the past," he warned.
The President Ecuador also commended the renewed organisation of the United States (EEA) under the provision of reducing the influence of the countries in Asia and take into account those signed by the United States of San José on Human Rights.
Those who teach themselves will never be able to do anything, and on the contrary, we always sign the South Americans.
"It is unreasonable that the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights has been funded by the United States and has been financed by the United States," he stated as a response to the political asylum, the Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because he did not raise his principles but comply with his "deep democratic values and views of human rights".
He added that it had given "funded confusions that Assange delivered to a third State and would not keep its procedures".
He also criticized the Swedish Justice, which he requested to submit him in his State area, for a convenient sexual crime, while "the Swedish law practice allows this by means of a video conference that could have been carried out over the Ecuadors message in London."
Correa explained that the risk would affect the health and psychological state of Assange.
"When he was in our message, I didn't talk to him, but the messenger informed me that he had a easy problem with the lungs but not a serious amount," said the head of the State Ecuadors.
However, it improves the danger that he faces physical and psychological damage because he was captured in a close space and could not carry out physical practices free.
"It would affect everybody's health," he added.
Correa acknowledged that the solution for the asylum has been granted in the Ecuadors message since June in London, to be a free letter that he could travel to Ecuador, and that this was in the hands of the British, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe. He stressed that it had given talks with London to find a solution for the reasonable reasons of WikiLeaks.
We do not act with human rights, but we do not apply this word in this case, but it has given continuous discussions.
"The solution for this problem is in the hand of the British, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe, because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, leads a number of procedures to various European institutions," he stated.
And "If the British morning granted this free letter, this is my opinion. "
And when Mr. Assange heard about the Ecuadors message in London or Skype, how it allows the Swedish law and was made in other cases, if the problem was done.
Correa used the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of the freedom of pressure and said that what he did not tolerate is "the medium-sizedness, the wicked hope and the lies that made the freedom of opinion".
"The biggest enemy of press freedom are not the wicked and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who tried and pressed according to profits," he said.
In this sense, he welcomed Ecuador that such journalists "and not to be dominated by bankers or Hegemonians and specific citizens", and said that he would be “promoting the revolution in order to continue the way in this right direction”.
Correa also supported the decision to keep Veto against Paraguay at least to its next elections, and he argued that the organization must "reserve" and that no opportunism should be permitted and none of which is legally covered, because "the legitimacy of the democracy was destroyed".
The President Ecuadors also deserves the desire of his Colombian opposition, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice of Den Haag, which offered the maritime Stateness of Nicaragua to negotiate the legal borders between two countries, for "absolutely".
This sentence is not currently implemented.
This is a problem between a South and Mediterranean State.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome after a common way.
They must be treated completely so that you can overcome them and look forward.
He also trusted in a good conclusion of the conflicts on the marine borders between Peru and Chile before the same Court of Justice, and said that "this is right to call international entities if both countries are bound to accept the judgment, even if it is very hard."
With regard to the possibility that he becomes a candidate for the next presidency elections in Ecuador to achieve his third mandate, he said that this option "see much optimism and joy, although sometimes it is very difficult".
Correa assured that if he solved the elections in February 2013, he would return from the political life.
The power has never interested me personally, but under such unjust circumstances, as in Ecuador, this socioeconomic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the faith that I was that guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to follow this responsibility," he said.
If I should win, it would be my last period as President, and then I will return to the public life.
This also applies when we lose.
"This is decided," he explained.
Correa also addressed the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just talked to the Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, and he told me that he went to the place for a planned and rutinal treatment, and that he would expect to return to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It does not mean, in any case, a decline in the health situation of President Chavez," he commented.
The Magorian Head of State today took part in Lima at the sixth meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South America (Oneaur), which was completed with the call to increase regional integration in order to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
The cause for a death because of AIDS is a too late recognition today
Fabrizio was 21 years old when you confirmed the result of the research: HIV-positive.
"It was like a bomb," he said about the moment when he received the diagnosis that the doctor tried to "defeat the diagnose without a recognisable success."
He hid it before his family.
He decided to take care of his disease alone and began to inform about it; and this was the use that he just celebrated his 43th birthday.
He is certainly one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit of the Civil de Guadalajara Hospital (HCG), where he arrived after several battles in 1994.
Fabrizio lives with the human immunedeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to imagine when there were many doubts, little treatment opportunities and more stymate.
Thus, the director of the ISS Clinic avoided its approval, "for it led it into a sack gas."
Now, AIDS was synonym for death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome with life quality.
However, there are still many people in the clinic that do not know anything about their disease and whose virus has already caused damage and created its immune system, and the victims of opportunist infections are.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e., after the first reported cases, "it is the great success today that the survival of a patient that takes timely the treatment and the survival of the general population are exactly equal," the leader of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, said that this information was based in April of this year.
The expert on infection diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a death judge, but the years of survival and the life quality of the level of the immune system of persons in the start of treatment, and that the greater opportunities were not depending on AIDS: up to 30 years of decrease of 200 CD4 and 50 years in a declination of 500 CD4.
Similarly, the above statements mean that who receives positive HIV diagnosis in the age of 25 years may be "unfailablely 75 years, as long as it is under control", explained this expert.
In order to make this progress properly, it must be reminded that the life expectation of Mexico is now averaged by 76 years.
Even though mortality has significantly reduced in the past years (in Mexico, the number of people who died in AIDS has been decreased from 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (UNAIDS Annual Report), it is true that 60 per cent of the patients in the national database have been lost.
Only 255 people died in Jalisco in 2011, and until May this year, there are 187 deaths, but it will be ensured that there are universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- So why are people still die?
- I think the problem is not the access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and that's in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we had no health problems in the medicines, the problem is that people come in a very higher state because they did not know their infection situation, i.e. in very late phases of disease.
He makes a strict statement: "No one of the ten patients come to us when they have already a joint infection. In order to affect the global mortality, diagnoses are necessary for early, for which all persons who need it must offer massive recognition tests."
This proposal agrees to the experts and officials of the Statal de Prevention del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on AIDS prevention in Jalisco) and to the patients like the manufacture who performed his test at a private laboratory, and this is the only reason why it had made a friend of him who had already been in the AIDS-phase and even the Caposi salmon (a crystal tumor), which was one of the common complications.
It's different if you know that you have AIDS.
Some think they're gonna die, and they don't want to hear.
"If I have to die, then I like to smell three times," you say in my case.
The change was to improve, I'm showing good, driving sport and taking the medicine.
Today, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everybody else.
"I work much, I have an active, but responsible sexual life, I take care of my health and the other person," says the factory that is appropriate to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO in order to identify with his witness those who have fear today in the framework of the world AIDS day.
They should do the test if they belong to the risk group. At first they know whether they are HIV-posittive, it's better, and if they already know the diagnoses, they should learn how to live responsiblely as all people.
His message is a collection of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condome behind the loading table
Among the health programs and the simple citizens, Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who accepted the matter of HIV.
And the most important is the predictation.
In some places, "If the distribution of condomes actually increased, they were previously dismissed individually, now they give us a paket with hundreds of pieces, which is good, but there are still people who have no access to a condom," he said.
The risk personnel for new infections are young.
"What do you need this?" is a broad spot question of social workers, orientation staff in schools, pharmaceuticals and health system that did not want young people to take place, assured the correspondent.
He intended to redirect this inefficient distribution; the condomes should not only be behind the loading table, but also in expenditure devices in public toilets of facilities that are often visited by youth.
It should not be promoted by the promiscuity.
It should not be paid to them the beer and the motel, as the Governor Emilio González answered to the question whether it would be distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality does not look like that; best, it is to bring the condomes closer to those who already exercise a sexual activity," he said.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13.435 cumulated cases (1.258 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
The State is seen at 4 places of new and cumulative AIDS cases, and 13 in relation to HIV.
92% of the accidents of sexual trafficking, 6% of blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 persons that do not know.
After confirming a sentence by the United States that does not recognize the restructuring of the liabilities of the Vitro Group that has been reached through trade competition in Mexico, an unfair case of presence for each national enterprises with neighbouring liability in the neighbouring country will be created.
It could therefore be said that the procedures for survival of the companies authorised by the Mexican laws are not valid in the country of Stars and Stripes, in resistance to international agreements.
In practice, the judge Harlin Hale at the Court of Justice at Bancarrotas for the northern district in Texas has been acknowledged by the Mexican companies to take their property outside the river Bravo.
However, the decision opens the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to call the Supreme Court of the United States for three inconsistences.
While the judges of the matter point out that the believers must submit to the United States' competition law, the Fifth Circuit's Professional Court first says seats in New Orleans that it is the principal procedure for the trade competition treated in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in procedures for payable enterprises with transnational profile is not known.
Indeed, the model law of the United Nations for the harmonization of the International Trade Law Act was created by the American Law Institutes.
Secondly, it is estimated that without the votes of the companies after recognizing the liabilities in the competitive mass, which Vitro had with its mother society, the necessary majority would not be achieved for restructuring the liabilities.
However, this possibility is recognised by the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme was approved.
There is a half twenty examples, including Agremex and Commercial Mexicona, whose engagements were confirmed under the Group of the Federal Institute de Concursos Mercantiles (Bunde Institute for Trade Concursions).
Furthermore, after the votes of the filials, the believers of Vitro, who claimed to the courts of the United States against Vitro, were not reached by majority, such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited.
The vote would be 45% against 37%.
This is not taken into account by the Professional Court.
On the other hand, Vitro has been in charge for its difficult situation since 2008 in the context of the great economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country slaughter.
For this reason, the family González Sada is opposed to the same vocational law in order to follow the vote in full, i.e. by all judges, because only three of them agreed.
If not, the Cerciorare entry shall be introduced which requires the review of the procedure by a higher instance, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
In this case, it is important that the Court has provided a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the Figur amicus curiae (Frau of the Court), which is describing the procedure under the Vitro Law on Trade Concursion, and which is noted that it had strictly held the agreements signed by two countries to comply with the United States' competition law chapter 15.
Furthermore, it is noted that the country has subjected the principles of the Commission of the United Nations for International Trade, i.e. the rules laid down in the cases of cross-border payment inability guaranteed the equality of debts and believers.
Two-banding carbole: a shock for Vitro and the country.
General balance
After the statements by the mexican air traffic companies against the former owners, Gastón Azquarraga Andrade, who was accused of a begurous administration, did not previously progress the Asociation Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores.
The investigation provided by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now introduced a criminal procedure against the National Bank and Value Commission, which is proposed for the disability of the justice.
The Supervisory Authority has systematically refused to inform the main management of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the employee to decrease from the Bank F/589 in the name of Mexicona de Aviation 198 million Pesos.
These resources were used for the purchase of shares of the Administrador Professional de Hotels (the professional hotel management).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posada Hotel chain.
Dragon Mart is rounded
A group of national and foreign protectioners, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of the civil society decided to create a width front in order to reverse the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún at a weekend meeting on the weekend end of the Caribbean University.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and sales centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country outside the wall, complementing a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
The Canacintra (National Chamber of the Manufacturing Industry) has been reached to join the governance in the south to reverse the monumental institution that destroyed protected areas and represents the mother of all the threats of the industry.
ACTA is dead
Since the Government has not been subject to a request from the Senate to explain which conditions and circumstances of the mexican emails in Japan signed the anti-counterfeiting trade agreement known under the English decline ACTA, the case is already archiving in accordance with the Mexican Institute of Intelligence.
As you know, these measures took place, although the Senate had taken the possibility out of view because he considered it a violation of the freedom of opinion in the social networks.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life."
The world's boomer of the basketball, Hector "Hetin" Reyes, was connected to the corbsport for 60 years and over the whole world.
Some in Puerto Rico have a so large spiritual collection of the country's Basketball history as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was linked to the Roll Studio in 2008, Rexes was six years ago part of this sport, it was as a lower class player, players of the first national liga, voluntary and leader in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of the Basketball Association.
"In my life, I have placed many guests in the basketball, even several times as I was President of the BSN, head of the National Humanity and the President of the Association in the 1990s," Reyes remembered at a visit from Firsta Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he was with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not overcome this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memorys of his long carriage and proof them.
Bahamon in the heart
The most emotional memories are those who remembered at his time at the Vaqueros from the midst of the 50s as players until 1982, where he held his 15-year-old jubilium as a business leader or business leader of the club.
"This was my best years that I had mostly joined, because I was part of the eight Masters of Vaqueros since 1967, it was as business leader, business leader or trainer.
There were many years of fulfillment, including the five masterships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I adopted me with a mastership 1981, the year of Jerome Mincy's Debout at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a very good manager," says Reyes.
I still know that Gene Bartow, who worked here as a trainer and appointed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said, "I have a very strong and 2 m great player.
Do you want him?"
And this was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players, the Puerto Rico had it.
Bartow then recommended the free-free specialist Raymond Gausse, who left its citizens and was one of our best publishers.
I know how he said that if Mincy had allowed a mastership for Bayamon, the gas would take care of another.
The Mastership of Vaqueros with Gauss was granted to him, but it was already out of a distance because he was already at the top of the association in 1988.
At that time, he proposed to enjoy his full struggles and the Mincy's nationality.
I still know when we win the first time at the preolympical tournament in Mexico against the United States.
Then the 1990 World Mastership, where we were in the fourth place, which should actually be Bronze, if not this Canadian Schied leader, who has left us the last time again, said Reyes.
Was this group of world masters in 1990 the best nationality you saw you?
It belongs to the best, as well as those who win the Olympiade 2004 against the Dream Team.
My favorite, however, is the manner of the panomic games in Kuba in 1991, where we win gold and offered the US team a fight as they win us at the World Mastership Bronze.
In this manner, not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculino" (Ortiz) were back in there, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers of León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who couldn't be in the same place for a struggle in 1990.
A mansion that may not be the best about personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and prepared us great joy, was that of the 1995 pre-lympical tourist in New Queen, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Paul Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a replacement for the cutting players because of the pre-passing of the panomic games in Mar del Plata, we win the gold medals.
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
That was no doubt Piculin Ortiz.
His numbers at the level of international tourists are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as Piculin.
And this, without taking into account his trains in the various lines in which he has played.
Who was the best trainer from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good trainers such as Julio Toro, Flor Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandado Torres.
I like Leo Arill's work.
What do you think you're the best thing you've achieved in the relationship?
I was part of the most successful era of the National Humanity from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN from the beginning of the 1990s to 17 agents in a season.
What's left to do with you?
There are things I had introduced, for example, the regionalization of the below categories.
That the kids in Ponce, for example, play only in their area and only meet in the national Playoffs on mathematicities from other edges of the island.
Today the children do not need many trips and games.
At least, I see the result of the training and courses for trainer, table officers and Schieds Directors.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to hear music, see music videos of my time in YouTube, enjoy my kids and go to a basketball game.
And of course, I enjoyed my wife Isabel, who was always on my side.
Larry Hagman is dead.
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Wordh (Texas) and was worldly famous with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the TV series "Dallas", where he played a sgrouper, home-cache and manipulating businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oilmagnat J.R. Ewing in the TV series "Dallas" to a symbol of the Habgier of the 80s.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new stage of "Dallas", died on Friday afternoon because of cancer complications under a press communication of the family at The Associated Press by Warner Bros., produced by "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his loved birth city Dallas, where he again played the iconic role that was mostly grateful to him," said the family.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the celebrations of the Championship.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and follow-up series, was at Hagman, when he died in the hospital of Dallas, said her publisher Jeffrey Lane.
He made all the joy that knew him.
He was creative, sweet, sweet, sweet, lovely and talented, and I'm going to miss him very much.
"He was a original person and lived in full practices," Gray explained in a communication.
Hagman was diagnosed in 1992, and he admitted that he had slowed a lot over years.
1995, a bad tumor was found in his lever, and he was understood a transplantation.
In the years before "Dallas" Hagman was known at the television as a good type in the 1965-70s, with the "Beauty Jeannie" of the NBC.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life would be put on the head when he faces an attractive "dwin" (shooted by Barbara Eden), who will live with him in his home.
He was also promoting two communities that were extracted only a short time, such as the Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
In its cineworks, well evaluated roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his mastery interpretation of the enthusiasming J.R., who made Hagman to a superstar.
The dramatic series of the CBS television chain on the ewing clan and other figures in its environment were extracted from April 1978 to May 1991.
The newspaper "Who did J.R.?", which expected to create an episode of full emotions, where the figure of Hagmann was almost killed, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were covered in wethouses.
So the series reached a viewer record at that time.
When the response was known in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by average 41 million observers, which "Dallas" was transformed into the second spectrum, which was seen by the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Christine who had shooted J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby).
J.R. had been shocked and threatened to present her as a prostitute if they didn't leave the city, but others also had reasons for seeing him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of the Ewing as a corrupt, unfair man with a charismatic laugh: a residue of business man and unloved husband, who then tried to make his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what to stand on the Grabstone of J.R." said Hagman 1988.
It should be called "Here the honourable citizens J.R. Ewing."
This is the only business he didn't win.
Victoria Principal, the Middle of the Original Series, recalled Hagman on Friday as a "a great personality on and outside the screen".
He is unforgettable and unconscious for millions in the world and remains us who have the luck to know and love him in our hearts.
Ten episodes of the new output of "Dallas" were extracted in the TV channel a few months ago.
The record of five chapters for the second stage was closed, and a sixth chapter was just turned, informed the sender.
There was no immediate declaration on how Hagmann's loss would be treated in the series.
born in Fort Wordh, Texas, he was the son of the artists and songman Mary Martin, who played classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was a young man when she got Larry during her marriage with a lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried to work on the theatre flights in New York at the beginning of the 50s, and then served from 1952 to 1956 in the aircraft forces in England.
There he learned the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many famous people had their stay.
2001 he referred his memories "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I haven't written anything from which I believed that it could harm someone or affect him at any point," said the Associated Press at the time.
After heavy transplantation, he took place for healing and worked as volunteers in a hospital to assist in premature patients.
"I pray them, give them courage, I meet them when their operations are before and then," he explained in 1996.
I want to make them a little comfort, for example, "No fear, it's a little unexpectedly the first time, but it's gonna go well."
He also put himself against smoking and took part in several campaigns.
Start of the course studying the "End of the World"
Each week, students study Apocalyptical Topics such as Atom War, Zombies, Virus and Keime and global warming.
Each seed, when the Religious Profesor decided to stop a course over the end of the world, he knew that he had about an unreasonable Angelhake: the end of the "long backward record" of Maya calendar on December 21, which many people believed that it was the end of the world.
But Charmen had no idea what should be expected in the following two months: the destroyed Hurrican Sandy, which some called "Deudarmagedon", and a growing conflict under the participation of Israel, the place where the Christian theocratics believe that the apocalypse begins.
"I have not noticed that this will be the most apocalyptical seed that it has ever been", said Charme this week to students at the university of Rutger Camden (New Jersey).
If someone analyzes what happened today in the world, like if we would have removed 30 days from it, this would be a very good period.
And he remembers that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor that this seedster, which should actually be the last in history, offers courses over the "End of the world".
In Temple, the attendant Professor Barry Vacker provides the course "media, culture and the end of the world".
Each week, students study Apocalyptical Topics such as Atom War, Zombies, Virus and Keime and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas are extended with time," he said, and the way to offer hypothetical scenarios that lead to a certain human behavior.
If nuclear material reached the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could be cut off.
This month, students analyzed films with apocalyptical content and investigated how they compared to the real life.
"I've tried to inform students about what possible, probably, believable and impossible," said Vacker.
At Pennsylvania University's main camp, Professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a assistant professor for art stories and anthropology, have established a team to offer a course with the light term "The end of the world".
"We do not take 2012 to keep the option to keep the course again, for the case that the world is not understood," said Restall.
Despite the "first start", students must study, create projects and participate in conclusion tests.
In Penn State the completion test is carried out at the end of the apocalypse, because students have no opportunity to continue to work until the night, where the world is going to end, said Restall.
The courses were very favorite.
"In two hours there was no place anymore", said Restall about his course for students with high average, filled with 35 students.
We received emails from students who asked whether they were free.
Students, on the other hand, ensure that the course is the interesting ones.
"It's fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutger Camden for Religious and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptical sect or religiousity is in fact only a question of comfort or lack of it.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa for psychology and hospitals declares having seen all apocalyptic films.
"I haven't heard anything of a teaching where this is taught", he said.
I enjoy it.
But no one of the students asked - and less than one professor - explained to believe on the last date of December 21.
"In our first project we treated Maya's prophecy, and in a certain manner we discredise it," said Julie Zeglen, student in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayas never said the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
He notes, however, that western society has an apocalyptical fear that returns several centuries when people responded to changes in their environment with the predictation of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"In some places people don't think so," he says.
This is mainly the case in the English world.
Joseph Duugherty, a religious professeur of La Salle University, who taught on the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question whether he would know a course about the "the end of the world".
"The Philippines do not participate at the end of the world," he wrote as an advertising to an exception of a higher institution.
We have a infringement from the pope.
Restall pointed out that many days were spoken from the last court over the years, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "the people immediately think about a new date" or philosophed that the 21th December is the beginning of a seven-year period, which comes to the end of the world.
Students and Professors take this date easy.
Many say they wanted to go to party on "the end of the world."
"I probably call a few friends to smile together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communication.
