What do they do, the SSD? The Czechian social democrats in Praga, nor the voldeer place, nor the "conditory".
The new Councils of the main city will clearly have to overcome certain language barriers in order to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Council of Prayer and in the Cities.
The newspaper updated.cz has a little "concluding" member of the new Council from the SSD, as it controls the notorical ring that has entered in the past few years, where today's coalition partners were in Praga on Ruder.
The coded word chat, introduced in the faulted era of top citizens Pavel Bém from the Prager's political elite, is rejected by some of the most known actors, situations and causes.
It was surprising that the new routines in terms of these new terms were something in darkness.
At least they said that.
"Who is Voldemed place?"
"I don't know."
"I'm a new gang in the Prager Policy," Lukáš Kauckī, the new advisor for culture, responded to the test of "Paten-Words."
But also the Councilsher Karel Bśezina, a political veteran, reacted similarly.
For example, the term "golfloch".
"This is the only expression of those you present me here, which I go and go again."
"Only, I don't think much of Slang."
From the quote published by the Daily Newsletter in June this year before the ODS's election congress, the editor took six words out, especially those who were notedly linked to the Prager Master Council.
The social democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "great Prager Golfloch", "Go to the Conditionary", "Sterien", "Retraction of the capital city" and "smell".
The fourth - Antonin Weinert, the future chief of the Prayer's schools, first talked to his participation in the conversation, then not to take off the listener.
The fifth advisor, Peter Dolínek, rejected the test before.
"These things are not me, and how the citizens of democracy are interfering, I do not condemn it."
"For me is important how we understand in the framework of our programmes," he said.
As already stated, Lukáš Kauckī had not apparently recognized in the above line that it is the slight of an influential entrepreneur and friend of the former citizens Bem, Roman Janoušek.
The term "Voldemort" says nothing and the only word he corrected at the test was "the biggest player golf loch".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," he said, "but I know more from the newspaper."
And ridiculous, "I'll probably have to show a language course."
The "golfloch" is then not only designed by Matator Karel Bśezina, but also by the Council's Council for Environmental Questions Lukáš Plachý right as the Tunnel Blanka.
Both social democracies also know whose term Voldemort is, and Lukáš Plachý, even where this figure is to find, and what it means to go in the conditory.
"I think that means to go in some prayer of guestnomie", Plachī is quite close to the race solution when you know that it is about the seat of Janoušek's company.
However, in accordance with Bśezina, he claims that these knowledge are more covered from the newspaper than that he would be his own word chat.
It seems that there is no similar skin among social democracies.
"I asked my colleagues too, but obviously there's something that really doesn't exist with us."
"We call us on the name, and we also use sculptures or sculpture names", says the Chairman of the Prayer s.SSD Petr Hulínský - by its partners salopp "Hulda".
"In the school I was called Bśíza (Birke), but I don't know whether I'm also called my colleagues," Karel Bśezina gives us his spot names.
The newspaper Deník Update.cz has tried the name and see there - he works.
The "Opa" or less friendly of the "old", the representative of Miroslav Poche, who has taken attention to the parties' sponsoring, is called by some colleagues "Igraček" (known Czech Lego Figur).
The names are the only to allow social democracy in the internal language use.
Hulinský may not be called "Hulda", but Denic Update.cz recorded another name of the Chairman of the Prayer.
His "Doctor of the Gummiknapple Rights" is able to do that Peter Hulínský has purchased his title at the Bratislaver Police Academia.
The government wants to connect the torture of "Hexen" and gave a brochure out.
Women who are planted in Burkina Faso to Hexen, generally have some common social features.
They belong to the older generation, they don't find any job - for example, for healthy reasons, they're leak and have no children.
If one of these women will "be" be strictly isolated so that it can't be dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Mans are rarly affected by this skill."
"As a young and healthy woman remains shocking this because they help children to work and create children," a commander describes the situation that is in the capital of the West African state Burkina Faso in a special house of more than hundred women who have been discovered by their communities.
The local government has now decided to go against this abnormal "social measure".
And there was a brochure that was to connect the "hexen persecution".
But the thing has a hake.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso can't read," said the newspaper "Standard" on the dilemma of the written statement.
In other African countries, the heavyness is also to be respected.
In Ghana, the neighborhood of Burkina Faso, the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahov was tortured by three women and two men to death, and they slaughtered with petroleum and simply slaughtered them.
About this incident, you also reported the BBC server.
However, the murders said that the matter would only be a collection of unfortunate circumstances.
Your version is deflated to oil that is used to ritual salts.
And even after the group tried to "a bad spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "Hexen" supports people here without care of their education.
"The Standard" quoted here to a 42-year-old employee from Burkina Faso: "The brothers of human soul are a risk than today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to develop the Hexenyegd, the President of Gambian has been fully communicated in the last year.
"President Jaya Jammeh took a monster hexenjagd after his death, since this share of their death would now be tried to kill the Presidents itself through black magic."
"That he called the shamanes from the nearby Guinea, who were in charge of the police, soldiers and the body garden of the President, and men, who were violently arrested from Gambian villages and brought to the farms of the President in Kavali," reported the Organization of Amnesty International in their report.
The farmed people were forced to drink an abuse from plants with saluzinogenic effect, but also enhanced dark and nine problems.
Two of the repented people did not survive the rest of the farm.
First, because of international pressure, nearly thousand prisoners were released again.
A mixer of Bakala: He's heating in the hole - Despite the payment of higher money
A older man just left the RPG Byty Customer Centre of the "Kohlebarons" Zdenśk Bakala, the largest private possessor of accommodations in Czech.
Under the arm, a map with three new cotton contracts to three apartments: for the own and the apartments of his daughters and son who just taught a prison penalty.
All three were raised in the sog. "Deregulation" just increased the currency.
Instead of 3500 krones of month, the son has to accommodate a 2-room room room with kitchen of the second category 4100 krones in the next year.
"And there is no fly water in the apartment and heating there must be in a simple coal", he tips with the finger on the new cotton contract of the Son to which he has a full power.
"And something - I have signed", he explained half and resigned.
The BytyOKD.cz citizens who describe the new conditions as "incorrect and immoral" calls the men to simply not sign the new treaties and to wait until 7 December, in which they are advertising a guideline, as they are proposed against such treaties.
But the man just wins.
"Everything says this, the other thing," he makes a dark face.
The Ostrava region will be so large as the Deregulation Lab.
After New Year, this deregulation is the majority of Czech inhabited in Czech, whose deputy is not payable for market payments until now.
Currently.cz decided to visit this "Labour" personally.
The RPG warming room in Haviōov is full of four in the Ostrava region and has been cut over 9 a.m. on Tuesday.
Just next to the door, Bodyguards are a security agent and a calling device with her.
"First 2011" lights a specific key field on the touch screen.
Shortly tip and the device already splits a number line.
We've discovered the number "157" and already put it on the large screen at the floor of the chat room.
A half second later you're on the line.
Sometimes a older couple is involved in the waiting room to ask after the midst, but the shooting in the waiting room is obviously not the new hour.
Most people are here to solve the common problems - repairs, insurance issues and similar.
From the midst of November, in the Ostrava region, the Kuverts with the new meal contracts fleet the majority of the total 44.000 apartments of the portfolio of the RPG in the boxes.
The RPG Byty suggests that they will increase from around 15 to 38% in the writings.
The special switch for the new measuring in the customer centre is open since November 18th.
"The action runs something over a week, that means that it's just the beginning", the lady answered the back of the shield after a moment of smiling, when the "Client" comes as a journalist.
The deregulation and bakalas former mountain workers are a brising theme.
Before the elections, the vice-president Lubomír Zaoralek, from Ostrava, had not been wonderful that the newspapers were full of it today.
"Thanty years I want a new footbooth from them."
"No more. WC-Brill could switch them," the man called the start.
To date, the employees are mainly on the switch to convince themselves that they really receive the promised switching that RPG is granted to them when they sign the special long-term offer.
In the Genuss of a slowly delayed February, the other ones who sign the new Meeting Treaty up to 15 December should also be signed.
Until now, "Deregulation switch" in Haviōov is everything else than overcome questions.
"For the total of 360 customers, only about 40 to 50 of the mills in 2011," estimates the slaughter officials.
RPG offers both on its website as well as on the wall tables of individual meal agreements where it appears necessary.
But if the Party does not have some new currency, it will be determined by an independent court.
"This is not a threat, but is to understand as information about the only and fully legitimate legal measures", RPG states on its website.
"Here no one goes before the court," one of RPG Byty's employees and a man on the road before the customer centre gives you at least partly right.
"I have 13,000 (Crone) interests, which remains for me 5,000 remains for food, where I should take the money for a trial."
Then the assignment will be insecure.
"I'm seeing."
"Mr. Zaoralek tells them about the media, they should not sign and wait for the people still," he says.
The regulated currency ends in the majority of Czech Republic to New Year 2011 and RPG Byty is an economic need for increase.
"The existing amount of currency is not enough to maintain the residence fund," said Pavel Klimeš, director of the RPG Byty's Apartment Portfolios, and - just the disadvantagement of the housing fund, which is criticized by the Middle Apartment Fund, is in view of the household owner of the main foundation for mixing.
During the years between 2005 and 2010, RPG could invest four billion in the apartments, in the four years from 2011 to 2014, there should be 5.2 billion.
On the big formatting LCD display on the box towards the polsterssels in the waiting room of Haviōov, there are always a few red lighting information.
"The measuring increases in 2011 at 15% and less than 31 200 apartments, which means more than 90% of the apartments of RPG."
"Everything means this maximum of 7.50 CZK per squaremeter and month," is to read on the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments from the portfolio of RPG increased the average to 38%.
"In these cases, it is the extensive increase of 19.66 CZK per squaremeter," said RPG.
In 2600 apartments the average remains at the same height in the next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation is not springing to the height, but slowly follows within four to eight years.
What more - the company has another obligation: all income from mid-sized increase (see graph) wants to turn the company back into the apartments, especially in heat parkings, in new windows and in the warm deterioration.
But, priorityly, these people should be welcomed by signing the agreements on the Mediterranean increase.
Architects looked into - the office also belongs to a child garden
The office of Avriopoint in Brno is the new seat of the company Arch.Design.
But who would already wait here for a minikinder garden, with everything that belongs to: several walls, creative houses, a lot of game tools, and even a mini playing place on the outside.
This child garden is available to workers of Arch.Design since last year.
The projecting and architecture office Arch.Design, from which a series of native flowers builts, has been calculated by the first designs for the new Avriopoint building with the areas for its company-mining gardens.
In an amazing perspective, because most of its 90 employees (in) are located in the babyboom old and the company that projectors and architects return to their work as soon as possible.
In addition to the possibility to be reduced, the child garden is another bonus offering the Arch design of its employees in the context of their social programmes.
Building engineers and architects are so easy to bring their dedicated professionals and children's care in a harvest.
The Minikinder garden is an original idea of the employees (in) by Arch.Design and with the support of the management, they have been able to win their supporters from the European Union and of the Ministry of Work and Social Affairs for their project.
The business mini-kinder garden is financed by the Operation Programme of Human Resources and Employment Policy from the European Social Fund and from the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this financing (subsidies of 2,8 million CZK) the necessary institutions and equipment could be provided and for the duration of 2 years is supplied for qualified staff and for the operation.
Following the expense (2 years), the company Arch.Design is obligation to continue to work on the mini-kinder garden for three years further.
The preparation of this project took a whole year, providing the Economy Corporation a strong aid in the development of the application.
To children carefully qualified personnel - a nurse and a child garden, child garden can visit children without older restrictions, although most of them are over three years.
And as it's about a mini-kind garden, only five children may be present at the same time, but the day changes several children each other.
Child gardens are flexibly agreed on the needs of parents who have children of all employees with regard to the use of child garden the same rights - without regarding the company's hirearchies and their own position.
While it is about individual education and training, the programme content in the mini-kinder garden is comparable to the framework programme of pre-education.
The children are not only playing here, especially for their excellent teachings - from basic knowledge to pre-education, but also learning English.
The classroom is not only equipped with game tools and creative games, but also with a computer that is available to the children.
More - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company.
Parents can take a look at the children at all times, and so the stress is declining when the child is late in a far away child garden.
Parents use their working time producers.
No wonder that there are also natural and loyal workers' relationships.
Arch.Design renewed the Czechese company that offers significant benefits in the purchase of new employees, which are family friends and strengthen their staff marketing by such programmes.
A skin house also fascinates 100 years later. Look at the interests of Gaudi
The bathroom is like the back of a prehistorical shift, the floor like the weapon room of a dinosaurer and the balcony are shocked fishermen.
This is the Batloo House of the Catholic Architecte Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
The house, with its organic forms, took the names "Knochenhaus".
Organic forms, wild colours, the incompatible use of stones, casts and mosaics, which remembered fassades and all-warm lines, all these are typical features for the youth style of Antonio Gaudi.
The fassade of the house plays with dreaming lines, colors and textures that remember the nature and lifestyle.
First of the precise view, it is noted that everything is controlled by geometria, rhythmus and meditational order.
In the night, the entire fassade is still plastic, dramatic and the special lighting increases the sight of the colors.
The same weak lines and shapes also dominate the inside of the house.
Well-formed wood copies window frames, landscapes, gates of doors, even swimming pools and leisures.
The Batlló house in the fourth Eixample at the pleasant shopping street Passeig de Gracia No 43 was launched by the reconstruction of a house from 1877, the architects Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years in charge and was closed in 1906.
The investor, the welfare industrial Josep Batlló, originally took place on the fall of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but finally he realized the idea of Gaudís to become an uncommon and even more suitable reconstruction.
However, the House House Batlló did not get Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
The decorations for the representative accommodation of the owner and the use of Mosaics at the Fassade were his idea.
However, there were many other pictures and artists to work at the fassade.
The joint work on the projects for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful cooperation by Jujola and Gaudí.
Thus Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudís House Casa Milá in the Guell Park, where there are further works of Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after his finishing, the house came from the huge inhabitants of its organic forms because of the pits names "Knochenhaus".
Others again called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "speaking house".
It is also said that the sword of the holy George, the patron of Catalonia, is represented above on the building.
But also other image-aurical elements symbolize disgusting religious motivations.
Gaudí was a unique centralizing system for the house at the time with relief channels and typical channels.
Somehow strangely, their 45-grad nervousness is already.
Gaudí was ignored in his sheep, resulting in all then building rules and left no way out of this.
However, before the building begins, the appropriate construction authorisation was for one of the information made by him about the planned reconstruction so slow that the town of Titus two years later was so replaced by the result that they requested relief.
The Councils, inter alia, have also found that the construction with its pillars is even in the public interest.
However, on the contrary, Josep Batloo had only fiveteen days after the invitation of the city's newspaper, which was requested to authorize the allocation of the two higher Stockworks of the house, and was soon granted to it.
The householder himself moved to the lower stages.
In the 2st Stock gallery, there is a company room in the third Stock, the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The earthquake was shocked at a juvenile business.
The whole six-third building runs a floor to the dawn ground.
With the basic elements of the reconstruction, all right angles and just lines were eliminated and replaced by boxed and struck walls.
But Gaudí also worked with a modern approach to mutual connection of spaces.
The social part can be fully connected through the opening of salon doors and, so, a larger society could be able to rejoice, without rejecting a certain intimity at more confidential meetings.
The house was received by Gaudís, except a new fassade, also a right insufficient toilet and two other storeworks.
It is also impressive that Gaudís games with light and the blue and white slippered cachels with which the inner court is supplied and the light heights.
The game of these two colors gives all stages of the house a maximum to light.
Thus he made the principle useful that white reflects better than dark colors that decorated the sun light in the opposite way.
The House Casa Batlló, which was included in the 2005 World Heritage List of Unsco, can visit everyone today.
In the first place the most spacious and accurate apartment of the public is available.
The householder only decided to take this step in the year and this from the 150th anniversary of the famous Creator.
When you found that this is a right to be undertaken, you have also helped the specifications, and it was also expressed on another common and the shooting spaces, including the shooting landscape.
However, the price to take account of the building is not a patent steel; it is 16.50 euros, students, rentners, groups and holders of tourist exhibitions receive 20% decline.
This amount refers to the entry prices to other Gaudí-budgets in the city.
Who wants to know the real atmosphere of the house with his dragons towers should try to close friendship with one of the householders and visit him home.
The right matrats and the right bed? Women have other desires than men
Not the greatest bed frame, but the quality of the lift surface - so the mattress and rose makes the good bed.
However, these need to be harmonized in order to justify the desires of the concrete user.
In the selection, many things play a role - weight, size, health condition, and not lastly the sex of the skin.
It is also important that the internal in which they have been subjected to matrix and rose.
typical example?
In a weekend house where it is not regularly heated, latex matrats are not good, since they need much longer to be "heat".
Moreover, they are significantly more serious than normal polyyurethan matrates.
And - they should be regularly sent.
Indeed, if they do not have enough relief cancers in the kernel and are still on a fixed plate, the temperature is not excluded, therefore, that they are under their smile.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what you want.
Those who were longer in the foreign, where very high matrats are commonly with weight, are difficult to cut down on a low matrats with a hard surface.
"If all the eishockey players who came back from the NHL, I've been sweet that they can't sleep right here."
"For their shoes, shoes and horses they simply need a wheel of Visco-shaum (Memory Foam - a memory polymer)."
"This is my recommendation, among others, that people suffering under a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can receive the "information" from the skin and the skin", says Sylva Hadamcsikova, who specializes on polster mobs.
This is why I have concerned many Eishockey players years ago, but other customers also care for these matrix with Visco-shaum (Memory Foam).
"This is no problem today, because such matrixes offer, for example, the manufacturer Temple, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you must not be a famous eishockey player to learn the advantages of the Visco Shaum.
This "Wunder" actually works very simple.
The smell optimizes its dusts and shape according to the absorpted warm, otherwise heavy changes to the warm body.
There's nothing to press, in the night, you can't be shocked like a serious fight.
You're just sleeping much better.
The viskoelastic shoe also provides protection against Decubitus (Wundbrand).
In the selection of the matratiz size, you should still add the length of the footsteps, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Man as a woman, who is at the size of 180 cm, needs so a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each width should be available at least 90 cm, so it is 180 cm.
In individual beds, for example, in Singles, 120 to 140 cm.
The comfort half and even for possible visitors.
On the other hand, the following faust rules apply for the ideal bed width: "If you are on the back, it should still be enough for the easyly adjusted arm," Ing. Helena Prokopova, the director of the Polster and Raum Responsors, who has been able to have the problems of the healthy sleep and the ergonomy of houses, and this theme also provides in special schools.
With a double bed, each one needs a own red and its own matrix, but check at the purchase so that the matrats are equal to the same.
Otherwise, there is nothing else than mounting the rose in different heights and it is not possible for any bed frame.
Shum matrats should be at least 14 cm high, matrats with feedskellet 15 cm, which should take at least three centimeters on the shape and fein polster.
"In the hand or in the adjustment, the farms should not be shown in case", warns Helena Prokopova.
Each matrix requires a special root type.
Full-powered beds with mattresss and subscription, such as grown siam-wills, have nothing to search in the bedroom.
These matrixes are not able to smell and the reference can not be able to wake out what is already loop and sweet today.
And as you lost Swiss in one night between 0.2 to 0.75 l, it is clear that the matratze will be slowly to a huge (and hidden seb) after five to seven years.
As a result, advertising advertising journalists, who promised a life period of up to 25 years, even a long life guarantee.
Everything has her when and but.
And therefore, a practical advice from the handlers: in matrats of 120 or 140 cm width, you should not think the hygiene of the sweet, slightly sweet smells, but recommends to use a matrat shoes that can easily take away and wake up.
Even today, when the matrix is produced with the rundum strike closure, there are two half feet after opening (which is important for washing and washing machines!), the manipulation with larger matrats, especially only executes, often as inequalious struggle between David and Goliath.
Do you have a fixed place in the bed instead of a face?
Get out of it!
Or best for a bed for unloved guests and for one night.
In addition, they should use the plates more likely with swimming powders (if they are no longer there) and matrats with feedsquelets and 15 cm of minimum height with soccer sweets and feinpolsters.
Polyurethan matrates do not include a subscription.
For not-building milk races with 14-18 feetlegers (Lamelles) are suitable for latex or sandwich rats (e.g. combinations of latex and cocos), raws are always paid with a larger number of latinists, such as 28 and more federalists, to regulate the lattery barriers and the possibility of regulating the latin torches.
There are no matrats with feed cell, since they do not react to the ergonomic distribution.
In addition to setting the stages of the federalists, special flexible flexibility switch modules are also offered.
This applies to a special configuration of federalists, which allows the federalists to press or even win so that they allow the punctuary indentation of the slaughter's slaughter.
Nevertheless, it is important for men with wide sculptures.
There are even matrix manufacturers that have started to use "herren matrats" areas for the shift area.
It is also thought of the ladies - they're shocking these swimming zones in the harvest.
For the most complete customers, pointselatic flights systems (Lattoflex) or reds are determined with pointelastic contact paths with soft multitrusion feeding.
The pressure is distributed on several points, reduced the swimmingness.
But - if you use a bad (to large and full) head cups for the right matrats and the right red, most of the benefits will be lost again.
This is also a faust rule: the head box should support the head, its skins should only be rich to the sleeves so that the sculpture muscles can be able to relax.
Ideal therefore appears a 50 x 60 cm large skin, such as the scandinavials.
In the page, the head box (compact with the loading zone in the red or the shift area in the matratze) should be compared to the height of the shift.
Something have had our modern matrats with the unique (filled with hou) shoes but common.
Modern manufacturers are always using often natural materials or at least their minimises.
The new magic word "Bio".
Instead of oil raw materials, it is used for the production of polyuret cows always more frequent natural oils - for example, Rizinus and Soja oil.
Soja is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio says in matratzens, which consists of their kernel of pure natural origin of materials", says Peter Vašíček from the company Tropico Plus.
However, natural substances are also used for the manufacture of matratrics - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
However, you can also give microcapsules that extend fry forest or lavendelduft when sleeping.
There's also a difference between husband and wife.
While the men are used a "from" plant extractor from birds, so that the matrix dissolve the warmth and can coal the body, the environments for women have "warmed" effects.
Extracts from red papricachotes rain the blood circle, the weak sex is so warm at sleep.
And today's favorites?
Matrats from the cold show (he has larger porns with destroyed cell structure and therefore is more active than commercial polyyurethan and also much more flexible).
The combination of the various skins (hart) of cold shoes and visco shoes consists of multi-zone matrixes that know exactly where the head is, half and brake.
However, for a high-quality matrix, we have to consult 7000 krones and more.
However, health ratings are generally lower taxes, as they apply as medical aid.
As the first Czech company, Gumotex was shared in this advantage.
You're seeing to shoot the matratze and the red is not so easy.
There are special offers of manufacturers and handlers offering two matrats for the price of one.
Thus the Marke Magniflex offers the matratze duofree with a relatively hidden Visco-shaum memory for 11.990 CZK.
The second will be obtained free of it.
It was the material temperature that led the era of the viscoelastic sculptures with open cell structure and high density in close cosmic time.
No wonder, they've been developed for NASA, because the astronauts have been performed at the start of large overloads.
Temperatural smells in heat, in quiet medium, it will be firmed again.
So it is perfect to the human body and is optimumly distributing the body pressure.
It is therefore not just ideal for preventing printing burden but generally increases sleeping comfort.
Viskoelastic grains are not only used for matrats, but also for other health products, such as special footpools, which should facilitate the skin and the grain.
Inland manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More parents want human supervision devices to have controlled children
The fear of own children grows, and so more parents are increasing to supervise them by GPS.
The system, originally established for cars, may also provide good people, which would also be helpful in such cases, as soon as in the unexpected loss of the nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is now almost as large as a cigarette chair, but it should not be more than a weapons sacrifice.
Many people have the case of the lost Anička fear and fear, so they keep up in means and ways to protect their children better.
In addition, for the price of an impairment of its privacy.
"We're trying to tell everyone that there's nothing to be a shock-spion, but a effective means to reduce the probability that it comes to tragedy," Peter Pilin from Macro Weil, one of the providers of GPS control devices on the Czech market.
"I'm able to make it possible, in particular, to misuse such devices, for example, if you stole it to someone, without he knows it, but we had no case before now."
"The majority of customers really purchase it from security reasons", adds Pilin.
His opinion, however, should always know what purpose the child serves and how to use it in the emergency case.
The child psychologist Dana Bočková notes, however, that a child, if it doesn't take such a thing, simply finished it.
"As a very small child shows great creativeness when it is to lose certain things indeed if they don't want to be controlled."
"When the phones started with the parents' expectations, but they let themselves get off as easy as these new monitoring devices," says Mrs. Bočková.
Your view is also struggle if such a establishment is actually helping in the case of a attack.
"Before planned discovery, the kidnapper controls practically whether the child has any electronics with which it could be ordered."
"This is the phone today."
"If such monitoring devices are more widely used, they would also search for this because their sale would be safely accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases the police's offenders are always a step forward," the psychologists say.
However, it appears that similar devices can be helpful through a padophile by means of a slow attack.
According to the company RC Monitoring, the location services are offered for cars, as well as for persons, the existence of a device may also be helped if it will be destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device, in fact, can be set so that it reports the position in certain interactions."
"If it would soon be destroyed, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"It is even integrated by a swimming meal, which means if you go and stay without movement, the device immediately sends a warning under the position," states Mr śech.
His view of similar services could also perform intelligent mobile phones with navigation, just playing a special software.
The problem of the current location devices is that there are machines in Streichholzjackel largers, dividing the attachers or smaller phones.
There's always a threat to lose them.
Mr Pilin, according to the Macro Weil, is therefore tested in the present devices that look like normal digits.
"This has benefited that the possible angryer must not even recognise that it is a supervisory or a positioning device.
"or he notices that only after a certain time, what the police has a time prediction", he adds.
Equally, in which direction the development is going towards armed countries or attendants, the same technology is always used as the vehicle system.
So for the combination of location functions using the GPS system (such as Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many snacks that you can turn into Czech all over you can keep only two years
The Czech Army has purchased 445 miles [445 km] Czech Army, with springs.
In the past year, the Defence Minister had already been delivered to the army guards by 224 km.
It is quiet to know that the forces have been employed for 225 years.
The problem is only the duty of the snares - two, but at least four years.
The army purchased the thirty-shirt of the sharehold company STV Group, s.g. for light 40 million chrones.
In its foundation for the purchase of this huge amount of trial, the Generals Tab MF DNES answered that soldiers would consume annually to the 60 kilometers of Dutch.
According to the research of armee Pyrotechnicians, MF DNES, this indicates that the whole army must complete an extremely intense pyrotechnical training every year - from all generics and officials of the army command, to the secrets and puzzles.
Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Armee General Vlastimil Picek are not excluded.
Only so was the considerable annual consumption of sixty-kilometers of twenty-first kidneys justified.
This length also corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But this would also be rich for more than ten years.
But if the old rule of experts applies that every new professional soldiers is sufficient to train two meters of twenty-five feet, then the army has created the new purchase - also under the view of the increased needs of the pioneer and special units - a quick for the years mentioned 225.
As a result, soldiers of the rapid invasion responsibilities were slowly estimated to the Minister of Defence of Vondra, they almost had no patterns for handfire weapons, so that the missing funds were strongly limited.
It's a very sweet smell.
"I don't even know why they're buying such unfair sweethearts from us."
But this is finally their decision, they will already know what they need."
"For us, the army is a good customer that we want to come as a handler most widely", says the STV Group Jan Dæckī.
Jan Pejšek, speaker of the Ministry of Defence, is based on the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of Sundschnur, so that the army had been covered at least for ten years with this "munition".
However, Jan Dæcký by the STV Group only speaks for a four-year-old use period of the sweet and police and army pyrotechnicians for only two years.
"It is likely to be the four years mentioned in perfect situation", one of them, but who wants to remain angry to be respected as soldiers not to the criticism of the army.
After the duration of the use, any munition must be tested greenly whether it is still reliable and not threatening the life of soldiers.
But these tests are not anywhere, but cost more money.
Another argument of the Defence Minister is the quantitative rabatt for the 445 km Cündschnur.
"He costed us sixty percent less than the last year delivery of 244 km," Spracher Pejšek shares the position of the buyers of the defence minister.
Only compared: Annual consumption of pyrotechnicians of the police, lifting munitions from the Second World War or the Soviet Brothers Army has been over a few years.
And the police always orders the amounts of this munition that it can consume before the time of use.
With the safety of the pyrotechnicians, the possibility of flexibility to purchase more modernly and therefore reliable skins are open.
The Defence Minister has no major problems in the liquidation of ten thousands of mushrooms from the Warschauer Treaty when the twenty-third-first Czechoslovakia People's Army prepared on their field towards Rhein.
According to the pyrotechnicians, who spoke to MF DNES, the Czechian forces expected in a few years the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of miles of old kidneys that they have purchased so "favourable".
To date, the contacts I have won thanks to the competition
The segrete location in the competition "Climbler of the Year" has helped Lukáš Pytloun to sell his hotels in the sale of Franchise.
The winner of the last year of the competition "Clean businessers of the year" was Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The history of his success is like a film scenario.
Lukáš Pytloun is pleased to travel.
First in the foreign, he was conscious of the lack of aware prices in Liberec.
From the expenses of his vacation work in the foreign area and with a bank credit he built a building house with five apartments.
Remember that he was a high school student at the sixth seminar, this was certainly a courageous undertaking.
"The ancient price-quality relationship was angry and so I tried to do something instead," says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first rebuilding apartment was prevented from foreign workers.
The whole wine, he immediately invested back to the house, which then turned up step to the pension with 54 beds.
Sither was to open him in only seven years of entrepreneurship in Liberec four pensions, two quiet restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was the four-star hotel "Pitloun Design Hotel".
In this year, another first-class hotel was added.
"We have signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tési, which we sold our Franchise Concept and other interests at the Franchise of the Pytloun hotels have already been reported", says the entrepreneur number one of the last year.
"A great part of this license sale of hotels had just been the winning in the competitive "Englishers of the year", adds Mr. Pytloun with appreciation.
The victory has made him more advertising and popularity in Liberec and environment.
"The people recognized me on the street, often grateful to me even afternoon and I have to say that it was good," he recalled.
I really recommend everyone who wants to make something to participate in this competition.
You don't need to win equally, every view is good.
He says that he has benefited from contacts and advertising to whom otherwise wouldn't come.
"I have maintained regular business relations until today, if some people I have taken thanks to the competition."
The success-related band also suggests that some of its employees are understood.
And there he's seventy.
"I note with them more loyalty and pride that they are part of something to share the general recognition."
I also see this not only as personal success, no, this is the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name is just cut into the front," Lukáš Pytloun says to decide.
My followers would like a year more calm than we had it in Farmet
The Siegeseuphory was quickly dissolved from the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his goal, Farmet has the worst behind.
The price for the first part of the Vodafone company in the past year, Karel śarský, has taken the company's farmers.
The Jury then acknowledged the efforts he made a company from the small tool construction in śeská Skalice, which makes hundreds of millions of arrangements.
"I can say that this estimation is not only me myself, but also encourages all my employees and has strengthened our self-consciousness in fighting with competition," said the previous year winner.
At the beginning of the farm stories, the efforts were to do something useful.
And when the State of his father Karel śarský as a compensation for the ownership of the communists called, he did not long, he left his carriage in the company where he was up to it, and founded with a few cameras his father's own company to produce plastic waves.
Shortly later, they began to concentrate on plant oil pressures.
In the course of 18 years, they have led to the largest manufacturer of automatic prices throughout the Mediterranean.
But just through the success of the competitive and its medialization, it is also aware of the non-faculty.
"Don't just that our customers now make the Marke Farmet more intensive, but our foreign partners also began to cooperate with a company that has made the greatest success possible in their country", says Karel śarský.
However, the winned year was not only in the sign of the Siege Seauphory.
The estimation was decreased by the economic results of the company in 2008 and one part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the hardest year for sale of toolbuilding products.
The crisis, which still less citizens, but especially protected enterprises, just reached their higher point - many companies were able to set up their investment projects and to restrict the sale of new institutions and technologies.
"We couldn't, of course, get out of this situation."
"The arrangements returned to 40%, we had to limit the production and even to discharges," says Karel śarskí.
A living enterprises must also take such unpopular action.
However, it began to get the situation into the griff and to keep the company in the black numbers, even with lower wines than before the crisis.
In one case, the company was not intended to make stricts - in investments in research and development.
"We built a research and training centre in the subcommittee, we increased our presentation on international measuring and gained main prices in domestic exhibitions," says śarský.
Everything proves that we've surprised the crisis.
The channels are again grown and also the number of new employees.
"The new victory I want much joy in the victory - but in a quiet atmosphere," lets Karel śarský.
A question of opinion which is subject to unreasonable rules
The question of the "absurdness of the year" is the fourth part of the entrepreneur's competitive competitive.
Some unfair rules have already been to create out of the world.
To the doubtful winners of the next year of the "Abusiveness of the year" question, the obligation to create documents on authorities available online.
In this way, more than one third of four thousand employees have decided.
So the Social Insurance Management requested a paper exit from the trade register, even if the officer had been able to call him through two clicks.
Thanks to the view question, this will be changed now.
"The Czechese Social Insurance Management shall in the future do not demand any extractions from the trade registry for the control of social insurance payments."
In the sense and purpose of the view question "Absurdness of the year" it is to take all the rules and arrangements under the legs, to comply with entrepreneurs in Czech and to adhere to the unseen.
In this year, this is already fourth part of an entrepreneur's competitive competitive, which is organized by the Tsch. economic period (HN) and has been satisfied in the public's growing popularity.
If three thousand people participated in the vote last year, it was already four thousand in this year.
No wonder, since there is still a lot of legal obligations to serve only and alone to defeat the business.
"When the number of income tax forms, for example, we're taking a front ring in the world," notes Karel Havlíček from the association of smaller and medium-sized enterprises and competitors of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurship is the proclamed goal of all governments in recent years.
In comparison with the world, however, the situation in Czech was unlikely improved.
According to the World Bank's information, Czech Republic is taking the 74th ring in terms of business conditions, comparing with the previous year, one to eight more worse places.
The competitiveness of the year was the first time in the year, and each year, after the same scenario, has been played.
Each man may report from April to the drafting of the competition to the end of September administrative and bureaucratic intelligence.
In order to register, the website address is available at www.firmaroku.cz. afterward, the competitor of seven applicants for the "anntial price", and the public will vote on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdat and www.ihned.cz.
It seems to be the absurdness that comes to most of the voices.
For this year, more than hundreds of views have been reported, as exactly said 105 without rules and arrangements.
The tips are not only employees, but also professional organizations and journalists.
For example, under the named "finalists" of the competition, there are provisions that the maintenance vehicles for cars and fast roads have to be paid or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toiles every two years have to be presented.
The register of the "seven" this year is published on the sides of the competition.
The calling of competition at the Prayer of Wensel is part of a hapening which regularly participates in the personalities of political and public life.
In this year, for example, Eva Svobodova, the Director of the Association of Small or Mediterranean Employees and Traders of the Ts. Republic and Petr Kučel, the President of the Czech Republic's Trade Chamber at the level of competition with the Party.
"When the State acts with the entrepreneurs, it cannot give a real economic relief, so it is my goal to add at least thirty paragraphs each year, which are still unnecessary to the employees,," Martin Kokurek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
The efforts to create innocent orders from the world demonstrate effects.
In 2007, most of the employees imposed the obligation to report the contractor on the location of their permanent operational site three days before they intended to go to an exhibition or an exhibition.
This obligation was deleted by a new provision law.
The obligation to obtain the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the obligation to report to the Service Office of Employees for up to 30 days - was deleted by the law on them. "Green card".
And - all good things are three:
For the absurdness of 2009, the Regulation was chosen to have physiotherapeutes a sculpture, a cold jar and two persons' weapons in the talk room.
This Regulation has been mixed by the Ministry of Health in a few minutes this year - the refrigeratorship disappeared.
A new category accepts socially responsible firms
Evaluation criteria are projects of humanitarian, environmental, education or sport
A fifth year of the economic period competition (HN) is the category "responsibility company of 2010".
Thanks to this competition, it is to promote skilled and fair entrepreneurships.
"We want to support such companies that are aware of the consequences of your entrepreneurship activities and support socially responsible initiatives", says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the Mobilfunk Company, the exploder and guarantee of this competition, as well as the "rebell of the year".
For the first year of this special subcategory of the main competition of Vodafon Company, companies reported that success is not the only long-term goal.
The history of each of them is extremely inspired and bad enough substance for a self-defect article.
Although they are different from the subject of their activities, their efforts have, however, a common numbering support and consideration.
This is, for example, a person who has been engaged in personal problems or the health of the own employees.
Between the fourty finalists of the whole Czech Republic, for example, the Prager Software Company Et Netera, which promotes the development of non-formal sport teams among its employees, which then participate in numerous tours in various sports.
Another example of the most responsible company in the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, who is the main sponsor of a foundation fund for children already seventy years ago.
A paper manufacture from Podōbrady is also careful for their healthy employees who are 70% of their involvement, for which it has been accepted by the title "Related Conscious Company of the Mediterranean Bombs"; in the Vodafone Company of the year, it was the third Rang in the framework of this region.
In the Olomouc region, the booking company MiRyz Soft, which involved a flighting and also a average of 35 hours per week, and that was not relatively rewarded.
The Jury also honored the title of the company to buy in Czech manufacturers, support citizens' initiatives in their environment and works according to environmental principles.
"We strive to recycling as far as possible to keep the consequences of our entrepreneurship and the management for the environment as far as possible," states her business leader Miluše Ryznarova.
The IT Enterprises who are responsible is login from the region Ústi Nad Labem is again located in the health of its employees and therefore has created them to all the notebooks Ergonomic Sessels and Keyboards, and also promotes it in their employee work and uses cartering services that are offered by a private workplace.
"We also support the Foundation "Man in Not", which provides concrete assistance to the Roman Community", says Ondśej Search, representative of the company.
Not lastly, the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištční" in the region is also assessed by the activity of their employees in the form of extra bounds to their pension insurance.
"We provide our employee's contributions to manufacture, workway, to increase their qualification and vacation," said Josef Strapáč from the Czasch company from Bruntal, the winner in the Märish-Sthesia region.
To the category of the responsibilities company of the year, all sector financers of the Vodafon Company of the year were automatically registered, responding to the questions of the questionnaire provided for the registration, and sent him to the event until 15 August.
False or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation.
"When the representatives of the law enforced the questions, they were excluded by the competitive "responsibilities company of the year", the main Vodafone company of the year was therefore not disqualificated."
"A separate registration is not possible only to this competition, since it is only a subcategory of the main competitive company of the year", says Karel Goldman from the evented Agence Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Land Funds - Police arrests at a public registration
In the building of the soil Fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police was presented in the last few days.
In this way, the huge media entrepreneurs and real estate leader Luboš G. was deleted by the detectives in hands.
This had used to manipulate a precise public competition for the implementation of restitution rules so that the foundations offered in the competition would be a concrete interested person.
This is why Luboš G. has paid a half million.
"To this time, I can only confirm that the police follows a person because of the crime of dominant power in a public competition", said Antonie Zelená, the chief of the Pillner State Authority of the Journal "Pravo," could not provide further details on the current investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old employee was returned from the police.
In order to handle the public competition, it is only possible to spectify in view of the customs official information.
The speaker of the Land Fund Lubomír śerná addressed the question of Pravo, the police had actually taken prisons in the Pillner side of the Earth Fund, and it was during a public competition.
"It was about a customer and took place for one of our employees," she explained.
The public competition had, according to Ms. Šerná, the correct name "Officiation for Provision of Privileges for Transmission of Basements in accordance with the ground law" and would be in cases where several applicants were interested in the foundation.
"They provide a higher value in the context of the request, as a result of the transmission of the restitution requirements to be compared to the basic value."
"In accordance with the offered claims the result of the potential purchaser is determined, then the ground fund shall transfer the base to the person with the highest offer," the speaker of the Fund explains.
Luboš G. apparently had been available to information who had been registered on the invitation and since he himself was a qualified person, as he had purchased a number of constitutional laws, he asked a basic interest in returning from the competition.
Obviously against a fat absorption.
This would also be sufficient to explain why he had a large amount of money in his conclusion.
Luboš G. had too good contacts with the Pillner Earth Funds in the past.
In this way, he also played a role in the cause of the former Head of the Land Fund Václav Sankota, which was prosecuted in criminal law, because he had been replaced by foundations for which position decisions were already taken on building projects.
Thus, Luboš G. from the soil Fund, for example, also found foundations intended for the construction of public roads, exactly said where the construction of the carriage Magazine was planned to the Borskeé pole.
Later he took this very favorable with the magistrates against a house directly in the historical center of the city, which exceeded the value of the bases.
The Council's House had to give a serious heart to a small heart to avoid the construction project by blocking the baselines.
The housing costs of the household increased in some hundred monthly
The budgets must not only receive higher costs for all types of energy, but also with higher water and waste expenditures and for television and some places.
Familys will have to take hundreds of chrones monthly more from the portemony than ever since January.
Electricity is up to 4,6% torrs, gas on 2% and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supply, and some places also deserve the heat.
Only electricity costs the accommodation budgets annually some hundreds more chrones.
The Starkstrom journey was reduced by all the main suppliers, therefore the debt is the significant promotion of the production of electricity from renewable sources, notably from photovoltacene.
Gas is only slow, but this is exactly when most people need to heat and have the highest consumption.
So here is also to be counted with some hundred chrones per year.
While electricity and gas are more costing in the whole Czech Republic, the prices for television from city to city are different.
In particular, larger places planned price increases.
For example, the households in Pardubice and Hradec Kralové are to pay more monthly to 50 krones, more than 1000 krones per year in Liberec.
The population of Praga again threatens 9% higher water and waste expenditure, and this is the case that the city increases the infrastructure.
If the currency is not changed, it is only 6.8%.
However, the price in Prague is compared to the total Czech Republic also continues to be the lower.
In the northern tree where the prices are now the highest, water and waste costs are to increase 7,4%.
For example, large prices are expected in 140,000 accommodations, with a decline in the period from January.
For example, the Apartment of CPI Byty, which has 2500 Labem apartments in Ustí, plants to increase the midst from January to hundred percent.
Who does not agree with this increase, the company wants to be legally interested.
The regular wages that are still paying in about 300,000 apartments today will increase over 10 percent in the next year.
Czech children drink with TV and Rum Beer is out - it works just too late
Fernet, Rum and Wodka, closely a good wisky that you stole the father from the house bar.
These are the drinks that have to be treated as most frequent after the Genuss of Czechic adolescents.
No exceptions are children who have to sleep their cards again in the hospital.
This results from the experiences of doctors faced with similar cases in the inclusion of clinical departments.
"Ber or wine are completely out of the mode, because it's just too long until it's broken."
"The current trend is clearly a hard alcohol," Pravo Ludśk Pelikán said, the Chief of the Chief of the Child Division in the Mediterranean Clinic Hośovice.
"Whisky, if it is possible to use the father a flat from the home bar, and if not, at least television or Wodka.
"Woodka has the advantage of smiling him with the juice, then he doesn't smile so strong," said the Chefarzt.
The speaker of the Hospital Hospital Motol Eva Jurinova is right to him.
"The most commonly it's about television or rum."
"This is the today's alcohol tension, in particular at basic schools."
"It was also about Slibowitz, which you take from home to home," Mrs. Jurinova acknowledged.
According to Chefarzt Pelikán, 30-year-old trinkers in the hospital is no exception for a long time.
Before the clinic in Hośovice, in which he worked since this year, he was working for ten years in the hospital service of Motol, where the cars of rescue were shocked from Naa and TV.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"Your career began with 12 years of age when they first had 3.5 promills of alcohol in blood, and still were presented in combination with "extase", the doctor described a special serious case.
"He was at the exhibition in Holešovice on a dance party."
"The interesting thing was that her mother wasn't rare that her daughter had not come home 48 hours," the Chefarzt surprised.
If the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance with their own prostitutes applies as one of the main causes for the growing alcoholism of children.
For a real dependence in the true sense of the word, experts do not follow children.
"Unter alcoholism is a long-year chronic dependence of the alcohol and understanding all related phenomena and this is not the case with these children."
Repeating alcohol is a negative family-social background,” says Chefarzt Pelikán.
The speaker of the Hospital Motol, Mrs Jurinová, was placed up to mid November for about 40 kids to the high department for children and adolescents.
However, only the cases with serious alcohol injury that needed a hospital residence are going to the statistics.
Not registered children who are sent home after an ambulance treatment by parents or, where appropriate, from the police.
In addition to the cases in which children have only a slight snaps in the school bank, Mr. Pelikán believed that there are three years-time diploms on which hundreds of children are left: Walpurgucht night, Silvester and the end of the school year.
"The last named for two reasons - or from sweetness because of the bad witness or of joy on the holidays."
"I've already experienced seven kids in the shopping night," stressed Dr. Pelikán.
A struck child, who shrinks the night under medical supervision, is paradoxically better than a child who has to fight only with a slow castle on the next day.
The head pain in the morning, which produces dehydration and glucose injury, can be removed in the hospital with a flexibility infusion with glucosy and nutrients that lack the body.
"It's clearly better, because after the "good" experience on the night, they're going up with a good laundry, without anything hurting."
"He's just aware of where they are," Dr. Pelikán says, "which gives the patients at least the good laundry, telling them the costs she costs the treatment.
Because the transport with the saving car and the night comes well and pleased to a few thousand krones.
"I used this as a educational instrument, when I had just calculated the children at the visits what had costed their throne identity and that it can happen, that she will once have to work on the whole feasts to get the money for a single feast," added Dr. Pelikán.
However, the hospital cases do not apply to regulatory procedures in order to require the costs necessary for the raising of children.
2 training flights L-159 first in foreign hand - in Spain
Two slight fighters L-159 from a total of five twenty-third defence defence ministers against the Casa C-295M are fled in the Spanish city Sevilla, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS seizes.
It's the first time that machines of this guy have a foreign army.
In the foreign area, they were only seen in manners or flight shows.
This is the fluctuable two-seat version L-159T1, which was employed by the Czech Army.
The remaining three flights are L-159.
These are still stored in the Aero Vodochody, the Commissary of this business - the company Omnipol - has taken her overnight week.
When they are physically shipping the flights from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek is not known according to the speaker of the Ministry of Defence.
The united fighter L-159 was re-excepted from long-term-related aircraft, without any other installations and investments from the Department's resort.
"The double L-159T1 was exhibited in the current condition and appearance," said Pejšek of the Pravo newspaper.
He added that the army would not be issued without two-sided fighting devices, as the Defence Minister signed in May 2009 with Aero Vodochody a 200-million treaty on the reconstruction of four overflowd L-159 to the second version.
A new aircraft took the army in July, which second wants to take her to the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS was obliged to implement the fighting instruments into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"The treaty has been clear and clearly indicated that the EADS company is operators of the flights L-159 and that they should serve for pilots of the NATO countries.
"It is, therefore, the lawyer's way he realizes the thing", leaded Pejšek.
The economic period (HN) had above all reported that the Spanish government had no interest in L-159.
The shipping of five L-159 against a Casa transport flight and the purchase of additional aircraft for 3.5 billion chrones were yet authorized by the Government of Mirac Topolánek last year.
The Defence Ministry had then not explained any registration procedure for the purchase, but EADS immediately agreed.
The current Defence Unit argued that it will be supported for the future export of L-159 to the Foreign.
The Czech Army purchased Aero 72 machines, from which she was used only 24, the rest wanted to proclaim her.
The purchase of the flights of Casa should, however, have another legal impact.
The European Commission declared the Czech Republic of Defence, in particular the European Court of Justice, that is why the aircraft had to be chosen because of a full European registration and to be communicated by a single manufacturer.
The army has already got three flights of Casa, the last is going to be on the Kbely airport within fourty days.
A longer shower than ring finger means a lower risk to cure cancer
Mans whose fingers are longer than the ring fingers are obviously exposed to a low risk of illness to prostat cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on midday by British Journal of Cancer.
Indeed, this should be associated with the sphere of the men's hormone testosteron.
"One results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostatatic drugs, and this is not only among men to sixty," the employer of the study, Ross Eeles, professor of the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help to determine what men should unlike a prostatatic reef test, especially if genetic risks or other risk factors exist, such as family health charges, accompanied Ms. Eeles.
During the 1994-2009 period, she followed with her colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with prostatatic drugs, but at the same time 3000 healthy men.
In more than half of the participants of the study, the shower of the right hand was slower than the ring finger.
For these men the same probability of prostatatic reabs, as for 19% of those who were ring and swimming fingers were the same long.
However, the risk of men whose finger was longer than the ring finger was 33%, with men up to sixty percent up to 87%.
The relationship of the two fingers mentioned already in the prenatal age reflects obviously the different spheres of gender hormones which the child was expressed in the natural mother.
Any test staron corresponds to a longer shower.
Previous research shows that the test star slows the growth of prostatatic rains.
Václav Pačes, leader of Czechian genetics and former President of the Scientific Academy, said that it was well known to him, but he had not been the relationship between the finger length and the cancer risk for "government".
Czech in the snow - D1 and D5
Like the largest part of Europe, Czechs are also on Thursday mornings.
On the streets and roads, the winter serviceers were many places all night on the axis.
The D5 cars between km 89 and 90 in direction of Rozvadov is cut by some accidents of Lkws and Pkws and also the D1 at Brno in direction Prague "its".
This said Novinky.CZ of the Dispatcher of the Central Auto-Moto Club (UAMK).
At km 91, a LKW lacked two Lkws together, there are lost in this accident.
A few pkws are also located in the streetscreen.
There are also problems at 185 km from the D1 cars in direction Prague.
There are also two Lkws together.
The drivers should walk back to Brno at 190 kilometers or walk through Brno and start at 182 kilometers from Kıvalka.
In fact, there is a mile-term stage.
The D11 also occurred an accident and this is equal to the train to Prague.
In Praga itself, there are a few centimeters of sneeze and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees of Celsius.
Auto-collections, for example, are located in the city of Prose, and also the street Štrboholská is fully hidden.
The safeest transport is the metro at any time.
The road trains walk with late, for example, on the line between Karls and Peaceplace.
To 8:00 a.m., the Prayer's Crisis Tab will be together.
There are also problems in the rail and on the airport.
The Czech State Statistics had to cancel seven speed-related connections because of swimming pools.
There are problems, for example, on the route Prague - Kingupy or even Praga - Beroun.
The travellers should notify themselves of the current situation.
The Ruzynō airport is closed from midnight at 5:00 p.m.
The majority of the roads in Southern Sea are available only with increased care.
For Vyškov, three sideways are completely unplaced, in the area of Brno, they are generally swimming snakes and in the area of Blansko, they have been obliged to put snakes on some higher roads.
One of the most relevant areas is Vøškov.
There are still three streets fully hidden: Russianov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also šaratice - Milešovice.
This is also the need to be used to swimming snakes here.
When they can be relocated, it cannot be estimated until now.
In the Hodonian region, the white cards are careful.
On the roads which can be settled from natural protection only with inerte strikes, one to five centimeters of swimming sneedecke has led to swimming snake.
In Czechs, two to ten centimeters of neighborhood, most of which in the north of the trees, slowly up to 18 centimeters.
In the Mediterranean and the Swedish region, up to 15 centimeters new neighborhood.
But in Czech it sounds slowly shut up.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapons".
American troops have first used a new "intelligent" weapons in Afghan, known only under their code name XM-25.
Generics hope that this new automatic weapons affects the therein conflict with the Taliban and moves the forces' relationship to their favors.
The new weapon is something like a super-good canon.
Indeed, their projectiles will be carried out by laser with a strike safety of only a few meters.
The special shoes of caliber 25 mm, developed for this weapon and contains high explosive sprays, operate practically as small granates.
The shoes can be programmed so that they can not only explose their balistic flights on the basis of the objective, but on a favorable point of view.
This means that you can use it against a enemy who hides behind a hinderance - a wall or in the shooting grain.
Of the above, it is usually not protected, so that the murderous steel sprays of the above can easily put it out of sight.
According to Richard Audett, who participated in the development of the XM-25, the new fighter is the first infantry weapons that makes use of "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier is understood as a result: he sees the goal and sends a laser rail that determines the removal, so he wins a precise view point after it corrects the increased wind, then he only needs to put out.
"If we say you measured 543 m."
"When you push, the weapons are shooted up and shoot the shooting on the removal of 543 meters plus one, two or three meters away.
400 jobs are moved
The Fujitsu Concern leaves his departure in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July the following year, 400 employees will have their workplace from the previous office building at the Marienbader place in Bad Homburg in the Astro Park.
The Japanese concern Fujitsu leaves his license in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As on the computer and its maintenance specialized sectors on the midday afternoon, 400 women and men will provide their workplace from the previous office building at the marine bathroom in Bad Homburg in the Astro Park, which is a large office complex on the Lyoner Street in the Frankfurt city of Niederrad.
A speaker of Fujitsu explained, a medium-term speaker should also be carried out to 100 additional jobs of the concert that have been distributed to the region until now.
The Mietangebot was extremely attractive, and the large space offices also improved the work of the employee's work.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only a Mieter.
The competent business manager Bernd Wagner said, "We found a central location with an excellent infrastructure with Frankfurt-Nederrad."
The excellent connection to the airport is just for a global company as Fujitsu of great importance.
The new exchange of an important company within the region was pleasant last night with the winners and disappointment of losers.
Frankfurt Economist Deputy Markus Frank (CDU) said to be winned a Global Player.
It's a great position recognition.
Fujitsu passes to the city, the seat is an important impulse for the Niederrad.
The Bad Homburger Observer Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The city is soon informed by the business leadership about the purpose.
"We have also offered our help to the company", said Korwisi.
However, friendly contacts couldn't change the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the employer of the real estate at the marine bader place.
Finally, economic reasons had been given to the explanation.
Now go on to prevent a long space on such a prominent place.
"I hope the owners and employees of the building are cooperative."
The house used by Fujitsu until now in the house of the Council and the nearby "Small vertical" were belonging to the other buildings at the marine bathroom place ten years ago to the nearest building projects of the city.
As a common project of the city and a private project developer between the Bahnhof and the Council House, a new part of the city was established, which was both because of the massive construction of the areas used before it was a parking and the height of the buildings for criticism.
2001, the installation advisory and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel transport systems, the Amadeus Start, as well as the computer manufacturer of Fujitsu associated with Siemens.
The building used by Fujitsu was purchased by the Frankfurt German Real Estate Group, together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund, and has continued to sell a year later to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu Concorders in Tokyo are the third largest IT supplier of the world.
He prepares businesses for example computer and servers and provides the necessary service.
The lowest leasing in the Rhein-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, so much more employed is Fujitsu in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the daughter company sets up Fujitsu Technology Solutions in Frankfurt-Niderrad, the other daughter companies are to be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, the office building of Astro Park was mixed 7000 squaremeters.
In the twenty-year-old complex, the name plays on its ultimate basic risk - has its seat among other parts of the central electronic and electronic industry.
Amazon sperm server - Drugs against Assange
Wikileaks devices are growing in the circle.
The Amazon Internet server has banned the integration platform from its servers.
It may be between political pressures after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomates.
Wikileaks-Green Assange can be held in England.
The Wikileaks integration platform is increasingly in the United States.
Internet activities lost access to their current American server and now search for a Internet hite in Europe.
The prominent American Senator Joe любrman called in other countries and enterprises to Wikileaks' boykott.
And Wikileaks-Green Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's professional lists, must be held after a newspaper report in England.
"Whileaks of Amazon server disrupted."
"Free speech in the country of the Free", the enthusiasm activists by short news service have shared Twitter on midnight (Original time).
Shortly before, the Internet company Amazon was banned the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists had returned to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) during the publication of the secret diplomatic depths in order to enable the high access numbers to the documents.
By Twitter Wikileaks continued to declare: "Prima - our dollars will now be issued to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon had such a problem with the freedom of speaking, "If they should stop to sell books."
Amazon has stopped the use of his server by Wikileaks after the employees of Senator Joe любrman had established investigations, the television CNN reported on the office of Amorman.
The President of the Senate Committee for Home Protection had threatened Amazon with a Boykott, reported the British "Guardian".
"I would like to wish Amazon that this measure was previously taken in view of the previous publications classified by Wikileaks," said the Senator.
In this respect, loverman called for the platform also in other countries to use servers.
"Whileaks' illicit, unrelated and unconscious action puts our national security on a game and threatens around the global life," says a communication of the participating senator.
"No responsibility firms - or American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in its efforts to extend steel material."
Wikileaks-Green Assange, which is searched for injury by the authorities in Sweden, is on the list of Interpol's expertise.
After a report of the London newspaper "The Independent" the 39-year-old Australians in Britain is known as the exact place is Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always called the investigation in Sweden as an intrigue of his enemy.
Wikileaks speaker Christin Hrafnson said in London, he gave threats.
"There was even called after a murder of Julian Assange."
Therefore, Assange feared his security, said Hrafnsson.
The Wikileaks green will therefore be hidden further.
Hrafnsson obviously reacted on statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican Governeur of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had requested the Wikileaks' endorsement responsible for the Wikileaks.
In Canada, a Governing Chief Stephen Harper said - obviously Iranian - in the television, Assange should be "mored" and Obama could use "a droid".
Between the white house and Assange burned a slagabetausch.
The speaker of the American President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "laugh and absurd" that Assange had requested the return of the minister of Foreign Affairs Hillary Clinton if it is responsible for recently known sponage disorders.
"I'm not really sure why we're looking for the opinion of a man with a website," says Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and interests in this country are much more important than its website."
The American Government now protects its databases in full on the test.
As Special Officer, the Vice Director of the Centre for Anti-Terror Measures, Russell Travers, was appointed to share the White House.
Travers is responsible to develop "needful structure reforms" that have become necessary after the release of the message reports by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to check the way the whole government exchanges and protects the information.
In addition, the American Government announced to want to ensure the security of dissidents and assets, they should be in danger by the Wikileaks publication.
"We've taken everything to contact them," said the Foreign Officer Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
Ice University
The "Gelato University" at Bologna will be prepared for better annual years.
The three-day basis course for future Gelatieri has the greatest start and visitors from the world.
Where is the entire ice really coming?
From Gelatier and Gelataio.
The galleryer, in German some age of the iron conditor, has the creme in accordance with all the rules of the Italian ironic art.
The Gelataio takes the glasscreme from the fridge, strikes it into the weapon and then sell it.
In order to know this, you must not go after the Anzola of Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever else wants to know more about Eis, who did not come to the "Glato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The university has established the manufacturer of iron machines in 2003 to ensure that it is justified by its machines all the high Italian ideals.
The three-day basis course for future Gelatieri has the greatest start and visitors from the world.
However, there are also several-day special courses around chocolate and practical practices in the hidden iron diet.
Some dream in the Midlife Crisis of a new carriage, others simply driving on the glass of their white shoes.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents from Brazil through Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an artist from California, loves the Slow Food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the industry of Ice-Cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business advisor and wants to make something own in a nervous job after years.
Two young Egyptians dream about opening a iron dial in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil wants to improve the quality of the ironcreme in their bars - and the Canadian household Julia comes, because their children love Italian Eiscreme.
Maestro Relator Luciano Ferrari declares the participants first the ideal properties of the perfect glasscreme.
Decisive is not only a good smell, but also the zealousness and the good conscience.
Luciano is not forgotten by his training, but it is not the shock of the national and Southern conversion: "Itlandic Gelato is just the best - and then it is still all the many Romantic."
The first step to production seems very simple.
Luciano kipps the basic milk, skin, milk powder, sugar and stabilitators in a large mixed device, which produces everything on 85 degrees, and then coals on four degrees immediately.
Then he turns a hair on the machine, and it appears to a pastorized white base, based on all the milk species.
Soon the dozent is triggered with questions: Can iron creating only with natural substances without stabilisator?
How can you let your own experimental loss free?
Luciano warns to leave the age of time into the Irish.
Those who speak "only of natural ingredients", however, have used stabilityers - mostly a natural product, about a grain of meat from the garbage.
Of course, iron can also be produced without stabilisator, only then it must be sold within one day, otherwise sack it together, and the customer is slowly ice wheels.
Several variations to the basic mass are allowed.
It's more swimming with the aroms.
For the smell in the iron, Maestro Luciano differs between the additives that are buyed in the fruit department or in the beauty of the supermarket.
There are powders and pastees.
"The delivery will all try to turn you twenty aromatised supplements."
"You should simply try."
or at the fruit or soft bed with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or at the ice cream from the white basic mass that becomes with eggs to yellow cream and with cacaopulver based on all possible shocklade practices.
Now the participants may be able to go on the iron machines.
Luciano can create four different types of Vanille, Schokolade, Mocca and Haselnuss eat - with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanillaroma or other natural additives.
Similar experiences will also be subjected to the fruit species.
More aromatic materials, more fruit-proof - it is not uncertainly better.
Haselnuss eis does not smell any more useful if it contains more haeles.
The most popular Kiwi-Eis offers the working group that uses more fruits, less water and little less stabilizer.
At first, a balanced mixed has shown the shape of a gelato correctly, says Luciano.
Egg production is a accounting point: use of Pfirsich swimming powder with a lot of sugar, the sugar rate must be reduced in the basic receptor.
For Zitronenis, an extra proportion of sugar is needed.
Luciano is a device with which he determines the content of the fruit species (winzer puts the oaks in the midst of the oak).
For a lucky time, the computers are easy.
Make eggs no longer requires so much physical use as previously.
Not only the device for the automatic manufacture of the basic mass is helped.
There is also a device where the fertile ice mixing is shocked simultaneously and coaled at minimum temperatures.
All automatization to the desire remains small painters.
The Brazilian Gustavo holds its courses from the top to the bottom with fruits when he has the superdimensional stabmixer out of control.
"In every course," Maestro Luciano says, " it's just a question of time until that happens."
Control colors in the light
The European Food Authority Efsa has been undertaken by the industry experimenting with plants.
This project is now the expert group of Testbiotech, which is an independent Institute for the evaluation of the biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiration theory, but we have well documented it," said the Chef of Testbiotech Christoph Then on midnight in Munchen.
The leader of the Efsa expert group for people's changed plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa experts have been under contract for years.
It is paid by concerts such as monsanto, nest or Bayer.
Kuiper has worked mainly on the Efsa test rules for plant plants, and it is a clear conflict of interest, critical.
The Ephsa Rules are, in addition, with the scopes of the Ilsi, and therefore, the documentation of the industry to be controlled by the authorities in the Italian parma.
It is already the second time that Testbiotech agrees to a colleague of interest.
So if a high-ranging Efsa manager has recently been without stocks or transitional time to Swiss agricultural concentrations – and has changed the pages.
The Middle German Rundfunk (MDR) also had recently enthusiasmed EU controllers and industrial lobby-related connections, which has also made the environmental links as well as EU parliamentaryers.
The Efsa cannot, however, recognise conflicts of interest.
There is a view to all the serial data, even those of the industry, while they are of high quality, which is in a opinion.
The experts working for Efsa are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But they should open this.
Kuiper enters his work in the United States for the International Life Science Institute (Ilsi).
This itself is a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and policy, including for biotechnological evaluation without a lobby contract.
In this case, independent experts, such as, criticize that humanly changed plants are now allowed without any feeding of animals and not tested the reaction of gene plants to environmental impacts.
"We want to know, for example, what makes humanly changed but on the acker," says then.
Current practice is to be only isolated protein, but not to test all the plants, which gives no perceived results.
"If you don't find the risks, how to find them?" asked the accused.
That looks like Angelica Hilbeck.
The scientists have been investigated in the genital technology since 1994 and are currently at the High Technology School of Zurich.
In this area, as in the United States, the industry is still increasingly trying to influence or discrete critical scientists.
For example, there are little researchers who have not been fled with concerns.
For enterprises, critical studies would not normally be published.
"The industry controls security research", says Hilbeck.
The stone scene
Uli Gsell was also concerned, in total about 400 kilometres.
On Monday he was formed Stuttgarter Station, the Tuba on the back.
It was Demo.
It's broken.
The story is known: In September the Baggers were pressed and began to stop a large part of the northern floor.
The Stutt garden world was no longer the same: ten thousands of demonstrates against S21, the milliards of depths of the train court.
When it arrived to the building, there was a majority of the flights in the clouds.
Search in 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Moschekalk, a weird large stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a swimming pool in East Fields, 43 years old.
He's got some of the brochures.
"These stones are reliquies."
"You can't disappear."
He warms: "Best and poor stone, simple and earthly."
When he pulled, he smokeed to smoke.
What he's going to do with the brooks, he doesn't know.
Stein has time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The slope of the stone stones leads to a forest in tubingen to a former municipality depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen created his stone kingdom.
The 44-year-old acts with old stones.
He's buying all that gets up at Abris in Stuttgart.
"It would be a damn that they would shoot in shotter or disappear in the depth," he said in his office, a wood bottle, which once was a shock.
He was struck and threatened to tell him when he was in the newspapers in September that he bought the rest of the northern flight from the abbreviator.
But he talked to the S-21 enemy for a long time.
And he told them that he couldn't do anything for the Abris now.
And if it happens once, it's the most slightest thing if the stone would continue.
About 200 S-21 enemies took one of the 80 kilograms of serious quarters, piece prices 6,50 to 14 euros.
As Andenken, however, some are hopeless to give him back in a reconstruction.
500 tonnes had been bought Rongen, 25 large Lkw loads.
Each half is still in the forest, the rest has been sold for a long time.
Garten owner, landscape farmer, hauil manufacturer.
From all parts they had come and had shooted what was able to carry out copper rooms and ambassadors.
The storm stone of the shooting has long transformed themselves into "muerle" or in limits of carboat prayers.
"In first, this stone is nothing special," Rongen says.
"It's not the political component."
He increases in his swimming car, makes a tour through his 20 hectares of great kingdom.
Jura studied and broken, later biology, then interested in computers, and eventually became stone shoppingers.
And stone lovers.
40000 tonnes of stone.
He's sweet together from all Germany.
He says he's the biggest stone chairman of the Republic.
He's breathing.
In the snow, the sandstones are sweetly sneaked.
"He belonged to the Dresdner Marien bridge," he said.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, heat.
"My favoritsstein."
It's the way up through the forest.
He shows on a ball: red sandstein, previous part of the Karlsruher train.
And go.
"Breat Travertin."
First of all, the quarters belonged to the tribune of the Stuttgart Neckar City.
Overall in the dark stone and stories, Cannponenten Travertin from the Stuttgarter Police Pressidium, Roman Granit from the Dom Sankt Blasien, Tuff of Heilbronner Hospital House.
What work, what the sweet.
If Rongen thinks of how the stones are previously shooted by hand and moved with simple flanks and oxen cards, he will be very honourable.
"It'd be a scandal if you'd be so crazy."
He hasn't become real, but the stone isn't anymore.
But 14 people are employing the stones today, also have left themselves up in the forest's stone méthod, a smied, a glass tree and a garden constructioner.
"We work hard, but it's satisfied," the rest valuer says.
First of all, he's gonna have to go to the kitchen.
There's also a stone to save.
Talent camps a high-potential
It's ruining rich Andrang on the buffet.
16 students swim over the laugh brown, tomate supper and sweet.
The Technical University Braunschweig and the Autobuilder Volkswagen have invited machine construction and design students to a workshop.
In a manner of ideas, they should learn with VW-developers on the car of the future – and with the people's cars.
In the strict way, many enterprises are in the shipping camp, such as VW, to cooperate with universities.
Your mission: The most engaged conclusions may soon be rerouted in the earmarks before they come to the job market and be converted by others.
And since universities do not give opinions on the performance of their students, the exceptional projects are tried to make up and binding themselves.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunway, the autoconcerns run around the talent.
A young dame from the Personal Division shares ball writers, gummi bars and folders with VW-Logo.
She tells the hopeless youths of practical programs and students jobs and shows their ways in the concerts.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig is the project with VW.
He looks at the benefits of both sides: "Studes are in contact with the industry and gather experiences."
"What can learn students at the same time, look closer to interested candidates, and see who are as employees in question."
Such cooperation, such as sell, are not inhabited.
It's new that it's so obvious for students.
"It was the main point on the practical project," says Selle.
The fight for the fresh degrees will probably be worse.
In many sectors, the companies cannot look for their employees from a great amount of candidates.
In particular, they need to approve, especially for high qualified workforces.
In particular, the technician discipliners are in an excellent negotiation position.
According to the German Engineering Association, VDI remained in October more than 40,000 engineering equipment.
And the so-called Engineering difficulty will, according to VDI prognoses, become even greater.
For the economic verification and consultation companies KPMG, Roman Dykta is on the Talentjagd.
It organizes an external recruitment events such as the KPMG Race, a modern type of snittzeljagd, where participants need to find their way through GPS coordinates.
Eight students want to send the company in the next year or by the United States.
Furthermore, the participants can look at KPMG fills and learn the company.
Who can with, decide in two selection rounds in the prefix.
Only the Crime of the Crime of many applicants fly in the United States.
The protection is increasing according to Dykta at the high potential at the universities in shoes and stakes around the high potentials.
"We want to get us out of the mass with the race."
"But a simple seal deceptive was too little."
It seems to be taken into account for the talenter Dykta.
"We have contact with all members of a similar action in the last year."
"Another one stands short before her closure and wants to be with us soon," he said.
In addition to the direct bull at the campus, especially small and medium-sized enterprises are also very classically at professional measurements.
"We tried to achieve experts."
"Etwa on the intersolar," reports Sitha Stöbe, staff leader at the Solar Technology manufacturer world.
The Bonner company is employed around 1500 employees in Germany.
The death knows about the problem of illness.
The company’s website is currently recorded 35 posts.
"It's just very hard to place vacant positions."
"This costs much time and money," she says.
Another way is the contact over the Uni Professionals.
Solar world cooperates with various high schools, around the university in Freeberg.
"Professionals indicate that you can do with us or write its diplomatic work."
Their advertising action has not been advised to solar specialists.
For this, the company tries to spend with other opportunities: personal atmosphere, flash hierarchy and light communication.
"This can't often offer a large concern," says the Personal Chief Suicide.
The money plays at the job search is no longer the main role.
Flexable worktimes, child care or good increase opportunities are further important factors.
The 55th place in a study of the Great Place to Work Institute was among the 100 best employees of Germany.
The Institute creates an annual best list of German employees.
This is how satisfying the employees are with their work and their job area and look at the framework conditions for employees.
Personal head of death is also expected from the placement points at the job requesters.
"I think that applicants are especially looking for external assessments about a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Warlers from the German Employer Branding Academy, who want to build a good call as employees with a long-term strategy.
He takes his customers more authenticity.
And that means, according to warriors, especially internal measures.
"The best way to be attractive as employee leads to the own employees," he says.
In the Branchen Yargon, the internal employee Branding is called, such as workmark training within its own involvement.
"Experiencing employees are the best messagers."
If you carefully handle his people and identify them with the company, they would be totally able to make them alone with friends and friends for their employees.
"This is like a game with bands," says the warler.
Obama stops new oil bottles
Before the Coast of the United States Florida in the Golf of Mexico, there will be no new oil boost in the coming years.
A corresponding prohibition has adopted the government to Washington, and so the previous plans are finally revoked.
Before the Atlantic Coast, new foods are first understood.
This shared the Minister of Internal Ken Salazar at midnight.
The explosion of the "Deepwater Horison" platform in April is to apply at least five years for the coming years.
Before the unfortunately that the 11 employees cost the life and leaded to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama reported his disposal to allow new burdens in the eastern part of the Golf of Mexico.
In order to reduce the dependence of the United States from oil supplies from the country.
The responsibilities for the promising oil in the Golf are not finally cleared until now.
The British Energy Concerns of the Critics Center, which is faced with billions of requirements, are in the centre of the criticism.
A survey committee at Obamas is intended to present its results during December.
In October, Ken Salazar, Minister of Internal Affairs, took the bohrstopp sent after the explosion.
At the end, various oil concentrations also requested for new bohr projects.
With enhanced controls and strict security rules, Obama and Salazar want to exclude a new disaster.
At present, the competent supervisory authority, which has been in charge by numerous corruption projects, is a basic reform.
Parallel has announced Obama to close lucrative tax drivers for oil and gas concentrations.
The industry is now publicly warned that the contributions in the Golf would be significantly lowered by a rigorous regulation.
"The Government's plans are the biggest burden for the growth of oil and gas industry", says the result of a current sector demand by the Advisory Company BDO, and before the midnight's ban.
The American Energy Alliance also claims the insecurity in the sector: "Nobody knows what will change with the regulation."
Investments in new support projects would be cut up to further - allowing growth.
Ogoniland has been burned
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it sounds like at the tank site: billions of liters of raw oil have destroyed the nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live from the steel, corruption and illegal oil cooks.
Celestine Akpobari means it's good.
"Don't stop," the ecoactiveist says the journalists: "You'll still get enough oil before the line."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has pursued the attempt to shut up a kid in water with the sleeves around him: In the rainy spring, the scene works almost well.
It is not to see that under the surface of the raw oil weight is bleeding.
Before she had soon gathered her here, Esther Badom reported on the Ufer of the Bodo-Jetty Flights.
In this respect, the flowing waters are perfect.
Five years ago, a shocked stroke of unmengen raw olive was shocked into the huge fat area.
Fishers from the neighborhood of Bodo must now swim six hours to get in fishing waters: Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Nigerdelta, applies to one of the most depressed regions of the world.
On the driving through the streamways, the whole level of the decline will be authorized.
Instead of lighting water, the motor boat blends bleeding blue brown, who smells his hand into the water, oil fingers out.
The roots of the mangroven trees were like black lacrist stains from the ground, and they would be sweetly able to swallow their wheel.
The warm birds, as they are normal in feed areas, are seen for forgiveness: When the outside borders shrink, it is wide in which the former Paradise that smells a tank place is excited.
"What happens here, is an environmental war management", says Celestine Akpobari window: "We live in permanent dangers for health."
The war comparison has been accompanied.
The area of the Ogoni is a decades of battle struggle: over 60 years ago the first operators from Europe have been organized here in the 1980s with the later executive Ken Saro-Wiwa of the first resistance, where the shell Congress had to set up its production because it was dangerous for its oil workers.
Even today, the company has been able to return to Ogoniland: while the entire Delta region of the Switzerland's three-fold size of over 5000 bohr sources and 7000 kilometers of rail lines are pumped more than two million phases of black gold, the oil fields in the Ogoniland are stable to the concert.
All hundreds of meters of steel places such as strange sculptures from the water: "Christ trees" are called too much the heads of the bowlers.
They're up to 50 years old, most of them corrupted to Mark.
Once again, a such bohr copper means Acpobari, then a constant raw olive flows into water.
More than two billion litres have been flewn after experts in 50 years in the Delta's ecosystem: each year the amount of oil, as they are at the Havarie of the Supertank "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the sea before Alaska, one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of humanity.
Who is responsible for the continued Eco-GAU, it will be combated.
During the shel-concern Sabotage and the organized oil dioxide are responsible for more than 90% of the pollution, you see environmentally protected swallowing bottles and pipelines as the main causer.
Shel is significantly lower safety standards in Nigeria than otherwise in the world, the US scientist Richard Steiner predicted the concert in 2008: only the rate of defects to leads is "in a variety of times higher than the other places".
In a place that looks like a leaved, oxided workplace under free heaven, the mangrove dimensions are cut off: they are splitternacked and swimmed up to the hals.
Under one of the many plants, which are able to be shocked on the floor, flats a fire: a illegal small snake.
In the fass, the oil is raised over the fire for a few hours, says Michael, head of the group.
First, benzine takes through the grain to the upper floor, then slows out at the end of the carosin leadership and finally theo.
Thus Michael and four employees daily up to four cases Cell to 300 liters: "This brings us 34,000 Naira" - around 22 dollars.
The Delta residents use the chronic carriage in the largest earthly oil state of Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one raffinery.
The low-level price with nearly 40 euro-center euros per litter can still provide the illegal shops: because their raw materials are obtained.
He is of "bunkers" who assault the pipelinetz by Ogoniland: In this way, experts are going to the country in the whole Nigerdelta every day lost at least 16 million litres of raw oil.
However, only a disappearing small part of the provisional between substances is divided illegally: the levine part is filled with organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranging militarys, in tank vessels and destroyed it on the world market.
The debate on whether the environmental disaster has been debt to the surroundings of the population or the laxen production method, the activist acpobari is fully académic.
"If the oil corporations did not take into lines and they wouldn't have destroyed the foundation of the fishermen so greenly, nor sabotage nor the steel and illegal raffineries."
In the meantime, the relationship of the Ogoni was particularly to Shell, but it was destroyed that only a disappearing of the concert is asked: "It is likely other nationalities than Chineses are better".
Michael's gonna be nervous.
"Better time you're gone," the muscle oil man says.
"All minute, the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil advertising is aware of the special unity of the forces of the forces, it is not an incarcerable arrest, but a painful payment.
The troops of the country's North also want to benefit from the raw material as all Nigerians.
"This sweet Zeug has brought our country into every point of view to the dogs", says Akpobari.
Factors discover dangerous construction errors in A380 trials
The A380 is obviously a great security problem.
Scientists have found a possible construction error in the investigation of a notified machine that could lead to a catastrophic triebwork disappearing.
The Qantas flight now wants to report to the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the notified Qantas Airbus starting November clearly had much more luck than ever known: the Australian air security authority has identified a great security problem in the triebwork of some A380 machines - and now warned a possible construction error.
The potential defect would have severe consequences: In the connection with oil smoke, he could produce injuries and leaks, he said, in an opinion published at this Thursday, by the ATSB Authority.
This could lead to "a catastrophical trieble defect".
These are manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 aircrafts of the A380 Royce.
The Qantas Airbus, which was required to notify on November 4 in Singapore.
The Australian aircraft has now introduced legal steps against the British Turbine Manufacturbine manufacturers.
She found a complaint on an Australian Federal Court in Sydney that could enable him to take further legal measures against the undertakings.
Qantas-Chef Alan Cœdès said that his aircraft will demand damage for the start of November.
When the motor was burned, parts were solved and damaged the traggle surfaces.
Rolls-Royce made a oil burn as a cause for the damage.
After the interim incident, the world must now be changing up to 40 trial works.
The Australian investigators announced that further security tests were carried out to the superjumbos equipped with the triebworks concerned.
The security recommendation is the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB speaker Martin Dolan.
The security problem is to be considered sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
Following the emergency of the Qantas machine, the aircraft had maintained its A380 flight over the ground.
Singapore Airlines left about three of its 11 A380 on the ground.
The air Hansa changed the trial work at A380 as a precaution measure.
The double flight is the largest passenger flight in the world.
Land-widespread swimming fall solved transport chaos from
Germany totally in white: Overnight nearly all the dark country.
In many streets, chaos, trains and flights fall down.
At car accidents, at least three people lived.
The winter frosts Germany: At heat temperatures, nearly the whole Republic has been accompanied on Thursday night - which leads many places to transport chaos.
In the north and eastern area, it is 15 centimeters of sneeding snakes.
On several cars and many roads, the transport is strongly limited.
In the A7 in Flensburg the winter service was in the durational rate, but it was not completed with the continuous new snee.
Moreover, heavy wicked trees were over the East Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Sea Shipping and Hydrography (BSH) expects to be the East Sea Coast Schleswig-Holstein from spring to storm fluids with water stations of 1,2 meters above normal status.
In Sachsen, sneakings were leading to significant problems on the cars and Federal Strategy.
According to the unveiled central meteomedia, the Swiss Swiss has been forced by the alarm rate - the highest level.
Some 30 centimeters of neighborhood, fresh and strong winds were sneaking for swimming.
There remained a few cars and cars in the night.
The police authorities also reported great disasters on the roads in Sachsen.
On the A2, snow and wind led to store transport and stage.
In thüringen, the A4 and A9 were affected by the dark accidents.
According to German Bahn, there are significant disasters in Sachsen, Sachsen Content, Thüringen and North Bayerns.
Sneak on the swimming trees, rounded trees on the shoes or destroyed overlays and wheels are the main problems.
In Sachsen the television was to be established from Leipzig to Nürnberg.
In the Thüring Valley, a ICE had to stop his journey to Munchen.
The 165 passengers were supplied by fire helmets and savings with cottons, food and drinks in the train.
Snake winds sneaked over the streets.
On large German airports, the snow winds lead to numerous aircrafts.
In Munchen, a speaker of the airport centre has already been reported some annullations.
In Frankfurt in Main, a fraport speaker already has 40 flights.
The winter service is in duration.
Despite just a few surrounded passengers at the airport, however, they are still ready for 400 field beds.
In many streets there was already accidents at midnight.
On the evening, a Lkw-fabric came with a train on a train crossing in Eastholstein.
The local leader was easily hurted.
Near Nürnberg’s neighbouring roads came to a similar accident: there was also a car on a train crossing because the vehicle was stolen.
The driver came to life.
In the train, four passengers were damaged - the route from Bayreuth to Nürnberg was then cut up until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after her car on a glad street at Aghiburg.
However, a good news has meteorologists: even though the snow will still be sweet and pull and therefore swimming with light evils.
But the wind will be cut off.
Only the East Sea is shocked by rapid and shocking winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to at least 15 degrees.
German banks are looking for a buyer for their swimming towers
The German Bank wants to split himself on their own marks: According to a newspaper report, buyers are looking for the money house for the two office tours at their Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to 500 million euros could take the real estate.
The German Bank has just made its concert in the Frankfurt Banks tours have been modernized and the bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial center is obviously wanting to renew the costs of renewal and seeks a buyer for the two homes, such as the "Finity Times Germany" writes on a speaker.
For the planned sale, the speaker did not call the speaker.
"We always check whether it is more sensitive to have or sell real estate itself and then return", he said.
As a result, the largest credit institution of Germany has already been decreasing its company after a short time.
The bank had taken the double tower for the average 2007 for 272 million euros from the employees of a counterparty fund and then healed.
The energy restructuring was around 200 million euros.
A sale would likely bring a lot of money to the bank.
Branchen experts estimate the value of the channels of the newspapers in the "Green Towers" around 500 million euros.
Whether the building is re-employed to a fund in the ownership of the bank, or to an independent investor, which is still open, said the speaker.
Thousands betray a whole partner
More than 10,000 people thought in New Zealand of the painted mountains that were declared after several explosions in a mine.
The body could still not be hidden because the safety position in the unfortunate was still precarious.
Just two weeks ago in Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth, there was a strong explosion.
29 mountain workers in age between 17 and 62 years were murdered under days.
A summer was allowed in the unfortunate chair, but no scene of survivors had found.
Because of the high concentration of gift gas and the following explosions, no relief forces could be decreased because of security reasons.
After the second heavy detonation, the authorities and experts found that there was no chance of survival for the couple.
The bodys could not be hidden up until now.
Now the family and friends remembered with a memory feast to the dead.
100,000 people had gathered together in Greymouth in the neighborhood of the neighborhood.
Two minutes long, they smile.
To the honour of the struck hills, there were 29 tents on which the hells, lamps and the names of the companions were to see.
Images and personal objects, including clothes and surfboards, found their place here.
Before the government buildings of the country, the flags were half-made.
New Zealand hoped that the mountains would be "of the depths of the earth" back to the surface, said the Neuvian Minister John Key to the members of the guard.
"For they've never come home."
He could not end with the death of his son until he saw his body, Lawrey Drew, whose son Zen was protected in the crowd.
A number of foreign diplomates, together with the Minister and the members of the victims, took part in the garden.
At the first explosion, on November 19, the British and South African mountains were also protected.
Saving workers began to remove a fire within the coal area on the south of New Zealand.
Once the explosive gas is slow, it will begin to recover the heavy temperatures within the mines, President Gary Knowles said to journalists.
Fuck, warrors!
Does Splatter pass to art kino?
The Governor Nicolas Winding Refn is a new exhibition with his battle epos "Walhalla Rising" old Genre greens.
What public did the Danish government Nicolas Winding Refn have thought when he turned "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Wikinger kitchen with only one eye (Mads Mickels) frees from his pinners and spends with closely overwhelming power with his enemy - slips ideal for young men's viewers on the search of blue action, just because our herd is pleased to sleep rabbid murder methods and his enemy is already slept from the living body when he has a bad laune.
On the other hand, the inauguration of how it actually is called, the whole movie for no word, and the other figures make up at least one or two seconds or a few qualified death shoes.
On the other hand, it is shocked and shocked in the slightly beautiful mountainland of Skotlands, which offers the wicked world from about thousand years ago.
Ideal better for adult cineastes with interest in existingism and very quiet camera drivers.
Beautiful when a movie has several target groups, it hurt only when it excludes each other.
Regior Winding Refn applies to "Pusher" as a Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and shocked drug dealer trilogue, but it refuses to make its works with a little more humor on the Mainstream or a little less brutality available to the arthouse.
Most artist-kino friends would have to decline from the nearly splitting brain mass and the warm.
The action fans died in the past late time when an unsuccess of free interpretable reasons with a troop of violent Christian missionaries through the ship to Jerusalem and sets an eternity in fleet and nebel, before the manship comes obviously in America and continues to swim there.
So there is no wonder that "Walhalla Rising" in Germany hasn't found a kino delivery and now appeared only on DVD.
This is especially because of the pretty pictures, but also because it hides a slight piece of kino, which has given a little attention.
In this film it's not about dialogue or a stringing behavior, it's all the atmosphere, a filmed fiber traum.
And there is no reward for the observers.
Refn slowly shoots him a moment of disappointment and smells him with his sweet images and the dark trance-training sound trance trance tray slowly, but especially with the unfavourable hair that shoes him from the hearts of the figures.
Only a small boy, who is faithful to the side, keeps something like an innocence, all others will be tried by anger.
In the majority of the evil heroes, whose motivation will never be declared, but who will ever be for enemy and interim associations to warrants from hell, where possible to the messager of the Devil itself.
It means disaster, but maybe only for those who are without abuses.
"Walhalla Rising" is a ridicule film that you can hate and admire, for gorgeous, shocks and surprises.
A experience.
Rathing landworks
The Atomenergy Authority IAEA has new indications on a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
However, the country is aware of taking this position - still allows it to control.
On midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighting buildings have a mysterious, swimming building in Syria.
It is located on the east of the Euphrat; the next largest city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
His name is in documents of the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) when it goes to the reactor, Syria has usedly built aid from North Korea in the Quader, hidden in a ball that depends on the electricity.
According to a letter from the US-Aussie Secret Service, at the end of April 2008, the reactor also would have been able to produce Plutonium - from which the nuclear weapons were built.
However, for the other purposes, the technicians are few of the fifty.
The CIA led a video presentation with our satellite images.
By computer animation, she identified which components of the reactor should have been before the destruction, which was a smaller copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon Atom Center.
She also presented photos that showed the building from the nearby or even the internal room.
The reactor had been short before the infringement, called it, but not yet was equipped with fuel.
Today, more than three years after the bomb, there is little more known than that time, and the race became more than the time.
The former US President George W. Bush recently entusiasmed the fact that the CIA was right before the attack that Syria built a reactor in el-Kibar, but little intent points saw that it had been a "active nuclear weapons programme" in the country.
Some secret services in Europe are more careful and are talking about only a "acceptable reactor", even if they hold the CIA representation for "plasible".
You miss hard evidence, as well as IAEA.
As far as he was sure to have a reactor before himself, a high UN diplomat in the summer only was the lapidar that IAEA had "some material to ask questions".
The smooth of the "unuthored military buildings" created the Syrians a sacred side and planned the floor.
However, in June 2008, a IAEA team was found under the former spectacle Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar Spuren of Uran, which was produced by people.
Furthermore, the IAEA has received a Member State with satellite images of commercial offerers from the time directly after the attack that would be more powerful than the CIA presented.
However, these income will not be obtained in the market because the unknown contractors - perhaps Israel - have purchased them exclusively.
The IAEA may therefore not verify its reality independence.
Syria has always claimed to never employ a secret nuclear programme or to have built a reactor.
The Uran stands from Israel’s weapons, declared Damascus.
But this showed the IAEA after the analysis of the particules as inconsistent.
Sither refuses Damascus to discuss about it - as well as about the satellite images.
In addition, controllers have a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the clusters of the destroyed building.
But the Israelites also smile.
"We will never comment this," reaffirmed recently the official position at the time of the attack, Primer Ehud Olmert.
Thus, the investigation of the case has been carried out since June 2008 and "develops a serious credibility problem for the Authority" as a high Western diplomat at the side of the IAEA in Wien, which is finally a serious violation of the nuclear weapons treaty in the area where the IAEA is expected.
As a key to progress in the declaration, the IAEA is apparently seeing three other institutions that should be "in functional connection" with the mutatisk reactor - and other than that still exist.
The inspectors have not yet opened for which facilities it is, nor what function they have or what they may appear suspicious.
According to the information of the Southern newspaper, they will be called at the IAEA internal Marj asultans, Masyaf and Iscandariayaah, which are retreated from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified this place and made a satellite image complex in Masyaf, where it is most likely to be one of the suspected objects.
It may be located in or directly next to a military basepoint - exactly with this foundation, Syrians of IAEA give access to the three places.
In Vienna, the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA will be sent by the United States to shoot the military stocks.
Because the nuclear detectives were noted by a tip of the US secret services on the institutions.
The IAEA has indications, including satellite photos, which were carried and transported between the three places and the fourth part of the Euphrat material.
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said, at least one of the facilities could be "related to fuel production".
However, it provides "no instructions on sensitive activities", namely Uraning or Reprocessing; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is employed with uran that is not sufficient.
However, where the Uran should come and where the plutonium for the bomb should be removed, there are, in all cases, joyful confusions.
It is also unexpected whether the throats that could be mounted valuable springs were shocked on the three places.
If the hundreds of cars lost from the ground, nobody wants to have information about where the shooting remained.
The IAEA is inconsistent that the 1998 syrien has studied the salzmine al-Tibni, located on the other side of the Euphrat.
The former IAEA Inspector Robert Kelley had recently linked her to an analysis of satellite images for the named Magazine Jane's intellectual review.
However, receptions from the orbit show that Syria had previously worked on the three suspected land and removed large containers after requesting access to the IAEA.
This may be a accident, but has not contributed to examining the suspect.
Furthermore, the IAEA has used a few months to develop an inspection plan there, which should allow Syria to realize any military secrets - only to show how great the interest of the inspectors is.
Indeed, Damascus also decreed this proposal.
Had western diplomates in Vienna already a year ago, the reactor has already destroyed, so the matter has not had a high emergency, some US-Botschafters Glyn Davies has brought a couple of months in the game of special inspections, one of the most powerful resources that the Wiener Atom authority has to control.
The IAEA Chief Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already been deceived by "a option for which I am open in the future."
There is a high risk in this way: for one, there is a majority in the IAEA Governing Council, and some of the 35 countries there are all other than the sculpture.
For others, how a diplomat is to remember, "What is if they find nothing at the end?
Love in War times
Since Angelina Jolie began with the work of her still unnamed Regiedbüt in summer, there is a misleading.
The Drehbook itself wrote a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a serbia man.
Many of you don't know about this, but that's enough for disappointment.
Hartneckig, the wedding, a muslim, was in love during the Yugoslavia kitchen in her Serbian manager.
Bosnic women's organizations have immediately protested, where some of the Drugs planned in Sarajevo were shortly entered to Hungary.
In the meantime, the film is turned into Hungary and in post production, but it is still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic, from the organization of Women's War Opposite, wrote about the UNHCR Refugee Help work at Jolie and requested a meeting with the shooters, has now reported a bosnical newspaper - Jolie is the own United Refugees Helpman.
Diplomatically is not - she has offered the women a meeting in Hungary a few weeks ago, but they dismissed.
The meeting should be held in Bosnia, so Hasecic.
Love stories in assault camps did not give it, and the situation of Jolie's victims with regard to the victims sufficely depends on the drought book.
Your organization recommended the United Nations Refugee Helping Work to leave Jolie as a Meetingster, reports the Guardian.
What exactly has Jolie written for scenes?
The Bosnic Cultural Ministry, which has received her Drug Book, has issued a driving authorisation for Sarajevo – it is not very clear why Jolie did not come then.
The juvenile itself claims that it does not consequent political intentions with her movie, has made a lot of efforts in the Yugoslavian conflict, which would show the horrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all of the parties.
However, in content, she remains low.
As a result, a second synopsis for the movie on the network, which then sounds very different: the loved ones were able to find it before the war slaughter and meet again when they, a bosnical muslim, are buried in a serbian camp where he works as guard.
What, however, seems significantly different than the variant "the victims of assault sees in a folter night."
That the Jolie's movie actually begins before the war - so safe.
The pressure on them, so Jolie, is "unfair and based on missing information".
Now you can only create Hollywood's Hackers of Peace: when they set the driving book, as soon as possible, illegally into the network.
Nothing like away here.
On this evening, it's finally round again for the Iranians.
There's no squad of skilledness.
For this, the home team has a lot of guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
The fans jokes for joy in sweet music, they smile with the feet.

Because bad perspectives at home two of Tanners have already been looking for their happiness in the foreign.

The kids go: As with the tanners it looks on the island in many families.
100,000 Iran will probably leave the country in the next time, said experts of the Economic and Social Research Institute ESRI in Dublin.
To 2015, they even recall with 200,000 immigrants.
For the small country with only 4,5 million inhabitants a strong loss.
Conserving the prognoses, it comes to an emigration environment comparable to those under Ireland in the twenty-first years.
After a decade of the resurrection that brought great well-being with Iran, it is now again wide.
The economic crisis insures mainly the young, well-educated Iranians, for which it was only mounted up until now.

As it feels to build something else, Sean O'Donovan knows for a half years.
Because it did nothing to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on the construction in Germany.
They're just taking a model house in the Gelenkirchen.
In January, the next project continues to Hannover or Berlin.
His home looks rare in here only because he makes extras to pay the credit for his home home.
"The situation is a bit crazy," he says when he first goes to the level of his home after a long time.
"I save money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I am so good as ever."
He smile something and goes through cold rooms.
The small house is located in a pleasant accommodation with buried preserves, in the invasions parked large, sweet cars.
With a sister, O'Donovan has purchased the house for the four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent credited.
"It were crazy times, there was simply money without many questions," he said.
Did he be afraid that it could be shipped with the credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a time, sweet thee after and says, "I have no children I need to eat and I am youth; even if everything runs, I can start from new."
The engineer may not hear the shooting that he is now often listening.
"No one must hungry - but our situation is not so dramatic as in previous times on the island," he says.
"Every time to work in the foreign, that's not the worst thing can happen - maybe we feel just as Iran."
He laughed and then told his father who went to England in the last large economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life went to Ireland, very simple."

He's afraid it could be in a living party.
"Don't be too many emotions," he says and drinks a great shock of his beer.
"With, it sounds awesome."
"Let's better call it a trip party, very locker, with a few friends, a couple of drinks, a few games."
The Democratic Routine
Democracy movement in Latin America will increase, as well as supporting private enterprises.
Criminality is a greater problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil’s influence is greater than the United States.
These results were the Latin barobarometer survey, which was carried out and published in 18 countries in The Economist.
This survey is regularly implemented since 1995 and shows the exchange of opinions in this region.
Two facts fall in this year's survey from September and October.
First of all, the good stimulation in Latin America
and secondly the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions.
In many countries, the South America Pacific Coast has increased the democratic movement (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy increased by 2002 by about 6%, the number of democracies increased from 40% in 2005 to 61% in this year.
In Mexico, where the economy has come back from the strong invasion last year, it is to recognise such trends.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populated countries of the region, are convinced democrats, which are the regional average (see Diagram 2).
Ca. 44% of the respondents declared that they were satisfied with their country's democratic practice, which are so much than last year, but 25% more than 2001 (diagram 3).
About 34% trusted in the convention of their country and 45% of their government, and both values correspond to those of the last year, but a significant increase in 2003 (17% or 24%).
The Lateiname Risk has been underground by the efforts to increase democracy for a decade ago.
This is likely that during the world's economic crisis, the Lateiname Rikas countries have experienced only a short recession phase and have re-ejected rapidly.
Furthermore, the poor were taken through a stronger social network.
(In 2009, reports of the UN Federation Commission for Latin America increased the poverty rate in Latin America only low and in this year has been recovered to 32 per cent.)
However, from country to country there are strong differences (see Diagram 4).
Brazilian strong economy and the popularity of the separate President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva reflected in a wide progress.
In Mexico and the Mediterranean, where the reception was stronger and has increased violence crimes, this is less the case.
The second time since the beginning of the survey, many inquiries in Latin America in their country see a greater problem than in unemployment (see Diagram 5).
Ca. 31% say that in the past year the victim of a crime has been victim of themselves or a family member, but 38% over the last year have been cut and thus reached the lower stand since 1995.
The increased economic performance reflects the increased support of the private and market economy: about 71% of the applicants overregionally found that the private economy for development is essential, in 2007 there was 56% (see Diagram 6).
Ca. 58% explained that only market economy can make progress to their country is compared to 47% in the last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the questionnaires in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private economy), although their left President, Hugo Chávez, is a lot of private companies.
According to 19% of the questionnaires (18%) in the last year, Brazil has followed the largest weight in the region (9%, unchanged since the last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% in the last year).
Nevertheless, in Mexico and most of the countries in the United States, the most influential country in which this role will be taken in the Dominican Republic and the Nicaragua of Venezuela.
A chosen sleep
Nobody had expected that the elections would be perfect in Haiti on November 28.
But the facts overcome the fears of the election assisters who embraced the country to help.
Fulled election urges, several-fold votes, election appearances in the Rinstone, destroyed election locales and threats were only one of the problems.
The selection room opened with long-term late.
Many Haitians, whose many have become homeless in January, strive to search for a choice.
Some of them finally turned out.
A twenty-five president, including some sighter, requested the restraint of the results of the elections due to a reasonable fraud.
In the whole country, there were too little violent protests.
However, Edmond Mulet, Chief of the United Nations Mission in Haiti, called the choice "as well in many interests".
According to a careful statement of observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, "making these irregularities, so they may seriously be, the process is not necessarily invalid".
In other words, the show goes on.
The election authority, which is obliged to separate President René Preval and its candidate, Jude Celestin, is pronounced on 7 December.
The expected styling will be accompanied for January.
There is still hope in the choice.
The two leading opposition candidates, the Rap-Musicer Michel Martelly and the former Lady Mirlande Manigat, have taken their initial detention.
If Jude Celestin, who is only low or no approval in the elections, declares the election listeners to the winner of the seal, this could lead to problems.
As a result of cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of earthquake victims still live in cells, a few choices were feared.
In the election day, many Haitians were prevented by lack of organizations at the stage.
Shortly before the election begins, about 250,000 exhibitions were not distributed to the choice.
It's a lot on the game.
The donor countries consider a legitimate, recognised government as a key step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are the same opinion.
Home in Middle
In the weeks after the late death of your husband, Argentina President, Cristina Fernández, a wave of sympathy, which runs up to 20 points up to 50%. This is the highest value since its election in 2007.
However, if you help this in the next year to re-elect, the perceived Christianna Fernández is a compromiser than her murdered husband, her committee and political partner Nestor Kirchner.
The signs for that are not clear.
Nestor Kirchner, who also took the economic policy after the choice of his wife, often set out budget plans that did not take full consideration of tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the President's couple to issue extra income according to their own goods.
In the paper, the television government lost the majority in the Congress last year.
However, the opposition has been shared and Kirchner's death after a heart infarction on October 27 leaded to further confusions.
Some dominants from the series of dominant amanists were behind Cristina Fernández.
However, after chaotic meetings (which a parliamentary had a view to another and others interested the Government of the observation) the Congress did not have to adopt the budget for 2011.
"I will not discuss this," says the President.
The 2010 budget is now also applicable for the next year, with the opportunity of the President to pay money for its own benefits.
The economy runs warm: it will probably grow up to 9% in this year.
The official inflation rate, for example, is 11,1%, but many private estimates - and payment requirements of the workshops - take the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who was over the 2003 office, when Argentina was protected from economic crisis, explained growth and poverty against its main objectives and not inflation reduction.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, scanning the private sector, and renewed the National Institute for Statistics and People's Accounting INDEC, which enthusiasmed the official inflation statistics.
Can Telendez take a slower way now?
She has called the private industry and the director of work.
In accordance with official statements, loan increases should be limited to 18% in the next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong extent.
However, inflation understood growth in 2002 by a large devaluement in 2002.
Cristina Fernández is likely to return to the rest of the world for this reason.
In the beginning of this year, the Government has entered an agreement with value owners who had rejected the country's previous debt in 2001.
Now Fernández looks like to enter an agreement with the creditor from the Paris Club, which she debt about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners always rejected a review by the IMF, as normally other places.
However, in the last month, the Minister of Economy, Amado Boudu, announced that the fund will provide "technological support" in the establishment of a new national consumer price index, which seems to be the first step to pursue the INDICE.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active after the end of its office without support by her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the average weight, mostly enough for the Kirchnerism.
When the Argentina returns from their summer holiday in March, the waves of the symptoms that they have been taken will be displaced.
If she wants to win another choice, it must decide whether many political decisions of her husband are quiet and slow.
Small Applaus for China
Taiwan's elections are slowly closer to the fixed country.
What does Taiwan take from his big brother outside the sea?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million electors, which are 70% of all election authors, were made to choose citizens and citizens in the five districts of the city. This is a wide evaluation of President Ma Ying-jeou.
With the creation of business relations, including a participating free trade agreement, Ma itself is a symbol for the relations with the Fixland, and its policy has changing the relationship with the Chinese mother country as a first time since 1949.
But it's the test, but it's just right.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) set three of the five citizens, she did not have a voice.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), which is a major independence in Taiwan, has received almost 50% of the votes received by KMT 45%.
This would mean problems for a Presidency choice.
Since his election two years ago, the vote part of his party has fallen around 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even moved to the city road with the KMT.
During the election, it came to the common car convocation in Taiwan with Krawall Machers, Flaggen-flaggen massage trains and only typically awaited dancers.
There was even the obligatory, mysterious murder.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan and Chairman of the KMT, held a conversation on a KMT candidate at the end of the election,
When a man shooted in his face, a man was hurted and killed an overwhelming observer.
Weirdly, it is not clear whether the sweet links would kill or a war with the candidate.
Independence on this, the attack called Tsai Ingwen, the leader of the DPP, threatens the choice and cut the DVDP into a bad light, which has taken more voices.
Maybe China was the largest winner of the campaign.
It was not thematicized that the relations with the fixed country were not addressed.
Instead, the candidates discussed the plans for social housing and the creation of jobs.
Taiwan loves their faculty independence and causes Chinese military threats.
For this reason, KMT does not like to consider its relationship with the government in Peking.
But this time, however, also prevented the DPP to smell the anti-chinesic feelings too much.
She reacted to the new consciousness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
However, I would like to confirm that the majority of Taiwan is favorable to its Chinese policy.
The Government in Peking will continue to follow its strategy to turn Taiwan back with economic incentives to the Community.
China immediately sent an undertaking to Taipeh to prepare an Investment Safety and Medical Cooperation Meeting.
It will certainly also want political integration, but the most important is first.
It is better to wait until the Presidential election of 2012.
The PPP has been newly developed.
Two years ago, she was strongly shocked: the former party leader Chen Shui-Byrilla was because of corruption in prison.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he was deeply involved in the absolute independence.
However, under the Tajik government, a new generation of gentlemen politicians was developed, and the DPP fighted for the vows of professionals and youth.
Tsai was a president of the DPP, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Your party now does everything to show that it is also able to build close relationships with Peking.
Tsai plants an idea as a point of contact between the DPP and China. However, it provides predictable free discussions.
Tsai publicly declared that their party offered a "reliable alternative" as a premature approach to China.
Chen seems very depressed about this channel.
From his cell he explained that the candidates of the PPP would have done better to exist in Taiwan's independence.
He even requested the Pragmaticer Su to refuse the Presidency candidate.
Even without Chens mixing the DPP is hard to choose its possible candidates.
The KMT will be undertaken by its own self-analyse.
But values are bad, despite rapid economic growth; KMT candidates wanted to lead their election campaign without it.
The main reasons for his inaliency seem to be unemployment and the further strike between arm and reign.
According to the statement of a KMT speaker, it will be converted to its cabinet and the local facilities.
The strong occurrence of the DPP is that Taiwan is only limited to re-annumbering.
At the same time, the majority of Taiwan views economic cooperation with China inevitably.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent colonist, "is no longer return."
Grammy Names: Jazz's speaker Esperanza Spalding was surprising in the category Newcomer of the year
If you come to the request of a President, people will notify it.
President Obama himself requested Esperanza Spalding to take place in the ceremony on the Nobel Price Salve 2009. Now the 26-year-old Jazz-Basistin and Snakeman was overall appointed for this year's gramy in the Newcomer category of the year.
In view of the fact that Spalding since its album "Esperanza" 2008 is already a celebrated star in Jazz scene, the namement appears a little uncommon. However, it corresponds to the gramy rules that a artist before the publication of the album with which he was known in the wide publicity could have issued at least three albums.
His ambitious album from 2010, "Chamber Music Society" is certainly a step forward. And with its slightly voice and a good scene for pop, funk and Latin Music, Spalding can be compared calmly with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success as Jazz interpretin in this category of the namement Spaldings.
Moreover, the Vijay Iyer Trios album was named in the instrumentalalben category. This loved the critics experienced a rise.
The Concurrent Years includes "Moody 4B" of the experienced saxonist James Moody and "Positootly" of the Keyboarder John Beasley.

The Secret Societ of the wild stampank musician Darcy James Argue was well-known in the category of the Great Group. He is therefore attracted to the Billy Childs Ememble with his room jazz and the attractive Dave Holland and his Oktett, whose life ablam "Pathways" is a good example for a Basist as a Democratic Band leader.

Moscow in Temecula endorsing planning committee
The construction of a mosquito in Themecula found after a fifth announced public hearing often the unique adjustment of the local planning committee.
Criticals are expected to promote both terrorism and transport.
However, according to the Commission's statement on midnight, the new Religious Centre will comply with the local provisions and will be an aesthetic view.
"The project is supported by many good people - by Christians, Jews, Bahais and many others," explained Hadi Nael, Chairman of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"After the Americans, I'm proud of it."
"It shows that justice is ruling."
"There's just a few enemies," he added.
"It's just very nice."
"In this Tal live wonderful people."
The meeting began at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the centre were almost midnight, while the votes on both sides were much simultaneously distributed.
The debate was continued to be held on the site of the newspaper.
"There is no more America," said a comment.
"It's a other planet of the ass, and the state of freedom is dead in the sand."
"America's at the end."
In other parts of the country, the Islamic centres have also led to Protest, for example, near Ground Zero, the shooting of terrorist attacks to the city of New York on 11 September 2001.
In the Tempecula Valley, the priest Mahmoud Harmuush called for violence.
His community with about 135 families has lived peacefully in the Riverside County for years. However, they wished to be a larger and better place than the camp that they have measured together with a manufacturer for water filtering facilities.
The new, about 2.300 m2 large mosche in the Mediterranean style will have two minerals and will be higher than 13 m.
It will be located on the Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School at about 17500 m2.
The Cities Council is still able to engage in the project.
Arsen-resident microbs could allow new life forms on the earth or where otherwise
The discovery of a foreign bacteria, which can live by arsen, opens new opportunities for new forms of life on earth and otherwise.
Although scientists have discovered this inhabited bacterium here on the earth, their view is that a life is possible without the elements that have been observed as well.
"This organization has two possibilities."
"He needs to watch or phosphor or arsen."
"This makes something very special, although it is almost a 'free' life form", Paul C.W. Davies explained by the Arizona State University and Co-Auditor of the report that appears on Thursday in the online output of the magazine Science.
For now, six main elements were considered to be living - carbon, water, steel, sugar, phosphor and sweat.
But as the scientists find, the bacterium in the Californian Mono Lake continues to grow when it replaces phosphor by arsen.
"What you ask what else is possible?" said the co-actor of the report Ariel D. Anbar by the Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in searching for extraterrestrial life, as scientists need to recognise their forms, so canbar.
The study focuses on microbes found on the earth.
The advertising of a press conference where no details were announced on the discovery, Emphasis had been too widely speculations on the Internet that the report could act on the discovery of foreign life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "in other planet systems, organisms can be placed in Gang with other biochemical processes and that the 'Standardelements', which are absolutely necessary for our view, are not unprecedented", explained Charles Cockell, Professor at the Planetary and Space Science Research Institutes of Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a new, because it shows that biochemical processes and structures can be replaced by one another," added Cockell.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolf-Simon, from the NASA Astrobiological Institute, who led the study, chose the Mono Lake because of the high arsenological content.
Since the arsens and the phosphor are chemically equipped, she accepted that microbes that are both deleted could be replaced by the other.
"The ability of the arsens is primarily based on the fact that it is chemically similar to Phosphor."
"The organizations are difficult to distinguish a element from the other."
"But the difference is so large that arsen acts different than phosphor. It has been achieved in our biochemical system where it almost disappears everything," Anbar says.
The researchers put the GFAJ-1 bacterium to an increased arsen concentration.
The microbe grows better in Phosphor, but it can also survive in the arsens, shows that a arsen-based life form can naturally occur, or on the earth or on another planet or moon, more on the arsen.
According to Jamie S. Foster, dozentin for microbiology at the University of Florida, it is the idea that Phosphor can be replaced by arsen, not new. But until now there was no more functioning example.
Arsen came more often in the early earth years, she says, therefore, the science has resulted in that early life forms have used it.
"This is reason for accepting that life has also developed differently than in the early earthtime," says Forster, who was not members of Wolf-Simon's research team.
The research work was supported by the NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Only stolen exhibition dog found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs that were stolen before a bellflower motel, were found according to the statement of the Los Angeles County Sheriff on Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two activists and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - changed on Tuesday, as unknown to steal the 2006 Chevrolet Express Van, where the animals were taken before a flower motel 6 nights, so the authorities.
Two of the dogs were discovered on midday, and the last two nights at midnight, Steve Whitmore, a speaker of Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is: the dogs are good up," says Whitmore.
"They are in good condition."
"They were returned to their legal owner."
Whitmore did not make exact information about the home of the dogs yet to the circumstances leading to their discovery.
"The investigations are still walking."
"We don't want to say this again," says Whitmore.
"We follow a few springs."
The dog owner, Christina Rickard and David Peek, were not available on Thursday for the accommodation.
They took their two dogs on midday afternoon in a district house in Downey.
The representatives of the Sheriff found the delivery car and the two dogs in different places in Compton.
The Akatis - Trace, a 3-year-old route, and Didi, a 10-month old gangin, were injured.
But Corgis Bunny and Peter, Rickard and Peek wanted to present this week in the task of their Japanese owners on the competition, remained missing until midnight.
Peek and Rickard, who lived in Redding, attended this weekend because of the ACC/Ecanuba National Championship in Long Beach in the city because Trace should participate in competition.
As Peek the Times reported at midnight, the other dogs should participate in other competitions in the days before the ACC/Ecanuba show.
South California is a stop on the nearly unmonthful tour of the couple of dogs view to dogs view.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard were checking in the motel.
They are often overnight in motels and parking their delivery cars before their room windows.
They took three other dogs - a boxerwelve, a parson Russell Terrier and a British, with a motel room.
The swimming Asiat and Corgis remained in the delivery car, because it was clouder there.
They left the window open a spat, so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car on Tuesday at 6:00 a.m.
Peek promised everybody who could give a reference to the corgis a loan. The animals were planted to identify the microchips.
On Thursday, it was not clear if a loan was paid.
The leisure resumes again after legal approval of MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulences and insecurities, MGM has finally come to green light for a new start.
On Thursday, a New Year Competitor officially blessed the "prepared" crowd plan to spend $5 billion and the 86-year-old entrepreneurship company the way for new films and television shows.
According to the statements of Thursday, the plan meets the requirements of the US Concours Law, so that MGM's new starting under the leadership of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spiglass Entertainment, are not more in the way. Barber and Birnboum will be present to some special studio as a principal business manager.
The number of employees is calculated from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM Chapter 11 is actually in force only when JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned contribution of $500 million to finance the new MGM productions.
On the moment, a bank's consortium is involved by $75 million, the company, and the financing is to be at the midst of December.
The restructuring of the study began in May 2009 with the assignment to the Moelis & Co Investment Bank, the company's leadership that was struggled with interest payments of $300 million/year in solving their financial problems.
In August, the business manager Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO in Enron and restructuring experts known by his activities at Crispy Kreme Doughnuts.
The efforts of Moelis & Cooper to solve the financial systems of MGMs and pay more than 140 guests of the study were longer expected.
After monthly discussions, the parties decided to provide the purchase undertaking at the end of 2009.
But the auction was only a few biggers and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion requested by the believers.
In the spring of this year, the MGM team started with the restructuring plan, which was signed by the believers after monthly debates and internal conflicts in the end of October.
If MGM has been officially overcoming the competition in the next weeks, Moelis and Cooper receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share of Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, is $9.5 million.
Cooper, which has been paid monthly for the management of the company $375,000, receives a "hearningsbonus" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnboum planned to restore the production of MGM. In this year, the study only produced a film and created a year plan with seven or eight films that should come to the Kinos in the beginning of 2012.
They also plan two films after "The little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The study requires a separate share of $265 million to $275 million for its financial share in these two films that should be covered under the region of Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who has financed about 18% of MGM loans, tried a fusion of the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose biggest shareholder.
However, the last negotiations between the two enterprises did not result.
Tech Toys holds your gift budget in balance
This year favorite is the iPad, which may be followed by a Microsoft Kinect Video Console. Both players can spend a huge lounge in your gift budget.
A iPad costs as much as five BMX racings for $99, while the price for a kinect game is about 10 classic spring seats or about 48 dozen play doh.
But you can get your gift.
Recently, I visited the search for three electronic games under $80 three national players - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Walesale Club.
I was immediately clear that Moores's law had been in force. This year the technology games are more efficient and cost at the same time less than in the last year.
And although less new game tools appear with their own website, the most famous of this type, Webkinz and Club Penuin is a larger offer.
There are always more button-floor games on the market, and many contain reloadable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(If not otherwise specified, all prices of Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years of age) are painting pictures, such as sea-sweets that smell a note when you press on their bottle.
Once pressure corresponds to a note, you can play a song by several presss.
More Sing-a-ma-jigs songs in Harmonia.
Attention: If you have started with the press once, you can't stop.
For a combination of sent and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
On the basis of the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatoral puppe changing games such as 'Simon says', and thanks to the new shoes with radblocking it controls the Moon Wall.
Childs testing the device use Mickey as dance teacher. Your parents, however, estimate the lack of volume.
If you are a child of the 80s, remember Alphia, one of the first computerized learning tools.
Now he's back (Hasbro/Plays cool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole questionnaire card that can be able to get a car to a school hours, with a better water with auto correction function as teacher.
If you don't want to trust your smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo from VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the most suitable and useful solution, equipped with a qvaluey tastatur. However, the games contained are not as less than those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which is equipped with the Leapfrog first large revision of the Leapster stream with a new, lighter screen.
No versions are compatible with older cassettes.
iXL of Fisher Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) is used for games and eBooks a system similar iTunes, and thanks to the SD Card Cards can also be viewed by family photos.
Finally, there is still a scrabble Flash ($30 by Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are not greater than a slipper and have a LED screen.
The game is to join the blocks to words before the time comes off. It is great for an improvised booktable competition.
Always more players have a type of online connection.
If you go only after the offer, Webkinz and Club Penuin are the most important ones.
To give your child a online trip in the Penuin Club, for example, you can buy a Disney Club Penuin 2" Mix 'N Match Figuren package ($5 for children from 6 to 12), which contains a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child receives sufficient credits in the Club Penuin Store for two other parts.
This can be a roll shoes or a puffle shooter.
The latest head cell microboat, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is not greater than the head of your teeth.
The buyer moves rapidly on 12 vibrating silicon beverages in every right direction.
It's glad to send him out of shooting.
And he's a little out of it.
Our kitchen has fallen from the kitchen, and even some time in the mould of our dogs.
Police entities in China are safter
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin exclaimed on a city, checked his nervous signs, and gave it with military authority and struggling orders.
He wanted that his women members of the Chengguan - China's robust guards of the city order, feared and enthusiased for their desired races and huntings to violence - impress the observers.
"Grade stand!"
"Blick just out!"
"Show them," he frozen them, "what nice girls are!"
Four girls, little growing to the teenager old, with white hands and identical oil green jacks and hoses standed straight.
Four couple black pumps stand in right line.
Four ordinary gardens are perfectly swept on the sweet slaughtered hair with blue-wheeled clothes.
"If you see them average," Mr Tang notes.
"Models are nice."
several governments have already tried to put the image of Chinese city inspectors.
All new applicants have to have a high school ending in a city.
The province of Guangdong introduced a light blue unit instead of green.
Whan was replaced by the Netherlands's Sternes: 2009, 50 officials reported a non-regulated bicycle car, and shooted the operators until a half hour later and left the place.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to change the image fundamentally.
Since 2003, 13 women enhanced the city police teams, which were specially chosen because of their appearance, their good figure and their youth.
You're gonna give the crazy police a weakest, feminal aspect.
However, unfortunately, it would also be unlike to improve the bad image that the Chinese commanders of this city have.
Right, so the critics.
Unlike the police, these officers may only apply the city laws by means of bus payers or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media shows routinely another image.
In January 2008, the officers in Hubei province tried a observer to die when it filmed with his phone how she was protesting against a moulde.
In the past year, a training book was stolen and published on the Internet, which is described how criminals can be improved without blood injury.
In this year, a Shanghai water melon slaughter is carried out after a assembly of hands with five officials of the brain injuries.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows training employees in China at a attack on road drivers.
"Chengguan makes fear of the government," the National Journal of China Daily lamented last year, after further controversies regarding tactics.
The newspaper requested a "very green relief".
Skepticers are not sufficient to the present approach.
When the district searched for eight women's recruits in October, a editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether women had true tasks or should only serve as an optical decree.
Maybe both.
According to the age of 18 to 22, women were searched for a good figure and "harmonic face traces".
You should be over average - over 1,5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 dry.
The employment relationship ends with the achievements of the 26th life year.
According to the officials, women's activities are physically strict for more than 25.
"The most important thing is her image," gave an innocent district officer at the almost government website Rednet.com.
"In order to get the job, the candidates first depend on their external appearance, such as size, weight, face traces, etc. "
Then temperatures and "indoor qualitys" come.
"Women Chengguans are like flower vagina," he said and added, "but there are still other obligations."
Zheng Lihua, a supervisor leader of the district management, does not want to contribute to this description,
However, the fact that in China, the size conditions in placeholds for both sex are not inoffensive.
Similarly, it applies to equivalent visibility.
Whether this is equal to a good look, it is struggled in China.
But people with disabilities or physical detections do not need to be disappointed.
"We, unfortunately, cannot use lambs or bucklees here", says Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who patchs on the Baoguang plate near a closter, is 22, has apple bags and a well-formed mouth.
It is not like sexistic that the value of it is put on its appearance.
"I see in this uniform sexy?" she asked with ironical view.
Your colleague with the boys, the 21-year-old Xu Yang, comments: "We have the task to represent the image of the city."
As a result, they do not regret the short position because they had more ambitious carriage plans than simply dividing handlers through the gass to prevent them at the business machine.
Each morning, the strikes with about twelve road drivers, which are most likely to sell a lot of breasts and tofudirects before they are continued.
"Mr. Wang, please leave here."
"We have told you so often," explains Frl Xu a handler who had been flying on foot and then left him on a bicycle cart at the time.
According to the officers, the activity is more monotony than strict.
"It's almost the same day," says Huang Jing, 20 who study the free-time distribution facility.
All Routine.
One reason is that women officials do not have to concise the goods of handlers, such as their men's colleagues.
They can only threaten criminals to report their men.
This aims to protect public advertisements which are often exempt by officials in China.
In this year, hundreds of people of Kunming, the capital of the Province of Yunan, were killed by Chengguan officials.
More than a twenty-first police and Chinuan officials were injured at the night incident, 14 government vehicles were shocked or shooted.
Xindu remained deceptive of such violence until now.
But those who are disappointed are not excluded.
Only two blocks away from the calm Baonguang plate, where the women's employees patrolized this morning, gathered over 50 people at a road board.
The officers acknowledged a motor route which was reparated instead of repaying the provisions on the citizenship instead of a workplace.
The owner crys cryers and mordio.
After 15-minute dents, the officials were talking about the way to their vehicles and continued to drive with the motor route and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of man's stretch, remained back. He turned out his white name shield to remain anonym.
Like their colleagues, coordinators - men more than 40 - play a full supporting role.
But they were not forced to present a cleaner image.
" Sometimes we're going to be shocked."
"Atimes, however, physically", Mr Li uses.
"The most time people were taking the war."
State lawyer is not encrypted by Senator Ensign
Senator John Ensign freely speaked of the accused that, after his case with a former election assistant and his attempt to make a lobby activity against his husband, the lawyers of the Senator were known at midnight.
This Decision ends the most serious legal proposal against Senator Ensign, the Republic of Nevada. Before the scandal, which was careful for the country's slaughter lines and carried out his career as a possible candidate to the Republican President for 2012.
As Senator Ensigns' office was known, he was on the judgment after the annual investigation "highly happy".
However, the Senate's Ethics currency could also be a disciplinary punishment.
They were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations were established against Senator Ensign and that no further appeal in this case was presented.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to express himself in this case.
The judge was surprised for many Ethic lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. Your opinion was that there was sufficient evidence that Ensigned the Lobbying prohibition.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents opened first in October 2009 in New York Times showed that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his election assistants, helped lucrative contracts to purchase his sweeper on a matter with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton was active during a election campaign Ensigns as a Teacher.
Ensign took contact with some political friends to generate hampton's work. According to the documents and consultations, he passed for them after the Hampton's lobby work.
Since Hampton was recently in Ensigns' election team, he had no lobby work for his former employee or the whole Senate for a year.
According to the declaration of Ethic experts, the uncommon agreement between Ensign and Hampton, which was closely satisfied before the affair, was contrary to the prohibition called the drone lobbycracy.
According to the advisory independence, "that seems to be a debate and the infringement against the Drift Statistics", says Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer, who has specialized the defence of customers in the Government's visa.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to give the reasons for the decision in the Ensign field, Mr. Brand and other Ethican advisers said that the Ministry seemed to be very careful in the adoption of political appeals after a variety of non-profits that had been followed by the media, including the decision in the last year to let the complaint against Senator Ted Stevens because of the failure of the lawyer.
State adviser "It's clearly terrified," Melanie Sloan, Chairman of the Association "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (the organization whose aim is to combat corruption in the United States parliament and government crystals) said that a group of lawyers who have been subjected to various appeals against Mr Ensign.
"This means fundamentally that high-level government officials can now depend on that the laws for them are not applicable", added.
Paul Coggins, head of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview, he received a call on a State lawyer on Monday and another on the next day in which he was informed that the Ministry would not be sent a contract against his customers.
Mr. Ensigns Defenders had cooperated with state lawyers in order to convince them that the Senator, as his office repeated in a statement on the midday afternoon, had "dealed in accordance with the law".
Mr Coggins refused to explain more accurately the legal arguments he had submitted to the State lawyers.
"I'm not sure I'm not going to go in the conversation details between the Ministry of Justice with me. It's just so much to say, we believe that we have taken the right decision," he said.
Last month the Federal Selection Commission decided to establish investigations because of a separate composition by the ethical group after which a payment of $96.000 by Mr. Ensigns has affected the Hampton's parents against the federal election law.
The election committee said that it has not proved sufficiently that the money was something else than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, who supported the Senator for a long time, was one of the company where Mr. Hampton found thanks to the assistance of Mr. Ensign Lobbyists.
A email from December 2008 stated that after the company continued to be a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's Stabshop, John Lopez, had an interview with Mr. Hampton, in which he reported to him that he was in the internal Ministry for a matter "acceptable".
Mr Ensign was also joined by Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, and asked the Minister of Transport to agree on a meeting on behalf of the aircraft, after this Mr. Hampton had established a lobby work.
On the last year, when information on these businesses were taken to the public, Mr. Ensign was apologizing with his electors and gave his position to the Senate where he had been on the fourth place in the gang of the Republicns.
After he wasn't gone many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he tried to be a third official in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr Ensign has not been the objective of police investigation for a long time ago, his speaker Jennifer Cooper, the Senator, hoped that the Ethics Mission is very fast to follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and its investigations.
"Senator Ensign is pleased to continue his hard work in the service of people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire's call takes note on Twitter
A twenty-five of them had been shocked in the court hall.
In the minute, they sent their reports on Twitter about grain witnesses.
At the end of the defence, there were more than 140,000 Twitter reports about the process of robbery and beds kidnapped children in a house in flames.
On Thursday, the observed process of Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of three members to have killed a family of Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the judgement on the death sentence that the jury has declared.
However, Mr Hayes has already submitted applications to the court for the reasons for a profession and the courts will be employed for years.
One of the most prominent reasons is that it has been the intensive reporting of the process - even through the extensive use of Twitter by the average reporter - to a "circus mosphere" and a so far-displayed reducing of the driving details, so that the jury has been unacceptablely influenced by public equipment.
This appeal could allow the appeal duties to address the question whether new technologies are required in the court hall.
"Come I experienced it during this process, I believe it is really a danger if the access of the new technologies in the court hall affects the right of each individual to a proper process," said Thomas J. Ullman, head-defender.
The Chairman, John C. Blue from the Supreme Chamberquarter, whose week the requests were made by decision and preaching, when he said that the new media would be "supported" and that there was no evidence that the jury of liability was carried out.
But this was not the last word in this matter.
For decades, the courts have found that the reporting on famous-professional cases may cause doubts on the fairness of a process.
In his historical decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States urged Dr. Sam Sheppard, a Cleveland Osteopath, who had to kill his wife, and said in his decision that it had given a "carnevalsatmosphere in the court hall" because of the new media.
Some believe that the television series and the game film "After the refugee" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that the courts that Mr Hayes condemned a half century later may follow the argument that new rules have been needed to regulate the ways of communication from the court hall, which were still unproposed at the time of Dr. Sheppard.
"A good reason is to be to be concerned about the influence of the new media in processes that are followed by a wide publicity," said John J. Donohue III, Professor at Stanford Law School, who investigated the death penalty in Connecticut.
Professor Donohue said that some appeal duties could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of an agreeling communication from the court hall could make the processes.
The Twitter matter is only one of the many who presents the lawyers of Mr Hayes to discuss on years and thus delay a sentence.
For example, the Defenders said that Mr Hayes could have already been sentenced as a judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jury by showing them green assault photos during the jury.
Some of the jury said, photos of the victim, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years of age, and their daughters, Hayley, 17 years of age, and Michaela, 11 years of age, had filled with abscheu.
Defenders say that they would also ask the constitutionality of the death penalty, and argued that the judge had failly a jury who had been a criticist of the State Authority, and that he had made an inadmissible pressure on the judgment when he had taken the wrong decision to free the jury over the weekend.
The jurys weren't isolated.
However, their arguments on the impact of the explicit report on the process may be the greatest interest.
In a sentence which they had sent last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign for the Governor and the American Senate.
They argued that the new media had continued to defeat the flags of the emotions about the case.
"Under such daily advertising the media pipsers, cameras and reporters outside the court hall," the lawyer wrote, "what you have not experienced before in New Haven and maybe even a countrywide."
Your main point on the reporting by Twitter is contrast.
In Interviews, some journalists said that the statement that these direct messages are more than reports that are more slower than a technological view that disrupts the report on future processes.
However, some lawyers said that appeal duties would often be compared to the argument, social and technical changes need to be adapted by the courts.
Mr. Hayers' lawyer strengthening this statement.
In its opinion, the Court of First Instance decided in 1966, where Dr. Sheppard was denied due to the reporting and made clear that the new media requires new rules.
"This case," she wrote, "represented Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21th century."
Can heal the separator?
After a campaign of shock words and negativeness, this week is slightly broken in Washington.
Is it the omen of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before you return to the battle of the parties in the capital?
The meeting between President Obama and Spitzen of the Congress did not have an interruption in the great issues with which the meeting was taken at the end of a government period, in which no decisions were taken anymore.
After all that you hear, it was not a high discussion between two different sides, nor an observance of their shared responsibility, but more than a empty episode of a partial point collection.
The public meeting of the President's deficit committee on midnight was civilized, despite the political differences that continued to exist between members.
It seems to be clear that close interactions can be a mutual respect for the ideological club that continues to trend each other through a period of months.
This is little enough to say that it's a new time of cooperation.
Both sides are now in a phase of test - in which one of the other signs of the cooperation and compromise preparation is required, while it itself is trying to derogate the borders of public opinion and the patience of the electioners after a renewed party war.
Thus, the meeting was limited on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants at a minimum of claims or accused.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicns are too deep and too deep than they could expect a rapid change of the atmosphere that was predominant in the past two years.
Unlike taxes, expenses, health or expectations, the two sides are far away from each other.
Finally, the November election of Washington has voted at least for a short time mild.
"No question that has changed the tonfall," said Pete Wehner, a official representative of the Bush government, now works for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center".
"This is uncertainly after elections.
Elections use partial suffering to remort.
And that's good."
In some questions, especially those in the agenda of the "Theme Duck Session", the Republicans and Democratics have little other choice than a solution."
Bush tax rates end up the end of the year, and no one will prefer it.
Both sides want to find a way to make some or even all of them, if it is interim or permanent.
In addition, a compromise on the increased unemployed employees is expected, even if only because the Republicns are not able to make it possible to believe that the favoured tax rates for the rich, while they reject unemployed employees.
After the meeting in the White House, the optimism increased that some of these issues can be ratified during the "Lame Duck Session" and simultaneously the new START Treaty.
But William Glaston of the Brooking Institute warns that a successful cooperation in urgent issues of the Lame Duck Session should not lead to a permanent cooperation of the parties if the new 112th conference is called in January.
Instead, as he says, it is a stage of non-compliance likely, perhaps even unnecessary.
"And the things to be done are done, this short-term psychology will be struck in contrast," he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this skepsi is shared by many - leads to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of things happening from today to 2012, as boxes, or shadow boxes, for the main state of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have to do much with the drawing of the new Republicn majority in the white house and with the Teeparty choices that were their education.
As the Republicn leaders also concern that they are too high pokers, they know that they must try to make their promises to reduce the expenditure of the government and to keep the health reform in the way they are in force.
These partial lines are already clear in the first reactions regarding the recommendations of the Deficit Commission, which contain a tax reform and the increase of certain taxes, and the increase of the pensional elder and the sense of State expenditure.
The Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own appreciation, very emphasized the deficit question on the public agenda that they cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan for official recommendation, and they are very fighting to reach only near this number.
The largest resistance is in the selected representatives of the body, since in financial questions, at least today, just a few game spaces or a few sympathy for compromise.
Galston said two phases in the struggle between the White House and the Republicns in the Congress.
The first struggle will take place in the form of participants when the Republic of Obama requests the State budget, the taxes and the health system, then follows a stage of increased double cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It is evidence that, despite the participation of the current election, the majority of Americans still want to work together.
If comparison to a sackgase, as happened in 1995, both parties must take care of the public response.
Those who are always condemned to lose will change the course and need to search for compromise.
This may, in fact, be a optimistic way.
Partiality and polarization are now greater than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a larger ideological club between Obama and the Republic of Congress than at the time between President Bill Clinton and the Republicns.
At the same time, the activers of both parties in 2010 are a pursuit for a more wide choice in 2012.
Thus, the holyness that this week is shocked may be welcomed by many Americans.
However, on both sides, there will be much more efforts to find a common namer in the issues which are divided into the same way.
Congested US documentation Portrait Moscow as a port of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of the "Cleptocracy" and it provides a part of the reserves and the protective fees that she joined, continues to the Kreml. Thus, in February, the American message in Russia was reported in a memo.
The police and the State Security Service were high protected in order to maintain their tear life standards in Moscow.
They collect money not only by legitimated business, but also by organized criminal bands.
Each of the officecracy - what the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called "Verticle of the Authority" - takes its part of the money that the leader moves up.
The memo sent by the messager John Beyrle to Washington was published on his homepage on Tuesday of WikiLeaks.
The memo is based on sources whose name was edited.
It was written, while Yuri Luzhkov was even the Chief of Moscow, and it accused him of corruption.
He was shocked in October by President Dmitry Medvedv, but there is no evidence that it would be slaughtered in the interim period.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who has a well-known company, have always reaffirmed corruptions for years, and he wins many of these charges.
In September he declared a Russian television adviser when he was asked after a documentation that suggests he's corrupted: "It's crazy, it's crazy, it's crazy, it's sweet."
> A large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unlikely that, as happened in the messager's report, individuals are called, and it is unexpected that this happens by a diplomate of a foreign country.
"The direct link of the Moscow government has led to criminality that some are called "stress" and to the conclusion that the government is more than a claptokrat than a government," says the Memo.
"criminal elements have enjoyed a "kryshna" (a word from the world of the Criminal/Mafia, which means "dach" or protection), which is also engaged in the police, state security (FSB), the Service Monitoring Authority (MVD) and the Office of the State Agency of Moscow as well as the whole government office of Moscow.
Experts have discovered a trial structure within the criminal world Moscow.
"Luzhkov is on the top place."
"FSB, MVD and the Military are on the second stage."
"Clearly, the ordinary crimes and criminal inspectors follow at the lower level."
"This is a incompetent system in the crime groups in some areas, because the city does not offer any help."
The report continues to say that the FSB's money is covered by the largest companies and arrested by the police for small business.
A source means "explicated that Moscow's business holders understand that it is best to get the protection of MVD and FSB (and not by organized crime) because they are not only more weapons, resources and powers than criminals, but also because they are protected by law."
"But this reason the protection is no longer asked by criminal gangs as previous."
The Memo notes that, while the collection of money is full, the protection itself is not very determined; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business very fast closed - because of one or another inmigration.
Medvedev has spoken several times about combating corruption, but has noted at the same time that he has made little progress.
The message's Memo contains descriptions of men with coppers that probably were full of money to the crowd.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must leave on the officecraft," said George Satarov, director of India, a Moscow expert committee, recently in an interview.
"For he is part of this officecracy."
"It is no part of the political class, because there is no more political class in Russia."
Without the political politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of violence, he says that corruption is uncertain.
The countrywide, so estimates Indem, the Russian corruption costs more than $300 billion per year.
The country is launched at 154 a new investigation on the global enhancement of corruption by the non-governmental Transparency International (the countries will be listed by the "minutely corrupt" to "related mostly corrupt".
The interpretation of the memo of the American message that happened late after Moscow’s time will be resolved with safe failures within the Russian government, although Luzhkov can be accused of Moscow's error, it can also be a possibility to indicate that the problems are solved.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin stated that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fault and reacted to the enthusiasmment that the American diplomas called Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is about our interaction that is an important factor of internal policy in this country," he said.
"On to be honest, we wouldn't expect that this would take place with such an arrogance, with such a pressure and so unthicly way, you know."
Khmer Red Veterans Unfortunated to Contrain the past
In a weak, enthusiasmed classroom with smiling and smiling walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built him at the later Khmer Red leader Ta Mok.
Everyone here loves Ta Mok.
"He was a good leader and he was careful of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Since his brutality during the Khmer Red Governance is known as "the fighters", the command chairs remain in this former Khmer Redge-Hochburg in Northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals and pumps that have developed the infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers are still living.
But this year, 12 years after the capitalization of the Khmer Rouge against the government, long-year attendants in Anlong Vengue are requested.
In April, a local truth and conviction forum allowed the victims to face the public confrontation with the people who first supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book that first was told the history of Khmer Rouge for the children of former soldiers.
And in July a community contribution of UNO and Kambodsha was sentenced first a former member of the Khmer Red when it condemned the former Chief of the defended Tuol Sleng Folter Chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known than the duch, to 35 years of prison.
With each of these developments, the fear under the Khmer Red Veterane Alnlong Venngs was assessing its efforts to condemn and reintegration into the Kambodsian society.
"These are still refusing and fear in the former Khmer Red, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the documentation center of Cambodshaas, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"For she was the life under the Khmer Red glory, but the regime has become a symbol of the wicked."
"It's spoiling your own family."
During the Khmer Red governance in Kambodsha, between 1975 and 1979, 1,7 million people were executed or died of diseases, reprocessation or famine.
When the Vietnamites entered the Pol Pot-Ied government in 1979, the remaining of the regime and its military to the Kambodshas borders of Thailand.
Here they distributed until December 1998, when the last movement was capitalized, unreasonable.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the Guerilla war in the west of the mountains and Dschungel of Kambodscha, Ta Mok moved the next generation in Anlong Venng.
However, in the middle of the 1990s, when a peace agreement promoted by the United Nations in 1993 to the first democratic elections of the country began large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters to overcome the government, which leaded to the capitalizations of Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998 of a natural death, and Ta Mok, who didn't stated, was arrested by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains.
He died in the prison of Phnom Penh in 2006, where he waited for his process.
When their gangers did not protect them longer, most of the former Khmer Red fighters fled into the devastating poverty of the rural Cambodia and many involved the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even though some of the Khmer Rouge officials had their local government posts because they put their weapons down, the simple soldiers remained poor and unformed farmers.
"These people have only benefited very little of the capitalization," said Sok Leang from the Centre for Justice and Conciliation, which holds public forums in the whole Kambodscha, also in Anlong Venng.
"They are vulnerated in the Utopical Agriculture of the regime."
"You're swearing without any professional knowledge."
According to Lim, 55-year-old years of union with the Rhmer Rouge in 1974, struggled in the dschungel for a long Venng before 1998 he was slaughtered to lead a life as a poor traveller.
"The life under the Khmer Red was good," he said.
"Tha Mok gave everybody something to eat."
"But now the life is hard because we need to care for ourselves."
The Khmer Rouge Court also urged the concerns here.
The court will be tried to submit to the court of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samfan, Ieng Sary and his wife, and Ieng Thirit, another former Khmer Red Minister.
The court's mandate is to condemn the old leaders and those who are responsible for the slaughterings, but it is not said whether it will be subjected to further acts over these four cases.
This has little helped to cure the fears in Anlong Vengue.
Current media speculations have focused on In Chaem, 64 years of age, which had been during the Khmer Red governance in the late 1970s of district chefin in the Province of Manteay Meanchey.
She told the Officers of the Centre of Documentation of Cambodscha that she brought the construction of the Trapeang Thma Damms, a project that probably died in thousands of pregnant workers.
At a warm night in Chaem from the work on the fields to their wood house came back to a smooth street outside of Anlong Venng.
When the sun's long-term shadows on the deceased grace, in Chaem it was noted to discuss their past at the Khmer Red.
If the court invites them, she would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodscha lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If no persecution anymore, it would be war here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who was fled by the Khmer Rouge 1878, has also warned once again that the situation would be insecure, but the Court would accept more suspects, although experts and historians discuss it.
"Chambodscha has to shoot a loch and shoot the past," he said.
But the contrast with the past is what Cambodscha needs to do in order to go forward, said Chhang Youk from the Documentation Centre.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer lines means composing the broken parts," he said.
"It's our obligation to put these broken parts together so as we can understand everything."
The centre created the first school book approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, the 75th "Story of Democratic Cambodscha".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an appendix to the High School of the Ministry of Education, containing less than four sides over the Khmer Red.
As often in Kambodscha, young people in Anlong Venng are only a few over the Khmer Rouge, despite the connections of the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19-year-old student at Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps students understand a major part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are misstrayed because they are not sure how many people are condemned by the court."
A such resistance makes the compensation process complex and complex, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the school book and the court will be obtained after and after the influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful relationship here.
Both in the Dangrek mountains, one of the strikes is swimming and with a swimming swimming swimming swimming path to a right snake of black Russia, covering a red blue dawn.
Pol Pots body was burned here after his death in 1998 on a snake.
Sothea, 31 years old, said that she didn't know much about the man who was burned here.
"And he has a strong spirit and many people go here to pray to him," she said.
It was Nuom Sotheas birthday and later on the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last peace place where she will put a bus rider bananas - in the hope that he brings her luck.
The white Russian Country has agreed to join an unarmed uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign on global security of nuclear materials, the Government of Whiterussland announced on midnight that a higher uranium, which is a critical part of nuclear weapons, will not be gathered.
The contract was announced in a common statement after a meeting of the Minister of Foreign Affairs Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Whiteern Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Guide.
The US government had tried to convince the white Russians that it was not a higher uranium and that the last spring year seemed to have been achieved.
However, the official of the US government told Washington Post that in the last two months two secret agreements with the Whiterussland were taken to remove 187 pounds of armed Uran from a White Russian research station.
This was prepared to remove the rest of the material on midnight - according to an official employee that remained anonym because of the sensitivity of the theme, about 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obamas 'Nuclearm Security Board of the 47 nations' from April, which was excluded by the White Republic.
And it was obviously good enough to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit of 2012.
"I was really grateful of the fact that they wanted a seat in the Nuclear Security Hall (de 2012)."
"This proves that it works", said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear security.
Clinton called the Agreement "a very important, very important step" of the Whiterussland.
Obama spoke in April 2009 in Prague to ensure all nuclear materials within four years.
Since then, the United States government has helped six countries to get their high-scale Uran.
The white Russian country will be seventh.
A twenty country did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obamas Nuclear of Security, the White President Alexander Lukashenko stated that the country will never be sent to its Uran.
"What holds high uran - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally weaponsable, and less rich Uran," said Lukashenko at the time.
"This is our raw material... we're not going to make bombs and we're gonna sell no one."
"We use it only for research, that's all."
But just a few months ago, the whiterussland approached the United States when it was interested in the meeting of an agreement.
The first start to remove the Uran Whiterussland in October was particularly complicated because the material was easyly corrupted, says officially.
It was loaded in a special shop, which was more than 1,300 miles to a Russian manufacturer for location and disbursement, says officially.
The second start was decided on Monday and was carried out according to the offices by flight.
The US government pays for these $14 million, with a majority of the money in the White Russian research with a weak uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was very carefully coordinated and agreed to build confidence," said Andrew Beneiawski, a representative of the Ministry of Energy that works at global risk reduction.
James Martin Center estimates that the Whiterussland had at least 88 pounds of armed uranium and hundreds of pounds of high-scale urans in this year.
The whiterussland wants to resolve its loan until 2012, according to the common agreement.
The relationships between the whiterusland and the United States were encouraging for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's human rights misunderstanding.
But the statement of midnight suggests a possible approach.
"The progress of these global security issues welcomes the United States of America and Whiteruss that a increased respect for democracy and human rights in Whiterusland remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," he states.
No punishment of the Spanish government against the CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objection against the CIA flights with Taliban and Al-Qaida prisoners on Spanish state territory to Guantánamo, such as a telegram from the U.S. Ambassador in Madrid.
This reflects the documents extended by Wikileaks and reflected on the daily newspaper "El País" (per cable). It is added that the former government chief María Teresa Fernández de la Vega requested to be informed by the Spanish government "to demonstrate that foreign aircraft, which are overlooked by Spain, will be monitored".
In June 2006, after the publication of a report by the European Council, in which the aid to human rights advisory practices was accused in a Dutch country including Spain, the former North America Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega were discussed.
The Deputy Head of the Governing Body was able to hide anything in this matter by the Council's report "hate Zapatero on the side" and confirmed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"The Vega understood, Spain has no crime against secret service flights on Spanish state territories."
"They just want to be informed", not "unforeseenly surprised", reports Aguirre per cable.
Also, the former Foreign Minister, Miguel Angel Moratinos, pointed out that the Spanish government "does not want to give great attention to this matter, although the government has little influence, since they are in the hands of the judges."
The advocate of State Vicente González, on January 2007, understood the message that it would not block the initiative to declarify the documents of the Spanish Secret Service Center (CNI) and the defence defence minister on the CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any of the harmful or sensitive information," the poster explained after a conversation with the State lawyer.
Nevertheless, the United States were more concerned about the "possitive coordination between the Spanish State lawyer and the German State Prosecutors" than about the declared information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent suspects will complicate our efforts towards discrete handling between governments", says Aguirre.
During a midday in March 2007, in which the U.S. Ambassador Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba participated, the latter commented that "if the Spanish judges were considering their independence and what they do, he gave his workers to avoid "resolved protestal comments in order to make the sponsor."
The messager also expressed his concern on the approach of the PP in this matter.
"In its general state of pro-Amerika, our experience shows us that the PP will not be doubtful, as a evidence that the US government of Zapatero, which could be subjected to human rights violations, has been tolerated, tolerated or mostly ignored, will be shocked, even if these enthusiasms could affect the US government."
The child murderer increased the Internet on the "muchsal" of the maternal society.
The young woman talked about the child when this was dead and she had a blog, "Terror on Galic kind."
Monica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this name, which she leads from small, she holds with a cusin and at least a friend's contact, and both are from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The communications are from 2008.
In order to understand this, you must know their loved lives that rebuild the ABC daily period on the basis of testimony of their family members.
The 30-year-old galic woman took a relationship with Iván Tunñez, an industrialist.
She took a year.
Shortly after she solved her relationship, she was known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know whether the baby is from him, but his former man never let him conduct a DNA analysis.
Shortly, she went to another relationship.
The chosen Alberto, a young man from Lousame, was a neighborhood.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balears to look at the labour market, the young man left with her partner who had even joined to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their messages, it can be concluded that their relationship of love was broken and tending to them.
In March 2008 she was alone on Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very unique and sweet because I came to work."
"If I told him, he found it good, but now he realizes what it means to be alone all day and not to be free to do and leave what he wants."
Later she mentioned a message she just received on the phone, "I want you to return this month or let me get a address I can send you to the boy."
She claims, "If he doesn't like me to leave the boys with my mother, I'll take him off when I'm back."
In May she says of the return to her village: "This week I'll go there, but I'm only gonna stay there until 19th, because I have to imagine to work on 20th, if I don't want to lose it."
She explains she takes her first birthday if everything's okay.
"He will be with whom he must be, that means with me. I will not leave him again with someone else of my mother," a doubtless hope when you take care of their bad relationship.
There's another mail in July.
When she writes this, the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and probably died on 10th.
"Onewise, Caesar is satisfied, otherwise not."
"Only, he's with me and the place like him, but otherwise he must go to school every day."

Popular Party won 4 sites in the Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28 November, the PP could play a key role in the towns of Leida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the significant vote and deputy in the last regional election, the PP has already seen its view to Parliament's elections, and its expectations are more positive, because the number of votes that this party has been achieved in these elections is normally doubled as the elections in Catalonia.
Thus, the Catalyan People ' s Party was received 610.473 votes at Parliament's election of 2008, while this paragraph was only 316.222 in 2006.
Last Sunday, the PPC reached 384.091 votes.
In the case of this upward trend, the result of the processing of the vote share of the PSC and the introduction of the election of the PP, the analytics of the PP should prognose that in the election of parliamentary elections the PPC could increase from 8 to 12 Congress Members, while also CU four (that has now 10), and the PSC would lose at least 9 Members (of 25).
These calculations indicate the fundamental importance of catalonies for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose a deputy, which is now three - while ICV holds its Members or could win.
However, if the election calendar is maintained, the next term is in May 2011 with the community choice. The People's Party (PP) can also be the language at the Waage to prepare the socialist ruler to prepare a end, in four province headquarters and with the majority of the city Council of Barcelona, one of the largest budget managements: 661 million euros for 2011.
The nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC can lose the Citys of Barcelona, Tarragona, Léida and Gerona, where socialists do not achieve a majority or not to their traditional associations (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debacle, it is not unexpected that this party will lose its delegation in the municipal Council of Barcelona, where 5% of the votes should be achieved.
However, the PP marked an increase in their vote shares in the four provinces and could become a major force in Barcelona, Leida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they could play the main roles in Tarragonas, where they had registered with the PP before the current citizensman Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Léida, the PP is only 500 votes behind the PSC. The Citizensman, Angel Ross, has a good relationship with Mariano Rajoy, during the last election fight.
In other important places, such as in Badalona, Castellon, or Reus, the People's Party could make a significant increase.
Currently, the PP is represented in 34 cities management catalonians and aims at education of lists in as many places as possible.
The catalanic cell concerned thousands of travellers Al Qaida
In addition to the seven feasts in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven of the police officers of the Barcelona police and Nigerian police officers formed the controlled dschihadist cells of Thailand, the different Al Qaida groups, including the "Move movement to release Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Lashkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the last author of the attacks in Bombay, who called for the 2008 106 dead.
The Spanish Minister of Internal Affairs has a great importance of these investigations, which is so far that he assures the "Operation Campai" to be the "flacking device" of Al Qaidas worldwide and "as a result of their ability to act".
The researchers show that in the two years in which the cells were active in Catalonia, thousands of places were sent to Thailand where they falsely and then to the groups where the criminal Galaxie Al Qaida was assembled, so that their "fighters" could not be punished by the borders of European and other Western countries.
The closed cell is not the only one of the dschihadistic networks active in Europe, and therefore other European police units, except the Thai research bodies, have also affected the investigation, and it is not excluding that in the EU's area, in the next days, will be taken similar attentions as the last service day in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanian Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabra Asghar, Malik Sitichar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Baptual Agunbiad) was captured in Thailand, where Pakistanian Muhammad Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Syrian Kijbuming.
They had led from Bangkok from the cells deleted in Spain and other European countries.
The catalanic network - a part of that was destroyed in 2009 - was particularly stealed by tourists passes in accordance with the terms of the “International Islamic Front” mentioned.
This means that the documents on the name of men in the age of 25 to 45 and had to be valid for several years; they did not show a vis steam.
In research crystals, it is stressed that there was no connection between the Catalonia arrests and the attack in Bombay, although the author was the "Lashkar e-Taiba" who stole one of the groups of recipients in Spain and was false travel costs in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be reminded that a few days before the catalonian attack was sent by means of a money transfer company several thousands of dollars that were used in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which later were used by the members of the "Commando", which were prepared for the life of 106 people.
The police has invited a large documentation.
PP requests a transmission of the tax agreement by Mas
The Chairman of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity last night to present its own conditions to support his Officer's membership as President of the Generalitate, which did not differ from the already set out in the election campaign and allows to comply with the priority of the economic recovery and the submission of regionalist independence, such as a financial compensation agreement which the regionalist leaders wants to propose on the top of his mandate.
The Chairman of the Catalan People's Party, with the security of Artur Mas, which she gave to the 18 deputy who had received on Sunday at the last Sunday, was a point that is more than enough to feel unreasonable; because the candidate of the Burger-regionalist Party CU has indicated that at least one of the opposition parties is in the vote with its official vote.
The future conclusions, which the regionalists want to take place in the future Parliament's elections, depend on a possible intent with the PP, but the discussion, which leads to the massa with the other parties, turns into catalonies.
In terms of the PPC participating, it calls for the support of the Officer's "all debates involving the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" and a agreement on the financial balance between the State and the Autonome Region, as well as in the Basel-Chairland, and the members of the CU even a referencedum.
It is common for political leaders to make the constructed political device of regional management more slower and to put up the inheritance and gift taxes.
With the details of the negotiations on the official access to Mas, the PPC Jord Cornet and Dolor's Montserrat are employed.
However, Joaquim Nadal (PSC) has already announced a hard opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV), and he is meeting with Joan Puigcerkos (ERC), Albert Rivera (Citadans) and Joan Laport (Solidaritat Catalana).
The Old Employee confirms that death cases are not to be reduced to "unless measures"
The owners of the old house in Olot do not end that their cousins killed over 11 older people
The responsibilities of the former secret La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave last night a press conference where they found the damage of the criminal acts Joan Vila Dilmes - the employee who had killed at least 11 old people for which he was responsible.
The chief of the former secret, Joan Sala, was in charge of his lawyer, Joan Cañada, proclaimed and announced, "La Caritat wants to accompany the responsible persons (for the deaths)," but "the law and our detention responsibilities forced us to accept the process and civil detention."
The establishment must not only take a social loss because it had not been identified at the time, but now pay a high deprivation rate calculated by the lawyers of the family members of the victim.
Joan Vila Dilme claimed that the first crime returned in August 2009 and that he has been killed since then.
The judiciary ordered the exhumation of eight bodys - former patients of the Old-Chair, since he tried that no doctor had investigated the losses personally, but the forms were telephonely developed because of their age and diseases.
The Chief of La Caritat destroyed this point around and explained that "extinct measures could have been no time for accidents."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that it "no indications for a person other than the accused."
On August 29, 2009, the baptized baptized 11 murders and explained that the first crime was pronounced and killed the second old woman in a half months later.
In this case, he killed with a overdose insulin, in contrast with the first crime in which he was administered a mixture from different medications.
The leader of La Caritat explained that the access of the staff to the medicines is only difficult to control.
The insulin insulin pain and the cocktail of cocktail placed in six of nine crimes to free patients from their suffering.
But the results of the laboratory surveys will find whether Vila was lying and actually chosen a less grave death for his first victims or whether he burned them from inside, by accepting smuggles, how he had done it accordingly for three women he killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, you don't believe in the words of the chairman, not even what the number of the murdered murders may be more, so that it will justify that Vila had made very different statements before court and that there is no sense to change its course after eight successful murders.
They said they made themselves out of this reason and for the explanation of the scope of these events of justice.
Drugs of the European Central Bank (ECB)
The investors reacted last night to the threat of the President of the ECB Trichet, who warned: "The markets should not consider our reaction ability."
The risk proposals of the euro peripheral countries have been dramaticly increased and the shares of the European banks are more than 5%.
However, we should not consider the possibility that the ECB can be angry and that the euro has not put into account points which are concerned.
The events of yesterday are typically for an illicit market, which is re-recovering, but due to the closure of shorter and high speculative positions.
The institutional investor will still not lose his fear.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank invited us to reverse our liquidity measures, which the ECB must make a back round tomorrow for a fourth year in two years, and probably another time in the future.
The Federal Bank requested the application of the plan to purchase State debts, since these are inefficient, as well as the removal of all extraordinary liquidity measures, which should be maintained by an unexpected access.
According to the Irish crisis, we expect that the current liquidity measures "alone to March" will be extended and that the fourty-year records will be maintained with unlimited access to the Quartal end to ensure liquidity at least June.
We also expect that the programme for purchase obligations will continue and that it will be a strengthening signal.
If the expectations are not fulfilled, the extraordinarily reaction of the markets will be recovered from last night and if we are hardly maintained to return our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Like at the ECB meeting in May, where the bank confirmed that the purchase of State debt papers would not take into consideration and the markets in that way could be gathered tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and bearing.
In May she showed the teeth and at midnight she told her to have a lot of buying, which caused a new compulsion of the market.
Last night the auction of single-year state institutions in Portugal was very weak.
The government was only 500 million to 5,28%, with 750 million to 4,81% in the previous auction.
However, the interest rates in Portugal were 30 base points in the whole curve, reflecting a change in the markets in accordance with the words Trichet.
In Ireland, the numbers of the debt debt in Allied and Bank of Ireland were published.
The sum is estimated for about 10 million short-term and possible 15 000 more. There is time to build private capital, or the banks are entitled.
Although Ireland has lost his credibility after it had not recognized the problem with stress tests in July, the numbers are acceptable and helpful to reduce the uncertainty.
However, on Thursday, the Government must receive Parliamentary approval to its new budget and, as it is not yet sufficient to support, Ireland is still a source of incertitude.
Angela Merkel has prepared its discurso on the summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December moderate, where it has been asked for political unity to demonstrate that we are playing together the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the nine Sinfonie Beethovens.
Last night, the Spanish Government President proposed the plan of action to be adopted on Friday by the Council of Ministers.
Rent reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as financial institutions, decrease of the State deficit, liberalization, privatization and job acquisition measures, which are in the ears of investors such as Vivaldis for four years.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish bridge has increased around 4,5%, doubles as the rest of the European burners.
In comparison with February, the reaction of the Government and the Spanish Central Bank was quick and convinced, and we benefit from the surprising effect.
Today, there is a great deal of a three-year State support that will benefit from Trichet's effect, and therefore we put on a strong question that will remove all doubts of our debt capacity.
For Spain, the application of an aid plan would be self-received.
We would receive liquidity that we don't need. The sweet team has 40 billion euros, three times as much as in March. The interest rates are over cost and access to the markets would be unfreely closed.
Nevertheless, our strategy should respond to the Motto Caesar's woman: "The last thing is not only its own, but also the scene."
Just courage, we're gonna do that!
The Presidency of Eulen, on request of his children, welcomes the Society Assembly of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the Alvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro society, does not depend.
David Alvarez, the founder of the enterprises, will fear the Society Assembly of El Enebro, which will take place at the request of five of its seven children on 16th, since he holds them "absolutely unlikely". His children will try to receive a majority to control the administrative bodies of the company - inhuman of the Weinberg Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Alvarez and his children David and María José provide the legal measures for a new judiciary capital in their struggle for the control of a part of the company group.
The founder of the largest holding for business services does not seem to be ready to submit the control of the entities of El Enebro.
He was issued by the Governing Council by five of his seven children, and they were appointed to members of the Governing Council on 18 January of this year, which was already entered in the trade register.
The Society Assembly of El Enebro, called by the Court of Commerce No. 2 of Madrid for the 16th century, has solved a new shock in the shock of the Alvarez family.
The calling of the Judge to recommend the Assembly is the only legal way that ensures the invitation of the Society's Assembly.
The last strategy by Juan Carlos, Paul, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz will be recognized by David Alvarez as a "uncertain means of the applicant - his five children - to declare by means of legal discrepancies, competitive powers and legal abuse of the unexpected congregation of 18 January," as official speakers.
This argument is the basis for the warning of the congregation in the afternoon to explain it as "absolutely unlikely".
The same protagonists, who smell in discrete smells, have already tried to call a congregation on a pleasant way in June.
With El Enebro - property company and owners of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, in addition to other property values - control David Alvarez' seven children 100% of the capital.
Nevertheless, the founder of the Service Group requires family protocols that use law exceeds 51% of the capital.
This is the actual background of the matter on which the judges have decided on the treatment of the claims for which no date has been given.
Red Bull is seen in F1 with a secret weapons of Siemens
The cars are improved in real time with a software.
Since Red Bull 2004 ended in the world of the form 1, their history is expressed in this exciting universe in the speed of surprises and successes.
At the beginning, no one gave the new observance and, despite his upset, the last stage, all of the warrior of Fernando Alonso's victory at the end of November.
Without the ability of German pilots and World Minister Sebastian Vettel or the performance power of Renault motor, the "secret weapons", which led the Multi Semens Red Bull into the hand, and thus a victory team became a legend.
In fact, it was a powerful software to simulate processes in 2007, which are the purposes of the German company that did not have to do with authors.
This PLM information programme has been used for the development of mount chains in manufactures throughout the world, energy work and high-specific instruments.
Bezweckt will be a credible reproduction or simulation of a product or process before it is actually built to avoid such error and overflow costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon's cameras, Sukhoi aircraft and Nissan’s most famous use vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, Chief of Siemens Industries Division, explains that with the use of this software in the form 1 - Fabric Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time" the changes and improvements that are determined on the costs and tests can be completed and implemented.
Russian Worm concludes that 1992 were a average of ten technicians working in the rear samples that could lead to at least three or four improvements in a season.
The Red Bulls Team today has 180 high-qualified young people. EDVs with power-based installations are conducting analysis and all possible changes to the rail car.
The Siemens Manager explained that the PLM software could be able to analyze and improve all components of Red Bull's rear cars, with the exception of the engine for which Renault is exclusively responsible.
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamic and the security elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred to the reality within less than 24 hours from the virtual reality of the simulator thanks to the continuing production systems and hightech auto-claves.
The only limits that have been established in this crazy technical perfectionism are the $40 million that can be evacuated by a form 1 team for its struggles in a season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech fabric for the development and manufacturing of its rail cars in a 50-kilometer away from London.
These are two buildings where visits - especially by journalists - are strongly limited.
Everything that happens there is Top Secret.
The accommodation includes 580 people, including the two pilots, the World Master Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bulls real form 1 - Held is uncertainly the recent Master Sebastian Vetell.
Among the huge technological resources that the energy drink manufacturers are in the services of its participation on the renal lines, further protagonists, whose support is inestimated and their advertisingness is equal to zero.
The technological head of the work, Steve Nevey, emphasized that five years ago, was still able to say that the progress in the F&E-renarms sector with 50% to victory and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the share values have changed, and the technology is 85% of success while the contribution of pilots is estimated to 15%.
Nevey recognises that Vettel and Webber never can be replaced by EDV because they are "not predictable gladiators".
HP will open twenty own loads with local departments in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) last night, he entered his first exclusive load in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of a sales network that exists from twenty businesses with 80 to 100 square meters that will open the multi in the next two years in Spain.
The company agrees this initiative with the already existing 16 sales areas in the multimarket industry, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Court English.
The Chairman of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, called the rebuilding load at the Great Vía in Barcelona, property of Pont Reyes, has cooperated with the HP for thirty years.
The North American Company Group is taking into account 200 sales in Europe until 2010, with 20 discounts in Spain.
The first week in Bukarest, Romania, and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Herrera did not want to betray the coming new openings, but did not conclude that Madrid could be the next goal.
The Chairman, who is also head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy for load opening is always the same. It supports a local driver with experience and business knowledge.
The North American company group has this, and overcomes the exclusive loading (with interactive products to accompany). In Europe, all loads will appear equally.
In addition, HP is responsible for the training of the load personnel.
Helena Herrero said that it was not a Franchising system and hobbed that the exclusive sales facilities network is regarded "to optimize customer service and the advice of small and small businesses in the purchase and later, even the packagings".
The load in Barcelona has a pioneer pilot program that resolves the technical problems of HP devices with guarantee.
A online service builds a connection to technical centres in Maastricht (Holland).
"In this way, we can solve problems in ten minutes that sometimes take into account up to two days."
"This system has been developed in particular for small and small businesses and private companies, as large companies have already made their service contracts for technical customer service," said Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants his rivals in three years a million customers 'clauen'
The employee member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a hard year for the banks, but first a new liquidity crisis and a prophecy period will conquer the end of the debt war.
However, it is expected that the interest rates are incurred, which tries to balance the banks with increased expenditure and prices for payments.
Saadell expects to start a million private experiences in three years - one to exist.
Saadell has found the way to create the coming three years, and so to survive in a very complex economic environment.
The bank will introduce a new three-year plan in 2011.
The goal is not only to survive without taking the public aid from the FROB but also to increase the market share for a million privates - 700 000 if you are deferring customers who lose the bank - and this is the great challenge that the bank is before, because it has more attention to its business workshops than to now.
In this year, she had to join 250 000 privates and 50 000 companies.
Your market share in privates is at 3,5%, while business workers represent more than 10%.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 Business Plan is the increase in productivity, extent, cost reduction, and the challenges in which the bank is concerned will be presented together with the annual final report.
It is only a few banks to establish and publish objectives in these difficult times, since all the plans of the banks have been divided through the financial crisis through the world.
This year, Sabadell is completed by its Optimate Legislative Plan four years ago, which was initially extended to three years, but it was extended to a business year.
The key goal of the bank is the customers who will leave the sparcasts.
In a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola emphasized, 2011 would be a "sweetie" year "with great reign wide".
The manager is out of that, Spain only comes out of the crisis.
Furthermore, it would be "softly difficult", in two or three years "making jobs" - based on the survival of banks.
Even if it comes to the fact that the war against Passiva - which punishes the interest margins - will be abrogated, the risk advises that banks and sparcases have to pay for their emissions towards liquidity, as the compensation for weak profit rates is already deleted to the price for credits.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are structural and they will exercise pressure on credit."
"We have not turned the hair, but the interest differences are very high", said Guardiola.
Banesto already expressed the order to its filial network to restrict the allocation of long-term loans and increase the interest difference (see Cinco Días, 22 and 27 November).
The manager also acknowledged that the banks had now pursued the statistics "enlarged the expenditure", but "in a framework that was prescribed by the competition".
Saadell's guideline is based on an organic growth, even though the group does not exclude corporate business as always.
Nevertheless, he assures that "greatest enterprises are needed in Spain".
"The next year, everything will change", he says.
He emphasizes that the need for capital is currently "enormous" and does not conclude that some Spanish financial institutions will be deleted in red numbers.
He believes that the FROB could replace the monetary market in capital loans.
After assurance that Saadell can also survive the markets, he realized the argument of some bankers that have already prophesied a new liquidity crisis.
He emphasizes that nothing can be rounded, but in contrast with the accidents in June, you can achieve short-term funding on repowering business and thus take the crisis.
CECA closes a second fusion wave of the sparcakes
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, has convincing the possibility that it might come to a fusion weather of the Sparkases and emphasized the speed that the sector will be restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish Spain Case began, several sparcasts were not involved at the first stage, and they were in the second round.
Instead, the Director-General of the Spanish Spain Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, would not happen this second round.
"I believe that the majority of the fusions has been closed. Cajasol's participation in the Banka Cívica group cannot be considered as the second round, it was much more about adjustments."
"The largest part is closed. It may be that we have been instead of seventy-third or fourteen, but all important processes are already completed. They have been controlled by Banco de Spain, which has strongly supported all operations."
Olavarrieta noted that the concentration process was completed as soon as possible and that we must be satisfied with the fresh end that was established in previous times, not now, within the framework of the business plans with Bankco de Spain.
"The transition of 45 Sparcas with a average of 280,000 million property file to 17 with 75 500 million is a historically uncomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced to 62 per cent and are now much greater than we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement."
Olavarrieta explained that "there's a number of uncomfortable views about the slowness of the process, the insecurity and intelligence", because "Banco de Spain encourages us to end the slow-range right before the end of the year."
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assuranceed yesterday that Spain had one of the most strict financial systems of Europe and "viellence" of the world and complemented that those who doubt that this is "no deep knowledge".
The manager noted that we should do no concern in the current economic community about the situation of the financial institutions and the spheres that have been understood by a "severly important" concentration process that will be completed as soon as possible.
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the Red Line Germany
Berlin has decided for the maintenance of the euro, but at the same time the European Union has decided.
The shocks on the market have solved a double response of the government.
On the other hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero introduced new adjustment measures, starting at tax deficiencies for small and small enterprises, the regulation of temporary workers or the relief of the 426 euros support for unemployed persons, which are no job payment, until 49% of AENA, the management of the Barajas and El Prat airports, and 30% of the state lottery.
On the other hand, Elena Salgado, the former Government President, Felipe González, supports the criticism of the chairman Angela Merkel, as responsible for the current crisis.
How are these operations to understand?
It is predicted that the position of the character is not an error of its public work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of the new definition of the euro.
In this way, Germany takes a fundamental new perspective to build our future, which collects most of its partner's traditions with the maintenance of the elderly traditions.
In view of the rebellious situations in Europe, there are three possible ways to be speculated from the crisis in Germany.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south leaves the euro space.
The second: The re-introduction of the German Mark, although it is currently under science Fiction, supported by a majority of the public views, about 50% of the population.
The third: a conversion of the euro in accordance with German proposals, which means: more macroeconomic controls; rigorous budget management; punishment of the countries that are presenting the requirements; possibly the payment of certain countries, and the expansion of the costs of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been decreased since some time, and therefore there is no exit now.
First, 2009, both the IWF and the European Commission encouraged deficit deficit, and the German Government moved towards a constitutional reform from the pool to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign of the interference between the need for Germany (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign of the Middle-European country, which was Merkel, was the decision to save Greece.
This was a strong criticism, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the public view publicly published, were absolutely against a salvation of Greece.
Finally, in the last October days, the Merkel will take a clear position, which calls for a reform of the EU agreements to allow the saving of a country and to impose the private donor to take part of the costs.
This position was expressed as an anti-European, as it progressed the Irish crisis and all the following.
But its proposal, if something welcomed, has been adopted, and in the next months we will participate in the reform of the European Union which will allow these measures from 2013.
Germany took a red line that did not remember it exceeding.
All of us say that, even if we have to take unfavourable measures, it will not be given the old functioning of the euro from this time.
2013 will be the birth year of a new currency area where the counterparty countries are hardly punished, they will be able to explain to payableness and to take part in the private sector in this case.
Germany shows that we need to spend a strong growth rate, with high speed and investment rates, consumption deterioration, improvement of productivity and competitiveness, and positive external sales.
The other alternatives that are based on debt and buildings with huge loans in the payment balance, as stated by Spain in boomtimes, will not be simply included.
The offer is clear.
And we would do bad about not understanding it.
It is not only to go down the State deficit until 2013 to three percent.
The demands are much worse.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to be disappointed by ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulences will be more calm.
And that we will use the possibilities offered to us until spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero also understood this, and his double advertising (the promised reforms after conversation with the big businesses on the past Saturday and the proclamation of new measures from yesterday) emphasizes that, despite the criticism of Merkel, the order has been prepared to create its way.
But the red line taken by Germany is there and it doesn't seem to be that something would change it.
With the possibilities taken into consideration, we should not exclude the euro area that has been completely cut with few serial countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sports and regulatory environment
Tricks such as Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax, but not the will of conducting a sanction.
The excluded by two players of the Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game of 23 November against the Ajax in the Champions League leaded to the fact that a lot of thin had been borrowed about whether it had to be an unportuous act or whether both players should be sanctioned by the EUFA.
As it is generally known, the two players lost a few minutes before the player (and the team had already obviously winned) time and played several fouls so that the Scheedsher showed them the second gentle card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid would join his group, the two players will fill the sanctions required at the next link against the austery, and so without cards in the next stage.
Finally, the EUFA’s Disciplinary Commission charged the club's trainer, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different money.
The prominence of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is most common in the world of football.
She is so wide that she is part of the Ethos - the non-scribed, but the rules in this sport type.
The part of the debate on the case shown is that a team of the football club Real Madrid (when in his hymne Edelmut and honor had been punished and in other occasions had been punished by his players for similar events) played the main role, and the dramatization by Mourinho, who has added more to his long history as theatral and provocative technicians.
In any case, the debate is about whether it is not explicitly prohibited by the statutes contrary to the principles of sport, which means whether these acts are a regulatory environment.
In this case, the damage caused by the sport should be examined.
The sports spirit defends the physical incertitude of the players, a aspect that has not been threatened by these acts, because it was not agressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that the opposite trade players take an unjusted benefit from the opposite team.
The paradoxe of the acting of the players of the Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we normally understand under a false game or a rule environment, because the circle of the rule was not secretly complete to avoid a sanction, but should be as opposite as possible to be punished by the Scheeds Director.
The players waited and took the sanctions joyfully.
Another question is what kind of advantage the reciprocal traders have been taken from the disadvantaged fouls.
It should be highlighted that the rival has not been placed in an inutility situation and benefits for the game played, since the obviously result of this action was that the own team had to continue with less players.
It is no useful strategy for the next game, because the club then does not have these players.
The benefit is obviously that the players start the next stage of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation to a future game.
But it is a long-term advantage, until a certain degree, since the team can even differ. Furthermore, the players receive a sanction with this action and go to the second cycle where they differ less than in the first cycle of cards because of cards.
This is not so clear whether it really is a benefit.
Finally, such measures do not oppose sports, including strategic decisions, in order to benefit from the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to take sanctions (which would actually be a clear case of regulatory environment), they wanted to choose when they were understood.
They have taken a strategic decision without escape or flying before it.
Although the borders between the production and the regulatory environment are different, I believe that this matter is a clear case of production.
I have the impression that the Polemic has resulted in two factors: because it went over two self-determinations and because of the type of the proven transmission.
The damage that has been added to the principles of the sport through these acts is less ethical than more than aesthetic.
Offers for customers for groups of Christmas meetings in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar has fallen a la vine of reservations on the 16th and 17th December.
The payment holidays by employees themselves are wide. They do not want to pay more than 20 to 30 euros.
As the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, there are also group groups that will lead to the guests and free-time sales of Barcelona. However, as a result of the economic crisis, they resolve a price-free event to also represent the large massage: almost all of them want to eat between 20 and 30 euros for a midday or dinner, confirmed the demanded entrepreneurs and associations.
In order to make the booking a little more complex, the calendar (Silvester falls on one day) has fallen all orders in the week of 13 December, with the result of a la vine of reserves of dinners at two spotting days (16 and 17) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many enterprises have established the group shareholders from budgetary reasons.
In order to avoid rejecting this tradition, many employees pay them from their own tab.
As the conjuncture is always, it is requested for weight prices, confirmed the Chairman of the Guest Towns of Barcelona, Gaiity Farràs.
The representative of the Town Association is not expected to predict how the celebration is appeared in this month.
"The people's gonna be twenty times before they reserve."
"He wants to go out, but they take care of the prices." he stressed.
The business will go well, "the quality of good prices with a good service", he adds, and remembers that customers are expenditure in times of crisis, whereas prices are most strengthened by 25 euros.
A survey in various central restaurants shows that the night of December 17 leads the suppliers to collaps.
The Soteras Group says that the demands for this Friday would bebomen less than 30 euros. The group has adapted its menu with full offers between 25 and 35 euros to the conjunction.
Another leading group, Andilana, who holds 16 guests in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), has conducted the property of the calendar, even since November.
"We have made it impossible to keep the previous year prices with the menu for each shooting from 19.95 to 30 euros."
The AN group, leading to El Mussol, Attic, Ququ and the total of 23 places, does not lose the optimism after the second quarter the income again and good, even if the prospects of Christmas business are focused on a few days.
Sources of the company group indicated that also the 18th overactive day with friends who are predicting Christmas will be.
A Christmas menu has been added for 30 euros or more than prices. The impression that the customers are ready to pay 10% more than in the previous year and, on the contrary, want more details, such as Cava.
In some enterprises, there are also green trials that look for re-inviting the employees, and it gives the impression that group links are back in the relief.
On the side of the Town Association, Facasarm (such as the snake, restaurant and free-time Association of Barcelona), the star Chairman, Enric Gomá, believes to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are totally "lebable", although the customers are "a maximum".
However, the fun at the party wouldn't be back, no one pays.
The Pakistani nuclear programme has great concern in the United States
Islamabad makes nuclear weapons "better than every other country".
Enthusiasms of Wikileaks confirmed relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The enthusiastic content of the corespondance between the North American message in Pakistan and the US State Department is confirmed by the Internetportal Wikileaks, which is a huge concern for the Pakistanian Atom programme of Washington.
At the end of the clear and valid details offering the documents on the content of the conversation and the thinking of the accredited North American diplomates in Islamabad, they emphasize that cooperation between two countries is not strengthened in matters of nuclear security, but that the instable Asian countries makes more nuclear weapons to a faster rhytmus than each other country.
In particular, the ownership of the Pakistanian Atom programme - that the weapons are not assembled, but their parts are shocked in order to slaughter their destruction in a possible attack - will be prepared without sleep nights.
The following risks are the messanger in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before visiting the former leader of the National Security Council, James Jones, on: "The nearness of some nuclear plants to the region attacked by the Taliban, the confusion of the nuclear material and the accident of the transport of nuclear material."
The large number of people involved in the nuclear scenes and the rats programs will be viewed not only by the United States, but also by Russia as an exercising and reason to handle care.
"Pakistan has to establish strictly credible staff to monitor the nuclear plants; because of the low levels of education and cultural organizations, extremist organizations have more opportunities to resolve people who work with nuclear or rats programs," said Yuri Corolev, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a discussion with its North American Office.
New at Julian Assanges Internetportal documentation is that cooperation between the United States and Pakistan is following nuclear distribution and the increased time in Pakistan's nuclear weapons.
In May, a message office, which describes the communication with Pakistan as "freety," declares: "No transparency is often available; on help offers we do not receive answers or they are rejected."
In another communication Peter Lavoy confirms that "in spite of the economic disaster Pakistan's nuclear weapons soon than no other country produces".
The messanger Patterson requested Washington during a visit from the Supreme Headquarter, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "exply", that "Pakistan's army has to make its quiet support for terrorist groups."
On the Jagd to Wikileaks Chief
Obama calls for a high responsibility for the anti-terrorism fight to prevent new enthusiasms.
Interpol provides a red warning for persecution and relief of Assange.
Whatever Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, is a complex labyrinth, where the contents of the experts are only difficult to explain.
Yesterday, Interpol gave an "red warning" to Assange's "Extension and persecution".
However, it is not a traditional arrangement for establishment.
She is not new, she is 20 November.
It also has nothing to do with the latest integration of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accused of sexual abuse to which the Australian must be in Swedish.
In addition, the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, firms "the police knew where and how she can contact Mr Assange."
The International Police Authority, on 20th of the request of Swedish, issued the arrangement, but it was not known by the Swedish authorities until yesterday after the holding of the power.
The 188 Interpol countries are ordered to identify and discover Assange, "in order to fix and deliver him promptly."
While Interpol is not able to order the conclusion of one of the individuals involved in red warning, many Member States consider the red warning as a free letter for arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extraction agreement, how it is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange may be held.
The proposed assange lawyers, who were mostly published a letter in which they informed that the 39-year-old reasoner of Wikileaks is ready to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by video conference.
They also recall that Assange was requested to travel from Swedish and to compare the State lawyer, who received the approval with the prescribed Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, the Head of Stalin.
"This is like a jagd, not like a legal persecution," is accused in the writing.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother of Australia's innocence of her son - Asange is on a unknown place, but not sweet.
On Monday, he gave the director of the magazine Time per Skype from an uncertain place from an interview. At the meeting he requested the return of the US State Secretariat, Hillary Clinton.
"If it could be demonstrated that it was responsible for the order of North American diplomas to sponish UNO and thus defeat the international agreement signed by the United States, it should be returned," he said.
His opinion was sentenced yesterday by the Presse secretariat of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who called the application to return as "speak and absurd".
"I'm not sure why we should put value to the opinion of a type with a website", he explained the CNN sender.
Obama himself has taken a high responsibility for the anti-terrorism fight, Russian Travers, with the prevention of new documents.
The attempt to give a less attention to the speaker of the Chairman Barack Obama, Assange, is in contrast to the views that the conservative politicians and comments in these days.
The Congress Member Peter King, who is leading to the Presidency at the National Security Committee of the Deputy, has requested the State Department to investigate the possibility of establishing Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations, to "remember their money and to follow each who supports or provides a contribution."
Tom Flanagan, advisor of the Canadian President Stephen Harper, was still gone, and he had to say that Assange should be "mored".
"Obama had to change him into a target chair and use a non-employed flight or something like that."
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, Baptist Minister, former Governor of Arkansas and possible presidency candidate.
"Whoeverever was to switch information in the government, he's the slaughter and everything that is no direction is, it's too sweet punishment," he explained the shipment Fox.
Puigcerkos is looking for an eye-winkel in the ERC
The Republican leader allows the party to vote secretly on its continuation in the office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the full assembly principle.
Joan Puigcerkos seems to have found a receptive to go out of the quarterly internal survey in the lines of the loss of 11 Members and half of the elections without the ERC.
The participatory group is aware that his retreat threat is not sufficient to the part of the former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector today is struck as its mentor itself, and he will not be struck the same offences as other former struggles.
Hence, the leader of Esquerra tries to win the new critics, which would ensure its position up to the next community choice.
Last night, the ERC's over 200 regional members could be secret of their stays in the office.
With choices, not with high hands.
If the carodists wanted to pass a penalty to the present, they could do this without fearing repressions.
In fact, the Chief wants to avoid the impression of disruption as well as the income under his person.
In several interviews, he confirmed that he would feel the half of the voices no longer confirmed, and he added without indication of percentual values, a result of "in the Bulgarian style" would not be good.
The Carod Stockers request the President more than the party to provide its office; an unsuccessful beast, since Puigcerkos is controlled by the top body of the conference.
But as they do not have sufficient majority to obtain delays, they will agree with the state with a plan of action from now to May.
To this end, they expect to work on the preparation of the document on strategic reorganization that the leadership will be submitted to the Council on 18th vote.
Their hope is to be made for Puigcerkos. On the contrary, it is to be promised to prescribe the Congress in the early 2011, which the party's piece already holds for a fact.
The ERC participating group is the opinion that "polyphony" harms the stability and is trying to bring the organization into the ability to shoot their shocked doors behind the closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by the official consuller Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
In view of the fact that the Puigcerkos is an ideologist, the owner of Innovacio was based on a fact that the participating group "in exchange against various objectives".
He counted five of whom two were on the front.
First of all, the "restructuring" of the state to ensure that at least 90% of the members of the parties, which means the integration of new faces in the area of Carods.
The second could be the great news.
Huguet proposes that the full assembly principle should finally be set out as a functional manner.
In this way, he defeats a reform of the statutes which it will allow to hold the conferences with the selected delegates.
From the end of the full assembly model - a exception in the Spanish party system - is the Puigcerkos' team that had already been fighting on the last two conventions, as they were.
Indeed, at the Meeting of 2008, the party's review of the principle of the full assembly was held on a conference that should be addressed with the reform of the statutes.
This end is still understood, since the information of the internal relief in the last few years did not have to be ratifyed.
Now, without the critical sectors, the time could be done to react and end this matter forever.

Reader Exception Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN declared that the former panist group has the right to apply to the National Order Commission and to request what the right is to be subjected to him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vazquez, ensured that the exclusion of the Manuel Espino Barrietos had been right and that the former PAN's Party had the right to apply to the National Order Commission and to call for what the right is to be subjected to him.
In an interview that took place before the complaint Gabino Cué Monteagudos as the Governor of the State, he stated that the exclusion of Espinos was a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an independent decision of the Order Commission in Sonra."
"Mr. Espino has the right to apply to the Commission the Order of the National Council in his case on the complaint, in order to make a decision by an competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he explained that it was not to think at the time of 2012 and that a alliance to the President has never seen at the negotiation table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that the national action was strengthened from the internal vote on the coming 4 and 5 December, in which his followers were selected.
"These (a Allianz in 2012) is a theme that never was on the negotiation table, at least now. It was a proposal for the community choice, he was successful and fulfilled his purpose."
The panist leader declared that the PAN returns to 71 years of dialogue, so "is not horrible to us the internal competition; on the contrary, "we enjoy them and it strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the Council would, unfortunately, choose the best Chairman who would need the National Action for the next three years, and therefore he would "to those who would determine the Council."
"I'm fully inquired and open, and I'd be proud to transfer each of the fifth officers of the party seat."
He prognosed that the resignation of the party signed in the last elections of 4 July reflected in the following elections, although "that is not at the time to think at 2012."
"The last time it is to support the Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this regard, he hoped that the three governments, which were exhibited from Alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa, would take the fahnes and observe all the country; therefore, "will be placed in them and I am sure that Gabino is the height of the requirements".
When he is asked about the criticism of the PRI at the President Felipe Calderón for his discourses within the framework of his four-year-old government, Caesar Nava called for the members of the PRI to consider the six-year period of the former President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believe that the governments of Zedillo and Salina were better than Fox and Calderón, they should begin to defend them, they should finally come out of the pain," he confirmed.
He believes that the deputy of the federal government expresses expressions such as those that he can make in his discurso in the National Auditor, as it does not prohibit the mouth and less a center in this country.
Obama puts himself in Twitter for the law for undocumented students
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act - Act, then call your senators and strike to adopt this law," the President of the United States in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported the country-wide mobilization for supporting the Dream Act - Act on the legalization of undocumented students with a message on his personal blog in the social Twitter network.
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act - Law, then call your senators and strive to adopt this law," tweeted Obama.
His brief communication contains a cyber link to a comprehensive document requesting the public to contact its senators, since the vote of the law is directly encouraging.
"If your voice we wait, the time came to listen to you," he stressed.
The message was distributed after the 42 Republican senators and the 42 were to block all votes for each law, except the expansion of tax deficiencies from the periods of Bush and the financing of the government.
A such blockade announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republicn senators could affect the vote of Dream Act and other projects such as ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the distribution of nuclear weapons.
As regards the blockade of the Republicans of the Dream Act and other projects, the President Robert Gibbs said, he trusted that, once the issue has been solved, a timeplan for the other projects could be set up.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that tax case must be completed before the end of the year..."
"I think we can meet a agreement every time, and then we can plan the end of the rest," he said.
The Chairman of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, acknowledged on Tuesday, "he would ask the vote on the conclusion of the debate, so that the Dream Act - Act, with which the initiative for non-documented students from the next Thursday could be agreed to the Senate, although the next week would be likely.
The version of the Dream Act, or the law of the American dream, would be legalized by about 800 000 young people who were inmigrated in the United States when they had not been sixty years old while the last five years lived in this country and have been signed to a higher educational institution or army.
But the Defenders of the Law need to adopt the initiative sixty votes, as they are appointed on the votes of a handful Republicn, and the organizations of the speakers of this project have an intensive impact on the adoption of the law at the time.
Democratics, among which the majority supports the Dream Act, have over 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, would vote and only a Republican Richard Lugar from Indiana has announced his support to the law.
The Defenders of the Dream Act must therefore be held on their side if other democratics should decide to turn back the initiative.
The majority of the Republicans, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who overlooked Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans, who supported the Dream Act in the past, are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but explained that it would not be supported at another time.
Another Republican who spoke for the law, John McCain, has not yet established his position.
Although the Representative House has another version, analyticals agree with the Dream Act in the Senate before the largest obstacles.
Put the finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The Lust in the Language' was a swimming course in which the participants became strong for the story.
"What I understand with the sex in the language, but... what is expected by me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who should open the second round of 'Los placeres de la language', a cyclus that feed the Spanish language literature and used in this case the subtitle of her question (when the round table was given to the sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "Bring us in difficulties," the Argentinan writer sweet to the public, which was mainly assembled from young people who gathered together on the International Book Meses in Guadalajara (FIL), to attend this modern-modered round table by Marisol Shultz, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she gave to Gonzalo Celorio, and then marked the shultz as a wonderful story. Luisa speaks in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking for what is a "dog" and goes to the doctor whose answer is not, but provides instructions for the leadership of her record.
The infector lets her convinced: "Patience is not my strength, maybe it's my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologs, which you slowed the atmosphere at the middle of the gang, and who states that the desire is not scientific, the psycho-analytics enthusiasts the secret: "The wound is the really open, the symbolic is the narrow."
The main figure of the story is facility and closed, which she "assums only knowing that it is really open and not existing." But she is convinced that the pleasing in the language and its cases is mixed.
Valenzuela, the writers, played with both.
The Nicaraguaner Sergio Ramírez also presented an enthusiasming story that he called 'Promise', and in which the fingers were not mentioned in the wound, but are discovered.
In response to the magic realism, he spoke of a famous magnificent magician who struggled the wool, slowly swallowed men or restored the torment lost by a girl. The story made a master of America, the great Roman, who failed from the beginning to his own chronists, and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticized the overflow of the stories told by the audiences.
"Cervantes, who called us all (the writers), shocked the predicted witnesses that were shown in the stories that were true, but otherwise the history of the Americas would never be told - with the power of training that even the shame had come down."
However, he has said, "If it's the crazy and liars that are the best thinking of the things", and there approaches the reality and lies to each other where you don't know anymore where the physic literature reaches the gateway.
He actually calls it the 'Tradition Cervantes'.
"We have been blessed to be what he's told."
When Mayra Montero was at the series, he commented and glorified the various interpretations to which the invitation of the FIL to the round table 'The Fingers in the Wonder' had taken.
The Cubans and Porto Ricanese contributed to the great wound of social violence, which belongs to their country - such as the whole Latin America - as the result of the fight against drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poesie, good songs contained a quiet, not predictable commitment," she explained, after he highlighted that the literature is communication and binding between the author and the readers as a "chemical reaction."
On the evening, the Spanish detector, Luis García Montero, also decided to "the thin of the engaged writer in the wound of the writer".
He noted that in a fast living world also the intellectual habits and the control of consciousness go to dogmatics, and it will forgot: "It is a little no in behind each confirmation and a small ja behind each injury."
"To be our thought and reality in possession, we need to snake: and Nuanciers often want to put the fingers into the wounds and to smell those who feel much more like when they are in the form of charikatures, black and white, in preferential ideas without nonces, and also to spend the powers that it intended to take attention to the world in black and white. He called for a sense of writing again.
Romano fights for his first title
Ruben Omar Romano looks back on three finished games, he experienced in his career, but three times he played decisive games.
In the dull between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end of the game, there are also two different styles prescribed by its trainers, and which is reflected in the results.
Ruben Omar Romano looks back on three finished games, he experienced in his career, but three times he had decisive games, and until now he has been well-served, because this opportunity is very important for him.
The Argentinan played up with the Medaille to the second champion, he was a step behind the winners, and it's surprising that he has launched end games with the same team.
The Santistic Strategy reached the first end game as a trainer at the tour open 2002, when the Morelia had the shoes in the hand with which he had a large decline against Toluca with 4-2; later, Clausura 2003, he reached the crucial dual that he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Preparing with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', where they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to turn back, since the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros on 210 minutes of play, but at 11-m he came up with 3-1 and had two options to cut his title, but the last three of his players failed the 11 steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén had already had two finish games with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rivals, lost. Therefore he never wants to be persecuted by the disaster and free from the wicked magic to celebrate a title for the first time, although he confirmed that the most important game is for him.
"I want to be Champion, I don't want to break statistics, this is for a club, for my dedication that I give, and therefore the title will come to me, but what happened before is the most important," commented the Tax Man when you ask him about the lost end games.
The last end game has still remained strong in the memory of him to have learned much of this: "The only lesson we can get out of it is that until the Scheedspread does not fill the end, we can't celebrate at the line, the players are also prepared, because the last time we were prepared with two editions, and I believe that this is a teaching until the game is ended, there is no place to celebrate."
To know that this series could be solved by one-metre-floor shooting, does not end him because he trusted his players: "No one will ever come to the shooting, you want to end in the regular game time, but sometimes there is no alternative and you must be prepared to be prepared, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately we prepared the skele a bad game, sometimes as a result of nervousity or strong effort to keep the title already in the hands, which leaves us something for this end, and we hope that this time will not come to it."
It's in Romanso Macht to be not only a second champion and to cost the sweet first time to bring the title with himself.
The United States changes the rules for the maintenance of a visa
The persons must be presented before their meeting at the consultation at the services for Visual Survey Services; the costs will be reduced in waiting time.
Since 10 January 2011, the procedures for the application of a visum are changed in the message of the United States and the Consultates.
In the new procedure, most applicants must be presented before their discussion in the consultation with the Services for Visual Survey (ASC, the initial booking sites in English).
The ASC staff shall provide the biometric data of the applicant reviewed by the consultant before the conversation.
The new procedure has certain benefits for the aspirants, including:
The total expenditure of the visa is reduced, since it is not necessary to pay the Terminal debate, the processing of the visum application and the transport service with which the document is equipped.
The applicant only provides a single payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the contrary to $140 for a tourist visa, $ 150 for Visa with application (including Visa for time workers) and $390 for handlers and investors.
Those who want to extend their visa only must not conduct a conversation in the consultation, they must only be presented at the next ACP where they present their documents and take their fingers.
Since the biometric data is obtained in the ASC, the applicants who need a second term for the consultation in the consultation remain less time than previous.
Those who request the visa in the Consultants of Ciudad Juárez, Monterey and Newvo Laredo do not need to pay the service as a $26.
Additional information about the new visa application procedure is found at the following site: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the Fund for Foreign Life
The North American Railway Agency held a press conference to provide a fund tomorrow, which will have the impact on the search for living in all.
The National Air and Railway Authority (NASA) of the United States is tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of foreign life.
The Fund will be presented tomorrow at 13.00 p.m. at a press conference at the NASA seat in Washington by astronomic experts. This is a scientific study of origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When the press conference was insured, the NASA would propose "a supervisory fund for the search for extra-term life" which was solved by speculations for experts in other countries.
The discovery could describe the theory that it could exist in phenomenonal environments that could exist for inhabitable human creatures. The hypothesis has been discovered that these are in intelligent lives - like people - could change if they improve their conditions of life.
It seems to be a microbike found on the basis of the Mono Lake at the Yosemite National Park, California, where she lives in a environment that has been maintained too giftous for all forms of life, since the sea is strong.
In any way, the microbiology uses the arsen as the survival resources. In view of this capacity, it can increase the possibility that it is on other planets that do not have a similar life in our protective atmosphere.
If these organisms change the ar, according to the astrobiologists, "is actually another form of life, there is a second life form that differs from the known ones."
The room journey will be known tomorrow, on Thursday, at the press conference, the real bond of its funds.
At the conference, the geobiologs Pamela Conrad participate in studying the possibility of life on Mars, and the Biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists, the Titan (the largest moon Saturns) studying whether its chemical composition of the earth is different.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and Patrón form an opposition block
With the reform of the Organization Act on the Congress, the two party system will be introduced.
The 60th Legislative period was started, and it was already installed a block of opposition by the members of the PRD, PT, convergence and Jesus Manuel Patron Montalvo, who represented himself as an independent person. The four were asked: the invasion of the 'seven partial system' in the room.
Before the initial session, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergence, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo by the PRD and Patrón Montalvo against the reform of the organic law, which would be excluded by it.
With this reform, they repeated it would introduce a 'third party system', since there were now two people, the same number as the parties that controlled the Congress.
These four Members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, the coordinators of the PRD, were the only representatives of the president of Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his property as a Chairman.
Corvera Quevedo stated that the PRI and PAN parties would have introduced their political position with these reforms.
He concluded that in the next days they would speak with the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme, and they were out of their political will and if they did not have it, they would be retraced by both parties, which would end the opposition coalition.
"I'm coming (the opposition coalition), this is what I see, because we will be excluded from all decisions that do not take into consideration the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergence declared that it would be able to agree with PRD, PT and Patron and that it would therefore form a multinational group.
It could not be allowed, he continued to conclude that the Congress, after he was monopolist, should now be "duopolist".
"It is not the spirit of the law reform that it is to rule forever a two-party system in the Congress."
"For the beginning, this group begins with five Members and speaks with other colleagues and colleagues to become more", explained the Convergence Member.
Hezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT, expressed the remarks on PAN and PRI that the Congress had now become a 'beast' for two.
"Before it was only a party, now they share this to the second."
Patron Montalvo requested to respect the Members and to give them their place to the negotiations.
"The five, which are now dismissed as in different groups, have decided to agree in order to take our place at the negotiation table, because because of its reform, which was carried out by the other, we have remained outside and we have not agreed with this reform."
200 000 weight more for "the delivery"
The city management of Mazatlan pays a further check to the employee of the electric material company.
Another check of more than 2000,000 pesos benefited from Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city management.
The amount paid in the second half year to the owner of the electric material company is 1 200 000 peso.
According to the page for more transparency of the city management, it was issued on a amount of 200.144.56 Peso spectrum by the number 9258447 last November with the "Open Accounts".
The Teacher Luis Miguel López Moreno had already predicted that more money from the community would go to this delivery. It will be observed by the Auditria Supreme del State because it sells to higher prices.
What is not mentioned, the total amount that you are debt to you and then the number of checks that are still issued for Camacho Palazuelos.
"It was nothing purchased with her, it's just paying the debts, just as with the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The latest schecks "scanned" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, 2 of 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and this last of 16 November.
Although the provider has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as it is legally prescribed, if an ASE company is in question, to avoid that other administrations requested their services, the slaughter would ensure that its services would not be taken again.
After the Noroeste magazine published on 25 July the examination of the schecks issued by the city management to its suppliers, it was known that, from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, he had paid the community over 10 million peso with 42 schecks at Camacho Palazuelos during the three-year official period of Master Jorge Abel López Sánchez.
It also found businesses with Jumapam where they entered Schecks in value of more than 3 million peso.
Tourist places must be improved
Tourist companies regret the accident of the foreign tourists due to the bad state of Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlan.
After a foreign tourist in the invasion of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism sector of Mazatlan requested the authorities, the areas that are in a bad condition and a bad picture on the port city, to give particular attention.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, Chairman of the Soviet Association of Zona Dorada, recalled that, in various occasions, it was requested to meet the goal of travel and the bad conditions that the tourists are to change in new employment opportunities or routes.
He said that the bad state of the roads and roads would have affected negatively, since the tourists came to the slaughter and looked out the injustice, whereas they would apply the nearby shoes.
"Politicals don't know what it means to close a company one day, and they don't think about how many money are lost, because they would not carry out the construction work in this way slowly and unplanned."
The hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the storm of the tourist would have taken note of the missing prevention and the remaining maintenance process of the city.
“The congregation must take its responsibility and avoid that happens again. How to do this? Well, by means of a preventive care instead of improving everything in the next place” he explained.
"We waited for a cleaner city, because not only because it is a foreign transportation area, we have to keep it, but also we have a right to a cleaner living space. City management has to change their strategy to get the city in a good condition."
" There are other places that are also unpleasant and unfinished," he said, "for example, the Escudo and the Venadite of Mazatlan."
"Our day we need more than only advertising to lock tourists. It must be offered a good product, a city that cleans its streets and streets, and keeps the tourist attractions constantly in the shoes," he added.
"They have not been given sufficient attention to these arrangements, and this kind of incidents makes only what is clear for all: a maintenance is urgent."
Raúl Llera Martinez, Secretary of Promotion of Touristics, expressed how important it was to save the tourism site of Mazatlan, because they would not be used correctly and left a bad image.
He mentioned a number of places that should be taken together with the city in front man. The city should be priority to build clean, ordinary and attractive for foreign traffic.
"Happyly, Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural places that first have to be swepted and cleaned to make them attractive for the foreign transport and to make them attractive to the inventor we make for this travel target.
IP required results from the Conference
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE, proposed that the deputy should take the great responsibility to provide an example of a better synaloa, which is before many challenges.
Mazatlan's business sector requires a valuable Parliament, free of negotiations, to the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is chosen and is at major problems.
Last night, the 60th Parliament was referred to, with seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of the Partido New Alianza, two of PRD, one of PT, one of convergence and one of PVEM, which is a total of 40 people.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to make a more pursuit work, feeling the society and the various social groups who have been assigned to a responsible parliamentary work, and that they do not repeat the same pattern of partiality and patriarchism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE Coordination Council, proposed that the new Members should take the great responsibility to give an example of a better synaloa that is before many challenges.
"We hope that the Members really exercise their right to act freely from negotiations between the parties, because they are generally taking agreements with which they have their own interests, transforming themselves into the coppers of the governments and the leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to the construction of the necessary bridges to submit the current government.
"We care for them to carry out a reliable work and to use all things for society and their groups, because they were the inhabitants of Sinaloa who discussed their trust in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, Chairman of the Hotel Association Tres Islas, means one of the great challenges faced by the 40 people's partners is the lead and the common works for the economic growth of the State, since today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important is that they increase the economic growth, investing and infrastructure measures, which will, in any way, promote the creation of jobs."
With regard to the foreign transport sector, he requested the new Members to share the necessary levels in the State budget for the promotion of the Ministry of Foreign Transport.
"I understood that it is the Ministry with the secondary means, which is uncompatible with an important economic activity, which brings flows and investments into the country and is in direct competition to the agricultural industry."
Tourism projects must be acknowledged by money, supporting public security and the alcohol law which has not been renewed in previous legislation periods, must be put on the latest position.
The Holy King is Search
The children of the Coronado Valenzuela family want to be sweet.
The next three-year-old day will be difficult to fill this desire, as the budget is not at least twelve people and a sweet bottle.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give the hope that Melchior, Caspar, and Balthasar gives them the player and the clothing rooms they seek.
The family lives in a pleasant house in the sediment Salvador Allen. They live from the hand into the mouth, because the father has no fixed work.
" Sometimes my husband has no job, but we sell manners and cartoffels... I'm going to go with the views to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little.
The four-year-old Adelaida would like to be a puppe or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wanted a barbie poppe.
The ten-year-old José Alfredo wants to have a 'monster car' for which eight months old brothers Jesus puts clothing in the size of Cetseana for a year.
" (Joseph Alfredo) said to me, 'I would like this monster', but I answered him, 'Let us wait, kid', because it was much more money', Cettana replied.
For the older children who were in the school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
The 11-year-old María Guadalupe has the size 12; the 10-year-old Isaiah has 10, while the eighth-year-old Miguel size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacked tennis shoes. A couple in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela, you can participate in the 'Saint King' campaign by shipping a player or bargeld in the Receiving Chamber of Noroeste.
14 Narcotic drug dealers arrested
In the midday, a Cannabis' production and sales network of Cannabis was carried out on 10 households in the administrative region of Estonia.
Fourty persons were arrested and were put into account against different contracts.
The home searches were played in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where the places were to have served before the drug production.
"After 750 cannabis plants, four kilo hashich, bargeld and equipment that have served the production have been confused", said Louis-Philipe Ruel, speaker of the security police of Quebec.
Overall, 11 men and three women were arrested from Sherbrooke two of the men who are the main threshold of drugs.
The arrested persons should be apparent for hours after their arrest before the justice building in Sherbrooke.
They could, among other things, be accused of the production of cannabis, whose possessions for sales, the complot and the service of crimes.
These house surveys have resulted in a long-term investigation activities which had been held over one year.
"The information obtained from the public hand has allowed us to carry out these findings", precise Mr. Ruel.
For the 70 police officers of the Regional Investigation Unit, Estonia of the Security Police of Quebec, Sherbrooke's police office, and the menphremagog police were involved in this police operation.
The secret immigration could be seen unfairly
The draft legislation of conservatives to regulate the problem of vessels engaged in private immigrants will be struggled after having announced the three opposition parties in the midnight that they cannot be favoured by the proposal.
"I'm not going to stand on this chart."
"I'm holding with a party who put fessels to you on your feet", explained Michael Ignatiff, Chief of the Liberals, after the weekly Caucus meeting before the gathered deputy.
The Liberals pointed out that the draft legislation, which allows each person who come to the transport of a marine ship identified as an illegal immigrant, was denied for a year, as proposed by the Canadian law and freedom Constitution.
Gilles Duceppe, Chief of the Quebecois Bloc, also pointed out that it could not support the draft legislation, since he turned up against the wrong target group.
"We are, however, and it seems to be all the opposition partys, so we will wait for what the government takes", said Mr. Duceppe.
The criticism on the migration question of Olivia Chow, NDP, has made the critics from the hand which requested that their party was not sufficiently stable towards the home immigrants.
"The neo-democrats agreed to take measures against blind passengers, and as soon as we try to follow by communicating another draft legislation, the C-35,," said Chow.
We did not therefore prefer the draft legislation of the conservatives because he searches for the guilty of refugees and holds children arrested at least a year," said Chow.
The Minister of Immigration Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties to play with the policy and to ignore the will of the Canadians.
"The Canadians are entitled to deputy that they do not tolerate this kind of domestic immigration, to these criminal procedures related to Canada and to treat the country as a foot-department."
"He expects that Canada takes hard measures", says the Minister of Reaction Kenneys.
"The Government has not announced any confidence on its draft legislation that could lead the country to elections that the Government had rejected.
However, a conservator has expressed the QMI Agency that the Government would call for a vote so that each opposing Member immediately explains its elections.
The new unit does not find harmonity
Despite the proclamation of the possible establishment of a new, existing unit for combating corruption and collusion, Jean Charest requests many observers to continue the training of a public research committee on this subject.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, said that this idea was not last year: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this subject last January.
The metropole has been entitled to a substantial unit against corruption since 1870.
However, the announcement of midnight has surprised more than one.
It should be said that this measures, due to the meeting of the Permanent Committee of the Quebecer Police Service on October 29, has not been discussed on the least fewer, despite the Presidency Robert Dutils.
It was also lacking that Stefane Bergeron, critics and members of the Quebecois party, the announcement in public security was qualified as "of the hot sweet caninchen" and "an a chechel-based solution".
Minister Dutil had again used those who feared that the political power has too much influence on the future unity in question.
"They will see the result when we will be proclaimed", he rejoiced.
"It is aware of this problem."
According to Rejean Parent, the President of the CSQ, nothing can replace the implementation of a public survey.
"The more Mr. Charest wants to prevent the education of this research committee, so much more people like you and I think he's going to hide something."
"The only means to form a research committee is the return of Jean Charest," stated Yves Boisvert, Decent for Ethics and Policy Systems at the ENA (E.U.A. high school for educational officials).
In order to get out of this sackgase, he suggests to the Quebec to make a specific mandate for the financial checking, in order to establish such investigations on corruption and secret discussions.
"It should be able to extend the mandate of the test control", he decided.
He also believes that the chebec of the testing control could enable the same power as the Commissioners, which would allow you to bind the people to speak.
The training of an unit is not the only project in the Charest's sculptures.
The Quebec is also requested by Ottawa to change the criminal law in order to be better established on such crimes.
This is the case by the Supreme Ombudsman of Operation Marteau, who informed Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the law practice in such a manner of punishment is not clear.
Vic Toews, State Minister for Public Security, confirmed his colleagues from the Justice, Rob Nicholson, currently set up with certain, this dossier concerned.
During the Operation Printemps 2001, the groups of motorcycle police police were arrested 131, although the criminal law was not renewed.
As a result, Ottawa has implemented the law against Gangsterm.

In Shawinigan, in Maurice's administrative region, there was an earthquake on Wednesday afternoon.
Two households were evacuated preventively.
On the evening, another earthquake in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the Lanaudiere administrative region, was accompanied.
A straight is joined in it.
From Tuesday to Middle Wednesday, strong rainfalls have risen from 40 to 70 billion in several regions.
This was expected from 20 to 40 millimeters from this point in accordance with the regions until Donnerday.
The northern regions of the river and the Tal of the Outaouais regions were the most intensely affected.
The total of this was to 100 billion rain viewers.
Since there is no need to accompany the snakes that have already been assembled in certain part areas, the transition of several water flights will be feared.
Wednesday, the Quebecer Security Service warnings on the high water heat of Ouarwater and Achigan in the Lanaudier region were called.
The streamways in the north, in Saint-Jerome, in the Laurentine mountains and the cemetery in Lotbinière are going to be the object of high water surveillance and continue to be observed.

Dupont authorized to part
The Quebecer Rundfunkmodern Stéphane Dupont has experienced a partial delay before the Canadian Supervisory Council for Rundfunk Standards (CCNR) because of its controversial statements on social care and Haitianers as well as because of his accidental statement on Funk.
The CCNR agrees that Mr Dupont and its CHOI 98.1 FM team had had had had the right to express its own opinion, but certain statements had had "no information on social care and unreasonable negative manifestations of Haitians, as well as a kind of unreasonable statement that is not appropriate to the day-to-use posts".
The Supervisory Council also concluded that a debate on self-defence involves the proliferation of the names of two persons who started self-defence against the code of the round-function transmission.
The CCNR had received several complaints on comments made during the 2008 and 2010 period.
The first available was established by a complaint of the "Common Force of people assisted socially from Quebec".
The active organization had estimated that the amounts mentioned in the sender were slightly referred to.
Moderators should provide more solid than irrelevant observations.
With regard to the subject of self-defence, the Moderator Stéphane Dupont had the view that self-domicide was a expression of fatigue.
The majority of the Supervisory Council members had concluded that the message was that self-defence should not be considered as a solution to life crisis.
"The majority of the Supervisory Council takes into account that the consequences in question of the sentence "Dupont le midi" would have a positive topic in a family-based and appropriate way."
Hence, he was inflicted with no tent against his person.
The last point of struggle was the statements that had faced on the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-Rene Dufort had given themselves a mediative conversation on this regard that a lot of reactions were called.
The CHOI modeller had declared that they would not have depended on Haiti aid because they did not know with security whether the needs would actually receive the money duties.
The Supervisory Council believes that these comments have not been misunderstanding characters, however, that their cumulative effect represents an unreasonable negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already cut my three-day sustainment punishment in this matter."
"My record is young for a half years," the moderator explained.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Council applies to the proliferation of an unreasoned expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM Rundfunction-Chancer has treated its obligations.
The consequences of the roundfunctioner, which, among others, had to share his decisions once during the main end of a period of three days, are low.
A King of the King-Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemal, Montrealer Algerian origin, has a very special course.
The athlet, which is in "Sanda" (Voll Contact Kung-Fu), in the Kickboxs and in Thai boxes, now increases in search for new challenges on the Tatami and the boxing lines of the world.
"I started in Algeria with fighters like Kung-Fu and Kickboxen 12 years ago," explained a census that has been accompanied since 2008 in the Metropole to continue to develop themselves under the profession.
I personally search for the struggle of all kinds, because for those who are presenting the earthquake, as the mixed struggles of fighting him, are not rhythmed in North America."
His sign had recently worked as a security officer, as well as his rivals made bad news at the company UPS, in which he received two gold medals from the World Karate as well as the Kickboxing Association (WKA) was issued between the 23th and 30th October in Edinburgh, Skotland, the World Minister of Amators.
"I have won in the categories of Kickboxen and Thaiboxen's full contact," he explained.
"Actually, I'm preparing for the world's Pocal in San Shou in China."
"They were invited by the fighters from each category that had been placed at the last world master at the first four."
"I got a baby in Toronto Bronze 2009."
"2005 I became a beach in Vietnam."
"2007 I finished the tourist in China on the fifth place, while I became a third in Toronto 2009," he added.
"It's precise that I have made progress in every competitive fight."
"To this rhythmus I'll be first this time or next year."
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplinary from China, with fausts and footsteps as well as grounds.
The two battles are usually on a platform, more rare in a boxing.
The most renomeed boxer that came out of this kind of fighter is the American Vietnamian origin Cung Le, who is well known in the world of the fighters.
If Nacer Zemmal keeps only one event in his career, he would call his presence in the Super Town "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of the Kung-Fu, with security.
"This competitive fight is the highest and higher in China", explained the sympathy poundsker.
"It is a little more than the equivalent to the Stadion Lumpinee (the largest stadium of Thailand)."
"This was a super-exploration."
Hence in the half-final of his category (80 kg) wins his first battle before he lost in the end.
"Whoever has seen me was a butt professional," he analyzed.
"There are four chairmans for category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the half-final meet each other in the end of their category."
"The winner of each category offers the strikes to crown a single champion, the king of the king."
450 million in contracts without registration
Hydro-Québec has granted project planning undertakings $450 million to contracts for the Eastman-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In this lake more than 100 contracts, a consortium consists of the company BPR, Dessau, the Group SM and Axor, which has received the most important part of the project guide to a sum of $295 million without registration.
This consortium, called "Energy Generance", was formed as a membership in 2004 of the decision of Hydro-Québec, which the private sector was responsible for overcoming this important hydro-electricity project in a amount of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the "Energy Generation" Consortium resigned the lucrative treaty without having given it a public registration.
For the Quebecois Party, the restraints to business consorts are a serious ethical problem that constitutes the risk of competitive consumption and a price increase.
"This is a new way of a carded game and strengthens competition."
"This means that you are carded carded games instead of secret way now, open-formed", explained Sylvain Simard, deputy of the PQ, on the press conference.
On spring, Simard had addressed the question before the National Assembly, because it seems hard to understand how the interest of publicity can be taken in this way.
Mr Nathalie Normandeau, Minister of Resources, had reacted on the afternoon by rating that it had been a carded game with this treaty.
"I remain faithful to my line," she turned, enhanced her, the PQ was "incredibly" and it was "flore you.
She said it was "that's the least", that the PQ would apologize.
The model of the consortium is worldwide slow practice.
It is generally a timely temporary duty that allows two or several companies to switch their experts with regard to an order for a complex project.
The "Eastman" project is a high complexity level in relation to its work plan.
The construction procedure is in the gang and must be established until 2012.
However, the Treaty was forgiven without a competitive campaign; it had already been negotiated.
Furthermore, the model of the consortium in Quebec itself does not represent any exception in relatively simple projects.
As noted last week in the newspaper "Le Devoir", the model of the consortium object of government communications is applied in the field of the construction and consultations.
A short transfer of the Quebecer company registry allows it to name more than 200 consorts of which some of them seem to be permanent.
This way, for example, the company Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its nuclear competitors where CIMA+, Gennivar, SNC lavalin or also rock and Tecsult.
Any link, and there are several duties, brings back to one and the same legal person, namely Dessau.
As regards the "Energy Generation" Consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the Territory of Baie James has been subjected to a special working force dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has been able to take into account this fact since the 1970s."
Real Report, the large employee of the Société de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a statement that the nase has made the fact that the Project Guide Agreement was authorized.
"If you make a registration and there are only few applicants, your prices will be fast in the height."
"You have two possibilities, or you take the people who are on this March and say to you: you will be a satisfied agreement to a good price."
"The thanks is, however, that the price is not decisive, but the expertise of the persons", confirmed report.
The "Energy Gerance" Consortium is part of a long list of contracts by more than $50,000 from the Quebecois party.
The contracts were approved by the Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ project for Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
According to the review, the "Le Devoir" newspaper was more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts, the companies or their branches, including resource works, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had pursued 22 contracts, Genevar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without enhancing its participation to "energy generation".
All of these treaties have been negotiated.
They are totally employed at $449,783,344, which entered the contract with "energy gear" over $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard had allowed to believe that the four companies who form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor) were well known by the "liberal party du Québec".
Minister Normandeau had endorsed PQ's identically linked to the company they "funded" before she precised that it was much more about their leadership forces.
Barometer Conscious Consumption - The "Green" label is not reliable
Greener, but it's skeptic.
The Quebecer Consumer has little confidence to the main factors of sustainable growth, but also not only to the marks signed or the eco-marks to control its choice.
The damage, although it is in a media efficiency universe, where it takes it from information to benefit of a responsible conscious consumption only as possible: the barometer's conscious conscious consumption has a lack of credible information, an inadequateness that makes it aware of its commitments, as shown by the first reading, which has been held last night.
Although they have pre-established the consumption of so-called social products in 2010, they seem to have few credits to be sold.
Two thirds of the Queen's population, in fact, give little faith to the environmental commitment of the company as well as the green company, thus provides the instrument for the responsible consumer centre of the Sherbrooke University.
Another idea: half of the consumers doubts the confidence of the officials, the certificates that are fully accompanied by good products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that declare themselves as an environmental consciousness, the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the discursion of politicians in this issue is seriously taken by only 14.6% of the Quebezer population.
However, the information regarding responsible consumption seems important to stimulate this consumption, which is presently only a third of the Quebecry consumers.
Indeed, the ice of 46% of the consumers were shocked empty and doubtless characters of the information.
This is the second brems identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
Furthermore, a third of the competitors of the performance of the green products and services that are trying to handle them is mislead.
According to another communication, the half of the consumers had changed their habits in 2010 and had previously changed the mark of one or more products to express their conviction.
According to Barometers, they also had a favorable 61% purchase in handlers of their city newspapers and benefited from the purchase of food built in their region.
Green and responsible conscious - the index of the environmental conscious consumption had reached a maximum value of 100 in this year -- the Homo consumption of Quebec likes to present itself as a king of recycling, which tries to reduce his shoes left in the environment by care for the animal protection.
However, the social and environmental consciousness seems to be maintained before his car, so the barometers: just 28% of the cubezers have indicated, used public transportation in 2010, or have the driving centers to demonstrate their environmental interest.
The allocation and driving drivers also benefited from 39.1% of the participants of this comprehensive behavioral question, which the classic concepts.
State aid for the transfer of eXcentris
The Quebecer Government, which was asked to participate financially in the transfer of the kino-complex eXcentris, has agreed with cooperation, but only in the form of competitive contribution.
The developer company Angus and the Parallèle company, which had expected to have an expenditure of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to overcome the Daniel Langlois' eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent, had obviously not received what they requested.
Although the government has accepted to participate in this matter, it is in its own conditions.
Instead of the expected spends, the Queensian government offers an increase in lower than the initially obtained height, which could call for a viable solution to the living, at least in view of the sources deleted from the public coffee.
A first plan of action and a request of 12.8 million have already been rejected last spring from Quebec, which has been corrected since it has been repeated.
A proposal, together with a action plan, was already sent by the President of the "Society of Development of the Cultural Entrepreneurship" (SODEC), François Macerola, Minister of St-Pierre, which leads the eXcentris Acts.
A few days ago, he had left her the last report.
However, the opposite of the cabinet was transmitted to the SODEC on midnight.
Parallèle and Angus have now time to answer this to December 31.
In any case, the presses of the State party seem to be truly pressed on the side.
Let us recall that the Quebecer ownership of the Kinos and Kino complexs had refused to make up a direct State investment in supporting the transfer of eXcentris by providing the argument that the Minister of Cultural has not provided financial assistance for real estate projects that he did not allow other kinozens.
However, several other market participants in the segment claimed substantial and economic assistance.
Kinochef Daniel Langlois had presented the author in the areas of his cine complex, which could justify the exception from the State case for ten years.
The lack of cinema that shows independent films is more clearly than that of Montreal, and eXcentris knew to keep his customer at the stage.
The Company Angus, as well as the company parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the pitze, controls a private financing campaign, from which they get a total of $7,000 in order to currency the purchase.
Since spring 2009, only one lenging round continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The future purchaser's goal is to open the three cinemas on 27 February following year with the presentation of the very successful film of Xavier Beauvous "The men and divine".
Christian Yaccarini, however, has not called the newspaper "Le Devoir", and it is ignored what he and his group keeped from the following corrected proposals.
Secret of the complexed Canada
The new, American diplomatic guidelines distributed by WikiLeaks were the secret of what the United Nations considered under the minority complex of the Canadians towards the Americans, but with the same sense, they opened the latest sense of resistance to Canada.
The American diplomates are therefore grateful that the Canadian electioners do not have the Canadian American relations in their election, and they believe that the visit of President Obama had helped the conservative government to implement their 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the American message in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly distributed yesterday, offer more details than the bread of substantial content in which you have to be sweet.
One of the data links from 22 September 2008, i.e. in the period in which the federal election campaign was in full range, reports that the United Nations no longer participate in the income discussed by its political leaders.
For the greatest surprise of David Wilkins, the American messager in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers a number of explanations of this situation.
"In the Canadians nearly inhabited minority complex, the Canadian, political leadership forces may be more likely to speak about internal conflict issues of the daily day than to move the black Peter at this election, as in 1988, on the free trade campaign," he describes.
The United Nations, thus concluded, are therefore "the speaking Goliath of this election: any presentation, but potentially threatening to speak of him".
The messager understands this "exercising style" less than because the two countries have intensive political and economic relations.
"Logistic", he estimates, "If it would be the capacity of a candidate, a party and much more a party to lead to such an essential relationship that the electioner had to be key factor in the meaning of the urgency."
The other expression of this sense of importance reads on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, business advisers in Ottawa, sent to President Barack Obama to prepare his first visit in Ottawa.
"Your travel will help ensure that the Government is continued with confidence on the federal budget at the beginning of February, where Canada has the first deficit known after more than a decade of years, which has resulted in a programme of detention from 30 to 40 billion dollars", describes Brese.
There was no mention that the Government had to be held the Parliament's meeting before Christmas in order to prevent that the parliament would be affected by the coalition and that there would be a further part of the opposition parties to the quality of the proposed relief programme.
Another report from January 2008, which was data-based by the Ambassador Wilkins, in the United States, conscious of Washington's remarkable image that the extracted, dramatic series from the United States.
The messager is worried about sendings such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, where we can observe little subtle reactions to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or also invoices for the purposes of the CIA muscle protze.
Once again, a further report about how Hillary Clinten had asked Bernard Couchner at his first bilateral meeting if Europe is willing to take certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Couchner should have answered the question, but on the basis of a individual "Fall on Fall" decision.
At the end of the meeting, he describes, "what he equipped the State Secretarian a paper in puncto Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Canadian muslim."
"The State Secretariat has commanded to review the documents again."
Finally, let us note that the channels are experienced with regard to the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, a very close adviser, and Stephen Harper, had declared over CBC that the responsibilities of this massive leck should be "compensed".
He was referring to Mike Huckabee from the United States here.
Worldwide Plan for the Renewing of Lightlight
In Cancun, the UNO proposed last night a plan to renew the reliability of household, trade and industry in 100 countries in order to achieve a reduction in the greenhouse gas (FCKW) which meets nearly a third of additional reductions to be achieved in order to stabilize the earthquake climate until 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position at the steps of the concrete major projects that the UNO will implement in cancer in order to compensate the absence of responsibilities of industrial countries.
After the last plan, the main problem would be avoided in the form of 1.8 billion tonnes of the FCKWs issued on the ground if the white-blood birds, which still represent a monopolie of 50 to 70% on the market, would be replaced by fluorescent or better by lightdiodes (LED).
The clarification is responsible for 8% of the global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the disappearance of the world flight park.
In Kopenhagen last year, the major emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and other, including Canada, were bound to voluntary reduction plans, which should be undermined by the global FCKW emissions of 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, from this balance, there should be a decrease of 5 t to stabilize the increase in climate from today to 2020, with a view to preventing that it is not controlled.
In the white bleeding birds 95% of energy is escaped in the form of warmth, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact lightbirds, energy consumption reduces to 75%, with the new LED fluid blends are reduced again twice.
The compact light rings shall be cut between 6000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED-floors, such as those who produced Philips on the market this week - this company has also participated in the UNO study - have a life expectation of 25,000 hours and consumption 80% less energy than a white bird, which provides an adjustment of the possibilities of the exchange plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that you have completely new smooth blowings, they can also operate with a regular resistance.
And they do not contain any checksilbers.
A number of specialists have shown that compakt lightbirds have reserves because they contain cocksilders and that they should therefore be recovered as a special milk which is not always possible in the developing countries, except the producers provide a receipt place.
However, the main sources of checksilber emissions on the planet are not the compact lightbirds, but more than the coal powers that are essentially extracted to generate the electricity bleeding by the white birds.
Only in the United States these coal power works depend on a year of 25,000 tonnes of checksilver.
The report provides details of the profits that will be developed by this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would spend a billion dollars annually when purchasing electricity and eight million tons of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3,5 carbon powers, which would be made by Indonesia 2,5 billion.
Award cost expects the announcement of the results of the election
UNO Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon requested the "indirect" publication of the results of the presidency election of the Elfenbein coast directly after their Friend Table.
"The Secretary-General emphasizes the need for the independent election committee to receive their work and to announce the provisional results without any further appeal," said a UNO Chief.
"He requests all the parties and institutions of the coasts to make evidence of their responsibilities and to include each initiative to the use of the provisional results."
In spite of certain foreign governments, the election committee had the Deadline, which was determined at midnight at midnight, three days after the election on Sunday, without publicing the results.
About 40 minutes ago, the President of the ECI had confirmed in television that the Commission would continue with the work to pronounce the results.
During the mid-day, many times calls from the whole world have been made, but the CEI will finally call the name of the winner of the second election round under the separate Laurent Gbagbo and its opponents Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo Lager is calculated by the Constitution Council, which has been achieved by the former revolters of the new forces (FN) during the period of September 2002.
Pascal Afi N'Guessan, head of the presidency campaign of the iceland coast, had confirmed that the practitioned manuals of the FN to protect the elections in the north of the country had been shocked to go to the candidates of the President.
The whole choice could be canceled if the Constitution Council takes into account the cash set by Gbagbo.
However, the Gbagbo meetings are now more of the view that the Supreme Court of Justice of the country is not neutral, since it is conducted by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely linked to Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a Northern man who is able to deal with the ex-rebels, has estimated the delay in the production of the election results and requested Gbagbo to respect them, even though he has not been so far to demand the winning.
Gbagbo confirms the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost; and a complaint to reach a complaint before the Constitutional Court after he has prevented the election committee to publish the results is illegal.
The second round of the presidency elections were held on Sunday for the completion of a country's association and reconciliation process, which was divided into two parts over a year.
The United Nations had warned in the mid-day afternoon the Politicals of the Lake Bean Coast that they could be able to be held responsible for such explanations.
Laurent Gbagbo had the first election round on October 31, with 38% of the votes against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who had the public support of the former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round), as a spotzen candidate.
The unemployment rate in France remained stabil in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France is 9.3% stable in the Metropolitan International Employee (including 9.7%), thus shows the provision and united information published on Thursday by the Statistics of Insee on Thursday.
The unemployment rate in the metropole is 2.631 million.
The details of the second quarter were 9,3% of the acquired population in the Metropole and 9,7% involved in the overseas departments.
Over the year, unemployment rates increased 0.1 percentage points.
Indeed, 3.4 million employees of the French metropole were not employed in the third quarter, however, they wanted to find a job; in particular, whether they were all available for two weeks or not or if they were requesting or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to deteriorate the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the Metropole (+ 0.9% points within three months, +0.5 percent points over the year) and 25%, including the overseas regions, continued to decrease.
In the third quarter, 637.000 young people were between 15 and 24 years according to information on the unemployment of IAA.
The seniors have to increase the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropole (+0.2 percent points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482.000 of the 50-year-old persons, 6.6% involved in the overseas departments.
Only the 25-49 years were able to benefit from the unemployment stability in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropole (-0.1 percentage point over three months, +0.1 percent points over one year) and 8,8% in France in total.
After an interference on its calculation procedure, the Statistical Federal Office has not been published since 2006 the monthly unemployment rates.
However, Eurostat, the EU Statistical Office, continued to continue in this method and announced a quota of 9,8% in France for October (including the overseas departments) to 9,9% in September.
Alexandre Guerini accused and arrested
A investigation procedure was introduced against Alexandre Guerini, 53, head of a disburse company and Brother of the President of the General Council of the Region Bouches-du-Rhône (PS), and was sent to the prison in Luynes near Aix-en-Provence.
Alexandre Guerini was accused of a submission of social powers, income of general goods, hehlerei, competitiveness in corruption, unlawful insurance and weapons, so its lawyer.
"Alexanndre Guerni has been prepared and has proposed to express its attention to all the questions that the State Authority is put to him, instead of extending the brain pen."
"It's easy to make him a number of punishable punishment points, another thing is to prove this", explained his lawyer Florence Rault of the AFP (Agence France Presse) before listening to his mandate.
Mr Guerini, Brother of Jean-Noël Guerini, the first man of the PS (Socialist Party) in the Department, had given the value to allow the judge to accept a memorandum before his hearing by his lawyer.
A family Guerinis, Philippe Rapezzi, was also accused and arrested at midnight.
According to the lawyer Lucien Simon, she never had done anything else than his depony he had to lead.
As regards the business expertise or the target of the related fund, he would never have known, so Simon.
In this case, however, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Public Service of Abugnana, was sentenced at mid-day because of signing and complexity, then, under the position of maintaining the protagonists of these acts, again on free foot.
"My mandate could give statements to the facts that he had been proposed."
"The leader of the State lawyer has not taken into account his freedom, said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons were sent under charge and were taken out of prison on Wednesday, including two of them under legal supervision, so the Supreme Ombudsman Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, the representative of the Employment Employee Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), is legally followed by the "non-permissions of influence and passive observance".
Two State officials of the Ballation Area Abuagne, Michele Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, due to the title "Interlation and Punishment of Generalgut by a lawyer of the public service", and otherwise because of "Competitiveness in the abuse of public money".
Also, Alexandre Guerini, Jeannie Peretti, was accused of "Herlery and submission of social property".
For those who were represented by Guerini, Stefane Brunnengo-Girard was recently arrested because of a similar case of betraying powers from the public hand, the Corsika had affected.
Factors suspected their society to have involved in taking money from "high" offender creatures.
In April 2009, the investigation against X for the flexibility of public contracts, in particular in the disbursement, is carried out in the records of a number of open investigation procedures.
The investigation is particularly focused on the conditions of the incentive and the operation of a depony in La Ciotat, which also refers to waste from the Afganistan area, as well as from certain cities of the city of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée-Palast overcomes its secondary function for Syria
Over six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher, who was held in Iran for "Spionage", was the French public in Atem, launched the diplomacy in alarm preparation and acknowledged the deterioration of the relationships between Paris and Teheran.
This is all under the attention of the U.S. diplomates.
The American documents received by WikiLeaks and the newspaper "Le Monde" gives some backgrounds to this crisis.
They describe how Elysée declared the Americans its strategy to give this advice to its own crisis of "healths" in Iran (a small group of Wanderers).
They show how the French responsibilities have tried to convince Washington that the release of young Frenchs does not have the release of Majid Kakavand, a prisoner in France, and has been assigned by Iran, because of trade with materials for the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, she sets the way the French Presidency has tried to handle the media in order to make the idea believable, the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad has played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reis in a great light.
Indeed, he did nothing in this regard.
On August 12, 2009, a diplomated telegram in Paris shows the title "Iran: French comments on the way to be conducted with grain."
François Richier, Elysée-Berater in Strategic Questions, was undertaken by Patrice Paoli, Director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen Allgrone.
They explained the French methods.
They called on the Americans to put everything in place to retreat their own nationals who would be violently guarded in Iran.
"Match Larm," they said, "Articulated sound and clearly and without submission" the words "Grund Human Rights", "Unschuld", "free release" in the media.
This is necessary to bring the Iranian regime in a sense that is very slightly respected to his image.
"Do this more, ask the Iranians not to do that."
Because "stable switching does nothing", the discussions surveyed on an unexpected way, the Iranians are "Master in Exhibition".
Mr Richier adds that the celebration of foreign countries is a "smiling and Iranian tactic": "Accession for political pressure."
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reis from the prison (which should come on August 16, when it flys to the French message) "assum the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians" (230,000 cupation).
And he allows it to rely, that Elisea anticiphers, a phenomenon that "sweetheart".
The Iranians could "arrestly arrest one of about 800 French citizens who live in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Riiss has been abandoned from prison 12 days ago, however, it will continue to be held in Iran.
The Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States is requested for illegal trade with embedded electronic material to Iran, has been dismissed from the sentence of a judge in Paris.
The American message comes, as many other observers, questions about this unclean coïncidence.
For Washington, who follows the illegal Iran networks of the material provided for for the nuclear programme, Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Has France taken a cook trade in purchase?
The release of Iran against the French people?
On 4 September François Richier firms that this is not the case.
The Elysée, as he says, was not just "surprisely surprised by the decision of the judge," but also tried to stop.
"It has given a rain exchange between the French presidency and the French Minister of Justice" (Actually, Michele Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the right decision," he explains.
Mr Richier also wants to point out that Majid Kakavand is still under the "stricter" supervision of the French secret service.
The Elysée's band chooses a phone number, returns, informs the American diplomat, which the Iranians "defeat in the buildings currently conducted by the Iranian message in Paris".
During the holding of Clotilde Reis in Iran, the Elysée did not believe his efforts to make by means of advertising and the organized "fighting survey", the Syrian president Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "inflicting media role".
Americans do not observe this activity without Iran and notify that the manipulation produces fruit, since several printing items reflect the official French version.
A telegram dating of 25 August 2009 declares "the media blue of the French authorities".
What is based on a lot of " thanksgiving" to Mr Assad, the Paris message is asked.
"From its statements full of loving prices, the French authorities are in secret that they have just aware of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document refers to the reasons for the Elysée to disappear this section.
He analyzed the intensive communication efforts to confirm Sarkocy's opening policy against Syria.
A 2008-launched policy, which was then understood by many critical votes in France and foreign countries.
"The Syrian role constructing" is trying to lead to "Syria before the eye that you can achieve by playing a constructive role in the region".
It is also a goal to "consider between Syria and Iran".
The American message knows this from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier acknowledged her: "We do not know whether the Syrians have always done anything."
"But we thanked everything with them."
"This should at least be confused with the Iranians."
Clotilde Riiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes her in the Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanks the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role for the release of our countryman".
No online games for young Koreans to Midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "the Aschenbrodel", which is prohibited by the youth to play on midnight Online games by raising the access to them, so they are responsible for the government.
A draft legislation which calls for online players to retain access to these games after 16 years after midnight, will be presented to the Parliament in December, sculpted representatives of the Ministry of Cultural and Family.
"My children play these games all night and have difficulties with learning in the school and also to lead to a normal life daily."
"We think that this law is necessary to ensure their health and right to sleep", explained Jo Rin, with this draft legislation actor of the French Press Agency France Presse.
The online games are then available at 6:00 p.m.
The manufacturers would have made it precise for a year to prepare for the application of the law.
The Government also requested the manufacturers to add the parents to the responsibilities every day for access to these games.
He will also provide free programs available to those who want to limit the time passed on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most “net” countries, and the newspapers regularly report from various, intensive Internet uses events.
The country is also unfavourable Champion in global online game competitions.
In November, South Korea had four gold medals in the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
World Meeting 2018-2022: the FIFA names the Country of Direction
The FIFA's Executive Committee on Thursday, 2018 and 2022, is a higher political choice in which the rail to influence and the lobbying can threaten the technical criteria in the background.
One thing, however, is sure: the 2018 exhibition of the FIFA's reign disciplin will be held in Europe, its traditional hochburg (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain and Portugal, the Netherlands).
The 2022 issue will then be extraordinary; the International Football Association hopes that it can win new territories (Katar, Australia) for themselves, or continue to pursue its discharge in the United States or in Fernost (Japana, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Emir of Katar, Belgian and Dutch government head, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) provides the measurement of the economic and political use of a world master.
The powers behind the cults are, therefore, threatening to keep up the last minute.
Nevertheless, it is difficult to create a hierarchy of the candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portugal (2018) and the US (2022) data are more arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so weak for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the choice.
The Sunday Times, who was in the beginning of the enthusiasm, had also been able to destroy the possibilities for its own country, the ways of the football, which had only one time the world's mastership, that was 1966.
The BBC had once again given the floor on Monday by extracting a documentary report that took three influentious members of the Committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa lifeou.
Suffice to strengthen the FIFA and to bring the English responsibilities that, in the main context of David Cameron, had employed intensive lobbying in recent weeks.
The Head of Government hopes to re-establish the shooting achieved by Tony Blair, who had achieved the organization of Olympic Games in London in 2005 for the year 2005.
Should this intensive use be sufficient to restore the image of England before the committee?
Nothing is less safe, since the Duo Spain-Portugal does not lose the dumps with its already prepared stages, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the economic and financial shadow sides of the two countries could defeat their ambitions.
The possible repressions against the English countries and the doubts about Spain and Portugal allow Russian opportunities to become a weighter outdoor, despite his shoes in the hospital (Stadian, hotels, transportation).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided that the unreasonable enthusiasm appealing to the views of the English press "a unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" was the members of the Committee.
"It works with drecks, you're trying to compromise them," said Putin.
For 2022, the United States seem to be strengthened by the experience of 1994 to be logical favorites.
The first economic world force, the seat of the FIFA head officers, seems to have a long list of benefits against Japan and South Korea, which separately have established a very beautiful project.
However, these new candidates seem to be satisfied for two countries who had organized competitive fights in 2002.
Another threat: the WM 2026 WM 2026 offered by the FIFA warm authorisation for China, which will cause Asian opportunities in 2022.
With Australia and catalogue, which had taken all registers with the expectation of future stages, the FIFA follows its expansion in direction of new areas, but these two countries are a greater risk than consciousness.
Australia, as well as Japan and South Korea, could have suffered from the deficiencies of television rights acquired by the European countries (from the time disappearance), the FIFA's positive nerve.
Second mandate: openness
The Gaulle was really trained.
We had to believe he'd be shocked.
Valery Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the lowest teeth.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is less than this.
A mandate in the Elysée calls the next home.
The current head of the State will be a candidate in 2012.
But the opening is not a good face to the side of the mystery arrested by the Presidency function.
So you have to do like if the question is going to be.
In one, as well as in the other sense.
2006, attendants Jacques Chiracs suggested that a third mandate was not excluded without believers themselves.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy in a serious tone insured his decision to take "every time in the summer of 2011".
That he would allow the perspective of "twelve mandates" at the service adjoint in Elysée before the UMP parliamentarys, then a little fiberliness was distributed.
Was that the official announcement of his candidature?
It's missing.
The President recalled only that the 2008 Constitution change was limited to the number of five-year official periods.
He made a statement, no proclamation.
It is not the first time that he mentioned the election of the presidency on such meetings in a humor sound.
"You have even seven years old with me, or mostly," he explained in July 2009.
To a new in May 2010, "Do not believe I do not think about the phase later."
His words of premature do not make him more to the candidate than on the Sunday, but not less.
If they call comments, then it is a double reason.
The acceleration of the flow to the candidature with the PS on one side.
However, it is not the inclusion of competition with Segolane Royal, the Nicolas Sarkozy aims to reveal themselves.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidate in 2012, which many members of the PS are more early than accepted for combating.
The bad surveys on the other side.
The electioners of the right would first present a candidate of François Filon from Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate, and there are no discussions with the UMP," directly and carefully reacted the area of the Prime Minister.
"If he could find a shock as possible, he wouldn't be candidate", shares Jean-Pierre Rapharin.
"He will always believe to be able to be blessed," corrected Alain Juppee, who found himself with the opening.
Euro: the ECB has been able to keep its purchases of state sampling
The last assembly of the Central Bank Council of the ECB in the past year should provide opportunities to show how to come from the crisis, or at least proclaim a large number of unconventional measures in the monetary policy to end the year.
The crisis of the European State debt imposes that the Central Bank in Frankfurt can, of course, not be able to make any doubt, even today, more than an encouraging situation on the European markets in the way that it is not aware of their deterioration.
The political costs would be too high.
The French Financial Minister, Christine Lagarde, has welcomed last night the role of the press conference taken by the ECB for the solution of the State debt of Europe.
It has not to say whether it is the view that the Central Bank can do more, for example by adjusting its programme of purchase of State assets.
"I keep my considerations for my European trade partner (...)."
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, in Brussels, had not shown its consultation by the Economic and Monetary Committee of the European Parliament very well-being about his projects but much more joyfully to point out that the programme of purchase of State samplings would be "extensive" on the second market and that we will be viewed at the meeting on Thursday, as the decisions are taken."
Only awareness: the ECB will decide its responsibilities unchanged by 1%, the historically lower level since May 2009.
In practice, the obligation purchase of the shadow chamber was doubled by the ECB last week to approximately 1,35 billion euros.
And according to the discretions of some handlers, she should have made new purchase to Irish and Portugal states last night.
Overall, the Eurosystem central banks have been purchased up to 67 billion euros since May 2010.
There is no doubt of the anticipation of the purchase rate (see page 29).
People's experts have no longer expected to change a considerable course.
If the ECB arsenal operations of over three months have already been lost, the latter will still be made to the unlimited financial reserves on a free-government type, either for a period from one week to three months.
People's experts have already found that this measure will be extended for a few months.
"I can't imagine that the ECB will change its programme into a substantial way."
"In some cases she would risk producing new shoes in short view," said Michael Schubert, the commercial bank's people.
"A progressive expansion for the first quarter of 2011 seems to me likely to be more likely", is the contrary to the Norbert Bröms, the civilist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the field of its interventions on the market of State debt, the ECB should "conserve such a purchase volume of obligations which lives in the market," adds Norbert Brüms.
In view of the reliance of the European Bank's position on the markets of State debt in the euro area, the Central Bank has no choice to keep its presence on the market.
"They must go to the market at any price to the employees of the lack of investors and act in such a way to prevent the premature injury of the rates paid to the weakest states," said last night an important obligation manager.
Because if the interest rates for higher flights would still prevent the States to reduce or to stabilise their debt.
This is the price for the euro protection.
The Berlusconi government is going to deck in Italy
After a week-end that was worried for Italy, the situation last night was a little disappointed with the decline of ecksins for 10 years.
A return to the Trinity Style.
At the end of the meeting with the Ministry of Economy, President Giulio Tremonti had the situation as "undecimal" and heard him with a "unforeseen" weekend, which was, however, immediately declared.
On Thursday, with the German interest rates, the shoes had reached its record of 210 base points, and the prices of the contracts to cover the competitive risk were at 263 points, which had been a certain deficiency in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi, with his Minister, pointed out that the Discrimination of Spain is at 400 basis points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, was expressed as "who concerns" by the "marketburencing" and a possible shocking drive from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third of the euro zone, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The worst news is that Italy is like Portugal", says Irwin Stelzer, the Hudson Institute.
In the clear text, the problem is the decline of economic growth and the inadequate, slow-energy tax operations that the State risks not to cover its financing needs.
The last Brussels prognoses were a cold duche for the government.
An Italian growth of 1,1% in 2011 and of 1,4% in 2012 is expected to be expected, although the budget at the Senate is estimated to be of 1,3% compared to 2%.
In these conditions, as calculated by the Commission, the budget deficit will still be 4.3% of the GDP in the next year (as compared to 3,9%) and 3,5% in 2012 (notably 2,7%).
It is therefore also a new budget collection that could be used after the holidays to a sum of EUR 7 billion.
"If you need, you must take new sperm measures", says the Employer Olli Rehn.
Italy receives support for international institutions for hours.
"The fundamental festivals of Italy's economy are normally and its accounts are regulated, which we have been repeated for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian Countries of the International Monetary Fund, which is involved in the IWF with Italy.
"At the time there are no problems, nor short-term, nor long-term views, since Italy, despite its high debt (119.2% of the GDP in 2011, A.d. R.) is requested to reduce stabilisation slower than other countries," observes Pier Carlo Polan, Chief Vulks Factor of the OECD.
The question remains after the political inadequacy.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will be viewed as a disrespect of the Chamber, which could be organized by the electoral elections already finally in March.
It is therefore a little favourable period for a decision-making regarding a serious crisis.
Europeans think about the development of anticrisis measures
Christine Lagarde has expressed it in the context of a press conference in Paris expressly: "I think you still have proved it on Sunday and evening: the Europeans are clearly together, are ready and engaged to defend their currency and their monetary area."
Although it is relatively relatively - the last decline in the interests of the European State obligations was water on the currency of governments and the ECB.
However, from a normalization begin, it can not be the talk.
The Standard & Poor's Rating Agency had announced that it could reduce the debt note of Portugal, which is probably the most effective goal of the spectrums today.
"When in May there is a real lack of clarity and political reliability, especially on bank systems", says the opinion of the exane BNP Paribas's peoples.
In particular, "the political time is much less than the markets".
The European countries, which are well conscious of this pledge as well as of the dangers that are rejected there, are increasing the discussions to strengthen the anti-crisis measures already existing.
The informal discussions between the most direct financial ministries and, in addition, with their opposite to the G20.
And this is also about the meetings of Eurogroups and Ecofin in the beginning of the next week.
The ECB is here today.
The scheme provides the loss of unconventional measures to reinforce the European Zone countries in the faden cross of the markets (see below).
As regards the EU Stability Fund, its Executive Director Klaus Regling has already started its Asian tour on Tuur in Singapore to inform the investors in the television on developments regarding the crisis in Europe.
Although his goal is not explicitly foundation, he will certainly prepare the terrain.
The first public expenditure from the EU Stability Fund shall be provided for for the next month.
Last night, a official American representative of the Agency Reuters had acknowledged that the United States supported a potential increase in the additional, direct commitment of the IWF mobilized fund.
Portugal and Spain, mostly the countries, are being sent to structural reforms, especially in the field of the labour market.
Reforms to be added to the scope measures, but the effects in the near future are to be shown.
Lisbon and Madrid strive another way than Greece and Ireland.
While the one, as well as the other, is to avoid any price, must be provided international assistance before they set up their own budget correctives and have decided on insufficient structural reforms that reverse their confidence during the period.
European capital employees are reaffirmed by the options available to accelerate the normalization process of the markets of State grants.
Axel Weber, who was on the journey of Paris on November 24, had first found the idea that if the 750 million euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund would not be sufficiently mobilized, the Union would not be able to spend again into the own task.
The public experts of Barclays Capital, as regards the market of European State debt, would be judged in the main part of the existing actors, would be sufficient to extend around 100 billion euros, "preventive" as a direct flexibility sphere.
This means that the European financial stabilisation mechanism, currently 60 billion euros, exists.
A Cohesion that has all opportunities to be examined in the main cities of the European Union.
In particular, if the market conditions are adjusted.
Snee and Flower: 24 departments in Alarm level Orange
Snee episodes continue to have transport difficulties, in particular in the secondary transport networks of Britain and threaten to affect different economic activities.
Fourty departments are now in the alarm rate of persons because of the threatening snee and glatteis risk.
The regions of you, Eure-et-Loir, Doux-Serevres and Vienna have already been accompanied by 20 departments in the alarm period; 18 from midday and two, Dordogne and the Girondes, later in the night.
According to Meteo France, the intense snowviewers tangle the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it sneaks easy on the ee-de-France.
In the departments concerned, swimming pools of 2 to 5 cm are expected from 7 to 10 cm and 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
These are the regions Charente, Charente-Maritime, Coasts d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou, and the Basse-Normandia, Ile-de-France and Limousin regions.
The snakes are precisely enough to call trafficking disorders and to affect certain economic activities, says Mtéto France.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional routes are covered for the weakening of over 7.5 tonnes, including the transport chains Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudeac.
The transport situation in the secondary transport networks in Britain is very difficult, according to the transport police, which made it possible to use the vehicle only in emergency, and the use of some TER travelbuses has been over the whole day.
In Picardie, the school transport was decreased on Thursday.
No specific measures were limited at the mid-day period.
The prefecture " demands the drivers to take greater attention to the streets and to adjust their conduct."
The Directorate-General for Zivile Aviation (DGAC) invited the airlines to strike 25% of her from the Paris Airport Roissy and 10% of the flights starting from Orly because of the expected, strong snow accidents.
The DGAB recommends that passengers contact their airlines.
Gatwick airports in South London, as well as the airport in Edinburgh, Skotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial skizzen
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport industry in the Ile-de-France is in full gathering, billions of them rest.
At least in the debates.
In particular, the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris, which is intended to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to lead to the construction begins of the SGP, the State has called a capital cost of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the amount that the SGP would enable sodans to provide a part of the financial sum on the markets to their two times.
Today it has finally come to first high-counters.
The 2010 Supplementary Budgetary, following this prior day, by the Financial Commission of the National Assembly, provides the measures necessary to allocate the first part of these money.
This is two measures: the creation of a special tax on closure and a higher tax tax of offices in the Ile-de France.
First, in this way, article 15 of the draft legislation, it is "the largest public and legal officer of the Society of Great Paris".
This is decisive: "The product of this tax is of 117 million euros per year".
Secondly, a new regulation of the already existing undertakings is: "To modernize these to increase the product of its allocating product and to overcome this increase in the company of Grand Paris."
How much would it take?
It's a race.
This amount is not covered in the text.
From 4 billion are far away.
"It is concluded that the tax resources will be calculated to the $4 billion of the capital dotation that the State is covered and the company of Grand Paris will be paid after and after the project," says the explicit statement.
In the SGP, this system is not adverse.
"After the moment of receipts (the two taxes, D.R.), the projection can be cut over three years and then create only 4 billion."
"This is notified in the budget and after and afterward."
The SGP claims that 2013 will be started to notify the $4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measures, which have been able to search for four billion, are dangerous to move a right to call a parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting is held on 7 December.
Sweet hacker and exhibition span
The WikiLeaks business has a double importance.
On one side, she has been skandal, a skandal, which is only a skandal in the sense of scandality, which dominates the relationship between States, citizens and presss.
On the other hand, it announces deep changes at the international level and gives a shock to the future dominated by government.
But let's go to the line.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each of the data created by a secret service (a x-favoured nation) is uniquely composed of newspapers.
The "Austrian" American enthusiasms about the sexual habits Berlusconis do nothing more than what you have been reading over months as well as in every x-beloved newspaper (except those who owns Berlusconi) and the horrible carcinourized profile Gaddafis boxed cabare artists for their sketch for a long time.
The rule that the secret folders may only exist from known news is essential for the dynamic of secret services, and that is not just in this century.
If you go into a library that goes to the ethics publications, you will recognize that every work (over the Gral, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Temple or the Rose-Greuzer) is exactly repeating what is already written in previous works.
This is therefore not only because the author does not want to publish research (but therefore he did not wonder where news about non-existence), but because those who are swinging to the Okcultism, believe nothing else than what they already know and confirmed what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
Also the secrets.
The informant is faul, and faul (or restricted spirit) is also the chief of the secret service (otherwise it may always be anything, for example, editor of delivery), which is just considered true what he recognizes.
The Top Secret information about Berlusconi, who sent the American message in Rome to the State Decree, were the same as those who had already published Newsweek the week before.
Why, therefore, was this a relief made for the intensifications of these dossiers?
On one side, these things that every person has already known, as the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then the government leaders can call themselves towards themselves, or a flight to take themselves to the dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and have changed, except some small representations, to sponsor centres.
Each favorite observer of films knows this very accurate, and it doesn't happen from virginity that you do so to ignore this.
However, the fact to repeat it publicly affects the task of cycling and serves to put the American diplomacy into a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that a x-favorite hacker can attack the most secret secrets of the most powerful country of the world, is a major shock against the press of the State democracy.
Furthermore, the scandal has less the victims than the "Scarfrichters" in circumstance.
But let us imitate the deep nature of what happened.
Anyone, at Orwell’s times, all powers were like a great brother who controlled every spirit of his undergrounds.
Orwell's prophecy would have been fully cleared where every movement can be controlled by the phone, every active transaction, the visited hotel, the selected cars and so on; the citizens would be the total sacrifice of the eye of the power.
But if you go before the eye, what today comes to, that yourself the secret crypties of the power can't get out of the control of a hacker, then you hear the control flow to be one-sided and will be circumcised.
The power controls any citizens, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the race of the citizen, can experience the secrets of the power.
But how can a power be maintained that is not yet possible to realize their own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said that a real secret is a white secret (and a empty secret can never be enthusiasmed); it is also true that every knowledge about the Charakter Berlusconis or Merkels is a secret of secret, because it is presuming the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks, it is also true that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were emphasized empty secrets, which means to exercise every power.
WikiLeaks did no Sarkozy nor Merkel, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this limitation, which has been added to such a violent power?
It is obviously obvious that the countries will not make any more online information in the future - that would be the same as one in the road line.
But it is also obviously clear that it is hopeful to keep confidential reports on phones with the current technologies.
Nothing is easier to find out whether and when and when a head of State has continued and one of his colleagues has contacted.
How can a particular relationship in the future and only for certain ears be maintained in the future?
I'm very glad that my prediction is at the moment to science fiction and romantic, but I see the need to present me to the government agents in a secret way moved on uncontrolable shoes, their communications are not different than in the blue memory, and in addition, the few written information they have obtained in the shooting.
The information would be accompanied in only copy in closed papers: on the basis, the sponage of Watergate was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology today advances like cancer, namely back.
A century after the dragonless telegraph revolutionated the communication, the Internet rebuild a telegraph with (telephone) drast.
The (analogues) video boxes allowed the film researchers to study a band band by switching from behind to the top and switching all the secrets of the assembly, while today the (numeric) CDs do not allow anything else than to break chapters to chapters, i.e. in macro proportions.
With the high speed drives, three hours from Rome to Mayland, while this is required by aircraft including three and a half hours.
It is therefore not exceptional that policy and communication technology returns to cars and horses.
A last observation.
In previous times, the press tried to understand what was lost for secrets between the messages.
Currently, it is the message that calls confidence information from the press.
Climate: How France makes his financial promises
A year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to investigate the compliance of the rapidly resolved finances (and called "Fast Start" or "Fast Start" finances) achieved by the developing countries.
And it's already discovered the big French beauty.
The Copenhagen Treaty imposed the developing countries to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised 7.2 billion euros over three years, France 1,26 billion euros (e.g. 420 million per year).
In response to the opening of the COP16, the EU took all registers to convince their partners in the fact that their commitment towards the financing of fast-state finances: detailed action report of their Member States, press conference, large neighbouring events, brochure distribution.
Transparency is noted and estimated for its real value: the developing countries and the civil society will be pleased if all developing countries were the same level at the same level.
In 2010, the EU announced that 2,2 billion euros have been released, which brings them to the right way to address respectful commitments of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if you look in detail, the things are a little more complex.
In accordance with the Copenhagen Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" to ensure that an additional use has been introduced without reaching the part of the public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus about what "new and additional" means.
While the Commission proposed a harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today everyone chooses the right value he considers as the best.
For example, the Commission has implemented its guiding value for those in 2009: the international financing will be maintained and provides 150 million in the framework of the Financing of the "Fest State" for three years.
Other countries have chosen similar guidance values in respect of year or conditions at the level of public development aid.
On the contrary, France believed that the financing of "other new projects" in 2010 was "new and additional."
In other words, there are no direct values in the expenditure of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
Concretely, the total amount of French support may remain stable (or decreased) - France proposes to maintain its commitment to the "new and additional" financing.
Another, decisive element is the decryption in loans and loans.
There is no rule on this, and everyone chooses his account mode.
Some, such as France, have 1 € as equivalent to 1 divided €.
Obviously, this is only difficult to divide: the pressure is not comparable.
In the case of the use of loans for certain rentables investments (or, at the time, in the recognition of emissions based on more effective technology), it is strict to present the euro, which is an equivalent for an independent euro... and should also be calculated only the costs of the payment for the capital sharement (e.g. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing different than the following transmissions: it "respect" its obligation of 420 million euros by taking 91.5% payments (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% depends) 36.1 million euros - see the EU document to convince themselves.
France is the only EU country that uses grants in a large scale.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (e.g.) to meet their commitments to 100% with costs.
On the other hand, if the overwhelming majority of the European Union has to comply with its obligations, France is only 10 percent and understands comparable use.
Beautiful Hokuspokus!
All of them operates France in its fast-state financing with a double skin: in part, with a further development of the action through time, and on the other hand, with the reality of the financial use.
France is able to believe that 420 million "new and additional" million have been issued in accordance with his promise and that 36.1 million euros there are.
The manipulation of the Financial Ministry (which seems to have been Bercy, who has carried out the arbitration) could be a double negative effect; once the EU internal (which continues to go on with the other Member States if it is sufficient, and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not fully disappointed...
The chapter of the financing is only a small question of relatively short time compared to the overall discussions on climate.
But it could be too much in the great machine of UNFCCC.
Let's hope that this will not be the case.
As always, it is impossible to learn its lessons from this first year of funding.
First of all, France could announce a change in its type of negotiation for 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and the balanced justice with the other countries of the European Union.
However, in particular, France could follow the discussions on the strictness of long-term funding (a different, crucial and currently discussed theme): it does not understand the question of the "comparability" or the type of negotiation of its loans.
France could change his position in order to be continued to be the issues of conflict, as it is in other matters.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister of Environment Kosciusko Morrizet, which will be taken next week in Cancun.
A surprising advertising on the fast standard of France and its vision of "accentability" and the use of loans by nature would increase from the international confidence based that is necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - Pestizide taken by children
A 10-year-old child takes 81 different chemical substances, so a study published by the Association Generations Futures (ancient movement for the protection of the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which declared that its results "in view of the small number of analyzed samples, no statistically significant value, but represents the illustration dimensions of the problems treated", generally purchased within four, from some ten-year-old foods consumed at the feedtimes more a intermediate time in the Oise and Paris supermarkets.
These typical foods - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and vegetables, three milk products and 1,5 litres water per day - were also investigated as laboratory nascheries in searching for chemical substances, pesticides, sweat metals and other harmful substances.
The thermost balance is: 81 chemical substances, including 42 as possible or probably cancer, and five as safe cardiogen classified, as well as 37 substances with endocrine stroke factors, indicates studies of several institutions, such as the International Cancer Research Center.
"If, in the nearest totality of the cases, the legal limitation for each chemically individually accepted substance is not exceeded, this injury is very good that the reality in which the consumption may be employed with the endocrine factor is concerned", notes the association.
Prepared at breakfast includes only the butter and the tea with milk already more than ten of the cancer-related residues and three safely as carcinogens, as well as more than twenty residues that may affect the hormonal system.
The imported apples from Brazil, as a interim time for the study, covers six chemical substances, including one prohibited in France.
The same applies to the green bones from Kenya, enclosed in the midday, in which the study showed a strictly banned insectionality in the EU.
Moreover, the hacksteak, the thunfish from the bridge, even the bagate and the purchase of pestizids and other chemical substances.
The analysis have lighted the presence of nitrates and cloroforms.
During the evening, the lake store was covered with 34, the chemical residues of the "richest" and even the plastics used for the refrigeration of the meal in the microwave were not unclean.
The essential risk of this "shadow cocktails" for the consumers is probably underestimated, says the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology Les Verts (EE-LV) proposed "the face of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pestizides to stop the "reduce of civilization diseases".
A study of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was identified in July with regard to the presence of residues of 365 different, identified in fruit and vegetables consumption in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
