Buach: More security for footballers
They are not 100 meters away from each other: on Tuesday, the new B 33-food house is taken in the village park, in view of the older house.
Two installations so close to each other: destiny or shield citizens?
This question has been clearly answered by the Citizen Meeting last night.
"The Council House has been installed at that time because it ensures the school road," he explained eckert yesterday.
The club equipment is safe for both radars and bus trains and the mountainle inhabitants.
The installed last night officially operated is important for the crossing area of sulzbachweg/Kirchstraßes.
We have the museum, two churches, the curpark, the bus centre, a doctor and a bank and the transport flow from the residence area ›Grub.
"Besides the high transport and footsteps, the security of which was to be made a further pack," said Eckert.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold by the Country Council of Offenburg.
"In the current measurements of the B 33 days, about 12 000 vehicles are the municipality of Goodach, which are about 10 percent of swimming loading", says Arnold.
So the construction of another building should be more than necessary: "Security is simply about here", says Arnold.
In total, four transport views were carried out, and a circle movement was also considered, but reaffirmed by the crossing area of sulzbachway/Kirchstraßes.
According to Arnold, at the location of the mass before it was tested: "What an extra for us with specially long wooden transporters we have shown whether these vehicles can go out of the sugarway to the B 33 without switching the mass."
The current "modern that it presents on the market" explained Arnold.
The installation is equipped with pharmaceutical LEDs that lights so strong that lighters of the vehicles are well recognised, for example, at a deep sun.
And smooth is also: the older light devices consume about 100 Watt, the new eight times Watt.
Pro drivers have three light installs.
Arnold explained the technology of the new installation: This is equipped with two radar sensors.
By pressing the footsteps the ample button, the upper ray sensor tests the transportation position.
If the road is free, green comes directly for the footballer, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be completed for the feet.
"If a group or disabled people walk on the road, the green phase is extended, so everyone is safe about the trains", said Arnold.
Of course, the driver should consider here as a partner and observe the trains.
This wasn't the case last night: the crowd showed the ample for green footballers, a top class packaging out - at light red.

A Blackbox in the car?
American road planners are searching for a money source to repair the falling highway system, and believe that they have found the solution in a small black box that is found in each car area.
The devices recording each kilometer driven and reporting the information to the authorities are the key point of a contraventional attempt from Washington and the Federal States' planning office to revise the old system for the financing of US-American roads.
The normally more long-term area of the road planning has recently been a intensive debate with close alliances.
Freedoms have linked to environmental groups and expressed themselves that the Government can use the small boxes for the registered kilometers – and possibly where they were carried out – and the information can then be used for the calculation of tax decisions.
The Tea Party's been displaced.
The American Citizenship of Civil Rights (ACLU) is also very concerned and expresses a number of concerns of data protection.
However, while it is not possible to take some steps in the Congress, several federal States are not waiting longer.
They are currently checking how they can change to a system during the next ten years, paying the driver per mile.
Thousands of drivers have already tested drivers with some with GPS supervision.
This is really a museum for our country.
“It’s nothing we can use only,” said Hasan Ikhrata, head of South California Assn. of governments, who plant a record of the mile to all Kalifornies cars in the Federal State from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology is there.
The initiative comes at a time since the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed from taxes, is created by Americans at the shoeboard.
But in the United States it isn't so much as previously.
Autos consumpte less benzine.
The State Mineral Oil Tax of 18.4 cent per Gallone (for more than 4 euros per liter) has not been increased for 20 years.
Politicals do not have high prices to increase the tax only for a hundred.
“The benzine tax is simplely unacceptable” says Lee Munich, a expert on transport legislation at the university of Minnesot.
His Federal State has recently equipped 500 cars with drivers to test a milk-based payment system.
“This makes the long-termest alternative,” he said.
Office grades call it as milk-based user payments.
It is not surprising that the idea of urban liberalians is income, for instance, the tax had been used to influence the driving behavior so that steady and climate disappearance would be reduced.
The California Plans set up the system in developing strategies with a view to reaching the ambitioned, legally enhanced objectives of the State on climate change.
However, the Republicn Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, Chairman of the House's Transport Committee, also stated that he sees the most long-term alternatives.
Also, the free marketers of the Reason Foundation are designed by the idea to allow drivers to pay for returned roads.
“This is no tax that disappears in a black loch,” says Adrian Moore, Vice-President for Reason Directives.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers, which requested the Congress in 2011 to move on a mile-based calculation.
The US Senate adopted a $90 million of your pilot project that had included 10,000 cars last year.
However, most in the Representative House prevented the discussion and reacted to the concerns of deputy from rural areas that people who have to return every day a lot of miles on the way to work or to the city.
several states and major cities are not moved on their own faults in this direction.
The most engaged Oregon is currently 5,000 drivers for the greatest experience of the country.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage expenditure instead of the mineral oil tax to the State.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City also produces such a.
Illinois tests it in limited measures with Lkws.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the Ministry of Transport of 17 states in the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently investigating how to introduce the change.
The concept is not universal heat.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers had been equipped with the devices recently, car drivers were skeptically thinking that the government could follow each of their movements.
“Remember to Big Brother and such things were a great problem” said Alauddin Khan, head of the Strategic and Results Management Ministry of Nevada.
People didn't want it.
When tested, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: “It would be relatively simple to convert drivers into adult supervision devices.”
It is not necessary to build a giant, sperm technological infrastructure that would be used unnecessaryly to cover data about the daily movement of individuals.
Nevada is part of a number of federal States that now holds a view of a skilled technology, with which the State can take the kilometers driving, but not exactly when and where.
So, Khan, the public would also be quiet.
The Jagd after this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company named True Mileage in California.
The company has not occurred originally to assist federal States in the tax of vehicles.
Moreover, it was its goal to cover in a strict market for Kfz insurance feet where drivers should pay on the basis of the trained miles.
But the devices tested are also interesting for the road planners because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that are regularly loaded by modem.
“The people are worse ready to participate in when their speed and locations are not registered,” said Ryan Morrison, director of True Mileage.
In some of these public pilot programs, great errors were made.
There are significantly more and less intrusive opportunities to implement this.
In Oregon, the planners experience to give a number of optional opportunities to drivers.
You can decide for a device with or without GPS.
Or they do not choose any device and pay a loan expenditure based on the average miles driven by all people of the state.
Other agencies hope to be able to sell the concept of a mixed public by providing the devices with more functions than less.
In New York City, a vehicle official wants to develop a tax device that allows it to pay park costs, an insurance must be paid only for kilometers driven, and the speed data of other vehicles in real time, with which the car driver can evacuate.
“Auditors would be motivated to participate in a planning document of the city by the greater value of the benefits offered by the system.”
Some transport plans, however, ask whether the whole speech of payment per miles is not only a huge decrease manner.
At the Metropolitan Transport Commission, officers explained the area of San Francisco Bay, the Congress could simply solve the problem of the highway Trust Fund by increasing the fuel tax.
Additional single payment or an annual depth may be carried out by vehicles with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consumpte little benzine, so that they pay a correct share.
“ There is no reason for a operation if a aspirin is sufficient,” says Randy Rentschler, Head of Legislation and Public Affairs of the Commission.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers will take care of their privacy and many other things.
Royal field: Small management wakes
The volunteer's voluntary fire shocked its herbs top test, despite personal failures with Bravour.
Only 11 men took part in the training.
Commander Hans Kammerer, in his surgery, had seen the presence of the Federation in the Burgberger Street.
There should be a short conclusion at the seed.
The fallen burning and the development of smoking were damaged by two people, but one of them could send an emergency call.
Two breath protectors of the leg were prepared after the first review of the castle by Hans Chammerer to participate in the building.
After a short time, it began to find the first person and lead to free.
The second person had to be taken.
This wasn't so simple that it was to overcome a close trap.
The building was not easy to secure a workplace with integrated steel for two horses.
It was a lot of wood and also strohballs there.
There were still electric machines for wood processing.
The first shock was followed by the tank in the vehicle.
Another guide was followed by a overflow hydrogen in about 100 meters away.
Now there were three solutions.
In the building, there was also a hot rail rail rail in the building.
Hans Chammerer was also showing what is to be edited with little available staff.
In real case, support is held on the king's day-to-day group.
The commander showed satisfaction with the end of the exercise.
Connection of high schools and companies is important
On his visit in the countrycraft Breisgau-Hachschwarzwald, President Guido Wolf also explained where the workers came from tomorrow.
In the Summit Centre, he and the directors of the professional schools, the Gymnasium and the President of the Council of Parents in this important question were attended in the support centre.
"Education is an important position factor", said Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma School, who presented the connected school project education center high-school.
Thus Wolf expressed its impression on the model projects for training.
Since 2011, in the forest, there is a successful cooperation between the Food Centre, the Gymnasium and the Professional School Center.
He also loving the family friendship in the country crowd.
"It is important not only to have the family phases in view, but also the phase for the care of families, because of the demographic change, is also the stage towards the care of the family," said Wolf.
He also argued that the employees were increasingly careful about the work and care of their families.
"No support of employees can lead the resulting charge of employees to an end of the labour relationship," said Wolf.
But nobody could lend himself to lose qualified workforce, he said he continued.
Another, especially important factor is the linking of high schools and enterprises.
"Whoever has learned the proposals of the region during his study remains with his acquisied knowledge and its ability often in the regional economy, which is involved in strengthening the region," the President of the country has convinced.
Because only if there would be sufficient training places, the expert needs can also be covered.
His opinion is that the location of the Cruz is its advantageous situation in South-East Germany, directly close to France and Switzerland.
He also experienced on his train train from Titisee-Nestadt to Freeburg the efforts already undertaken to build public visits.
"Keep still hard and ensure that public transport will be better", he explained to the address of the communal politicians present.
Living a maintained afternoon with music
The family Kull has been prepared for 15 years to enter the dieting senior to coffee, kitchen and then to a vesper.
Before the older people were engaged in the race city.
In the midst, this afternoon is found in St. Josef.
The householders enjoyed the sweet kitchen and torten.
Afterward, there was a swimming salt.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich were able to support melodies.
The old natural stone maws of over 100 years, as a pre-limiting of the old school courts before sanction, are to be re-established with the sanction plan of the city of Bronging.
In the days before the Kilbig, the first work of the sanction of the prior school court was built a small angled, to stabilize and statistical discharge of the old natural stone wall with Balustrade over a hundred years.
Another step is that Alexander Misok, by the Braunlinger Citybuilding Employee, is to participate in the planning and to create an approach to the old wall.
In addition, a cost calculation is intended to be made by experts, which should then be placed to the Council of Common Action to decide and to determine the further action.
A decision on this will be expected to be taken in the next year.
After sanction, planting and tree planting of the Old School Court within the two side flights of the 1912 built schools, it has to be taken as a resulting measure, the need for sanctional restrictions to be sanized and placed on new underbuilding.
The historical, hundred years of old delimitation of the Old School Court to the Kirch Street, is especially through water and frozen damage, because there is no dragon, needs of sanctions and has an overwhelming injury.
Deep shoes in separate stones are caused by weather damages, but the wall is now not threatened.
A steady wall is a condition for one of students to use school courts, which has been performed by the current confirmation work.
It was originally planned for the school sanctions even in 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenditure had been moved.
A major word to the historical schooling that has already been used for film records will be talked to the country's smuggle.
If the provisions from this page come from, then the city hopes that bluns are supported by the thinking protectioners.
The students of the brunling basic school, which are re-instructed again in a well-known old school building with new aula, can immediately use the old school court.
Ozdemir wants to receive Jazzaus training in Stuttgart
In the continuing discussions on the future of the music schools in Baden-Württemberg, Cem Özdemir, Federal Chairman of the Greens, has now been enabled.
"I think it was wrong to leave the universal training in the Stuttgart School," said the Statgart News.
Jazz and classic are just in the Jazz stand of Stuttgart together.
For this reason, Ezdemir, who is a favorite for a direct mandate at the Federal Day, on 22 September, is the Green Red Land Government.
This strengthens a new order of the five music schools in Baden-Württemberg on the basis of a expert study.
In addition, Jazz and Pop’s study course of Stuttgart to the Municipality School of Stuttgart is intended to be moved.
US green: "Super tunnel" for drug polling
At the border between Mexico and the U.S., investigators have discovered and stopped a "Super tunnel" for drug smoking.
As the United States customs authorities informed, the long run between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, rail lines and a shipping plant.
Three suspects were then arrested, eight tons of marihuana and about 150 kg of cocaine.
The tunnel has not been used according to the information.
"These cards are stupid if they think they could be shocked under the radar," said the United States General Countries of Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference before a camp house in San Diego, where the tunnel was discovered.
To the drug groups, Duffy has been assured: "If you continue to build this tunnel and try to use them, we are determined to make it a huge use of your money."
The United States and the Mexican security forces are in a long fight against drug cards.
Since 2006, more than 77.000 people were killed in Mexico with drug crime.
Fabriced by experts
Because of the main equipment of the tunnel, the investigators show that it was built by architects and engineerings and that the construction took about one year.
The closure was so equipped that there could be electrically employed cars.
On the Mexican side, access is located in a building that is 80 meters away from the border.
According to the authorities, a leader is 20 meters deep to the real tunnelling.
The tunnel has a volume of 1,20 m height and 90 centimeter width.
It would also be appropriate to promote the illegal immigration direction of the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in relation to the cocaine friend.
The third, a Mexican, was taken because of the invited marihuana.
All three threatens as the maximum punishment of long-term freedom, as officials said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels were discovered, it continued to be held at the press conference in San Diego.
But it is the first time that it was found in such a tunnelbuilding cocain.
Normally cocain is shocked in smaller quantities and not by tunnel.
This said the "discrimination" of drug groups, whose traditional routes are separated in this way, said Bill Sherman from the DEA drug department in San Diego.
They would do everything to get in the United States.
No details were known to the prisoners, at least one of the mexicans, called it.
You have to be sentenced for ten years.
2014 Child Festival
The Jubilium of the city of Geisingen at 1250.
Repeat the first original consideration is increasingly closer.
If the year ends in good eight weeks, the Jubilee year will be reached.
Gestion and church houses were first mentioned originally 794.
In churches a original origin was made in both places.
On March 15, it is necessary to give an official attack to the Jubilee Year, and since the events have no hall at present, this accommodation is located in the place where both houses were mentioned before 1250 years, in church houses.
In the Jubilee, some events have been planned as well as in the church houses.
The church houses will take place in July at a meeting from 18 to 20 July the 1250.
Another party.
On Friday with a festival, on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the Kirchtalhalle.
In this celebration, also the Church's Hospital Festival is the church feast.
The city's music director Rudolf Barth wrote a composition that is included at three terms for the city.
On June 21, together with the Sunday of the Black Wald Convention, on July 12th, in the Arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of the city music in the new festival hall.
This will be completed and indicated in the Jubilee year, the official term is on September last weekend, on 27 and 28 September.
A new chronic will also be drawn in the sculpture of the city jubilium.
"But a chronic should be not only of smiles itself, but also a printed work on the smiling of today, which is both of gestures, church houses, lips, sweetnesses and goods", says Master Walter Hengstler.
And also the celebration of today's birthday 2014, 1974 the present space was completed with the communities.
The new chronic should then be submitted on 21 or 22 November in the new Festival in Geisingen.
But 2014 is also a year with many Jubilians.
On February 8th, Strohglonki began with a driving advertising at its 60-year-old existence, the harmonie is 90-year-old and has the celebration of the banket and then celebrated the district music celebration on March 29th, and then from 1 to 4th May.
The old work of Leipferdingen is 40 years old, the sculpture school has been a new place for 50 years and celebrated on 10 May, the musician Polyhymnia Leipferdingen is 150 years old and celebrates this in the context of the Brunning Festival from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was mentioned first times originally in the year 764 in one of the cases of the closter of St. Gallen.
The origin was formed in churches (audience) that was then the court.
Both communities are mentioned in the same origin.
Based on 2014 to celebrate this 1250-year-old year, in addition, the Community reform is still back to 40 years.
The Council adopts a view to the vision
Should the "Am Hirschen" transit be reconstrued in order to increase transport security?
Yes, the communities have decided.
Schillach needs to take $220,000 in hand.
In the next year, the German Bahn will enhance the thirty-first trails.
In particular, the safety of rail transit transits is to be increased - it is regularly slow to collisions of trains with other vehicles.
If the Communities vote towards the reconstruction measures, they must participate with a third party in the costs, share the remainder.
Schillachs city construction Meister Roland Greecehaber explained the Council of the Commonwealth specialities of the "Am Hirschen".
The city plants the city to build an exhibition in the west of the train line at the height of the tunnel Monde.
There could also be larger vehicles, such as transporting long-earths, to be incontracted without having to block the shoes.
Greece has therefore proposed to build a necessary funder so that the city could extend the road to the next time to give, in order to ensure unresolved transport flow.
This was discussed in the Joint Council, since some routines were doubtless the need for a road distribution: Thomas Kipp brought with his expression the stimulation of the critics on the point: "Do we want to take so much money because of such little vehicles?
Citizen Thomas Haas talked: The "Hirschen" train is regularly used for long-term transport.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is being transported partly by this road, because the vehicles that are up to 20 meters long cannot use the roads on the hibernation bridges because they couldn't leave there in the main road.
Furthermore, the routes were argued for vehicles not to use the tunnel when the main road is locked.
As far as Kirchberg and Closberg Tunnel should be reconstrued and sanized as this is the case in Wolfach, the "Hirzen" train could also be a major transportation for a longer period.
The routes agreed to investigate what costs would cause the estimated distribution of the road.
Despite this, it was widely agreed to the reconstruction of the trail transition with the measure that the necessary funder will be built so that the city can build the next road direction "Bath Court Streets", where appropriate for shipment transports around 5,5 meters.
However, the restructuring of the rail transition to the gerberry trautwin could be a very different problem, which concerns the driving into the strongly increased "Geroltz houses".
The management had allowed to investigate the rotation of trains from the Ingenieur Breinlinger of Ingenieur Breinlinger, as it had doubted whether the planned closure of the household was still possible without any further possible.
The survey resulted that it was not excluded that the relationships of the road could lead to higher vehicles.
The responsibilities for this are back to the city as road construction loaders.
The rebuilding can then be carried out in detention lines.
Since wood exports and deferences were operated in the current development state, you should not agree to the reconstruction of the rail transition, argued.
Also, the risk of a train collision with a vehicle on the transition is significantly lower than the other train transmissions, because it is located directly next to the middle point, which is better for good view connection.
Even the trains from the main station should be so disappointed in this place that no collision is threatening.
Most have been refused to reconstruct this crossing, since the city of Schillach had to "defeat the problem," the rays, as the trains can return from the responsibilities after the construction works.
As an unfair problem, the group considers the rebuilding of the rail transmissions "for Heubach" and "for Kuhbach", for which crossing agreements have already been taken with the train.
Esa decides about large world space missions: Millennium missions
More planets, greenhouses or black shoes - experts of the European Railway Agency must now be on two major projects that they want to start in the next years.
30 proposals were to be selected, five are still in the rent.
TV Worlds.
More than 1000 planets in other stars have already found astronomies.
If there are at least some of them, no one knows.
The selection is difficult: should you search for gravity?
Or do you want to investigate the origin of the cosmos?
Or do you find out an extraterrestrial life after desperate planets?
These questions are just the responsibilities of the European Railway Agency Esa.
For its "Cosmic Vision" program, they search for ideas for two large space drive projects that should lead to research.
The state for such "L missions" is about a million of euros.
The start will be expected to be 2028 and 2034.
Starting September, the Elite of the European World Space Research was held in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were at the debate, five of which have now been in the closer choice.
Many organizations observed the proposals to take to the researchers.
In the next days, a final decision should be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee.
In total, four major questions, the Esa has chosen to find answers to the programme "Cosmic Vision" initiated in 2007.
What are the conditions for the development of planets and life?
The exact operations in the development of stars from large gas clouds - and thus the development of planets that are around these stars - are still in the dark darkness.
A large infrastructure cap all over can swim this dark.
And if you have a star planet, what circumstances can exist there?
In order to address this question, 2017, the World Space Telescope "Cheops" is intended to start investigating the 500 well known planet systems in our nearby environment.
But the possibilities are limited, but Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, the astronomes could shape deteriorate planets, even analyze the composition of their atmospheres, and thus search for "Biomarks": gass that apply as an index for biological activity.
How does the sun system work?
This question is also to conclude what conditions it provides for the development of life.
A important role is playing the magnetic activity of a star and the changing effect of its magnetic field as well as the partial radiation from it with the planet system.
In our sun system, these operations can be examined by example.
With the "Solar Orbiter" the Esa has already authorized a mission of the M class (of the budget is about a half billion euros).
The sun will start 2017 and observe the surface and activity of the sun exactly.
A great interest for the researchers are also Jupiter and his moon.
They want to find out what role the Riesen Plan has played in the development of the sun system.
For this, the Esa presents the first of the total three L missions of the "Cosmic Vision" program.
The sonde "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) starts their travels in 2022.
Eight years later she reached Jupiters and intends to investigate the atmosphere of the planet as well as the heavy Month of Europe, Callisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The world has many possibilities to study materials under extreme conditions and to investigate whether the natural laws that we know are still valid there are.
Perhaps there are derogations that may lead the physicians to a new theory, including all known natural laws.
How has the universe emerged and what exists?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was covered through the urknall.
Besides our slow materials, from the stars, planets and livings as we exist, there is dark material, with weakness of galaxy and galaxy buyers, and dark energy, by which the expansion of the world is accelerated.
Before the researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first seconds burns of the origin, nor what dark material and dark energy exist.
With the "Euclid", the Esa has already authorized a M mission which is intended to start for 2020.
With a special telescope, the sons will first examine the distribution of the materials in the universe and allow back-cutting keys to the beauty of dark materials and dark energy.
Who could do the rain
The 30 proposals are only two remaining at the end of the selection procedure.
The best chances for an approval as L-Mission have, in view of many "E-Lisa", an appropriate approach to the evidence of gravity housing.
In addition, physical changes have been understood in the structure of space time that Albert Einstein had predicted almost 100 years ago.
They weren't shown up until today.
Elisa could create this, hoped the scientists behind the project.
The mission presents one of the two or three detectors that exists, which is stationed in all.
In contrast to the earth's plants, he could also demonstrate gravity housing that have occurred at the urine, and thus provide new knowledge about the development of the cosmos.
Four further proposals are still competitive for the second L mission: a large root telescope named "Athena", which is to investigate, among other black shoes, "Icy Planets", a mission on the external sun system planets, "Prism", a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which is to be surveyed and investigated.
Proposals for sample row transport from Mars, for research of Mond, Venus and Asteroids and Solar Physics are prepared.
Snowden is ready to cooperate with Germany in relation to the US supervision
Edward Snowden, Whistleleblower of the United States Secret Service, has explained that he was ready to travel to Berlin and to go before the German Federal Day when the American National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander did not give answers to its activities.
The German Deputy Hans-Christian Structure found Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where this asylum was received to talk to him about the speech in Germany.
In a letter of Snowden, which was presented on Friday of Strubele to the media in Berlin, this writes: “If the result of my efforts was clearly positive, my government continues to deal with a disappearing view of the political opinion with a criminal threat where no defence is possible.”
But the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international Community can convince the American government to leave the accused to him.
The accused of the United States Court of Justice includes the sponage and the slaughter of State property.
The German Deputy Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said to the time Online: “When Mr Snowden is ready to speak with German representatives, then we find the way to make it possible.”
The relationships between the United States and Germany have been disappointed by the auditions that the NSA has heard the phone by Kanzler Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the Member of the Secret Service Parliamentary Committee, explained that the opportunity was to listen to Snowden as a witness if it is possible to “no threaten him and completely destroy the relationship with the United States”.
Strubele, a deputy of the Green, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists at his visit in Russia.
Strubele explained that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee Snowden, Snowden cannot return to Russia when he leaves the country.
If Snowden expressed in Germany, he needed a assurance that he was “secure” there, so the Member.
Snowden, in his letter, states that he was expelled to a “precise and continued” persecution campaign that had taken him out of his home.
But he is touched by the world's reaction to “my act of political opinion”.
Citizens throughout the world, and high-range politicians, even in the United States, have called an integrated monitoring system as a service in generality.
In his letter, Snowden makes the German authorities an offer of cooperation, “if the difficulties were solved around the humanitarian situation.”
Frontier Airlines provides expenditure for handback
Frontier Airlines plant to demand 100 US passengers who want to spend on their flight bag.
Frontier Airlines has to calculate up to 100 US-Dollar for a piece of handbag and $2 for coffee or limonade, even if the advertising was to read at midnight that passengers should keep the whole dose.
The new payment applies to the handbag in the box over the seat, small tiles under the seat are still free.
Frontier explained that you were accounted for 25 US dollars when the payment was previously paid, and 100 US dollars in travellers who had only paid on the flight.
Frontier speaker Kate O'Malley said that 100 US Dollar was able to move travelers to care for payment.
“We do not want to calculate this amount” she explained.
Aviation companies began to demand the first and second kitchen payments for 2008.
Passagers who tried to run these, therefore, have shooted as far as possible in the handbag, which has resulted in the overwhelming shuttle over the seat.
Expenses are an opportunity to move passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said that the new depth is not really about winning money.
It goes about the faithful clients of Frontier who had clearly expressed that it would always be more difficult to find the place on the seat.
Passages that buy your tickets on the website of the airlines must not pay.
This means that a passenger may take free bathroom at the Frontier airport under circumstances, but the next person must pay $100 for a comparable bag.
O'Malley explained that the website of Frontier and the check-in practice would change, so that passengers were informed about the cost before they come to the flight.
The new thickness of Frontier is only in force in the summer, a precise date is not yet.
Passagers often spend over bags and other costs, but airlines are pleased to be back.
You argue that the transport of the bag costs and passengers should pay this service if they want it.
Many of the Wall Street consider the new bag costs as a sign that airlines take enough money to cover the costs of flight travels after years of loss.
The majority, however, leaves the fingers of payments for handbags.
Spirit Airlines Inc. requested the first payment for handbags and later followed the Alligant Air, also a flying flight.
The only other aircraft company with such a tax is the Hungarian Wizz Air, explained by the Airline Barat Jay Sorensen, which follows the additional costs.
He estimated in a report from December 2011 that the handbag costs of Spirit income 50 million US dollars annually.
Sorensen, who previously involved a leadership at Midwest Airlines, has recently fled with spirit and was shocked with what would expect him at the flight when passengers were faced with the unnormal handbag cost of the company.
“The Boarding process belonged to the most slowest that I experienced in my aircraft,” he said.
I expected to see dentistry and hand-creative discussions at the flight.
“The aircraft was full,” he explained, “and the board ran as shocked.”
Frontier follows the spirit also with the $2 requested for coffee, tea, limonade or saft.
The company explained that passengers who purchase limonade or salt, which would keep the whole dose and be filled with coffee free.
Water is still free.
US Airways had recently tried to demand for heating money in 2008, but it returned seven months later after passing passengers had been estimated and no other large society had been obtained.
Frontier step to upload costs for the handback if passengers do not buy directly to the airport company, the recent initiative is to be taken with the customers to the own website.
Airlines pay online travel offices such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars for sales tickets.
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers to direct sale with them instead of a online travel office.
In this area, however, Frontier has been the most slightest one.
In September, the company began to forgive only half of the flights in booking on a online travel office.
In midnight, the miles were reduced to 25% of the flights.
A flight travel booked at a third provider with Frontier over 1000 miles, therefore, customers take up only 250 miles.
Passages can also book only when buying direct on the site of Frontier Plotzes.
Frontier has a faithful customer party on his seat in Denver, but business is cut and lost money.
The result returned to 9 percent, and the aircraft capability slowed about 13 percent in the first quarter, as it was to read in the financial report, which was published at midnight of the Mother Concern, the Republic of Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic has tried to obtain the financing of Frontier in the context of the sale of society.
Words from the Bible
Good 40 women have visited the last woman’s fellow work this year in the Gospel Church Commons.
The theme of the day in the community house was "Sprake words from the Bible" and "Remembers from the Mediterranean".
Zita Kohler, the Chairman of the Church's Community rat, went to the Bible's words after the breakfast.
"True words contain life sciences, rules or warnings," he stated.
They compared several words with the relevant Bible texts and explained the importance.
She called words like: wood be waved, as shoes fall from the eyes, shut up an eye on someone, and his Lord is in bed, and his hands are eaten in unfaithfulness.
Many times, the referenceer also urged their listeners to what word it was.
The speaking of the Middle Age took place by the church community Christel Dehner: All good things are three, blue, something rewarding.
It explained the importance and origin of the discovery that she called "Bridges in the past".
On the end, a tombola was deleted.
The prices were covered on a table and were humorly recorded before they were transferred to the winners.
Between the visitors of the breakfast, Roman Waizenegger also missed the citizen candidate.
Learning instead of work: Pilot project for unlearned in Tourism
At the Mecklenburg Sea plate, a pilot project was started for the tourism sector.
The Federal Working Agency has to be qualified by 49 women and men who work as an unlearned in the sector by three winters to hotels and guests experts.
"Another thing is that the six-month course ends with conclusions", said Carmen Wiechert of the worker Newbrandenburg.
The benefits are multiplied. The participants would not do so without work, the firms funded experts that have always lost more in hotels and in guests, and the Agency should not finance unemployment.
The project also participates in the industrial and commercial chambers in Newbrandenburg as well as the German Hotels and Guests Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg.
NSA states that a "indoor error" and not hacker was a debt on the Crash of the website
The estimated National Security Agency declared on the past Friday, a error has lacked their public website a few hours and not hackers as online was held.
“NSA.gov was not reached for a few hours tonight, since a planned update has occurred an internal error” the Spionage Agency explained in a message sent by e-mail.
The problem will be addressed tonight.
It is not true that the deficit has been caused by a distributed Denial of Service attack (DDOS).
During the early nighttime, online servers were found that the NSA site was not reached at least six hours and that is still not available for some users.
A NSA speaker to ABC News had previously stated that the authority's sensible internal network was “in no way” compromised.
Secret information is not in danger, so the speaker.
At least a group of hackticists were entitled to have the NSA website with a DDOS attack.
In such attacks, the target website is transferred to page calls until the server is overloaded and reports the site.
The cybertics are relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to reduce the internal network of the target system.
The previous super-secret NSA, whose first no-Search Agency (No such authority), is located in the light of the public, and looks like the extents of its extensive monitoring programme in the internal and foreign – a result of the secret NSA data that were stolen and published by the former NSA-military Edward Snowden.
The growing contraverse for the secret service was initial speculations about the fact that today is the result of a targeted cyper operation.
It is easy to cut the number of people without job in October at 22 to 1.307.
Although the quotas with 3.1 per cent better than last year and even better than in September, "we would have expected more", says Monika Fielders-Bauer, representing director of the Working Agency in Solar Courts.
Because many operations have reacted to behaviour in settings.
For this reason, field-bower says: "We have no experts in the handwork, in health care and in the old work."
Annual time is required since September also re-equipment for staff in hotel and guest shopping.
In the middle of December the winter season begins.
The entire background report is found in the Alliance Table of 31.10.2013 (See 33).
Budgets in Bombardiers after return to delivery payments and contracts
The Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer Inc reported on Thursday a 15 percent decline of the net wine after he had been under pressure by slow orders and delivery to aircrafts in the third quarter and contract problems in the Railway Party.
Bombardier with Sitz in Montreal also has no aircraft tests for its branding flight of the CSeries and has not provided any new information on whether the aircraft could go to commercial use in accordance with the honourable timeplan in September next.
On the juvenile flight of the test flight over a half months, only three further starts were followed, which is questionally able to appear whether the test phase runs as planned.
The results remained behind the prognosis and led to a course of over eight percent at the Toronto’s Burse.
Cameron Doerksen, analysis at the National Financial Bank, sent his evaluation of "outperform" on Thursday in order to have a limited rate potential in the next two quarters.
“There were weaker delivery numbers in aircrafts, but we are very clearly disappointed,” said Doerksen in a customer book.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the test program is forwarded.
However, if no new orders are known in the next months, we hope that the market will be more skeptic than the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft can catapulate the company in the lower market segment that is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test flight was presented in March of the public and was first after monthly delays in September.
However, until now, there are binding orders for CSeries with 177 moderate, as potential purchasers are expected to wait on the results of the aircraft tests and see whether the exploitation of the company in relation to the carriage efficiency and the cost of the new carriage flight.
Currently there are total 403 orders and commands of 15 customers and society.
President Peter Beaudoin is convinced that the bombs will reach its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the Jet.
The company management also assured the analysts and media on Thursday, and the program was in the Terminal Plan.
“The test driver has not remained on the ground as long as expected,” said Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added, while the aircraft’s time was used to test the ground and software updates.
Each manufacturer plant is different.
We have decided to make a first flight and then adjust a revised period, which we have also done.
This happens during the whole flight program.
The second of five test flights will be expected to start in the next weeks, the remaining short later, called the company site.
However, analysts remain skeptical if they can operate a CSeries flight for 12 months after the first customer’s flight.
Bombardier declared that it checked the planning for the inclusion (EIS) and will update it within the following months.
“The long-term fronts of the flight test – even if it obviously corresponds to internal bombs – increases our view that the involvement moves to the first quarter of 2015,” said Doerksen.
In the third quarter at the end of September 30, Bombardiers had net profits of $147 million or 8 percent per share of $172 million or 9 cent per share in the year before.
The adjusted wine per action is unchanged 9 cents.
The surplus was low and low from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts had a profit of 10 cent per share and expected an overwhelming of $4.56 billion, so Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer has delivered 45 flights in this quarter, a decline of 57 in the last year.
The net orders fall from 83 flights on 26.
The contract file in the air and space shipping party was on September 30,32,9 billion dollars and was unchanged against 31 December.
“In the area of air and space passengers, the results were in our prescriptions, but the low contracts and the market relations were totally detrimental,” said Beaudoin.
The transfer of the air and space flow part was 13 per cent of two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the largest rail manufacturer of the world, announced that the transfer of this part has increased by about 11% to $2.1 billion.
On September 30, 32,6 billion of dollars, which was easily increased against 31 December.
The profit level in the field of transport was affected by development problems in some major contracts.
According to the company management, it will be provided for the fourth quarter of new requirements.
On Thursday afternoon, the bomb was at 8.5% and was at 4.83% of Canadian dollars, after announcing that the Google Financial Mission Patrick Pichette will be changing in the state.
The Brazilian Emmbraer SA, the third largest commercial aircraft manufacturers and bombs, reported on Thursday a decrease of the quarterly winner on Thursday.

Cocain dependent lawyer who warned the drug boss before police investigation must be in prison
Basharat Dita, 42, provided information on the subworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug dependence could come to light.
He was sentenced by Liverpooler Crown Court for three years of prison.
A well-known criminal who warned a drug baron before a large police investigation because he feared that his secret drugs could be discovered was sentenced for three years.
Basharat Dita, 42, provided sub-world size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about the investigation of its activities in the drug trade after it was compromised by his own cocain injury.
The lawyer of the first classified criminals was arrested in his house 2011 after overseeing the police Scarborough that he had been in a previous drug procedure.
The officers observed how Scarborough (32) three cocain kitchens were delivered at the lawyer's house in Primo, Lancashire, while they were with colleagues at a dinner of the lawyers.
The investigations showed that Dieta regularly consumed drugs of class A, after testing cocaine springs in his hairs, on his letter towels and on credit cards.
For a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to provide information unautorised on the arrest of two men in charge of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were observed by the police in the context of a large investigation procedure on heroin and cocain trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They were later arrested with 32 other people after the police in a number of home investigations Heroin and Cocain valued 1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds of bargeld.
Dita, 42, gave information to the criminals, because he feared that his drug dependence could be public.
Today Dita was found and condemned by the Liverpooler Crown Court in two cases because of prevention of justice.
He gave the cocaine belonging to a previous survey.
The lawyer was carried out after the police were investigated against Scarborough that this had been regularly contacted with Dieta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw how he went to the Ditas House and there was the drugs with a cleanness of 60 per cent in a black golf shock under the mouldton of the lawyer.
Shortly after he delivered the drugs, Scarborough regularly phoned with Dieta, who was located at the football station of the Deputy Rovers in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, helped the drugs, and then nine communications were discovered between the two.
Before the court, it was known that Dieta was a “regular consumption” of cocaine after testing drugs of class A in his hair, his letter tap and on his credit cards.
Dieta was later arrested, but started to take cocaine and said he had spoken to the widespread dealer because he was his mandate, and said that its debate was understood by the “secret of lawyer”.
During his arrest, Dieta took his letter tap and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and took him a hair test.
When he agreed to the police hearing, he would call him home for legal matters, both under his private address and on the workplace.
Before the court, he was informed that he had called a number of important drug trade actors, which had previously been sentenced and informed what the investigators knew about them.
Ombudsman Anne Whyte said: “A criminal law lawyer should be better than everyone else knows that the law is not entitled. ”
Thista is accused of the abuse of his position as a criminal defender, since he has left himself too much with certain mandates.
The fragrant relationship is not just the drug driver, but a drug adviser who offers his lawyer with drugs.
One of his communications was certainly legitimate because he was the lawyer of these people.
However, this was far beyond the borders of a normal relationship between lawyer and mandate.
He took the police investigations as far as possible so that they could continue to follow their criminal activities.
Mr Dita has thus brought his vocational position.
He was too close to certain mandates, especially Scarborough, and let it be compromised by his independence.
It said, "If I'd be a corrupt lawyer that I'm not, and I would give information to Scarborough, I wouldn't wait for 15 hours, but soon."
However, after hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead from the police in Lancashire said: “Jer. Dieta has done the step from a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment when he began to buy drugs from organized crimes.”
His cocaine dependence led to an unexpected compromise and accepted him for the reasonable leaders of organized crimes that were assigned to get valuable information on police investigations.
Prosecutors must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public confidence and confidence.
Dieta has left this confidence and tried to spend behind the fascination of his professionals.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigations against Ditta, which also leaded to a condemnation in three cases because of the possession of cocaine and justice disability, which stresses our determination to bring crimes to court.
In this case, criminals should be a warning and show that no one can get out of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to the court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced at 14 years of prison after he had declared the conspiration for heroin, cocaine and cannabis trade.
Five-five more in the drug trafficking persons were sentenced to total punishment for 153 years.
On his website, Dita published a area of questions and answers on which he agreed that his dream work was to be an advocate in the death cell in America, his final guest at dinner is Mohammed Ali and opportunity to be the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary work of the church music

Haslach: Skepsis slightly believing confidence
For example, the elections for the Pfarrgenerate 2015 will be changed in the primary Haslach (SE) Seelorge Unit.
Then there is only a common paradise for all six pararryes.
On Saturday, the organizations of Haslach, Hofstads, Mollebach, Fisherbach, Steinach and Wolchenstoneach were prepared on the changes.
Because the basic decisions of diocese are nothing to change and it is to the farmers to apply this as much satisfactionful as possible.
In the course of the day, it was particularly clear: the skepsis against the new is slightly slow, but looking at an overwhelming.
From the ideas and expectations to renew 2015 to the concrete proposals on the future composition and the size of the Pfarr community, the extremely constructive meetings of the six bodies with the main officials of the Seelorg team.
Regionaldekan Georg Schmitt explained, on the basis of a presentation, the new directives for sealsorg units in the Erzdiesian Freeburg.
Then the SE Haslach is a body of public law in the future which enters into the rights and obligations of the six individual church communities until now.
It will only provide a common parliament and a foundation Council in which the Pharaoh's power office is represented.
Each parameter should be represented at least two members selected, in the six parreies are formed in the locally called communal teams.
Your task will be for the future to promote church life in place.
The question of the financing of the individual partnerships showed significant need for discussion.
The renewings suggest that joint goods are able to be obtained in the pararryans.
However, the liabilities are overcome to the general community.
With regard to the large investments planned, whose obligation then meets all the pararryes, there were great concerns.
"Are in the past was invested only in projects that could only be able to be overlooked by the individual pararry," relating Haslach's general President Bruno Princezbach.
Practically experienced with a common body for five pararries, Barbara Ritter, chairman of the body in the Seelorge Unit Schutterwald Neuried.
They had been assigned to 2006, "It's gonna be one, five remain" and they had to find that it wasn't so simple.
The bodies of the Haslacher Seelorge Unit then made it possible to answer questions on the future composition and size of the common partnership and the practical work of the Community team.
The preparations will be concretized at further meetings and decided at a further joint meeting of all six bodies in the next spring year.
At the end, Pfarr generaliter Michael Beener from Steinach presented the new logo of the Seelorge Unit that was accepted by a significant majority.
In Pfullendorf the electric is tormer
The Pfullendorf citizens must set up higher electricity costs.
As the manager of the cities works, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed against the SUDKURIER, will reach a four-powered Pfullendorfer Family 70-90 euros More costs per year.
The main reason for the increase in price increase is the increase of the so-called EEC environment of 5,277 to 6,3 cent per kilowatt hours.
This shift will be re-established each year by the four operators of the large electricity trails in October.
These are the additional costs which are derived from the energy flows that they can be able to overcome through the strike.
The townworks Pfulllendorf form the last member in this chain.
In its prognoses, the Supervisory Council of Energy was even a higher environment, as reported by Jörg-Arne Bias.
Now the concrete payments should be calculated before the city works could inform their customers about the exact price increase.
"We go from an adjustment of 1 cent plus x", so Bias, which will stay closer to 2 cents.
Ample on duration red: Watch at waiting time
Sometimes a amp doesn't just green.
The contact drives in the street do not react or the light mark is defeated.
What do you have to do - walk at Red?
If a interested person has been waiting sufficiently at a red camp and the cruise is free, he can continue, the Stuttgart law lawyer Ralf Becker explains in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting time should be "measurable" which can be expressed in case in case.
Becker will take at least five minutes before the employee is defeated.
However, those who continue the driving despite red light should be clear that it causes a caused accident the full debt.
Those who are suffering less than five minutes are not waiting sufficiently in circumstances, warns Becker and refers to a decision of the Supreme Court of Ham.
In the negotiated case, a driver had ignored the ample after about three minutes and had to be responsible for a viable red light oversight.
Indeed, the template was not infect, but a little later turned to green.
A driving ban left him because of the special situation, but it was not the money penalty.
The Joint Council welcomes the solid budget
Only when it goes on the household meetings, Master Ralph Gerster has laughed well.
The Commonwealth Suck of Herdwang Beauth is well filled and debts have no longer known the management since 2005.
The 2012 budget can also be achieved as a full success in this sense.
This was clear in the presentation of the year account for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of around 7.6 million euros should be higher than planned.
The overwhelming of the administrative budget also was around EUR 1,8 million over the approach.
In particular, the oversight should be increased income tax revenue and the Community interest income taxes.
The resources budget was also clearly over the values planned.
Instead of the expected 1,5 million euros, it was 2,5 million euros last year.
"This is essentially the higher delivery of the administrative budget," says Rothmund.
As less investments have been assigned in the financial year 2012, the refund allocation is also higher.
Overall, the overall refund of EUR 2,1 million could now be increased to a total of 4,9 million.
Master Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"So a work isn't just protected from the crazy," Gerster pleaded with regard to the annual calculation.
He and the communists expressly enjoyed the good numbers.
It may be paradox kling, but precisely these good numbers may come to the citizens soon.
With the good financial situation, the community was able to reject high-speakings in the past.
But Gerster said that the country has already been shortened.
There are conditions for these aids from different compensations.
Among other things, the cities and communities requesting subsidies must present certain parts.
"The theme of the Gospels we must look at, since in the coming years of investments that we would like to have subsidies", he said in this regard.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter for 60 years in Chor

Kenya Press Recommendated on Controverses Media Law
“If we are in a delicate situation and we should ask ourselves: what does the Parliament consider to simplify the right independence tomorrow?” was in the newspaper that holds the draft legislation for non-constitution.
“The law is dramatic and very punishable, and we denied it,” said Cyrus Kamau, head of the Capital Group, who is also heard of CapitalFM, one of the most independent radio stations and news sites Kenias.
He said the new media currencies “It's always been predicted because it's a long-term arm of the government”, and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenia's position in the global economy.
“I hope the President listens to us and we call him to abstain this draft legislation and to return to Parliament,” he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government took the new law “Media is effectively astray”. The standard, democracy and speech freedom in Kenya had suffered“ a serious slaughter” and referred to the project as “dragonic”.
The adoption of the law is part of a range of measures to strengthen national security in the afternoon of the attacks by armed Islamics at the Westgate Budget Centre in September.
The Kenyan media moved to the angry of the authorities because they published the accommodations of security cameras where they were to see how the units sent to the murder were cut into the luxury marketing centre.
Police Chief David Kimaiyo reacted to listen to the appointment of two journalists and a leading media partner, even though the invitation was taken after a rise of the media.
According to the new law, media households can be incurred with a punishment of up to 20 million Kenian students and individual journalists with a million, as well as the other risk to lose their professional recognition or to be excluded by official press credition.
The Court also has the right to impose the ownership of the interested persons if a punishment is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, “there is the only punishment to the majority of radioscanners in the bank route.”
Furthermore, the newspaper views that these measures could have a destructive impact on the description of their "liberal blogsphare" Kenias.
If they take the media to slow, the politicians could unpunish what they want.
"No one will ever learn", wrote Mutuma Mathiu, journalist of the country, who calls the Kenyan media as a crucial control factor in public life.
“If the politicians are left themselves, they lead the country to the banking route, and we return in the time of the jagers and Sammler,” he commented.
The Kenyan lawyers have already come to the public offenders in the past.
In May they agreed to reverse the distortion of the national compensation committee and put their deficiencies in force of some 532.000 Shilling free of tax for month, as they were the highest world.

United Nations proclaims new objectives for the fight against poverty
The United Nations starts immediately with the preparation of a series of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals for poverty 12 years ago.
In the event of the UN Sustainable Development Meeting, which started at Rio de Janeiro at night, Australian diplomates played a key role in the establishment of “stable development goals” to replace the Millennium Goals in 2015.
They were included in the draft document adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the Summit.
The United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon declared on the meeting on the evening that the time was coming to “remember national interests”.
“I am glad that Member States have understood to attack a process to agree with the universal and sustainable development goals,” he said.
“This goals will build our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the Framework for Development for 2015.
I will not take any effort to implement this mandate from the Member States to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals that will build on the success of the Millennium Goals."

Many players have been training in the A-Young.
Therefore, they will be particularly safe against their former coach.
"It is necessary to expect whether it is still strengthening from the first place," said the SG coach.
In order to finally return to the success score, the Malmon team must be increased in comparison with the past events in any case.
Before all things in the switch work and the switch game, it was finally powerful.
The evaluation of opportunities must also be definitively better.
That's why I hope my players have finally got the head free during the short break.
Safety concerns in Mozambique growing in view of counterparts between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered together in the centre of Maputos under the watch of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and first President of Mozambique, in order to vote at a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace again, we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, director of an investment undertakings.
In the fear of the future of the country, she slaughtered its business towards a T-shirt with the record ‘We demand security’ in Portugal and joined the amount on Thursday on the home of the capital independence.
Since two weeks, there are reports about the convergence between government forces and Renamo, which are the worst feasts since the peace agreement over 20 years.
Renamo was at first a favorable revolving movement, which initially supported by white Rhodesians and later the South African government, in order to destabilize the independent government of the country.
According to the 1992 Peace Treaty, it became a party to opposition.
Analysts are inevitable that the country returns to a growing conflict, but the recent events of foreign investors and domestics have threatened.
For the rapid growth economy, it is much on the game, because the discovery of huge gas conditions before the coastal coastal and coal in North West in the next years could invest more than 50 billion US dollars from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States in the country.
The dominant Frelimo Party, since 1975 the dominant force, and Renamo is one of the same infringements.
Renamo argued that the government had caused the most recent confusions by attacking its members in the Sofala Province, a traditional Hochburg Renamos.
The controversies on the previous rebels were scaled as government instruments attacked Renamo's support points and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, explained Renamos speakers against the Financial Times.
The government gives Renamo the blame for the confusions and accused the organization to attack soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to discuss concerns about instability.
AFP, the French News Agency, said on midnight that Dhlakama is considered a loser who wants to “assess all his remaining forces to prove that he can imply his decisions to the Government”.
And both Frelimo and Renamo stressed that they want to avoid war.
However, since Mazanga has been quoted with the words, Renamo gave the peace agreement of 1992.
With regard to the FT, he declared that Frelimo did not respect the Agreement anymore.
“Our vision is to react negotiations and seriously,” said Mazanga.
Previous discussions between the parties have contributed only a few of the explanations that have been covered by a number of commutations in this year.
“We have two adult men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama), who gathered the heads,” says Joseph Hanlon, Dozent at the Open University and Mozambique experts.
No one is good in the negotiation and no one is ready to make the necessary acceptances.
Renamo, who goes on election reforms, has already declared that it will join the community choices in November.
The elections of presidency and Parliament are planned for the next year.
Some comments have interpreted the use of violence as a attempt to move a precisely movement, to influence the government's ability and financial benefits.
Since 1992, a new party, which will be improved by a former Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), will be improved in the elections.
Mazanga states that Guebuza – which increases the decline when his second official period ends in the next year – wants to destroy the country's democracy.
“He doesn't want a multiparty democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace, because he does not want the President's office," says Mazanga.
It's not clear about the capacity of Renamo, but it has undergoing inquiry attacks against police stations and vehicles on a major North-South connection.
Most feet found in Sofala Province, which is about hundreds of miles north of Maputo, where Beira is located, the ports, mountain construction companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale for export of carbon.
In June, Rio interrupted the use of rail trains for a month after Renamo had announced a attack on the route.
Mazanga continued to answer the question whether Renamo will repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to warn the international community that the things in Mozambique are not good, said Mazanga.
The instability has still increased the flexibility of the government, says Fernando Lima, leader of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people have already been careful of corruption, smooth progress in development and a recent reducing environment.
“The people think that the government and the President are responsible for the future of the country and should be the solutions to the problems” he states.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrant, said people just wanted stability.
“There are no interests in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want to go back to peace and useful streets” he explained.
Childs should be taught by myths and legends as "Princes for Life" means a author.
Thor's stories showed that “brutale power does not have an opportunity against clue tricks” and the art legends demonstrate how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths, however, “will be wild, to be angry and in some cases to be taught at schools,” said Crossley-Holland for a “supportable choice” old judiciary work.
“I’m wonderful that Mythen and Folklore are already part of the education,” he said.
I have proposed this as a plan for twenty years.
He added, to authors and teachers that were “excellently dictated”, children would ‘support completely,’ because in deep history, the message would be ‘speakable’.
Crossley-Holland, which has translated the Beowulf from the Angelsish and is the author of the Penuin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, explained: “It is possible to follow certain intentions, but you should keep it in the background.”
The greatest difference between an adult author who writes for adults, and an author who writes for children is the need to give hope.
Not everything must be simplified or lead to Happy End, but there is a imminent sense for good and bad.
This must be subscreenly reflected, revealed by the history and not explained.
This is the old story of the show instead of telling.
Hansyakob is again in Freehof

For the delivery of the honourable citizens, Haslachs Citizens-Minister Heinz Winkler was the honour that, in the delegation of the then official Hattich, he had made his expectation together with a part of the city Council.
Then, their expectations made the three-king singer, which gave Hansyakob to the appeal: "And as beautiful, there will be re-education of youth at my own three-year time."
With their song "O Jesuuliin" they enjoyed the public in the free court as well as the stortenday stores with their "Herus, Herus".
His criticism at the Official Church had expressed in the same way as his concerns about the developments in the agricultural industry, the consequences of industrialization or the impact of the war.
In the household, behind his grain caps on the fire at the courts, he found his rest.
"A unforgettable spirit had finally found his calm and was left home forever," he said at the end of the scene game.
Many Applaus and many glorious words were made by the public for the implementation.

Even the first decline in the Euroleague could not deteriorate the huge optimism at the basketballers of the FC Bayern Munchen.
"No one can ban us to believe that we can also win against the best team of Europe of the last two years," stated Bayern Coach Svetislav Pesic, who was dictated after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) Monday at the Olympiakos Piréus.
We sent the message: there is also Basketball in Munchen!

The guests initially created the art room to convert a 15-point swimming stand 13 minutes before the end was still leading, before Pireus gave the game a shift again.
"We have returned incredibly to the two times Euroleague Champion, but then we have made an easy error", said Bayern-Professor Yassin Idplusi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.

Ben Greenman: 10 years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City's birth place in America is: just hundreds of years ago, the artist Frank Fay, who worked as a conference at the theatre at Broadway, was working to tell the amount of Witze directly in a conversation.
In the course of the years, Fays innovation was developed, as recently on the New York Comedy Festival.
In life, Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Statup Institute Carolines, celebrates his ten-year-old Jubiläum with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
“The majority of these headlins came to Carolines and then became more successful until they were known at any time to get up in a club,” said Hirsch.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them.
During the this year, there are events of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, and “Stand Up for Heroes”, a annual musical and comdy benefits event for armeeveterane at Madison Square Garden, including Bruce Springsstein, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
With the festival, the world of Comedy has grown.
A number of Comedians who participate this year in the festival have been known over more unconventional ways, such as sendings on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was known with a sitcom in the cable view (the iranic-shot-football series "The League" on FXX) and has now its own Sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the designation of "Saturday Night Live" as well as of "Parks and Recreation", although they are most known for their viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Even Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the iranic and racial themes, focused on the race topics), are products of the decentralized world of the American Comedy.
The largest visitors of the festival belong to an interview: David Steinberg speaks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up Comedian, but it was developed to a viewed television and film register as well as to an informal Comedy historic.
From 2005 to 2007 he modernized a television with the title “Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg” at TV Land.
The meeting is located in the Town Hall in Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the Comdy DNA of Larry's whole work,” said Steinberg.
He told me when he's here, then he sometimes goes through the gas between two buildings and thinks, "Hey, if I lose my whole money, then I may live here.
Iran satisfies the process of nuclear negotiations
Iran is satisfied with the negotiation process one week before the next nuclear meeting with the five United Nations vessels and Germany.
"Any years later, you have made an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Authority to make the differences of the last years", wrote the Foreign Minister Mohammed Dschawad Sarif on his Facebook page.
It would be a long way, but the nuclear headquarters would be satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that both sides will be a solution at the end.
Drama in Uruguay: Kids killed game camps with Machet

Because of extraordinary human trafficking, preserving, threat, injury and dangerous infringement, the landgericht Constance has condemned a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen for three years of prison.
The former Federal Soviet who worked after two posts in Afghan as a tower in Afghan was an understanding within the framework of a process debate.
Then he learned in five cases of women through Internet or telephone contacts he sent to the strike for a few weeks.
Resistance, he tried to disrupt violence and threats.
He entered the income of women offered for him a part of the year.

With a colleague who communicated the women, he brought her into various borders in the southwest.
There he was to monitor them in part to control their income.
First of the court, the accused said, he suffered under a serious trauma after colleagues in Afghan, next to an explosion.
After a psychiatric experts great doubts on the psychological limitation and, so, to a restricted debtability, the 33-year-olds condemned a comprehensive understanding.
The court had no longer to be treated by the damaged women.
As a Kripo official reported, at least four cases of extraordinary human trading were identified after a first statement by telephone supervisory measures.
The voted discussions were expressed by high aggression.
In later appeals, the damages had confirmed their martyrium.
Another Witness in which one of the women had discovered the blue fleets of the whole body has not made a statement until today.
It is about "a completely broken personality", the violence and exploitation in this body as normal.
The accused regretted his conduct yesterday.
He said, "He solved himself from these circles and wants to conduct a very normal life after the prison."
Oil price goes further up to 96 USD per barrel
The oil price also continued on Friday after the concerns of a high offer exceeded a report, which increases the energy-free production sector of China.
The reference rood sites for delivery in December were fallen in the electronic trade at the New York Markingsle Exchange at 96.24 USD per barrel in Europe last morning.
The contract took about 39 cents on Thursday, which means a price loss of 5,8% in October.
The large wheat boat has stolen the prices in the last few weeks.
The United States Energy Ministry declared on midnight that the U.S. appeal has increased to 4.1 million barrel last week.
In the course of five weeks, the offer was increased by 25 million barrel.
However, on Friday, there were more information on demands by two reports on an activity increase in the Chinese manufacture.
This means a continued recovery of China's economy, whose growth was increased to 7.8% in the third quarter after it was started in the previous quarter at the lower level since two decades.
Rohöl from the Art Brent, a reference value for international raw oil, which is also used by American raffineries, went to the ICE exchange in London at 108.58 USD per barrel.
The Court blocks the decision on the NYPD's stop-and-Frice directive
On Thursday, a federal training court in the United States blocked the order of a judiciary that had requested changes in the stop-and-free program (the maintenance and investigation) of the New York police department, and the judiciary of the case.
The Court of Auditors declared that the decisions of judge Shira Schirdlin would be issued until the city was decided on a profession.
The judiciary had judged in August that the city was condemned against the Constitution in the way to implement the programme for maintenance and demands of persons.
The city took a vocational position against its evaluation and the proposed aid measures, including the decision, to establish a supervisory body to support the police in amending its Directive and the relevant training programme.
The Professional Court heard the arguments for the revocation requested on Thursday.
The Professional Report explained that the judges should be linked to the case because they had affected the US-American conduct code by determined that a judge should avoid the appearance of the participation; this was partly based on a number of media interviews and public statements in which it had been publicly reacted to the criticism of the Court.
The judiciary had judged that police officers had violated the citizens of ten thousands of people because they were aimed at seeing black and Latin American men with the stop-and-Franck program.
It called an external body to monitor the implementation of significant changes, including reforms in directives, training and services, and ordered a pilot program with cameras carried out on the body in four places where most of the controls were performed.
In August, the city of New York was ready to complete the practice of storing names and addresses of persons who were resolved after a control by the police.
A municipal negotiation on urban profession is planned after March 14, 2014.
The stop-and-freak tactic was criticized by a number of civil rights defenders.
The controls of this type have been in various forms for decades, but the number of controlled during the official period of the participating citizen minister Michael Bloomberg was a total period of 684.330 in 2011, most of those black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men who listened to all minorities were clamped up to a collection.
For changes in the NYPD's stop-and-mark program, changes will end in fair practices and create a more confidence and effective police, and influence the way and way of implanting other police presidencies.
Instead, the changes would fight the moral of the police, but not the criminality, but the money would not be dissolved and the greater problem of a police, which is under pressure by thousands of offices in the last decade.
The judiciary pointed out that they did not end the stop-and-Fryk Praxis, which was constitutionally, but only reforming the type of implementation of controls by the NYPD.
From the luck of the dreaming camele
Happiness is a oase that comes to reach only dreaming camels
With this beauty, the first Chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the Agreement "Helper Hands".
On Satugnan Thursday, the tenth birthday of the Agreement was celebrated, which can already show a great success.
The first Chairman Henne reported the work of the Agreement.
He was the first time in Mauretania in Cheijk-Zajed hospital in Nouakchott in 2004.
As a result, further cooperation was developed, and the Gynacologe Henne carried out on a number of travel operations on a place.
During the speech, images were shown on a large landing, so that the guests of the Jewish event could have made a image from the actions mentioned.
The Convention's wilder vehicle was also shown.
This is a former federal border vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, made the proposal to allocate this vehicle with a photovoltaic device, and now plant, according to Henne, to be operating in consultative functions.
In 2008, the roomei Sleech from Baier sources in the record time of just one week has created the hospital station in Socogim, a swimming quarter at the border of the capital city - honorably.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-kind hospital in Nouakchott
Specially interesting in times in Nagold the birth clinic is to be eliminated.
A lot of learning in Africa is so Henne, for example, the acceleration of Burn-out.
In view of the political distress in the country, many travellers were not able to operate as planned, but many medicines came to Germany to host this place in various areas.
Furthermore, containers are regularly sent to Africa, so in March these years medical devices, medically, related materials, hospital beds and briles.
Commissioner Hans-Joachim Fouchel himself provided a rich local colony by he told Mercedes' manufacturers from the Mauretany to the mobile swimming steel and the experiences of the stammhouse musicians that were traditionally supported by the United Nations at their Mauretan travel.
As his personal movement, he called his work in the field of accounting test as a young deputy.
When he became clear how much money was lost, he decided to help the Africans in the control of a budget through the people.
In addition, the fire stressed that global economy also demands global human loves.
There should be no way to forget that Africa is closer than some thinking.
It's not far from Gran Canaria to Africa.
Coulson set phone hacking for checking a tip
The previous news of the Word Heritage Andy Coulson tried to confirm a false tip of the former Minister of Internal Charles Clarke.
Statewalt Andrew Edis QC declared the Court at the Old Bailey, News of the World has heard in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his “attractive specialist” Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper tried the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlbys Voicemails, and followed her, but Coulson also called her and posted news as the court was.
“After the State Authority, Coulson, who is now an emergency provider, no one who is standing before the apartment of people is hoped to get it on a fresh face, but one who is pleased to face people with a story to see their reaction,” said Edis.
He said that NotW had three procedures to search for historys: phone hacking, monitoring and contrast.
The employer is personally involved in the third method.
Of course, he knows from the second, the supervision, that may not be different.
How does it look like the first?
He knows about the phone hacking?
He resolves this, but we say, "And if he knew it."
Stories over a business Clarkes were first attacked by the manufacturing of NotW when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said: “Do not use your time, she is together with Charles”.
A band with Vocemails from her phone of at least three admissions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaires.
The investigators also found entries on the computer of the detective, which were stored on the Pawlby and her sister as “projects”.
During the time they delivered the investigations, the grandmasters of Pawlby's anonymous calls, where they were asked after information about it, explained Edis.
Instead, the former chief Neville Thurlbeck and the previous reporter James Weatherup monitored the movements of Pawlby.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the contents: “I have a story we want to get out tomorrow, about which I like to speak with Charles.”
Edis explained that Coulson's activities in this history followed the same pattern as other important personalities, about the former minister David Blunkett.
The gentlemen heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had faced a business with a married woman when he himself had read with the Mitange-Claimed Rebekah Brooks, who was then married.
Coulson and Brooks aimed to smile with others from 3 October 2000 to 9 August 2006's phones.
Marcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have given the phone hacking.
From protest against the planned rich taxes, the French Fussball is actually taking the first strike since 1972.
A shutting meeting is on the end.
In the conflict of the rich taxes, the Government and the Professball in France have been handled in a sackgase.
President François Hollande acknowledged on Thursday at Paris Elysée-Palast of the United Nations and of the Association and also heared their cards.
However, he refused to return the Fussball from the planned 75 per cent allocated to income of more than one million euro per year, which all companies of the country should pay for two years from 2014.
The opposite also remained hard.
The strike announced for the end of November will now be taken, shared by the Head of the Profib Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel.
The day of play between 29 November and 2 December in Liga 1 and Liga 2 shall therefore be decreased.
Features: No absolute protection possible
"We want to join the inhabitants earlyly in the planning," Master Jens Houßler opened the citizens' information session on high water protection in guards.
About 80 participants came to the Community Hall to explain the measures planned, address questions, express concerns and ideas.
He stated: "The last decisions are the members of the Council of the Community."
The high water, which was unprepared on May 15, 2009, was an unprepared event that caused the question of protection for the future, is so exciting.
A river-zone investigation was given with neighbouring aid, which is now based on the high-water protection approach.
"The protection of the most constructed bases is the goal", says the widespread.
It is based on the planning of protection before a German weather service statistically expected high water for 100 years.
The climate change is taken into account by a 15% impact.
This is called "HQ 100aKlima".
The water mass that had led in 2009 to significant damages contained in a 1000-year-old high water.
"A absolute protection does not exist, but a relative improvement we can achieve," said hester.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aKlima, it is necessary to invest around four million euros, where the community can receive country grants of about 70%.
However, he pointed out that it is only promoting if a comprehensive approach is implemented.
This should be indicated by the Community to the participation of the citizens.
A constant planning and approval procedure should be completed.
In the best case, the implementation of 2016 could be started.
Among other things, the protection concept which has already been presented in the Council of Communities in the last week (reported) local measures in the flow of the river irm from the Stammheim Tal.
In connection with the representation of the high water protection concept, participants use the opportunity to bring their concerns.
It was asked, among others, why do not be planned for the protection of the place?
Gregor Kuhn, Special Planners of the Office of Ingenieur Forest and Corbe from the Heavy House, which presented the concept, pointed out that it needed the composite of all the measures presented to achieve the objective in the sum.
Furthermore, you should like to find the most economic solution, so Joachim's forest of forest and corbe.
Inhumanity was dominated by the older placers who have always suffered at normal weather rains under an overload of the channel network.
The problem has been known in the management and the first measures have already been taken.
However, he pointed out that the guidelines for channel systems are other than high water protection and that should not be lost.
The community is obligation to explain the channel network so that two to three years of rain could be enforced.
Increased water channels would disappear millions.
Heavy losses after confusion
On early Friday Wednesday, on the country Street 44 near Revensdorf, two drivers have been hardly damaged at a frontal adjunction.
The police immediately completed the road, but it could first say little.
However, there are various Witnesses that should be evaluated first.
The 19-year-old Lenkerin of a VW Golf in direction to Revensdorf, and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf, who came to her hyundai.
Both vehicles slaughtered together, while the woman was so hard, that the fire shooting had just needed a half an hour to free her from the vehicle wrack.
The real accident was first unexpected.
Both disappointed hospitals arrived in nearby hospitals.
The trails remained completely locked for about two hours.
You could call him the Dostojewski of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a divine sugar, a metafhysizer, his Romans and his stories also have some serious.
Reverse the relationship in the sweet: the eyes shocking, the bart, the high shore.
And as Fjodor M. Dostojewski is to understand with his massive Oeuvre as the founder and apologet of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is read as American prophets that apply something from its own country.
Some titles appear in the Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans box with the 118 records are two thousands.
Dick declares America - the kingdom of the shocking technical progress, paid with paranoia, safeness and faith, to be chosen.
Dick had God's experiences, his late books read themselves as a mixing from the John’s revelation and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy with drugs to his brain.
He captured, soon that the computers are divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what is different from a machine, the Creator of his Creator.
This is the "Blade Runner" problem.
The killer.
A Master of Science Fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film leaderships like Ridley Scott, Paul Verheeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The " minorities report" came from 1956, he deteriorates the deterioration of the cold war and the McCarthy Tribune.
This is the principle of the "Pre Crime", "Pre Crime", which is now more or less official doctrin of the White House.
In the Dick's world, which is the same as our horrible, looks at mutants in the future - and the police.
"We are taking individuals who have disfellowshipped no law," says the Head of the Authority.
"We shoot us before they can act with a violence crime."
And: "In our society there's no offenders, so we have a criminal full of pesudo transgressors." They read Time Streams.
They are accepting that weaknesses happen, and prevent the criminal dance to be implemented.
Dicks' discovery works like the blue pause for the anti-terrorism seats and the NSA's earnings.
Anticipation of the attack: So functions Obamas's drug philosophy and - Praxis.
But Dick's history is not over.
The police chief claims that there is no violence department anymore, the military controls the whole day - and the rest of the State.
Then the supervisor will be overlooked and transferred to a future crime.
The system turns around.
It's perfect, but it's lie.
It meets its own conditions.
Take wrongdoers and victims not only in buying, but build up.
The system creates the danger that it fights.
Philip K. Dick's reading means to come closer to the truth.
Sponsoring on Merkel in Russia
The former US secret service experts Edward Snowden could also be sentenced in his Russian asylum in the US succeeding newspapers Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Authority could ask any written questions, or the 30-year-olds were also taken personally in Russia, reported the Interfax Agency.
Before the Green Day, Hans-Christian Structure, last night, was the first German politician Snowden in Moscow, to speak to him about the business.
Improvement of NSA commitments to company paranoia for public supervision
On a midday end August, a German police slaughter was deeply over the US Consular in Frankfurt at Main, Germany's financial capital.
On the instruction of the Constitutional Protection and Terrorism Office (BVT), the German Internal Secret Service, he should photograph the desk of the U.S. Foreign Post, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Federal Bank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to demonstrate the presence of supervisory interests and the action leaded to a vocabulary change between the United States and the German Foreign Minister in Berlin.
James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, reaffirmed in September that the U.S. did not have any possibilities for foreign sponsoring, “in order to steal foreign enterprises in order to build their international competitiveness or their profits”.
However, from Edward Snowden, who has become an unwilling employee to Whistleblower, with the publication of his Fulglens in US-American supervisory secrets, the European governments and heads of enterprises have no longer been safe if they can speak to the director.
Reports that the American National Security Agency sponsored the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and provided data from the American Cloud provider, including Google and Yahoo, have brought the company paranoia to a new level because of public supervision.
The passing phase was the interpretation that the officer Angela Merkels' phone was struck, perhaps for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe is able to visit, it is also the potential objective of enterprises with security.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between US secret services and companies transparent.
I think it's likely to be used to use these data for mutual benefits.
“Germany has to wake up” says Oliver Green, President of the BITMI, who represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German enterprises believe that the United States now posed a almost large risk of China when it goes to industrial sponsoring and data-based investigation, which was published in July by the Advisory Company EC.
However, in Snowden's documentation, there was no sign that the United States had granted the operational secrets of foreign enterprises to its own companies.
Political politicians expressed their concern that the EU had failed certain IT and Internet powers and should reduce their dependence from the United States.
The companies are skeptic in this regard.
In the Federal Day, we should build a German Google.
I can just close my eyes and open it slowly...
“This does not work” says Hasso Plattner, President of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you should not have let them die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subventioned, from the coal through cars to the agricultural.
All up to the IT.
However, scopes and technical rationalities have been shocked by the US Snowd-intelligence authorities, which had previously seen the largest spionage risk in China.
In Cloud Computing there is a great change, since European enterprises are now conscious of the data stored in the United States and, therefore, potentially threatened.
According to one of the Cloud Security Alliance, a business institution, conducted surveys, constitutes an enthusiasm of American data mining activities with prism some ten percent of non-associative members plans to use a American provider.
Jim Snabe, a former SAP business leader, says: “We see a new question of customers who haven't yet been a year ago – she says: Where will my data be stored and can you ensure that this physically remains in this legal space?
Many German enterprises believe that the recent reports only confirm what they knew, namely that the powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore should be guarded for each price.
It is not surprised that economic sponction is happening.
That's always like that.
“ It was a subject for many years and has not changed fundamentally through the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the Chemistry BASF.
Americans sponsor us at a commercial and industrial level, as we do, as it is in national interest to defend our enterprises.
The company management is normally not about the contractual measures that have been taken, because it makes advantages of the adverse.
In large enterprises, employees are already understood that the participation of a free USB stand on a messe or the unexpected license of a laptop in the hotel room is not ratifying.
Ulrich Hackenberk, member of the headquarters of the Audi Auto manufacturer, says that it has been earned for years to collect the phones before a meeting, so that it is not possible to use as listening devices.
The German BVT is leading forces to use simple Prepaid handoys when they go to foreign journeys because smartphones may be compromised.
The Prepaid Handys will be removed back.
However, there is concern that smaller and medium-sized enterprises remain an integral towards hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are world market leaders in the Nice.
“Clean and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to protect operational secrets effectively against non-accessed access” warns in a report.
The United States warn their own business towards economic sponsoring by other countries.
According to Washington Post, the US National Intelligence Intelligence Estimate in February, France, Russia and Israel were ordered for two of the countries who served to purchase economic data of hacking.
A member of a German Blue-Chip company was true when it goes to economic sponsor, then “the Frenchs are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former leader of the French internal Secret Service DCRL, has been quoted in a interview in this month with the following words: “Secret services know that all countries, even if they cooperate with terrorism, are working on their associates.”

Parents of a young man in Georgia who died in tragic accident believed murder
The parents of the adolescent whose body was found in a collected ringer mate in the Turnhall of his high school are convinced that her son was killed, explained the lawyer of the family on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta, in the United States State of Georgia, was found in an opposite Matte found on January 11th, which was behind the tribune in the school hall.
The investigators of the Sheriff of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the family of 17-year-olds.
“They are convinced that her son was murdered,” said Benjamin Crump, lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, against FoxNews.com.
They never thought he died as the sheriff was closed.
“They are the view that it has improved every logic, contrary to the physical laws and to the healthy human mind,” says Crump.
Moreover, they are convinced that the truth will be pronounced to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
“Your son went to learn to the school and came back to the body hall” he commented.
US Ombudsman Michael Moore said on Thursday, it will give a formal investigation on the death of Johnson, as a number of important questions are still unexpected.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death to return to a crime?
This declared Moore at a press conference on Thursday.
I follow the facts, in which direction they also lead.
My goal is to find the truth.
“I believe that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation,” he said.
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsie stated that Johnson had been lost on the consequences of a ‘positive position’.
However, a second autopsy has given another cause of death, so Moore.
“ There is a number of questions that must be answered or confirmed,” he said.
Moore added, if there are sufficient evidence for a criminal or civilian investigation on the death of Johnson, he will enforce the FBI with the implementation of investigations.
A representative of the Board of Sheriff's authority was not prepared on our request on Thursday at a comment.
A court in South Georgia ordered that the authorities should release all videos of supervisory which were checked by the investigators at midday.
The parents of the teenager said they hoped that the video records showed how he died.
CDC Public Allergy Directives for Schools
In mid-day, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a number of directives for the treatment of food allergies of children at school.
This is the first of these directives which the US Government has issued, as the number of debt children with food allergies is increased.
One of 20 children in the United States has food allergic.
The dissemination of food allergies among children has increased from 1997 to 2007 by 18 per cent.
The guidelines contain information on schools that should be aware of food allergic allergic learning in the field of teacher and employees, and how to implement with children, the allergy reactions shown.
It is also recommended that schools have pre-epinephrin - the auto injection of the EpiPen Mark is most commonly used - to enable a potential mortal hypersensitive reaction.
Legislators in the Federal States have recently amended the provisions so that schools of Epinephrin can be more simplified.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms that are called by children that present an allergy reaction.
Childs may say: “It feels like if something presses my language,” “My language feels like a hair standing on it” or “My tongue cry.”
Parents from inter-sexual children can choose “sexual indefinite”
Germany is the first European nation where a third gender is recognised for children who have been born with nondefined genetics.
Newborns are no longer strict to men or women.
According to the new law, parents do not need to explain the gender for such children, but they may specify “indefinite” or “not defined” on birth course.
The objective of the law is to take the pressure of parents in order to not take overseas decisions regarding operations for gender allocation in newborns and to combat discrimination of inter-sexual people.
A intersexual person told BBC years later: “I am no man or woman.”
I remain the filling work that was created by doctors is shocked and full of nerves.
Assuming, one of 2,000 children comes every year, nor as a boy or a girl to the world.
They are among the intersexuals, a group that falls under the diagnosis “Sexual Difference Disorder” (DSD) of a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, chemistry verse (eruptions or hairs) or uncommonly developed genes.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
The understanding of gender identity is still not very well developed, but most experts in the United States focused on using the best available information on sexual instruction if a determination is not possible, and not waiting for the psychological and physical development of the child before, if indeed, to decide for an operation.
The New York Psychiater Dr. Jack Drescher, who has specialized the problems of sexual identification, said that the new German law “spends on a good thing”.
Intersexual children make a ethical dilemma.
“ Some people have life - threatening diseases that need a surgical invasion, but most children do not apply, ” he said.
You can take sexual instruction without operation and then expect how to develop identity.
Scientific data about how a child really developed its sexual identity are not very precise.
Nobody knows why it happens.
It's like the secret, because people are homosexual.
In a report from 2011 to the European Commission, inter-except people are to differ from transexual or transgender persons, because their status is not sexually sex, but constitutes their biological Constitution, which is not only men or women, but typically defined both or not as one of them.
These properties were shown in random sexual characters such as muscle mass, control, breasts and statues, priority sexual characters such as proliferation organs and genetics or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of discrimination, which views inter-sexual and transgender persons in professional life, as well as the extent of prosecution, violence and prejudiciary criminality.
Not with the sex-compliant boys now have a special camp.
In the meantime, it is possible for adults in Australia and Nepal to designate a man, a woman or a third sex on official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May-wellby (52) was acknowledged as the first “someless” world, after a court had accepted the life-language conservation of a “no-definite” sex status.
German statements have a third instruction, X for intersexual, so the Ministry of Inlands, next to M and W.
In the near France, gender subjects are still opposed, so a news report on France 24.
2011, twelve French deputy signed a petition that would be removed from school books.
The American website Catholic Online also expressed himself against the German law with the foundation: “When the world is cut into a new condition where sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we turn two more pillars of civilization.”
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained against the baby zone, she started it better when the child was given a gender at birth.
“The parent’s base is already too stressful, especially if you do not know the gender of your own child,” she said the parent website.
Children need stability and security.
The historicly seen children who were born both with men and women's genders, called hermaphrodites, according to the attractive Greek god that had both genders.
Another ten years ago, the medicine considered the gender as something that could be removed and then rebuild.
However, in this context, the ethical basiss of an operation are doubted, after now known how complex the sexual identity is, and that doctors can also lie wrong because they don't know how the child feels with their child’s gender.
“In the midst of the 20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency,” said Drescher.
When a child was born, you were not calling the psychiater, but the surgery.
The dominant theory on the treatment of children with uncertain genetics is back to Dr. John Money from the University of Johns Hopkins, who treats the view that the sex is forbal.
He expressed the term “Sexual Identity” and argued, social and environmental disorders – such as parents learned a child – interaged with the genes and hormones of a child and prayed whether a person was considered men or women.
However, in a case known under the title “John/Joan” in 1966, his theories were controversed.
He called the parents of a boy whose penis was dismissed at a decreased inclination, to cast the child fully and also to remove his dogs and then grow him as a girl.
“Money presented this case as a successful example of change, but what he was not,” says Drescher.
When the boy was around 15 years, he returned to a male sex and married a woman.
But with 38, he was self-defended.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
However, in the 1990s, with the access of the Internet, the survivors of these sex operations have come to publicity, which are “not happy with the result”.
Like Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author of Montana, who was born with men's chromosomes of XY, but two-year-old Genitalians.
The doctors did not clear whether he had a great clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead to a man as a “pleasant life”.
So his external body and the Hoden were soon away after the birth of 1976, and he was grown as a girl.
When he was 12 years old, he received a woman's hormone.
"I knew I'm not a girl," he explained to ABCNews.com.
I was unfortunately, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
In the age of 18, he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But as he was depressive and knew that something was not true, he requested his medical data.
What he found was shocking.
I was sterilised at my birth, and no one told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD which could not produce enough testosteron for the development of the genetics.
After he learned the truth, he turned out to a man's identity, received testosteron injections and removed his breasts.
With the operation, he became unfruitable.
Today, he fights for others in a organization named Interface Project that intersexual people will be treated normally.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of business in California, the Advocates for Informed Choice, is able to ensure that the German law can “assimile and stymaticize”.
“A number of activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to take rapid decisions and to give the child a child, not defined”.
We fear that it benefits interventions.
We think it would be better to show the man or woman's gender and then wait.
But we don't even know how the law will affect, so we can only show.
Tamar-Mattis said that their organization supports the Australian law, because “adults allow the recognition as a third gender”.
“A adults should be able to take decisions on their legal sex,” she explained.
The German law relates to the date of birth.
It's not a fight to a little kid at this time.
If they are grown up, they can decide on their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Brustradiologist from Pittsburgh who has a daughter with sexual differences and supported hundreds of others in a self-help group, says that the German law is “compliant” both of the parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with men's chromosomes, but has a DSD, namely, complete androgenity.
Because of the receptor defect of the target cells for testosteron, Katie has developed women's character crystals.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no eggs.
Today, Katie 29 is married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a worker in the child psychiatrist.
Because it is unfruitable, however, hopes that it can get a child by adopting or giving a child.
“The law gives parents a room where they do not need to take decisions overcome,” said Baratz.
It allows them to make different tests, to clarify things, and gives them so much time before writing them “man” or “evidently”.
In this way, everything's okay – you're slinging the child and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the parent's happiness.
And you don't have to take a operation that can't be reversed.
“ This closes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents do, because they think they wouldn’t do the right thing, ” she explained.
Finally, the child decides about the gender, which is better to him – and that's wonderful.
This means that children will be able to take the decision itself.
Unknown girls hurt by shoot from car
Unknownly, a twelve-year-old in Sachsen has suffered from shoes from a car.
The murders were probably shooted with an air pressure weapons on a group of children on Thursdays in Genthine.
That's what the police shared in Burg.
The girl has been easily blessed at the left wade.
Reservation forces brought the girl into the hospital.
The shooting came from a small car that had been predicted at a group of six children and soon maintained.
The Witnesses saw two people sit in the car.
The murders also shooted on a bus.
I'm a bitch.
Then they went out of it.
The Criminal Police identified it on Friday.
To date, the police inspection can look back to a calm Halloween night.
The officers were called only two times to embraced children that were against households.
Since the householders recognised this at the time and removed the eggs, there should also be no damage.
Moreover, some Sylvester trees have also been buried in the city area, but there has not been no assault.
A resident in the Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his pkw was designed with clopapier and used his raid barriers.
But until the police came, the man recovered his raids in the nearest place of all, because the police did not have to continue.
Conditions with future perspective
In fact, Wa lives smiling Ries.
Your house is in a quiet residence of Stuttgart with a lot of green, a old tree file, nice neighbors and even not too much transport.
In the city there are only few minutes with public transport.
"They hopelessly have no fear of skins?" asked Wa smiling ries and shows on a slight skin in the sight of the twenty-five board.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for a few years.
But you know how hard this is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spinesphobie, but the concern of the many stages in the age to house and in the apartment can't be able to handle.
Furthermore, since a Meniskus operation, the mid-fifty-five-five-five-five-year-olds have to learn in their own body, which means moveing to Stockwork with handicap from Stockwerk to Stockwerk.
Recently, a book of her appears to the subject 'Happy lives in the age - What kind of residence is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what isn', starts to tell her.
When she went with her husband over 20 years in the household, it was just a beautiful apartment in the green.
Today with a mid-five-five-five-five thinks Wa get ries different of it.
But she also knows that she belongs to the few people who are really different from the theme 'Women in age'.
Most of them disappear it as long as it happens.
The old ones will always be the other," she says smiling.
First, when the pain pressure is really great, you think.
'But it can be too late', so Ries.
In its book, the inner architectine provides 17 living models for a self-determined residence in age.
'If you choose a living form, it is always a individual decision', she explains.
D i e solution does not give it for the age.
Even those who can stay in the Tuscany or the Bretagne should always feel that he can also be sick.
And: 'No good knowledge of the country language will also agree in Dolce Vita', the expert authors of exhibition provides for the specialists.
In its models, classic care models, alternative residence forms or the often quoted rentner WG.
In age, everyone has his ticks and masks
'If I'd be so a living community but nothing,' she means with an eye-winkel.
Not like a student WG with a common bath and a kitchen.
'The age needs just his back spaces', so Ries.
However, that a senior community can function, the bookautor will not be excluded.
But it should be different from the classic students WG.
And sometimes you just want his peace, she believes.
In this opinion, it is not at least in the head of the country.
'The most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment so long,' is also the experience of Theresa Rüten, head of the civil service life in the age of the country's capital.
Your service office is rounding people around the subject 'olds'.
Therefore, the elderly people would often also take in order to purchase inadequacy and limitations, only to remain in their habitual environment, which is also the experience of the Foundation Warentt.
There are now many opportunities to build the house or apartment barrier free.
Ries recommends that all those who have the right to rebuild their home or their apartment, inform themselves once well and not to keep the first handworkers.
Today, there is also the right to rebuilding specialists.
Even in the accommodation, it will be realized by one or another, and if it is only the increase in the toilet, the internal architectin is cleared.
But it is not always possible that the existing apartment behaviour and that is free of barrier, even though it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to make Wae ries.
Because you could install a swimming lift within the apartment, which would also be a path loaded to the door of the apartment, but the widely larger obstacle.
She will continue to search until she found the ideal object for himself and her husband.
Before the shopping, you're more than before the spring at the door of your apartment.
The United States want to continue to pursue Snowden in criminal law
The United States have not changed their position to the former US secret workers Edward Snowden.
He will continue to be proposed to have provided unpermitted secret information.
That is why he should be sentenced in the United States, said the speaker of the United States Foreign Minister, Jennifer Psaki, Washington.
Also, the recent Snowden's words would not change it.
Before the German Green Political Hans-Christian Structure, after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, called to the United States to not even threaten him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that it was a structural vote on the parliamentary and not on the member of a German government.
Secret Service Teacher Edward Snowden is based on a conversation with German authorities.
First, however, he wants to know his situation clearly.
This clearly made the former NSA employees searched for in a non-reported letter published by the Green Christian Structurer Hans on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and continued to the Federal Government, Federal Day and General Connection lawyer.
The writing has translated the following words after a structure translation:
Avoidable
I was requested to write to you about your investigation on mass supervisory.
I am Edward Joseph Snowden and was previously treated or directed as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In my employment in these institutions, I was witnessing my Government's systematic legislation that has taken me from moral responsibilities to trade.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw me a serious and continuing script that forced me to leave my family and my homemate.
I live at the exile and enjoyed asylum, which gives me the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged by the resonance of my political trade, both in the United States and in other parts.
Citizens throughout the world and high officials, including the United States, have estimated the interpretations of a system of comprehensive monitoring which is responsible for no accounting as a public service.
These sponsoring extents moved many proposals on new laws and directives which resulted in the formally declared consumption of public confidence.
The benefits of society from these recognitions are increasingly clearer; at the same time, the risks taken in the purchase were significantly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts was clearly positive, my Government has said, as a fidelity, and then is trying to criminalize political opinions and declare in a crime.
However, the truth is not a crime.
I am convinced that the Government of the United States, with support of the international Community, will depend on this final position.
I hope that, if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are understood, I will be able to participate in the appropriate and legal declaration of the experts in the media, especially in terms of truth and authenticity of the reports.
I am pleased to talk to you in your country when the situation is clear and thank you for their efforts to ensure the international law which protect us all.
Edward Snowden witnessed by Hans-Christian Structure
Child gardens have found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands", says Winterlingen's citizensman Michael Mayer.
The former child gardens in the garden street sold the communities to a private person.
The sale of the Community Council agreed to be a part in its recent meeting.
The building changed his owners to a "acceptable" price.
"The community is satisfied," says Mayer.
In the budget, 100 000 euros were used.
It is still not clear how the new owners want to use the previous child garden.
The Citizense Minister is the right that winters have given the responsibility for the building before winter to someone else, and therefore no longer have to come to the entertainment of the house, how to heat, to look after the garden and to spend the journey.
"They are now away," Mayer rejoices.
Place concerns at high temperatures
The music coal hammersbach offers a place center on the terrace of the guest house.
When Dirigentin Bianca Willmann has the taxstock at 19:30 p.m, the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the kitchens of the Hammeric musicians.
The President Manuela Honeck explains the music rooms.
Honeck thanked all who had helped the first musical hock in this context.
Report: Obama campaign discussed to replace skins by Hillary Clinton
The most closest advisers of President Barack Obama have discussed in secret Vice-President Joe Biden in the election camp 2012 by replaceing Hillary Clinton, so the New York Times.
The enthusiasm is the considerable surprising of the long expected work of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann over the 2012 election campaign, “Double Down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times is an exemplary of the book that appears, and she reported on the Thursday that the President's top advisers would have performed “increased group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011” to find out whether it would be better for Obama's hope to re-embrace when he was falling.
According to Jonathan Martin, the National Political Correspondent of Times, the book is incredibly subscribed to the history of the efforts of the chairmans of the campaign and the White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, as well as to measure the effect that it has on the values of interrogation to be baptized by former Foreign Minister Clinton against Vice-Presidents.
The potential changing was a strictly protected secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only one half of the closest advisers of the President – including Daley, former campsman of Obamas, Jim Messina, and the former leading advisors of the White House, David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the thoughts of change.
The “Double Down” states that Daley had made a stand on the sight of the efforts, notwithstanding their “unity, personal relationships” before finally decided on such a shock after showing that Clinton's candidate would “the opportunities of Obama” would not be improved.
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually discussed replacement of skins by Clinton.
“I expressed a number of things you should consider, and that was one of these,” said Daley to the magazine.
It should be recalled that the President had a horrible question, so we thought, “For God’s will, what we do?"
While Daley described the investigations as “boat sorgfalt”, Martin said to Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the re-electing campaign, he has been employed significantly to find out whether such trains are paid for election urges.
“In campaigns, it is not so much money for surveys and focus groups if you do not think seriously about something,” explained Martin at AC360.
However, it is not clear if Obama knew that his team thought about a exchange.
Martin said to CNN, he asked Daley if his former boss knew about the potential change.
Even though Daley explained that he did not believe that the President was “conscious” of the possible change, the previous head of the stakeholder said that it was“possibly” that Obama knew it.
Martin added that “double Down” did not give any definitive answer to the question whether the political reviews obamas had reached in writing.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama didn't know any of the surveys about whether the skins should fall at the elections.
“Possible” Martin replied.
What happens on my email?
Email is actually e-mail.
Is the same as in the original post, in the design of the Internet-Dise email, the secret has been technically implemented?
The concept of the previous Internet services was to make possible communications.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols have not been considered to create a stable foundation for an hearing letter change.
This is why a coherent e-mail corresponds to an open post card than a seleted letter.
If user "Anna" sends a mail to "Benni", the computers of the two are directly connected?
The email program or the browser of Anna first step sends the email to the email server of their service providers.
For example, if she has a Gmail account, it would be Google.
This email server sends the content to the supplier that uses Benni.
On the road, the mail can run through some other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content to his supplier.
Will coherent e-mails be able to read through the network?
Most mails are read several times by software robots.
The supplier is generally checked whether the mail has a damage program as an annex.
The recipient systems are also obtained in a virus check.
Furthermore, the providers check whether it is a quiet and unwanted spam mail that is just removed or at least discarded in a spam folder.
Does the robots have another job?
In systems such as Gmail, the robot also identifies the information that Google requires to place context review.
If you communicate Anna and Benni per Gmail about their coming holiday travels, Google can hide corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do Unknown people also read e-mails?
The probability that unable people read a message is extremely low.
Theoretical, however, is possible.
In enterprises, the administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
Criminal persecution authorities and secret services also have legal opportunities to take or take account of e-mails.
There are possible illegal speech actions.
Is it possible to protect e-mails against mailing?
With a encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an e-mail can be effectively encrypted against a media.
It is also possible to spend the metadata of an e-mail communication with high technical impact, so that you can not even be recognised without any other person who has been communicated with whom it has been.
How important is Yahoo and Google on the email market in Germany?
The mainly private post cases play Yahoo and Google, according to an investigation of Convios Consulting from August 2013, are only a subdesigned role.
While the shareholder of Yahoo Mail had recently fallen, Gmail was able to subscribe clearly by Google.
Mother in the bowl painted and shocked
When his mom died, a man from Wolfburg was a plan.
He entered the dead in a forest - and continued to hide their rents and rewards.
In order to be able to cover the pensions and ships, a 67-year-old Wolfburger has buried his whole mother after investigations of the police in the forest.
First, he slaughtered the death of the 89-year-olds, then he put the money more than a half years ago.
Now, the 67-year-olds have to be answered for fraud, as a speaker said on Friday.
Then the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected already in May: afterwards, the mother that was needing was no longer needed for the medication.
The investigator told the Rentner that his mother was traveling to Spain.
Because the officials were wonderful about this, they continued to find them.
As a result, the two of them had lived over 15 years in a common apartment and had recently taken it.
The 67-year-old was finally slaughtered the death of his mother.
The police said that there were no counting points for a capital crime.
Are you glassing on the ice cream that shine in the dark?
A British employee has developed the first in the dark egg – using quollen.
Charlie Francis did use the fluorescent properties of the sea store and created a lighting lekerei.
The idea was that he came to him after he had read a research work on Quanten and was able to convince Chinese scientists to create the light protein artificially.
The glasscreme reacts with the tongue, which increases the pH value in protein and eliminates the light.
Chris explains that the food reacts to the warmth in your mouth and light - so much more you're lighting, so so lighter it's.
Charlie, founder of the Eiscreme Company “Lick Me I'm Delicius” says, “The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and there are two grams of it for 200 pounds.”
The protein used in the iron screen reacts with the language at a neutral pH value.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH value increases and ice lights.
We have tested it in the last months and it seems ideal to bring it to Halloween on the market because it has this wonderful light effect.
It's probably the most precious ironcreme I've made it, because the quantity light is four times more than gold.
Each cup costs me about 140 pounds.
But it's sweet.
Charlie's experimental company with seats in Bristol is famous for its uncommon shoes, including beer, sweet, sweet meat and brown.
But his latest creation is to be more ambitious.
He says, "I would like to develop an invisible iron screen."
This is on and impossible because of the lightbreak that is called by the iron crisis, from which it exists, but I am convinced that we find a possibility to create it.
The ice screen uses the fluorescent properties of a quantel which is artificially produced by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is still six game days without any point in the handball link.
It is now calculated for the team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow to Derby against the TSV Daverden, who held his first victory at the last weekend.
With this game the season starts again for us.
"I hope we're finally free of the head," has the ears behaviour optimistically.
It is finally available, with the exception of the last hendric Blohme, its complete chair.
Daverden also puts us on time game.
That is why we have to keep our error rates low.
However, first-line, there is a need to increase in the cover, which has finally left everything other than a safe impression.
Indeed, Daverdens Coach Thomas Panitz is the first stage seat against Northhorn.
The game, of course, was a house number.
But that's why we're not the favorite for a long time, because in Derby's it can always happen.
However, Panitz now wants to set up in Morsum to start a series.
The lack of the Jan-Malath will be Jodat.
For this, the A-Young Yest Wind Susse, who is active with double play right to the A-bodiestor HC Bremen, has its saison deployment.
Whoever isn't warm in that game must stay home.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was a little, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were able to eat wellness, to stay late and to take us to the neighborhood.
Today, I've become a Halloween muffil.
In the past two years, I have not been willing to depart from my apartment from sweetness, and I will not do this year.
But statistics say I'm a black sheep, which is Halloween.
The majority of the Americans – 158 million to be precise – celebrates this year Halloween and gives a total of 6,9 billion US dollars for beauty, costumes and decorations, so the US-American Association of individuals (NRF).
One thing I'm rejoicing every Halloween then is the trend values.
The costs will be estimated for about 1,2 billion of US dollars issued, as the NRF.
In this year there are incredible objects of the last cry.
Women don't need to kiss themselves in sexy clothing, they can now also be prostituted foods such as pizza, Hamburger or cards.
What men do, I expect every amount of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I decided that the Tuft-Punk World Manager will create it in the instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most amazing cosmos Zombies, Batman, Pirates and Hexen are.
I think it's nothing wrong with tradition.
We brought our dogs the last year, and they were not alone to my surprises.
Indeed, Americans pay $330 million this year for costiming their householders, so the NRF.
It's a lot of Hot Dogs.
What's going on, we're not coherent.
Americans will pay $1,9 billion for this year, so The Nielsen Company.
These are about 270 million kilograms of chocolates, shocks, bonbons and gumballs.
Thus, good news for the United States Headquarters' Ministry of the United States 41 million people who are driving through the speech "sweet or saure" by the fourth.
Indeed, we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of shock for Halloween and -- we do nothing to eat.
The only thing we don't want to consume is the sweet Candy Corn; however, it is sold 15 million kilograms for Halloween, so the national association of the good product producers.
These are about nine billion mass.
It's a race that I couldn't solve.
Nothing belongs to Halloween than houses where it spots.
They have great names such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which otherwise is in a real prison), "Howl-O-Screen" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized spook houses in the United States who gets $500 million resolved, so America Haunts, and this encloses the wonderful photos that are just in the hose pinkelt and the friends then set on Facebook where they are not reacting again, and one of the guy on which you are standing leaves a comment as "nother face expression".
But finally, we're coming to the curbs.
Charlie Brown trusted us with the great curves when we were kids, and the sweet of a snake is like the shock of Christmas tree – something we made from small.
Happily, the "Baby in the Kürbis" trend was just the last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us have grown up to access the core and not to sit there.
This year, the US Census Office will pay $106 million for curbies.
The cowboys, who slowly destroyed in the garden, are probably from Illinois where 245 million kilograms of curbs were shocked this year.
If you want to correct points, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and shoot some swimming pool from its 921 pounds of serious kitchen.
Apartment burn in Helmbrechts: Reservation forces in mountain-coated body
The fire shooting had to express the late Thursday in Helmbrecht.
A three-million family house in the countrycraft Court starts in the night on Friday.
The rescue forces mountains a decorated body from the house.
Reservation forces have found a decorated body in a three-familiar house at a burn in Helmrecht.
If it's about a resident, it's still unbelievable as a speaker of the police in Bayreuth.
Last Thursday, it was burned in the home's earthquake.
When the fires arrived, the flames are already broken out of a window.
The use of the forces went into the apartment and found the bodies in a room.
This and another room completely burned.
The whole earthquake was damaged.
All other inhabitants were not home during the burden, the police speaker continued.
The building is not living first.
The exact cause for the fire was first not clear.
Germany’s largest country church has started an open-up to purchase the pastor's professional.
The Evangelian-Lutheran Landeskirche Hannover is a possibility of counting about 1.800 pastors and pastors to 2030.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offered good future views, said Pastor Matthis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Gospel Press Service.
It is attractive to determine the labour and day end itself.
With Burkina, the country church first has employed a pastor at a full place to visit young people for the theology study.
Today, less young people are decided to study theology after the abysorption.
Burfien returns this to the process of discipleness: "God's voice is low, the world is sound."
In this way, the profession of great freedom and diversity is expressed.
I am Mr. My Terminal Calendar and I can put my degree in which I am important.
Pastors may be close to people as Seelsorger.
They paid so much as teachers and could live well.
Indeed, more will be paid in the free economy, but theologists had to have a safe employer.
This comes from the young people today who are not only about the carriage, but also for a senseful job.
According to the information of the country church, which includes three neighbors Niedersachsens, the present year runs around 60 pastors in peace.
At the same time, about 40 results of a theological study their vicatory.
In these areas, such as the hardship, Emsland or Wedland, it can be difficult to place places in the future.
Burfien wants to organize a study day for young people and invite prominent people who have studied theology.
The theology study offered a wide training.
You can even be the Federal President.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
In the internal, renses and six pounds and a free speech is found.
The options are available to increased brems, a service package with the maintenance of Bowler-Works mechanisms and logistic support up to vehicle installation between events.
Drew Bowler, director of Bowler Motorsport, says: “The Rally clients who come to Bowler have changed.”
They are not all experienced rail drivers, but people who are looking for disappointment and absents, as well as after achieving way to class events.
We are glad to be able to open this way in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format determines new possibilities to experience the various Rally Disciplines in Britain and the Foreign and to prepare new links on the straights and the reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge Wagen – that will be a sustainable mastership.
In addition, the Defender Challenge has a training and test day in February, as well as the option to participate in western residents in North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefloor to save a dog that set 15 meters over the ground on a dangerous rock prepair in a stone brown
Cockerspanel Hündin Ruby was discovered after a smaller traffic accident
Three days later, she was discovered by a snake in the stone brown in her worst situation.
Fire legs blew down to stones and saved the dog before the safe death.
The fire was able to swallow a dog safe, switching up a 15 meters high shore in a rock gate.
The nine months old Cockerspaniel Hundin Ruby was following a traffic accident on Sunday and survived alone three days before she was saved from a stone break.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20 of whom the dog heard, came to the stone fleet in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to take Ruby back and thank you for the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They were doubtless searching after their lost hair and publishing support calls in social networks when they had gone after the small traffic accident in the stone broken.
It was against 14:15 p.m. on midnight, a swimming swimming snake saw his dog, the swimming Ruby on the 15-m higher paragraph in the stone broke.
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station took place and looked at the relief of Rubys, then transported to a dog box above.
Andy Clayton, a specialist of the technical rescue team, said: “He was in a dangerous situation.
They were located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She did not move muscles during her saving – she was like steifed.
But now she's okay.
Then she took a few dogs.
It was a very uncommon use.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, a specialist of the technical rescue team, said: “Rouby had a ridiculous disappointment.”
It was the possibility that she was very hard or worse.
Ruby was carried out to the animal physician, but not found anything except creature and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “It was angry to see the salvation.”
I couldn't even believe she was upstairs.
It was wonderful to keep them back in the arms.
The animal physician explained that if the creature becomes too large and it would be broken, it would probably be disrupted.
The fires have done greatly.
It was really courageous to do what they did.
We're just so grateful and everyone of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson, from Keighley, added: “We had fear that she would disappear, but she remained above. ”
The fires were wonderful.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger explained that he never thought Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radiostate this week, the Pop Star said she worked as a Bacround Singer at Jaggers Song “Old Habits The Hard” from 2004.
Perry explained that she eated with the alcoholic, and that “he was shocked me when I was 18. ”
She added: “This is long and he was very nice to me.”
In a statement, a representative of Jaggers, 70th, said, on Thursday, he “declared Catholicly that he had ever taken up a survey at Katy Perry.”
The representative added: “Everyway she changed him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the songs that had a host in the Rolling Stock Tower this year.
Your new "Prism" album was on anfieb this week.
George Kerevan: European disappointment gives the shoot the choice
A new day, a new horrible story for independence.
This time we will warn that an independent Skotland is necessary to participate in the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the sign of history on pass controls in Berwick and a secure border with stacheldradat along the Hadrian Walls.
Indeed, in the Strathclyde Proposal, the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but this has not been a role in the lines.
No one has not mentioned that EU Member States often are to adopt their strict rules when they are better for them.
Since Scotia is not now heard in the Schengen room, the continuing non-respect for Brussels would only be a small consent to what you really want to do with the shoots.
So you don't have a story.
And one who has come so in the years that she is already the same fosil: the first time I heard the "Independence" means pass controls at least 40 years ago.
This is a interesting point when continuously repeating this urgency history.
Why should a independent Skotland expect that it dances after the European Pfeife?
Why would the London joch be against the Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great, strong plan for the Association of Europe after the war has been shocked.
With the European crisis, the project Europe has been officially dead.
Overall in the EU, profiting parties on grounds that are fellow to be the EU or want to spend the euro as a Community swimming swimming pool.
Even in Germany, the Euroskeptic Party Alternative for Germany – first founded this year – could have only five million votes at the Federal Day election in September, and thus effectively leave the free democrats (the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats).
There was always a home resistance against the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis is a point of changing.
As the Berlin and the European Central Bank strictly linked Spain policy in connection with the swimming chain where the national economy is required by the holding of the common currency, many believe that the European project was too far.
The euro crisis has little to do so that national governments cause excessive budget deficiencies – that was only in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has set up its members on exchange rates that are advantageous for German exporters, and it would like to allow German politicians so.
Without the possibility of assessing local currency, Southern Europe will return to Germany with an integrated productivity share.
The only possibility is to shorten the expenditure and public expenditure – encouraged by Berlin.
Among the current state and monetary problems, a deepest European productivity problem is.
As a result of the green energy directives adopted by Brussels – a Code for the subsidiation of French and German energy companies in costs of consumers – the European industry compares the double for electricity and the fourth stages for gas.
This is a remarkable share of costs, as we had already seen in Grangeouth.
The European Petrochemical Industry does not protect all the loans of the world because it is unlikely to be moved by a bill of American steel gas in the edge.
As a result, a revolt, especially in France, is the only chairman of the EU.
After the war, the EU's political elite of France saw the EU as a vehicle with which it was able to keep Germany in shock and to have Paris highlighted Washington.
But Berlin does not need Paris more than a port for political legitimation and has expressed its own economic policy to fight the French economy.
The result: Marine Le Pens, the legal judiciary, the EU-Finish National Front, just wins a decisive return to the government socialists in three places.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the election votes – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot be able to get out of it, a disclosure in the right spectrum would mean automatic benefits for the left.
What does Le Pen make with her new popularity among the white Frenchs of the worker class?
It wants to use the EU choice in the next year to measure an anti-EU, anti-Community block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties are well dismissed in these elections, and it is very well possible, then the European Parliament could first dominate such blocks.
This is the point I want to be left: in the future, the growing residue against the EU and the common currency will be accompanied to decrease the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will be more like the "Europe of the (sovereign) nations, the General de Gaulle.
Germany and a few of its satellite companies may be fixed at the euro, but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I hope that the United States are divided from this project in the hope that the United States will be able to interfere with them.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific Area is close to the fact that the United Kingdom will be alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where's the Skotland?
We can decide to be a region of (in the last consequent) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – which is also listening to tell Berlin and Brussels what they can go where they are.
I believe that Skotland could be well done in a more locker European connection, if we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other, similar countries is easier in a non-food Europe of the nations.
On the other hand, we should consider the same thing as Norwegia and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is, notably, the most successful political movement against the Space Policy in Europe and has gained a more spectacular majority because of the rejection of the proposed (and undertaking) burdens which were responsible for the Minister of Labour- Finance Alistair Darling and the following Tory-Lib Dem Coalition.
It would be funny for Skotland to decide for an independence now, only to take off a speech policy from Berlin and Brussels.
Previous Puberty: Being grown
African and Spanish girls tend to achieve the puberty more than their white age girls, such as research.
Physical changes do not mean the puberty
There is no evidence that hormone or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that epidemic fertility is a detriment of the early puberty.
The trend to early puberty is less expressed in kids
The former CNN Correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specialized on children's health and family issues.
Should a mother be worried when her daughter grows in the age of seven or eight years of breast and hair?
At the annual conference of the Child Medical Association American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these previous physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new standard.
“I have a lot of time to calm your parents – normally it is no sign that the puberty is now quick.” Kaplowitz explained.
Evident development displays, such as growing breasts, skins, axles, and body demands, are shown in girls early.
However, in the past 40 years there was only a slight movement in the age of menarch.
The average rate of 125 years is in the United States, a little less than 12.75 in 1970.
“When the breast’s development begins, there are at least two to three years to menarch,” said Caplowitz, also author of the book “Freue Pubertate with girls: the essential advisor to address this common problem”.
Time is the most precise test, as the puberty advances.
It is reversed, which actually represents the beginning of the puberty, but it applies to “from breeding” if the growth of a growing sugar is accompanied before a age of eight years.
In most cases, the process is slow or stagnated – something that can be monitored accurately by a child physician.
The tests may be shown by an indicator in order to exclude serious problems such as tumor or cysts.
There are treatment methods to delay a premature mestruction and other consequences: the premature age of skins, the finally to increase growth, and thus the small body weight in adults.
Recommendations for medical or hormonal therapy are aimed at the age of the child, the development speed, the growth rate and the emotional rit.
Psycho-social aspects are also important.
Caplowitz is declining in what is medically, but he says: “The subpressions of the puberty may milk the behavior problems and the feelings of girls, other than being their older girls.”
The other big problem is comprehensive: parents simply don't want to want their young daughters to have the period.
“They are careful for the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienical side,” said Caplowitz.
“ It was a shock,” remembers a woman who received her daughter with ten days.
Even if there was the first sign and we had spoken about menstruction, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came angry and angry from school to home because she was the first in her friendship.
There are many comprehensively published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there are no fair evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual news in the media were originally.
Childs come like girls before in the puberty.
Caplowitz is the view that the most convinced premise is the epidemic of fertility.
He supported the implementation of a study in 2001 on girls from six to nine years of age, which produces a relationship between body feed and involvement in the puberty.
Other research supports this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African and Spanish girls tend to reach the puberty more than their white friends.
There are different statements for it.
Global seems to have an early puberty of all possible things to be influenced by economic conditions on climate to genes.
Another race: Despite children growing the face and shadow warning early, the trend is not expressed as with girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference stress the complexity of the topic.
The visit of acne and shamhaar is widely distributed at children and kids.
“We have to be careful as to identify the true start of the puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatrist endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not be able to let their child’s doctor advise how to talk to their child.
“This can mean that you have to conduct a conversation before you are expected,” said Caplowitz.
If you stay quiet, the child normally reacts well.
The girls who flew early require the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it enters previously than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers strive in view of large orders on seat width
Among the leading aircraft manufacturers, it has been an interview on the width of seats in the tourist class at long-street flights, which leads to the sound for a worse convergence on the Dubai Airshow this month.
The strike turns to the seat width that passengers will be offered in long flights in the tourist class – not always those to try the airlines mostly, but this exhibited room represents the key for the effectiveness of airbus SAS and Boeing Co.’s most recent aircraft.
Airbus requested a sector standard of at least 46 cm (18 cm) in the tourist class this week, but the US-American Erzrivale Boeing said that the airlines should decide.
The interview is at a time since the aircraft manufacturers will still sell larger versions of their two motor vehicles, and expects record contracts from 17 to 21 November.
As the back part of the airport is deleted – in particular whether there are rows with nine or ten seats – is crucial for the economic results specified to deliver the new “Mini Jumbo” design.
Boeing said that his modernized “777X” phase 406 people were at seats in the tourist class, which are wide over 17 dolls and allows ten per series.
Airbus explains that the competitive version of the A350 transports 350 people in 18 customs large sites in the tourist class, which there are nine per series.
Aircraft advertising frequently share hibe on technical details using advertising in the special pressure.
Now calls Airbus before Dubai Airshow, where 777X with more than 100 orders will be expected to make the pension right to the public.
The company recently showed an indication that could be the beginning of a new war and show a image of money in which three people sit together in a restaurant, and thus the title: “Do you accept that?
“Boeing proposes long-stretch flights in seats, which are closer to the region of Turbo Props,” says the head of Airbus, John Leahy.
In view of changed food habits, people will be dickers, but airlines have not changed radically.
Among the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-term journey, and at the end of the century, the weight of the medium-sized men has increased from 40 to 49 years of age by 10 percent, thus the data of the US Ministry of Health.
The number of men's average people in the 21th century is 100.8 cm of American health statistics.
Airbus says that his rival was a seat concept from the 1950s, as the average body size of the fresh baptized “Jet Set” was worse.
So Airbus, research carried out that an additional customs (2,54 cm) per sit increased the quality of sleep to 53%.
Boeing controls the numbers of Airbus to the seats and says that it is not to decide how aircraft enterprises build the balance between aircraft and plant.
The company also declares that, according to the investigations, the experience in the flight depends on more than the seat width.
“It’s really going to give airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think to be successful,” explains the flight expert Kent Craver von Boeing.
They don't want us to dictate them what it makes.
You know her business better than anyone else.
There are more aircraft freedoms for passengers, but the manufacturer will, in increasingly, be a subject that can affect the changes.
A wage for aircraft orders is estimated by at least 700 billion US dollars on list prices in the coming decades, which could affect the export balance of the United States or Europe.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seatlayout is the driving power behind the interview towards the new jets.
Even Airbus as well as Boeing 20% more efficiency per sit were at its latest two-motor long-street designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-six boeing 77-300ER.
The reports on the results are partly due to the comparison of the 777X with its ten seats per series with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are still lower than currently used machines with ten seats per serie.
“There are more seats in his airport to make it more competitive to our products,” says Kevin Keniston, director for passenger comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts said that fully boxes with ten seats per series of 777s indicated that many passengers decided for the closer order, which could be taken with more suitable flight rates.
“The eightt dog width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: by an economic face, the airbus offer is controlled by the threat by 777," says Mary Kirby, experts for cabin plant, founders and exhibitors of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing does not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The favorable Jet sellers have even a band measure in order to comply with the competitiveness.
Even if they approve the comfort, all manufacturers also offer Jets with high-scale exhibition for flying and regional flights.
Airbus offers a A350 with ten lines, but has not been sold in its own speech.
Until recently, Airbus highlighted the importance of being more adjustable to the kitchen and offered wide seats to the gates.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call will probably be polluted after a new sector standard, but it could be allowed from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-Nichotin impairment could make the grain in smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-Nichotin impairment that could destroy the enjoyment of smoking.
One dose of the vaccine could protect a lifetime before the nicotin sweet.
Before testing the people, further trials are needed, which can last a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results are good.
“We are very hopeful that this type of vaccine strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and have tried all the methods available on the market, but they had to experience that their nicotin demand is stronger than these approaches” says Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been changed so that it contains the genetic information on the manufacture of nicotine antibodies.
The virus is selectively infecting the lever cells that then produce a constant electric of antibodys.
The antibodies capture the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before reaching the brain, where a smoker does not result in nicotin highness.
In trials, imposed males that Nikotin was administered contributed to their normal activity level.
Nevertheless, museums would have taken a “time”, the researchers explained a sign that the nicotine had reached their brain.
The experiences are described in the Official Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tabac vaccines failed because they received anti-organismes.
The infections had to be given so often that they were costly and unpractic.
But the costs of the new vaccine are probably significantly lower because it transforms lever cells into anti-corn manufactures.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine could be for humans if he is very sure that children are able to be administered before they tried to try to smoke, and thus prevent nicotine search.
However, it is likely that smokers would use him to stop.
“They know that when they start to smoke again, they are not able to enjoy them because of the nicotin vaccine, and that helps them to defeat the habit," he explains.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but at the same time they expected that it was still necessary for further research.
Tripodi controlled to be influenced by Obeid
The former minister of Labor Party Joe Tripodi from New South Wales is conducted by the public corruption oversight.
The former NSW Minister has established to have changed maritime department arrangements on the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, which has engaged in three substances on Stately controlled country.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption) has extended its investigations on Friday, whether Obeid has influenced different state ministers in this way, a patent contract at Circular Quay, where the Occupieds operate two restaurants and a coffee, without extending the record after their expiration in August 2005.
Now it was identified because of the accused, Tripodi had made aware of the interest that Obeid's foundation to the bases after the former tripodith stabschefin Lynne Ashpole was issued accordingly on Thursday.
In the years of the 2005 discussions, the Government had launched a public registration for the aid contracts.
The Palestinians, however, wanted longer periods.
2009, the aid contracts for the companies in the Circular Quay, which introduced the Occupied annually $2.5 million, were extended without public registration.
Tripodi, Minister of Hague since February 2006 to November 2009, was originally expressed for public posts.
However, he agreed to have made the amendments on requests of Obeid, which, as Tripodi confirmed, had enhanced the restructuring of the aid schemes of the Government.
One of the ICAC telephone records showed discussions from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a leading official who had changed to the Headquarters, after he worked under Occupy in the Fisheries Authority.
“What the theme discussed in this phone discussion was the development of the commercial depayment schemes?", asked the Chairman Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
“No” said Tripodi.
I can't remember what was talked, but it was not definitely.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli fighting shipping Objective in Syria, so official sources
Israeli Jagd flights had attacked a target in the Syrian port Latakia, confirmed a leading government employee against Fox News.
The officer did not explain what the objective was, but said that it was at least one.
According to Associated Press, it was the aim of Russian SA-125 rakets.
At least twice this year, Israel has spent air swimming on rake supplies in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457-vises could be subjected to “reality test”
The Government is thinking of a ‘reality test’ for foreign workers with 457-visual visums.
If the test is introduced, it is a criteria for the use of which should prevent the use of 497 unqualified jobs or as an interface for accessing family and friends to Australia.
Today, a proposal of the Government was published after the previous deputy of the Labor Party, Maxine McKew, condemned the comments of the Government on foreign workers, because they could be disfellowshipped by the neighbors of Australia.
“Lutheran declarations such as, countries should be set down below” and, firstly, Australians are a very poor decline in times in which workshops requested a protected labour market,” she said today to Australia India Institute.
The historical consideration was that white work forces should be protected – and if some in the region a echo of this historical art, it would not be wonderful.
The proposal for a discussion includes 12 measures that were first considered by the former Minister of Immigration, Chris Bowen.
Mr Brendan O'Connor, minister of Immigration who has spoken at last about human mud in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes that others will still be found.
If the “reality criteria” is accepted, a person may therefore be examined whether “the application is true in the cases where the applicant is associated with the holder or a person concerned with the supporting undertakings”.
The company could also be obliged to derogate the number of 4.57 visum contents after the past enterprises who first wanted to support only a small number of employees have finally established hundreds.
In the meantime, a 35-year-old sri-lank asylum probably died at a heart-infarction, when he arrived this week with a refugee boat on the Christmas Island.
The nine-year-old son of the man who came with him after Australia will be employed from an adult cousin who was also on the ship since his father died on the midst.
Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital where he died.
A study was announced by the British Government to increase the benefits of the HS2 Railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to implement high speed connections between Skotland and North England with the beginning of phase 1 in 2026.
Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer said that the project “is closer to the United Kingdom”.
Keith Brown, the Scotia Minister of Transport explained that he was very pleased to work with the British government at this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high speed connection between London and the West Midlands.
After phase 2 is completed, there will be links to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated costs for the construction of high speed Strategy between London and Northern Germany of 32.7 billion pounds of 42.6 billion.
The British government, which is in discussion with Scotland, has taken HS2 Ltd to search for further road capacity and travel time improvements for Northern Germany and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of traveling time last three hours or less than Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a real national road network, the United Kingdom and its cities closer."
We're going to go with HS2, because it brings great advantages to us.
Without it, we're in front of a capacity crisis in our station.
However, it is also the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved by HS2.
The Skotish State Secretariat Alistair Carmichael commented: “The advertising today is a good news for Skotland.”
In the name of the Skotish government, Keith Brown Carmichael called for “uncomingly” to join in the HS2 network.
Brown said: “The high speed connection gives the potential of great economic advantages for Scotland, but also provides the economic power of Scotland to a argument for rapid rail connections in the whole of the United Kingdom.”
It is why we are pleased to work as partners of the British Government and to investigate the options for high speed connection in Scotia, creating the benefits for all and complement the link Glasgow-Edinburg, which already plants the Skotish government.
I am glad to examine the research report with the British Ministers in the next year and to decide on the following steps together.
Rules on electronic devices in aircraft remain provisional in Australia
Australian passengers must also continue to stop tablets and phones when they start and load, despite efforts in the United States to locate the arrangements for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US flight companies to change their requirements so that passengers can read or play on their devices during critical flight phases E-Books, see or play videos, if they are in the flight mode.
During the majority of the flights, passengers are already allowed, but many people do not have to read their e-books when they start and load.
Australian companies observe the decision to implement the United States-American Airlines Unmendly to work, however, no direct plans for amending their rules are required.
The CaSA Aviation Insurance also declared that the advertising will be viewed, but stressed that the restrictions in the use of electronic devices in critical aircraft phases were applicable in Australia.
“The CSA has not currently implemented specific rules regarding the use of electronic devices in the flight”.
The theme is subject to provisions where aircraft companies must keep security every time and follow passengers the security instructions given by the cobine personnel.
Virgin has already conducted discussions with the CASA on an extensive use of its Wi-Fi maintenance systems and explained that it is open for changes, but this should be initiated by the legislator.
“We would be welcomed to review the authorisation of electronic devices by the CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after offering (freely entertainment) during the flight," said one speaker.
Qantas declared that you will remain further under the current rules.
“We present directives provide that electronic devices should not be used when starting and loading, and we do not have any plans to change”, explained the company.
The FAA Regulations apply to US-American airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in arrangements which can benefit passengers, and the decision of the FAA and the reasons for this will certainly be considered exactly.
The decision is different in American society after the age of the Flotte.
You have to prove that your aircraft can tolerate the function disorders through mobile devices, and handbooks, training materials, handback programs and customer instructions.
“A flight company has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, they can pass the use of more tragable, easier electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones,” reported the FAA.
In rare cases in bad view, the crowd is shown the passengers while loading the devices.
The group also recommends that more harder devices should be safely under the seat or in the seats.
Before the Revierderby against Schalke, the best BVB attachers had been buried with light races for skin scenes in the Veltins-Arena.
Borussia Dortmund announced its heartfelt consequences.
Before the freeday game of the football football link against the VfB Stuttgart, Ultra reacted first with a swimming.
It was an inhabited, almost so scenic accustic, which cut the viewer up to a short prior to the adoption of the Federal Liga game between the German Vice-Marian Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park.
The guest fans were overall with their seeds.
The Southern Tribunes, where the most faithful - and the most true - BVB-funds are, introduced first an extraordinary path: no legs, no battle calls.
The power of the Capo, who coordinated the common injury, remained unplaced.
And in front of the tribune, a large fan with a "Station Prohibition".
Only as Torus Roman Weidenfeller, as always as the first BVB players, burned a short-term jubel.
When his mature colleagues followed, there was a voice of sweet and shoes - but it was not long all over.
In the central 12 and 13 of the Southern Tribune, there was nothing.
Also that Stadion speaker Norbert Dickel once again counted the positive experiences of the last days - Derbysieg, victory over Arsenal, Proliferation of Trainer Jürgen Klopp - did not care for a party.
Before five minutes before the appointment, the capo took his power - and the swimming shock of the hands just up to the hands shocked in a shock, as a dickl as a habit of the smile on the rounds of the stadium.
As last, the Southern Tribune was as always at the series - and finally it was back here as well as the latest place in the stadium.
And the late time with appeal from the Southern Tribune, "Derbysinger is on" came, it was again all like always.
The skin before was probably a reaction on the events of the last days.
Unmediately before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the most attractive BVB boards were shooted into the sighting lines and on the scene - and so nearly the torches of Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was later used because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the spots of the villagemunder Ultra in his office - and it was believed that Watzke's words, which was a very unfair term for the fans.
"It will be given massive inputs for the whole Ultra movement," the BVB boss announced on Thursday at a podium debate in Frankfurt.
As soon as Watzke underlined Ultras a choreography for home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
"I'm prohibited," he explained.
The null tolerance policy in pyrotechnology is not possible.
Furthermore, Ultra has shown different possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday, this is time to decide for one.
On the other hand, as Watzke, the BVB will establish a sanction until the end of the next week.
"This will be intact", assured Watzke.
You may be shocked how the reactions in the south-tribune will then be disappointed.
Pfand houses bombs in Singapore, as the crisis has arrived in the middle level
In a bathroom in the Bendemer Center in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga entered a golden army, a ring and a couple of earrings in order to pay the school costs of her daughters.
“My husband and I just purchased a house, where my whole money takes place,” says Amirthalinga.
Although they won 3.000 Singapore Dollar (ca 1.730 euros) as an administrative employee, and their husband also worked, it does not explain the monthly family income.
Indeed, the demand in South Asian parts – where the debt increased – is so large that valueMax, where it has taken its bag, has become the third Pfand house that has been learned at the Singapore Burse.
The loan of smuck is not only a fast way to get money – 1.300 Singapore Dollar in case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as good as an insured bank loan.
Typically, swamp houses in Singapore demand an effective year in 17 percent, which is only over 15.4 per cent, which requires the United Overseas Bank, a local creditor with a branch in the same sale center.
However, Pfandhouses provide the advantage that there is no revision of creditability or income necessary, as soon as possible for banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region are employed at Pfand houses, after the pressure of the familys by increased living costs and increased budget and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and valuable credits because of a more locked financial policy in the developed economic spaces, families are looking for a smaller and medium-term income of the Pfand households in order to compare the differences in the hot economy.
This week, the Rating Agency of Standard & Poor's growing budget debt, mainly by increased hypotheks, was a risk factor for the creditability of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest budget debt in Asia as regards Brutto Inland Product, after evaluation of the Agency.
Malaysia has 80 per cent of the GDP at the top of the list, an increase of 60 per cent even in 2008.
People's economics also care for the high consumer debt in Thailand, which has resulted in a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a still existing export deficiencies and a leave of consumer demand.
“The final effect means that, in view of the increased costs, people will be tried to complement their income in the average to lower segments (the income scale) where it is always possible,” says Song Seng Wun, Economy at CIMB, a Malay Bank.
The historical maximums of gold prices in the last two years have still increased the tendency to consumption of personal objects, since people use the opportunity to change the smoke of the family to bargeld.
In Singapore about 70 per cent of the cutting objects in the 200 pound houses of the city of Gold.
People say, "The gold price looks good, let us spoil the grandmother's gold chain and get back the next month."
The largest Thai peasant householder, EasyMoney, has experienced 20 percent of customers in its branches in the last months.
The growth in the phanjed business is so strong that valueMax, Philadelphialers in Bendemer and 15 other in Singapore want to expand not only in the nearby Malaysia – where the company is employed by four houses – but also outside Asia, so Yes Lee Ching, business leader of ValueMax.
The company has financed the 60% of the 66 million Singapore Dollars who took it this week with the burdengang in Singapore.
While some creditors were born because of high interest rates in crossfire, Yes states that the Pfand households did not only offer more interest than other suppliers, but also not directly increased the debt.
“The customers have objects that they have already, and the frozen personal values do not increase the budget distortion,” he states.
The Pfandleak business is accepted in society as a short-term, secure financing.
Neither are all people who use the fifty feed in financial difficulties.
The rich people from Singapore also come to the branches of ValueMax to spend gold bars and rolex bures, for which they receive up to 60% of the buy price in bar.
We are customers from every social stage.
“It includes the well-being who have a short time for business or investment, or small enterprises that have to be overcome in the Cash flow,” says Yes.
Sometimes they just need very fast money.

Saving package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanic Health
The Australian government is the hard conditions associated with the saving package of more than 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health in order to ensure that the Government of the Federal State cannot defeat the money.
The Federal Health Minister, Tanya Plibersek, has announced that the Commonwealth will be taken “indirect measures” to abide a crisis caused by an older population of the island, a higher quota of chronic diseases and system restrictions.
The financing for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with the independent Tajik Member Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has set up an emergency relief package, which we believe is the unique challenges that the State has faced with respect to the state,” says today.
The 325 billion dollars package includes $31 million immediate assistance for election services.
Additional 2600 operations, including orthopedic invasions and treatments for green stars, are to be eliminated.
Furthermore, there are money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better care for stationary stays, expert training, psychological health services and the introduction of a system for electronic registration of health data in local hospitals.
“These investments correspond to the ideas of which clinical workers I have said they are the best possibility to improve the Tasman health system,” said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister was at a strict report and accountability of the Tajik Government.
The Federal State should keep the current financial level in order to obtain money from the Commonwealth, and report monthly on where additional money were issued.
A three-first Commission is established and is intended to ensure that the State's health services provide as effective and effectively as effective as possible.
As Wilkie today explained, the $325 million would only be useful if “not be accompanied by real reforms that bring the public Tasmanian health system to a more sustainable course. ”
In spite of this, he loving the Government that she had reacted on his request for urgent assistance that he first expressed towards the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
“I am convinced that the federal aid will contribute to the public health system of the state of the state,” said Wilkie.
According to the Government of the State, these election services will be widely reversed.
But the health policy speakers of the opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, is the view that today's advertising is only a 'plaster solution'.
“We are now in the situation because the Labour Government has deleted $430 million from the health system,” he said to ABC TV.
It can't be that a government runs nearly a half billion dollars from the system and switchs the Commonwealth 300 million, and then do, as the good news is.
Duton asked to ensure that none of the single dollar of the saving package will be issued for additional officecracy.

Syria has destroyed its possibility to produce chemical weapons, so a supervisory group
Syria has destroyed important facilities for the production of chemical weapons and gas munitions, declared the global monitoring group for chemical weapons on Thursday, while it came near one of the places where there is probably giftous substances.
At the same time, on Thursday, a Syrian active group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war had already been already killed three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) arrived a day before the end
1 November, which was established by Damaskus in Den Hague to destroy or “inoperable” all facilities for the production of chemical weapons, including all machines for the mixture of chemical gas and the filling of munitions.
The end of this process, which is based on the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone of a ambitioned time plan that aims at the destruction of all the chemical weapons of Syria to the midst of 2014.
The destruction of the plants means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus must still begin to destroy the existing weapons and equipment.
As a result, there are some 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including Senfgas and the Nervengas Sarin.
The proclamation came at a time when on Thursday, fighting in the city of Safira, the experts said that there was a production institution for chemical weapons and places, such as the Syrian Observatory Center for Human Rights shared in Britain.
The active group, who follows the number of dead by a network of actives in Syria, declared on Thursday, 120.296 people died.
There were 61.067 civilians, including 6.365 children.
On the side of the government, 29.954 were the army of President Bashar Assad, 18.678 were ruling friends and 187 libanese hibollah militers.
At the same time, there were 2.202 armed data and 5.375 fighters of opposition, many of them.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated the number of dead in this conflict since March 2011 to 100,000.
This number has not been updated until now.
The conflict has forced about two million people to run out of the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting for weeks in Safira against the rebelles of which many links to al-Qaida groups have been linked.
The observation place said it had losses on Thursday on both sides, but not called details.
The fights understood the danger that the chemical weapons inspectors have been issued because their mission to release Syrians from his gifting weapons scenario is a wagon against the time within a dead civil war.
According to the OPCW, which is closely cooperating with the United Nations, it is “unconvinced that all of them have seen important production and mixing institutions mentioned by Syria and that they have survived their destruction”.
Therefore, “no further inspection activities are now planned.”
At the beginning of the week, the inspectors had explained that they had completed the first round of the reviews and visited 21 from 23 of the places identified by Damascus.
As security concerns were not possible, the inspectors said that the visit was not possible.
On Thursday, the OPWC declared that the two positions were ‘inspected’ according to the Syrian word, and the objects that existed in the chemical weapons programme were displaced to other entities identified.
It was not immediately clear if the place in Safira was one of the two institutions that could not visit OPCW inspectors.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons that must be approved by the Executive Committee of the OPWC next month.
“I show the hot before the tapness and the courage you all have shown when you have completed the most urgent mission executed by this organization” said Ahmed Useumcu, Director-General of the Monitoring Organization in a comment published by OPCW.
Since three years of struggle, most of the Sunnitic Muslim Rebells in this civil war against the Assad’s government and their security forces, who heard many of the Alawis members, have been a reputation of the Sheriff Islam.
With regard to further developments, the leader of the Observer Group, Rami Abdurrahman, gave it a strong explosion in a air defence institution in the Syrian Coast Province Latakia.
The cause of explosion is not known, he explained.
Zorn about judgment for bombs in Bali
The survivors and associates of the 202 people who lived in 2002 at the bomb attack in Bali were reacted to the judgment for the last of the lawyers who were sentenced before the court, as the vision of the Patek should be judicially shooted.
Patek, who was only ten years old as one of the most popular people of South America, was sentenced last night for its role in the construction of smuggling bodys for the bomb attack to a prison penalty of 20 years.
With a punishment, he could be dismissed after 15 years.
The 45-year-old murder was found by the mass murder because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist town of Kuta, at which 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many more suffered.
A defence was also conducted in a number of terrorist accused points, which were a wave of smuggling demands on churches in Indonesia in 2000.
The State Authority had requested a long-term prison penalty, even if it was also called for the man who was also called “Demolition Man” for the death penalty.
The decision has taken painful memories at June Courten, a mother from Perth who lost her 39 years of old swimming Jane and Jenny in the conviction established by Patek and his competitors nearly ten years ago.
With the tears she said Patek should have been condemned for death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guy.
“It should be commanded before a shock,” said the Courts against AAP.
I have to live every day so I won't get any more angel and I will never see my daughters.
The Sari Club was equivalent to the earthquake, as recently after 12 October 2002, a powerful bomb was explosed in a small laptop that was parked before the night club.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's bar where only 20 seconds ago, a self-defended murderer made a rucksack filled with spring.
After the attack, he fell into the coma and “mort” three times, while he took into a life conservation system.
Hughes said that Patek had the same sicsal as the three other members of the terrorism Jemaah Islamia – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbad and were established four years ago.
Indeed, this guy should be sentenced to death before all others.
Let him live – no, there's no reason to leave him alive.
20 years after he killed 202 people and many hundreds of people, it's not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bomb that was before the court.
He took up about a decade of prison, but finally, in January 2011, the Pakistanian city Abbottabad was attacked where the U.S. forces killed the previous al-Qaida-Chef Osama bin Laden for about four months.
During the negotiation, a FBI agent said that secret service reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin loads with the goal to rebuild the connection between South-South-Terror groups and al-Qaida.
“He has not seen himself,” said the Court.
Until recently, he has not shown the angry of how much he had added to others.
The sentence was taken before the ten-year-old anniversary of the attack in this year, which will be started with monuments in Bali and Australia.
“ It will give many tears this year, ” said the Courtes.
Patek may be invoked against his sentences and professionals.
FAA: flights can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but no phone conversation leads)
flight travellers can now use their electronic devices to read, work, games, music and use the view of films, but not call with the phone, so the new directives issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.
However, passengers should not expect that these amendments are implemented immediately.
As soon as they would be implemented, notwithstanding the aircraft, Michael Huerta explained on a press conference.
The FAA has to demonstrate that aircrafts are in accordance with the new directives and that they have updated the training books of the aviation staff and the arrangements for the conviction of the devices in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA explained that it had already received plans from some airlines that would want to build the use of tragable electronic devices in aircraft.
Both these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
“We could soon accept the extensive use of electronic devices according to the state of the plan”, reported the FAA in a relief.
Currently, passenger phones, tablets and other devices must be disabled when the aircraft is closed.
They can start again when the aircraft has reached a height of three miles (3 km) and the captain has green light.
When the aircraft is entered into the country flight, the flights shall be disabled again and shall not start again before the flight is entered.
According to the new directives, airlines whose aircrafts are safe for electronic disorders could allow their passengers to use the devices also when starting, loading and on the rolling field, declared the FAA.
Most new vehicles and other flights, which have been converted to the use of Wi-Fi in higher heights, should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Professional Aviation Association, welcomed the amendments.
“If the new arrangement is safely implemented – and we work closely with the aircraft – will benefit both sides of it," commented Glading.
We are sincerely regretted to feel like supervisors in this issue.
However, Internet connections continued to be prohibited to surfing, exchange e-mails, text messages or downloads of data under three kilometers continued, explained the Authority.
Passages are requested to move smartphones, tablets and other devices in the flight mode.
Thus, no “Words With friends”, the scrabble scrabble game played on his phone, Alec Baldwin 2011, when he had to leave a Jet of American Airlines publicly because he refused to stop the device while the flight was parked on the airport.
And worse devices such as the laptops must also be able to be able to be discovered, since there is a trauma vehicle if they fly through the cabin.
Phone conversation during the flight remains still prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone discussion is at the Federal Communication Commission (FCC), not to the FAA.
FAA may have prohibition for certain electronic devices when starting and loading on
Last month, Mark Rosenker said that the National Transport Security Board, security experts for national transport questions on CBS News, would still be considered as a risk.
“Handy is really a problem, not only because they can cause potential disasters to navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that the transmission of the air can also cause sende mass,” says Rosenker.
A Branch Advisory Committee, called by the FAA to investigate this topic, recommended last month that the government allow more personal electronic devices to use.
In recent years the pressure on the FAA has increased to switch restrictions for use.
Criticals such as the democratic senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri are the view that there is no valid security reason for the ban.
The limitations are also increasingly to be implemented because the use of the devices has become deteriorated.
In some studies, the speech is forgotten or ignored until a third of the passengers.
The FAA began 1966 to limit the use of electronic devices by flight travellers after reports on distortions of navigation and communication devices by passengers, which were then represented by the latest UKW radio.
New aircraft are more depending on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also built as well as by the FAA, and authorized that electronic interferences do not make them anything.
Airlines offer passengers for a few years with Wi-Fi when the airline is reached.
The flowers adjusted to Wi-Fi systems are also unlikely against interferences.
The overwhelming majority of passenger flights should be appropriate for the increased use of electronic devices in accordance with the new directives, said Huerta.
Today’s electronic devices generally provide less functional radiation than previous generations.
For example, e-relator only gives a minimum radiation when you shoot.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are increased.
The packaging of the limits for the use of the device by passengers is Amazon.com.
2011 undertaking employees made a passenger flight full of children e-related and made a test flight to detect problems, but they couldn't find it.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings relating to the risk of the use of devices.
Douglas Kidd, from the National Association of Airline Passengers, said that it is the view that the distortion by the devices is real, even though the risk is minimum.
Other committees said that it was only aligned reports of pilots that were cut by the devices, and most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended the FAA to allow pilots to arrange the switch of the devices through the passengers in the instruments.
A grouping from the travel sector welcomed the changes and called them as a reasonable adjustment for travellers who would now be fully equipped with technology.
“We are happy that the FAA recognises that a good passenger experience is not in the reaction to security,” said Roger Dow, CEO of the United States Travel Association.
For air saving service of North Sea-Bohr Island rescued birds again released
A per air saving service to the coast of a flight bird, which was found on a North Sea Island, was left back into nature.
The water rail was fled the last month with a swimming powder to Aberdeen, where it was shocked by the Scotic Animal Protection Organization SPCA in its rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the centre, said: “This water rail was probably an winter bird from Northern Europe, which was holded by the strong wind over the northern sea.”
It seemed to find the created bird flight on the Bohr Island.
He added: “He couldn’t go further, so we were contacted with the request. ”
When it was released, the water rail was refined and healthy.
Is Europe's Elite ready to make business with British?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the desire to bring the economy to a table and to define what to change our relations with the EU in Britain.
For this purpose, we have given the most and more comprehensive investigation among British economic leaders and asked them what they think about the United Kingdom, the economy and the EU.
YouGov questioned over 1,000 leadership forces from the economy, which, in particular, form the British business sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will be surprised.
We have found that the overwhelming majority of enterprises exported outside Europe and focused on countries that modernize and grow, while the EU states.
They wish to promote new trade connections with countries such as China, India and Brazil, instead of maintaining the long and emphasis process to reform obsolete EU institutions.
In view of certain legally regulated topics – from the law to the product legislation –, most of the economic leaders consider that the control of these key skills should be recovered to West Minster.
It was general inadequate for the internal market, since the costs of the Brussels rules would exceed the benefits of being part of the Europe's trade zone – even 40 per cent of the major enterprises, which traditionally are the most freest of Europe.
Finally, and it is likely to say most, our question of economic leaders made that a clear majority of Britain wishes to change the agreement and a relationship with the EU, which is based on trade, is not on policy.
This recognition, which is found in all dimensions and leading concentrations, shows that the economy is a “slightly change” which brings the trade account back to the United Kingdom.
It is much - a change in the agreement and better conditions for the United Kingdom would lead to 16 per cent to a change in view for the remaining in the EU in a people's vote.
The Prime Minister should not have doubts: this survey shows that the British economy is under its plan for the new negotiations of the British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that enterprises from a new negotiation are expected to be a clear movement of power relations to Britain.
A better account for the British economy is possible and is increasingly necessary after the Euro Zone moves towards a closer economic and physical unity.
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain, as shows the result of our survey, which means a strengthened attention to trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach for rules.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom called Pipeline in Bulgaria as the start of a new gas
The beginning of the South Stream Pipeline in Bulgaria represented the start of one of the largest European energy projects, explained the Gazprom Presidency.
“The event today is a milestone: the construction work at the South-Stream Gaspipeline section, the largest and important project in Europe, has started", said the Chairman of Gazprom, Alexie Miller, in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the whole European continent.
South Stream is intended to ensure more diversity in Russia's export routes through Europe.
A partnership between Gazprom and its pensioners in Ukraine, where most of the Russian gas for Europe is engaged, ensures that a increased risk of conventional routes is to be heard by official sides.
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, said that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were “forever excluded”.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas rates to benefit from South Stream when the whole project operates in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work is to start on the planned route at the end of the year.
The pipeline is equipped with an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of gas.

Assisting before the King's Commission: two MYCA employees in charge against Jonathan Lord for sexual crimes
Two MYCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) were accused of sexual crimes in relation to children before 2011 against the children's employer Jonathan Lord from Caringbah, as the Royal Commission for sexual abuse of children received.
However, in the opening declaration before the Commission, the MYCA had stated that “a case of sexual abuse has never been done in the organization.”
The director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a MYCA employee was accused of behaviour with child pornography, and another in which a sportor of MYCA Caringbah Hall 1991 was sentenced to him because of the malnutrition.
Hare said Gail Furness, one of the Commission assisting lawyers, that he had known in the first case, but the second has not known.
He pointed out that the opening declaration of MYCA towards the Commission had also been urged to notify that “is given external reviews of MYCA, where the MYCA was recognised as the front before the child security.”
Proofs before the Commission show that the MYCA was informed that he received the second lowest evaluation of four possible ones in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Minister of Education) in August of the year.
Hare, who began with 21 at MYCA, was able to defeat the business leadership from me at the standing of the Lord and not to ensure that the employees have been clearly informed of violations against the directives on child safety.
Lord was sentenced to his two-year-old activities for the MYCA in the beginning of the year because of sexual abuse to 12 boys.
He was sentenced at least six years of prison.
However, it concludes that the MYCA had a cultural problem that the employee has stopped reporting Lord's violations in respect of the security of children.
The employees said they had observed crimes, among others, that the Lord was alone with children, she was in private as a baby sitter, left her sit on his shooting, said he loved it, and left kids playing with his phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose Lord was and who had requested for training for children's protection because she was concerned about his conduct, said that the Chief of Child Service Jacques Barnat, who was the Lord of the MYCA Caringbah, was “awesomely angry and the most closest time.”
The director stated that he would not accept the statements of employees, as they did not have to provide their proposed message.
Instead, as he said, their friendship with the Lord has influenced their powers of judgment, for they had not been reported to him.
Hare explained that he had informed the MYCA NSW's opinion that the lesson that the organization was to take into account the "Jonathan-Lord Case" was “not the message” by employees, and the body agreed to him.
Hare said that the decision to enter employees to sign secret obligations shortly after the accusation, it is taken by the manager of the MYCA child services, Liam Whitley.
He said that it should be prevented from contamination of evidence, but what was being “experiencing” and badly implemented.
The MYCA NSW was at the time that Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, no safe organization for children, explained Professor Stephen Smallbone from the Griffith University, experts for sexual abuse, the Commission.
He explained that it had given “prior problems” in setting, review, processing, training and monitoring of the employees.
The hearing was denied until 20 December.
Tony Blair explained that he would use the opportunity to return as the British Prime Minister – but it's a way that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview tonight on the fifth anniversary of his distinction from the Office, the 59-year-old years announced his views on different internal policy issues.
Since his retreat in June 2007 after a decade of State head Blair, Blair has widespread avoided expressing the British policy, and its comments are mostly limited to the foreign policy and its role as a sender of the Quarter of Peace-Carter in the Middle East.
To the question whether he would like to return to the office of the Prime Minister, Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard from London with the words: “Yes, sure, but it is unprovely that this happens, so ..."
When the horse experts in the shadows in Cardiff were entered to cover the horse of the year, they knew that a hard competitive fight was favoured.
But no one was prepared for the three years of Fenton Kirkland.
The snippe, who isn't even in the child garden and made his first steps just a few months ago, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee stood locker through the three rounds and bought the first price – and they left 30 adult enemy behind themselves.
The unreasonable couple, both large, has been promised because of their event, conduct and style in all year competition, which is registered by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
When he was in competitiveness against men and women with elegant melones, he had set his tears into a frequencies corner and led the two years old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was buried by the jurens for his natural ability when he treated the Pony, which was far beyond his age.
And Tofee received good notes for his appearance and his personality.
Fenton had received Toffee as a gift to his third birthday and has been working every day with the Shetland Pony.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, “Fenton and Doffee are a great shock”.
They had to arrive against the whole part of the field and went out of the place with gold pokal and Rosette.
It was only the second time he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all sweet when he won.
Full foreigners in the Arena took him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The young boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, followed in the footsteps of his tante Sharon Howells, which has been launched over ten years.
Howells told: “The whole public was like electricized and all have shooted and shooted him.”
He went to sand the whole length of the Arena, and although he was so angry, he did phantastic work.
Fenton is crazy for animals – he loves horses, tractors and plants and has two hairs to care.
As he has been started, it will not be long until he is on the “Capest of the Year” school – and I am sure he's going to break good.
One speaker of the annual horse show said, “Fenton is only three, but he knows how he should do with his pony.”
They're together a great team.
The jurors evaluated Fenton and Toffee after how well they were shocked and had presented in the pre-guide.
They looked at good cooperation between Pony and leaders – and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in the ring.
I'm sure that Fentons's sweet clothes have contributed to their part, which's really perfect for the latest.
Chinese newspapers are aimed to be "reformed" after call
A Chinese newspaper requested the release of a reporter, who was accused of diffaming, was to be reformed, explained a press regulator.
The New Express in Guangzhou has expressed a rare public call to release the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, in the television, Chen later acknowledged that he had accepted claims to false reports on a participatory company.
Now the New Expression will be subjected to a “complete rectification”, explained the regulatory authority.
The ‘Reclaiming Regulation’ was received by the Authority for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Provisional investigations show that the New Express, which belongs to Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several reports on the officially notified company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The edition management of the New Express was unordined,” the Rulesing Authority announced in a statement.
She said you decided to “a administrative punishment for Chen Yongzhou and to remove him from his reporting license.”
Furthermore, “the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been stated to present a complete re-validation of the New Express and recommended to identify the relevant responsible persons in the new expression and immediately review the leadership team of the New Express”.
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported about appropriate financial irregularities in a manufacturer of machines named Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the title page and posted his journalist work.
But then Chen opened out in the public view and said that he had published false reports against payment.
“In this case, I have damaged zoomleon as well as all the news sectors and its ability to win public confidence," he explained against the public newspaper CCTV.
I did it first in line because I was out of money and silence.
I've been clear that I was wrong.
The New Express published an apologist on the title page in the connection to Chens' appointment and explained that you were able to check the reports correctly.
A number of known suspects have recently been discovered in television convictions.
Experts say that compassions are still routinely disrupted, despite a change in law in the beginning of the year in which the authorities have been banned to force to condemn themselves.
Drug tunnel with own rail trains between the United States and Mexico
One of the most raffined tunnels for the drug smoking between the United States and Mexico, which was completely equipped with swimmingness, swimming and electrical rail operation, has now been discovered.
The United States authorities describe the tunnel measured by 120 to 90 centimeters as one of the most fatal passengers they had ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in the Zicksack Temple over a length of only six football fields, connects layers near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
In the area there are countless unlikely unlikely layers, which makes it easier to hide with drug drought LKWs.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported unknownly, the authorities explained.
In the discovery of the tunnel, eight tonnes of Marihuana and 148 kg of cocaine were safeguarded, so the signs of the Court were signed.
Three men who worked as drivers under the statement of the authorities were accused of the ownership and sale of Marihuana and Kokain.
You are threatening in a prison penalty between ten years and life.
In Nogales, Arizona, Smuggler places a comprehensive suburban network of design channels.
The tunnel is the eighth large passenger found in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels have been found after the Marihuana expert in Central Mexico in October, which brings drug cards before the challenge how they can make their products quickly to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a swimming passage of about 640 meters from a kitchen in a household in Tijuana to two accommodation houses in San Diego.

According to Lexika, the veganism is subdivided to vegetarism, but is very different from this.
Because while Vegetarians are allowed to grant snakes, ices or a powerful edamer, these sleeves do not stand on the food card of a veganer.
Milk, skin, egg, in addition to the vision of meat and fish, the veganer may defeat all animal products - even hair.
What remains, may be asked, but in closer consideration, the vegan food world is expressed by a considerable accidental bond.
"Brot strikes are very popular", says Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the fascinating reform house, which provides a variety of specific products for Veganer.
Reuben Proctor is also pleased to visit the load in the Domgase.
Since 13 years old, the new countries lived in Vegan, he finds everything he needs to live. "1997 I took my food and became Vegetarier."
During the centuries the next step, I became Veganer.
"But the conviction came not only because of food but because of the shooting," Proctor states, the art shoes predicts normal leder.
He acknowledged that it was also in other daily interests without animal products.
Firstly, Vegan is a ethical.
"I don't want the animals to die for me," Proctor says the Maximis of the Veganers, which strive to the whole consumption.
Instead of retracing Burgers, routines or gummiberers, the Veganer quickly discovered new products that increased the smelling.
"It's a double bonus," Proctor says today, "indeed, vegan does not make its view, no askes, but it's a rangement." The acceptance that you reduce the selection of food options leads to the power of habitat.
And precisely these conditions have also been able to cut some of the so-called attempts.
"The search factor is a very decisive factor that allows a lot of rapidly designing, like to smoke", reports a comparison.
And say: "A certain skin is not set on the animal."
Often, there are the grains or the type of preparation that form the skin.
"But there can also be the same effect," the Veganer says.
For example, Proctor brings a few veghane beaches, campignons, and also a few vegans.
It takes into consideration a balanced, swimming food, which should also be smelled at once.
Of course, you want to have something between the teeth, that's legitimate.
"It should be smell, but it's not only to reduce animal food," says Proctor.
Health damages to earnest disorders, another broad-speed acceptance, did not experience.
For me, the conversion had a positive aspect.
I don't take foreign cholesterine and have an increased vitamin share.
There are high-performance substances that only food vegans.
"My blood values are best, I often let me check", says Proctor.
In particular, before the lack of vitamin B12, many vegansimus critics are warned.
"The animals with food products, instead of feeding the weight, is questionable whether in the meat that you buy in the fridge, the part of the vitamin B12 is high", says Proctor.
For Veganer, it also provides the possibility to take the coenzym in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are fine," he says.
Weight ways Proctor should not go for food purchase.
Food is finally all and every supermarket has a mixture of soja oil and other products.
Everything I need, I find the place.
Just down and buy something special.
"Many people consider that only the finished products are cost-reserved, but so it is also known for "general" finished products."
Without the preparation of vegan courts, it should be more favorable and less temporary than commonly accepted.
"In the kitchen there are lots to discover, with a few small bones you can be good if not partly get better results", says Proctor.
Margarine instead of Butter, a little more back powder and coal acid instead of egg, with its vegane kitchen, Proctor could also make his swimming swimming powders a surprise.
Family feasts the Veganer gives a new wilderness.
This has a dynamic when you eat together, it has a new place value.
"The situations that can occur there are as different as people themselves," says Proctor.
Of course, however, he was already skepsis.
Don't you smell my food again?
"I should feel bad now because I drink milk?" - in such questions you should act as Veganer with finger paintings.
"I don't reprove the people, I am part of this society," Proctor doesn't want to fry.
And more accurately, the world seems not to be like a vegan friend - and the veganer does not be limited as a common acceptance in the daily day.
Fast Food is also allowed.
There's a bomb over there!
"Mhild swimming streets offer flafels, or a vegetarian eufka", says Proctor.
In a pizzeria, he spends on pasta directions, or orders a pizza without cooks, everything is a question of habit.
The restaurants are so late.
"If I started to feed me vegan 13 years ago, everything was much harder," the New York country can end up a development: "It's got to talk to the people to take care of them."
"If sufficient questions come, they may be able to add the food cards," he hopes.
Vegan restaurants are developed, for example, in Manheim or in the coffee bird free.
Proctor calls the desire that other restaurants have at least a vegan court on the food card.
In fact, vegan courts are taken for all of them.
Everyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"Fleecerechters, however, are exclusive, in the real sense of the word, because they are closed to other", states Proctor.
"If you want to avoid food channels, Veganism is a safe way to make the largest part of previously impossible", says Proctor.
But it can be difficult to buy vegan products at the beginning.
In particular, if you learn to understand, which can also contain animal additives as colorerers, you seem to leave the ethics in so many debts and cases of courage rapidly.
Neither have Ruuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen written a book: "Veganismo - Animal Contents and its alternatives" declares the many contents, the use of food and cleaning products.
"After and after developing a scanner view, you know what signs and logos you have to look at, "It is sometimes better to do small steps than to stay or to help," White Proctor.
The veganism, he is an important moral finger, which shoes on the consciousness.
Perhaps he does not completely make it possible to react his habits, but at least he can teach the consumers to ask his habits critically.

The British police decides to deliver Assange
The British police today has sent an extradition decision to WikiLeaks-Green Julian Assange, which searched for refugee in London and requested asylum.
Scotland Yard explained that you had the 40-year-old Australian "related to be able to be able to look at him to appear in a police guard, and he had to add, he shouldn't follow it, threatening the arrest.
Assange threatens the extradition to Swedish because of the complaint in a sexual crime after its possibilities were exempt by British law, since the Supreme Court has rejected its invocation against the expenditure in the beginning of the month.
He feared that Stockholm would deliver him to the United States, and on June 19th, he had searched for refugee in London and prayed the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard “a 40-year-old man called for a police watch at one of us’s chosen time” said a speaker.
He continues to harm the conditions of his release to cution.
The message did not comment on the complaint of the police's request.
Assange fears that it was issued by Sweden to the United States and claimed that it was possible for spionage-projects after published over 250,000 diplomatic news on the WikiLeaks website.

Tax for foreign real estate owner against London's Speculations Blase
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but it is still expected that the final decision by Mr George Osborne, who had linked a steel tax of 7 per cent to apartments, which was more than two million dollars and annual costs for buyers, the apartments as a company and not individual persons.
The income from the steel tax for housing in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea regions, which were set up in the 2012/13 tax year to 708 million pounds, are now available for Northern Ireland, Wales, Skotland, Northern, Northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cookie said: “After the increases in steel tax on high price housing and the introduction of related legislation against action, it can be severely controlled by high-quality realities, despite the impact of the common tax systems.”
“But this step could make some foreign investors more than the purchase of real estate in London, or keep the owner of it,” he added.
First-class real estate – most than five to ten percent of the accommodation market by price – in the well-being London Southwestern village, which spends from Fulham to Wimbledon, have deteriored the record value of 11,8 % in the last year.
The prices in Central London increased a equal growth of 5,6 %, but were exceeded by a shocked "Inland market" which has experienced a surrounding area of the city, the North (7,4%) and the East (6,5%), which is a survey of Savills.
Scientists were able to shine more light in which the dog’s sweet world is with its smiling.
Previous research showed that happy dogs with the sweet were more towards the right (of the view of the dog) while it was the left side with nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can realize and react these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigar, a new university of Trient, said: “It is well known for people that the left and right brain half of the brain differently reacts to stimulus, which calls positive or negative emotions.”
Here we tried to see this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just as in people, the right half of the brain was responsible for the movement of the left side, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
To learn more about how dogs react to the seed snakes of their friends, the researchers watch the animals, while these films of other dogs.
They produced the heart frequency of the four sides and analyzed the behavior.
We probably will soon understand why the weakness moves to one, once in the other direction.
Professor Vallortigar said: “We showed the dog films with dogs – or a naturally faithful version or a silhouette to eliminate other attractive aspects, and so we could control the movement of the skin more on the left or right."
When the animals saw how an unexpected dog moved the skin to the right (of the perspective of the swimming dog) they remained totally disappointed.
But predominantly the weakness was left (or from the perspective of the dog that smells), and it increased their heart frequency and looked uncomfortable.
According to Professor Vallortigar, the dogs do not communicate with each other through these movements.
He is more convinced that the dogs had learned from experience, in which movements they should be worried and when not.
He said: “When you have various contacts with other dogs and the swimming swimming is connected in a direction to a friendly behavior and the right side produces a less friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of these experiences.”
The researchers say that the knowledge of dog owners, animal doctors and trainers could help a better understanding of the emotions of their animals.
John Bradshaw, experts for dog behaviour and guest-stipendiat at the University of Bristol University, explained whether this was not the first study in which it was investigated whether the left and right dog is important.
Last year a team of Lincoln's university found that dogs turn the head to the left when they looked at a aggressive dog, and right if it is a satisfied dog.
In another research work at the university of Victoria in Canada, it stated: “There are going to go to a robot dog if it is, swanz's left and not right to be disappointed – exactly different than in the Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could therefore be able to say that the dogs in the various studies do not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study, as dogs react to real dogs, could help, he explained.
“If there are considerable investments for many different skins that the two sides of the brain will be used for different purposes, but many of the details must still be determined – and dogs are no exception," says Bradshaw.
But as they simply keep their behavior, it will not be long until we understand why the weakness sometimes moves to one, sometimes moves to another direction.

Papest Franziskus named the first kardinal in February
Pope Franciskus will first call on 22 February the New Catholic Church's Cardinal, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinales are the highest classists in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they are also the one who chooses a pope, so that Franceskus will be appointed the first group of men, which will eventually be affected in the choice of his followers.
There are now 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached a 80-year-old age is not to participate in the paused election, which is to be a group of 120 “elected cardinals”.
In a statement in which the message was announced, Pater Federico Lombardi, a speaker of the Vatican, said it will be a meeting of all the cardinals before the ceremony will be held for the name of the new cardinal, also known as consistry.
“Papst Franciskus has decided to predict his decision to introduce the consistry in February so that other meetings that may be planned to be taken to the participation of cardinals from all the world”, said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of cowboy cardinals will probably be cut up until February.
He explained that a pope normally renamed as many cardinals as necessary to retrace the number of cowled cardinals, and so many cardinals over 80, as he wanted.
The consistry in the next year is therefore important because it is the first since the election of Franzisku in March this year, so Valero.
Today, it is a certain transfer of Europe and, in particular, Italy.
“It will be interesting to see whether the new pope kardinales will be called out of the rest of the world to restore the balance,” he said.
Four per cent of the Catholics live in South America, but they have only a variety of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first calling to find a group of eight cardinals from all the world, who have the task of finding opportunities for reforming the church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
“Nu has the Frenchcus chosen this eight cardinal that should help him,” said Valero.
He explained that it was “good possible” that Franceskus would be asked for the Council.
But until now we were not in this situation – that's all new.
Valero said that typically the bishops from large places would call to cardinals, but stands Franciskus “all surprises – we do not know who he is called”.
GM calls new pickup tricks in the United States to repair the seat loan
General Motors calls for 19.000 its brand-number Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Peckup Tricks with construction year 2014 to address a problem with the manually constructable seat, so a communication of the US-American regulatory authority on Friday.
In some of the cars, there may be a defect in the mechanism for the recovery of the prereferencies.
For this reason, they do not comply with the federal directives for vehicle safety for headquarters.
“When the vehicle is on the ground, it is possible that the head supports do not protect the insules correctly, so there is an increased risk of injury”, reported on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The returned models were produced between August 1 and 10 September.
The delivery of the GM-Trucks started in June and constitutes the main model start of the leading US-American car manufacturers since the unsolved restructuring 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owner in the first half of October about the defect.
The NHTSA could not check the notification record because of the 16-day government Shutdowns, which was negative to the car sales in October.
The sale of Silverado and Sierra Tricks, which were renewed for the model year 2014, increased to 20% in the first ten months of the year.
In October GM 42.660 Silverado and 16.503 Sierra Peckup Tricks.
The GM activity increased at the New York Burse at 37.47 US Dollar on Friday.
Insufficient sword of a Obama elector
I have chosen President Obama two times in hope that changes are possible.
He said that Obama has undertaken loving efforts to be linked by the blockadetics of the Republicns.
The blockade policy does not apologize the website problems of Obamacare, the drug attacks
Obamas Meetings about the 2008 election campaign were a tragic memories of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at the Harvard Medical School in the second year.
I now read a terrible book.
It is a book I believed, it would give me hope during the second year of my medical study and again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" (Out to win) and the Memeric Barack Obamas for the 2008 presidential election.
If I'm finished with my patients's cards, and I'm going to bed, then the book brings me back in a time when policy inspired millions of people and one talk could smile the breath.
The election was taken into an earthquake and a news speaker in order to lead to the historical importance of this hour.
My classroom friends smile for joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on the path to the White House and the nation was ready to change.
When Obama was then changed into the office in 2008, he had authorized values of 82 %.
And then I closed the book.
Retrace to the present is a bad wake as if you're going out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a slow memory, a disappointment of disappointed opportunities.
In the years since I first left my voice, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could imagine.
I recognize the great and diversity of things that Obama has reached, from the adoption of the Asordable Care Act for Headquarters until the military department from Iraq, the end of the dismissed disagreement of homosexuality in the army and the murder of Osama bin Ladens.
I also believe that the partial political blockadetics have taken a lot of challenges with which our country should be introduced: immigration reform, public option for hospital insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay to call only some of them.
However, after I have defended the Obama government against colleagues and accused persons, I am at the end of my statement requests.
I have reached a point of political disaster.
The Republicnic blockade policy cannot explain why the deputy of foreign heads of State is allowed or the death of innocent children by drugs in the overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency samples data on the private life of Americans and why Whistleblower is punished to open public misconduct.
It cannot be explained why Anwar Al-Australia, an US-American citizen, was murdered without procedures, and the public finance and expenditure limits will not be interfered during the presidency election.
It does not justify the results of a report, which means the efforts of the White House to peace the media are the "agressive... since the Nixon government".
And recently, it can't apologize the incapacity to develop a simple website in which more than three years since the appointment of the Appealable Care Act has been adopted.
I don't know if it's what I had to expect.
If I should understand with 18 that the government work could oppose political campaigns that they were forwarded.
Of course, the Deputy is not a predictable course, since a party of opposition and accidental events such as the Newtown Massaker is the public debate.
But if I look at the above examples, it seems to be widely chosen by the government itself.
And it's most of me.
I chose again by 2012 Obama, not because I was a candidate for his candidate.
Among Romney was a confusing and unreasonable alternative that he seemed to be able to fix his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second official period for Obama, free of the pressure of future elections, would meet the hope that we had heard so long.
However, with the sensation of the authorisation values for Obama this week, the return of the book has become so deteriorated in 2008.
It strikes in me after the many promises that have resolved in the air.
This week I read a section in the book, which describes how Obama had to lose a serious loss against Clinton in the predictions in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the election assistants after the decision, he told his workers that they should return to course and follow the purpose of their matter.
“ I want to find our surprise again, ” he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr President, and I can't vote to you more.
The views expressed in this comment are only Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer, Prime Minister Tony Abbott has interested conflict at parents' vacation
Milliardary and deputy Clive Palmer said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott was in an interesting conflict with his plans for parents' vacation because his daughters are pregnant and, therefore, could benefit from it.
The mountain construction magnat, which is in a jurisprudence on payment of $6 million in CO2 steel, pointed out the attention when he wanted to take questions from the table whether he was in a conflict.
Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for the decision whether CO2 and mountain construction taxes are cut or slow.
However, Palmer said that only ministers could have interest conflicts and the daughters of Abbott would personally benefit from the laws.
“He is in a great interest conflict when it comes to payment parent holidays, because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he has a direct interest in obtaining a vacation or not,” said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission Palmer was declared with 53 votes after the new accounting officially for the winner of the Sunshine Coast Side of Fairfax.
Palmer requested a revision of the scheme for the styling accounting, so that this would be more faster.
Tony Abbott daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these choices be decided two months after the end of the schedule?
“We need a better system” he said.
Why should we not have a system where you're marked in here, entering data into a computer, immediately selecting and then finished at 6:30?
Palmer also criticized the use of lyrics in marking the smile place.
Do you use them because you can raise the results if they don't fall?
It is unbelievable to vote with bleistifs today.
The election committee has examined the options for electronic election and recently published a common legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, declared that his policy heard a international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he will take his new office “so serious”.
In the public office, it is about the public service.
“We are trying to make no reward except the story, namely that we can serve in a critical time of this Community”.
RBS suspends two shippers
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two handlers from its headquarters, so two persons who are trusted in the situation, and this is another indication that the world's responsibilities to the mobile manipulations on the monetary market are slightly driving.
Some of the largest banks in the world, including UBS, Barclays, German Bank and RBS, confirmed that they cooperate with the authorities with the most important financial market in the world, on which 5.3 billion US Dollars are changing the owners every day.
The two handlers would be the first RBS employees who have been suspended in which the scandal is on the Libor interbank business.
The bank, who did not comment on the suspension, confirmed this month that they received information requests from authorities.
“We continue to investigate this topic and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities” said the Bank two weeks ago.
Last month, the situation has been closely reported that RBS has forwarded the registration of e-mails and instant messages sent by and to a previous handler to the British Supervisory Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This manager, Richard Usher, had left the RBS 2010 and was to be allowed by his current position as a European leader of the Forex Spot-Handel at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, Chief of the European Spot Trading in Citi, was allowed this week, and Matt Gardiner, previously leading currencies at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
No of these handlers was predicted for any misconduct.
On the Instant Message Group of Usher, bankers in Barclays and the Citi-Gruppe said the situation was near.
UBS noted this week that she had taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulatory authority Finma declared that she was investigating a swiss manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six world authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competitive Authority Weko, the FCA, the US-American Ministry of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently employed with precursors in which bankers should have discussed transactions in the monetary market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and credit Suisse have also introduced internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said persons trusted in the situation.
Instant Messages and E-mails from several years in search for cases of misconduct.
The reports about these investigations have been carried out by the handlers in a field of relief that has heard in the past few years to one of the most profitable business units of investment banks, but this year has been pressed because low volatility in currencies limits the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to switch the business and said that it was almost impossible to manipulate the extensive and high-grace liquid bond market, but leading handlers believe that this is not indeed true.
One leader noted that, despite the huge daily volume in the carriage trade, the liquidity fraction between the various trading platforms and the increased use of their own internal platforms by banks would lead to “the market with very low ticket prices”.
The message came on the same day when credit Suisse announced that this week she declared a Manager of London Exchange Traded Funds, after the end of the last year he had caused a loss of only six million dollars.
The bank immediately informed the competent authorities and cooperates with them.
“We are sure that the handler has treated alone and that the matter has been dealt with,” said Switzerland.
The Building Sea on the Beothle Graduate
A group of citizens' initiative "Swiss Wiese" has enhanced the construction of the Bechtle-Grundhouse at the curpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, it was cut and spread the footway, which is called in a press communication.
The planned thresholds of the disappearing house in the back of the basement were not permitted by security reasons, as it threatens to decrease.
Alfred Abel, who is currently managing the basement, had voted with his colleague Reinhard Domke by the BI.
Before the BI's action, a transparency was accompanied with the message "We have done so."
However, about 20 members of the citizenship initiative were unlikely in their action.
Their moot on the large place called "We are against bauruins."
In this way she wanted to indicate the risk of even greater ruins on the Swiss Wiese - the rican project should be drawn up a day.
In conversation with many passengers before the "building" it was clear that some citizens believe that it will make many better with the achievement of the city project, although few of them have the same questions to the size of the project presented as the BI.
But they began to resign because the city continues to delay these answers, it means from the BI.
As it was to hear, the public statements of the Citizens' Minister also affected.
In May the Joint Council said that he feared the outcome for the thermal bath, the people should vote on the plans for a bath and wellness complex on the Swiss fishermen.
Some seem to be too shocked because others are as a "plump of pressure" in the population, which means that it continues in the Press Communication of the BI.
The BI thanked the costs for the color and all the helpers.
Rangnick shields for swimming: Man no swimming king
So satisfied Ralf Rangnick, with the current higher form of Federal Liga, Red Bull Salzburg, also showed the sport director of the "Bolen" of the Scheeds leaders.
"There is a dangerous tendency that Mane and Alan are being dragged into the category of Schwalben Powers", he took the two open-equipants on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
The youngest place for Rangnicks Critic was the illeb for Mane at 3:0 against the last Sunday, where the Senegale has been a suitable shooting player - which was freely not how the TV images shown.
"A grise lack of decision," Rangnick said, "the Scheedsdirector Harkam is "humanly overcome".
Harkam also had joined the "scale" between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Trainer Adi Hatter after the party.
His German Landsmann defended: "I would be in every situation as Roger Schmidt."
Schmidt itself wants to have no contact with his colleagues after the sharp kitchen.
I don't know why.
"When I am those who were politicianed," the 46-year-olds stressed.
In view of the success cycle, Rangnick realized a lobeshym.
"For this there are only two words: Very good," he realized.
There's no lot to use.
In particular, the way the mansion plays is impressioning.
This must be quiet.

High Court confirmed Obamas Health Act
It is a great victory for the Government of Obama: the US Supreme Court today decided that the closely linked health law with Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges condemned that the individual mandate of the patient's protection and Abordable Care Act – it forced the US-American citizens to complete a hospital insurance until 2014 or pay a punishment – is constitutional in the framework of the State's tax authority.
The Supreme Judge John Roberts was on the side of the four liberal members of the room, while the judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of 2700 pages of the legislation and also concluded that the provisions of the health law should be extended to the provisions of access to medical medicine or, at the other time, would not be sufficiently limited to all State medicine supports.
The complaint procedure against the law was aimed at 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was rejected by all leaders of the Republican Presidency, including the last challenger, in 2012, in the Pre-Carter of 2012.

"It is at least necessary to learn the letter chains in the cities new and Rosen gardens on Sunday," says Bittner and Rohrenbeck unisono.
Also for the nuclear city, especially not mobile citizens, a letter box should also be able to reach the Sunday Learning.
Rourenbeck asked in the city parliament whether the city management plans to discuss the post.

Hundreds of soldiers and police officers waited for the building, as Mursi found a short after 11 a.m. in a small autoconvoi.
Only a few hundred attendants had gathered before the court to join the new Presidents, and in contrast to the prestigious Prunk from the Mubarak Seat, the transport was held only short-term so that the autoconvoi could overcome the ordinary road that the city centre connected to the southern cities.
As an uncharismatical “emptomation” of the brotherhood, his personal president has taken up since his victory and a freeday speech, where he was not only a candidate of Islamics but all of those who wanted to put the objection of the resurrection from 2011 against the author Mubarak.

Do you think travel offices belong to the Internet of the past?
Flight Centre seems to be opposed to the trend.
The company has increased its profit views for the total year and expected recursion incomes of vacants in Australia and Britain.
The travel company is now expenditure of a yearly winning for taxes between $325 and $340 million, compared to $305 to 315 million in its previous prognosis.
If the current target values are achieved, it means a growth of 12 to 17% compared to the recursion wine of $290.4 million in the period 2011/12.
As director Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre achieved eight percent of wins in the first half of the year, and consigned a strong start in the second half year, especially in the Australian and British private business.
“After the beginning of the year, our ten countries are profitable and some of them are on the good way in the direction of the recording year revenues before interests and taxes,” he explained.
This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which typically belong to our strongest results.

Schools will be held to be more focused on mathematics, literature and gramms
In the course of English literature, students need to be treated at least one part of Shakespeare, a Roman of the 19th century, romantic Lyric and temporary British Romans from 1914.
The test also finds the entry of “unexpected texts” in order to spend a wide reading.
The combined course from English literature and language is discarded.
From 2015, students need to depend on a own GCSE test for language, with strong encouragement to select English literature as separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will be published tomorrow by the new education plans for English and Mathematics – the first cases that were radically revised.
Other nuclear cases will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual is announced by the Supervisory Authority, a new organization of GCSE structures, including a new system of use and less currency work.
In a summer speaker, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, said that there is a “width consensus that we need to reform our testing system to restore public confidence”, and he emphasized that GCSES would be“decisive, ambitional and stricter”.
Studies show that in English schools less time for mathematics is used – 116 hours per year or three hours a week per year – than in most other countries.
In this respect, Australian schools receive average of 143 hours annually and students in Singapore 138 hours.
There is no formal requirement to predict more time for mathematics in the hour plan, but it means that the comprehensive mathematic verification – combined with a greater weight of the spectrum in the rings – will be likely to encourage schools to use more hours.
In the school plan, more attention is placed on “problems from the right life”, including financial mathematics.

Trace through smile, rivers and dyskins for free medical supply
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical assistance in intriguing villages in Kamerun
Training blends and his team at least every weekend to treat hundreds of patients
There are no many doctors in the West African country, only one for 5,000 people
Absolute here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle belongs to the top 10 of the CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose him to “CNN Hero of the Year”.
The winner receives $250,000 to continue its extraordinary work.
21 years ago, George's Bwelle saw how his sick father always lost the consciousness and traveled to hospitals who did not have the resources to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured at a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital city of Cameroun, 1981.
First, he had only a broken arm, but then became a devastation that extended himself to his brain and caused a hamatom that would affect him for the rest of his life.
“ There was no neurary surgery in Kamerun,” says Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Nevertheless, Bwelles passed to join his father in overall clinics and hospitals in order to get the treatment that they had to offer.
“It's not easy” comments Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5:00 tomorrow and go to the hospital to be the first, and it's not first.
There are many patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed since Bwelles' father died in 2002.
In Cameroon there is only one doctor for 5,000 people, so the World Health Organization.
The relationship in the United States is at a doctor of 413 persons.
But even if a doctor has been given for them, most of the cameruners could not visit.
Two of five people in the country live under the poverty limits and nearly three of the health expenditures in the country are private.
“The only problem they have is the poverty,” Bwelle says.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
In Bwelle, his father and so many of his lands suffered, the decision to do something.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team have performed free operations in the last 700 years.
He himself was a doctor and worked as a prison surgery in the Central Hospital in Yaundé.
He also established a common organization named ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas and offers free medical supply there.
Since 2008, he and his voluntary group have helped just 32.000 people.
Nearly every Friday he went to 30 people in a small bus and walked with the shooting medical equipment on the toilet over unfinished terrain in the villages that need the help.
It's not always going to be slow.
Soon more than once they had to shoot the vehicles through rivers and slamm.
But when they come, they will receive as heroes: a feast, sweet and dance, and the best entertainment that the place has to offer.
In these villages, it is really a reason for the holiday and the bwelle – with its wide laughs and its unlimited energy – to be pleased at the joyful party.
On the next morning the team starts with the investigation of hundreds of patients.
“We treat 500 persons for driving” says Bwelle.
They come from a round of 60 kilometers around the village – and it is on foot.
Each of these weekends offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated by Malaria, Tuberculosis, Food, Diabetes, Parasites and sexual transgressable diseases.
Others receive clips, independent brills or free birthdays – a document that is necessary for the school, but many poor families simply can't lend.
Tonight the team performs simple operations with local smoking.
The operations are normally found in a school, the advisory house or a apartment; after the invasion, patients are up and go to the recovery area to make places for the next ones.
The clarification of the OP and the desinfect exhibition is seized by the generator of the group and thus works Bwelle and its volunteers until the early morning hours on Sunday.
It's a surprising pension, but the village musicians normally help to keep the team motivated.
“They smile all night to keep waking and continue our work,” Bwelle says.
On Sunday, the team returns to the city, sweet, but is proud of the work done.
The group – a mixing of cameraunic doctors and foreign medical students – has performed 700 free operations in the past year and knows that it affects a huge difference for people who help it.
One man declared that the free operation of a leisure brown that he received to allow him to work again.
“This changes the future of my family,” said the man.
Besides the weekends and its work as a surgery in the hospital, Bwelle also works in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his common activity, so Bwelle; the rest is from private costs.
"I really don't know when he is sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who studied the Drexel University in Philadelphia Medicina, and works voluntaryly in the Bwelle Group in the second year.
He's always in the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and hospital students such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe and supports Bwelles, this is an opportunity to gather practical experiences that they would never get home.
“We can be in operations where we help to pull blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle” says O'Malley.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students pay their travel to Kamerun normally and often bring dependent health materials.
But when it is once in Yaoundé, Bwelle overcomes the undercoming, transport and guidance.
“He is a hero without doubt,” says O'Malley.
He devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the Camunian people know no borders.
For Bwelle, the nearly permanent work is not loaded.
Others to help a more happy life and to fulfill a promise that he gave his Father provides to him great joy.
“ I am so happy when I do this job, ” says Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he's seeing what I'm doing.
I'm doing it to bring people back to the laugh and to lie the pain.

It creates focusing on the attention of the public, so that his monologists aren't a moment slow.
His efforts to endure the fish on the surface of the water are so true that the observers forget that the sea only exists from blue water flavors.
Governor Jens Hasselmann allows the old man to act in the boat before the fisher village.
During the launch, he puts the active scenes into the light: the garden of Santiago, the bar of the songs Marie-Luise Gunst, who meets the Kuba's feelings of life with their songs and their magnificent voice.

Tourism: Decrease to the Romans
At about 120 meters of length, a dishwasher canal is obtained from the Roman time.
Whoever visits the kitchen will not end in the dom.
The two doors in the sky were around 157 meters and make it to the second church building of Europe.
However, only a few visitors who experience the two filigrans of cyclopedia acknowledged that there is also a lot of discovering under the dom.
Rainer Schools are experts in the fields of Kullner underworld.
The service centre of the Colen-Tourism is directly on the dom.
The roundgang begins very unspectacularly, "We're going to be in the deep garage," says school.
In the seventy-years, the city desired a self-government city, and therefore the rest of the old towns was only the one that was not too large.
As a result, most users of the parking house eat today also to the Roman rest and only make their car off.
But who looks more accurate, finds in the Parkdeck D2 a architectic foundation separated by metal gitter.
It's about five meters higher rocks from handling stones.
"There are the remains of the Roman city Maurice, built in the second half of the first century after Christ," says school.
Before it turns back to daylight, schools allow the participants to look at the top of the park in a window, 15 meters deep shadow.
This is the burn of the old domain, which, unfortunately, will be uncomfortable.
The next round station is the premium, and here the participants will return to the depth.
Here we experience the office of the first powerful man north of the Alpen, the Chairman of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, you want to know a visitor.
"The decline is for "Collonia Claudia Ara Agripinessium", which means at good German as "Romic Law and City of the Agriprins, founded by Caiser Claudius on the place of the Altar for the Caiserkult".
And the premium is the former statue, the power center of the Roman Empire in the Rhein.
From the premature of the exhibition, a tunnel access to the Roman waste channel that has been obtained here about 120 meters long.
"You can quietly start a piece from the so-called cloaca Maxima if you want to", the guests taught the guests.
A surprise has still schools.
After he helped the key at the castle, he leads the group to a deep, accurate shadow.
"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bathroom," he says.
The Jewish community built its baths deep in the ground to come to the basic water that was unprecedented for the rituals.
To this day, at the late end of the mikwe whose origins are back to the eighth century, different water stations can be allowed through the changing skin of the rain.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological area on the Council House for which the construction works should start in rounds.
But there will be a few years until finishing.
It's almost cut: Locker process reset
A blue attack in the Rockermilloue is rerouted over four years.
A process for murders tried, dangerous injury and damage against two 30 years of age has started before the landgericht Frankfurt (or).
It is accompanied by strict security arrangements.
The accused shocked up.
They should have been active in the rocker line and then have heard the bandides.
The State Authority proposes to attack and engage in three men in a car in June 2009 together with unknown complications in Finowfurt.
All the victims were hardly hurted, a man had almost lost his skin.
The victims should have heard of the competitive grouping Hells Angels.
One would be a high-range member of Berlin.
It seemed to be a persecution year with several cars.
According to the accused, it was about reverse battles and a power-demonstration.
The two complaints were released in a first procedure in the beginning of 2012.
A court speaker then said that it has not been able to prove that men have actually been involved in the blue error.
The murders had loaded masks and were not recognized.
The Court of Justice urged the sentence after revising the State Authority and returned to a revised negotiation.
One of the complaints is now because of another crime in the open fulfilment.
At the end of the night, it was particularly about the reconstruction of the shifts.
As a witness, the Commissioner who then identified was loaded.
In the centre, telephone talks were held by the defenders and other persons who had heard the police.
It is difficult that Rocker almost always holds a law for them, and does not condemn it.
This applies also to the victims.
In the first process, only one of the victims was packed.
Anwalt Stefan Golfier from the State Authority Frankfurt (or) said that it had been new shows since the last procedure.
For the process, 11 further negotiations are established.
The road company does not think
The night was long, the music sounds and the smiling is good, but at once it goes home.
Only: In the shipping of people on the driving and backside, the hunger is noticed.
Clearly, the one may be responsible for this!
What is closer to walk to the next Drive in to give a littleness?
I'm sorry, I'm glad to do with it when it's going to be late last night in the early morning to feed hole.
A few pommes, a Cola, a Burger - and then nix as from home to bed!
However, on the homeway, the clear differences between me and other hungry Disco partners are marked.
Because what is lacking that you take your fat food products out of the car window with regularity?!
Especially at the weekends, deleted papers in road countries and in parking places.
"Who?" I ask.
Are the people too buffy to take the murders with respectful home to the next muller?
It isn't just so that the paper product breaks the landscape.
Toys have already discovered transport systems such as guideline plans and solved accidents.
What do you think is "World Society" not according, she probably don't even know what this word actually means.
If you're on the end of the road, just right with several people in the car, you can know how a back bank can look after the nights: clamps, balls and other mulls there.
There would be more or less mortality, even though nix, in contrast to the street where no one wants to roll on the rest of others.
I have seen the day in which the cities and communities will be broken - and the fat feed chains must be requested for their murder.

Most citizens could receive such a better, comprehensive hospital insurance for the same price or favourite than prognosed.
“He arrives a better offer,” he said.
The government was a little surprising that the five percent of the people who have completed an insurance should take account of another tax, since their treaty did not discuss the new standards according to the Appealable Care Act.
“I want to say these Americans rightly: you have won best”, said Sebelius at a hearing before the Committee on Energy and Trade of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sebelius, responsible for the implementation of the Abordable Care Acts, declared that the start of the online platform was lost since October “miserable”.
“I am also frustrated and angry as everyone else,” she said.
I'm determined to return your confidence.
This proclamation of a Sebelius posted to a consulting advisor in the Representative House was included after a struggle with Mrs Billy Long from Missouri, which was obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeated why the "architectin" of the Abordable Care Acts did not volunteerly denied on a Stately promoting insurance to complete a tariff at HealthCare.gov that they now want to sell millions of Americans.

The goal was "Lakes and Party equipment" which feared the Israeli government that they had been designed for the Libanese Hibola, said CNN.
Syrian and Libanonian media, as well as the Arab Sender Al-Arabia, had previously reported that the support point in the port city of Latakia was struck on Thursday, and Israel was responsible for this.
The Israeli television channel 2 showed satellite images of the station point in Latakia, where Russian switch drivers of type S-125 Newa and a battery of SA-3 rakes were able to see the channel 2 have a range of 35 kilometers and can be transported up to 70 kilograms.

The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai emphasized in the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime has tried to deliver land-luft rats to the hibola.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that every trial of Syrians to give the hibola with chemicals or other dangerous weapons was denied over a "red line" which would follow a military response.
John Kerry declared in an unfair ingest that the US spontaneousship was “too far away”
John Kerry said, with an unexpected ingestness, that the United States's decreasing position in respect of their monitoring programs, he said that the sponage was to be “slowly measured in certain cases.”
In addition, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who joined Barack Obama, was responsible for the “autopilot”, when the explosive enthusiasms of the Whistleblower Edward Snowden, were publicly public on the spiriting activities of the NSA.
The U.S. government is divided into a diplomatic strike of the detection of its associations.
In a video-related talk at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: “The President and I have learned and others in the government of some things that are almost off by autopilot, just because the possibility of the second world war and the difficult years of the war, and of course on 11 September.”
In addition, he was the first member of the American Government of the United States that the U.S. Spionage had overlooked a border, but also stressed that no rights were misused.
He said, “In some cases it has gone too far. ”
The President has decided to make clarity, and therefore he has conducted a green investigation so that no one needs to have the feeling to find an inutility here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent people in this process will not be affected.
However, Kerry found that NSA was a power of good and that many lives were saved through its supervision operations.
He added: “We have to do it with a new world, in which people are ready to smile themselves into the air”.
There is a radical extremism in the world, which is able to kill people, to shoot into the air and attack governments.
So what if you could start and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented aircraft doors, building appeals and people's murder because we have experienced such plans in advance.
In addition, American lawyers will continue to go to Europe in order to defeat the concerns against the American Spionage and to convince Europeans that they need to work together with the anti-terrorism efforts, as stated by the President of the President of the President of the President of the President of the President of the European Affairs Committee on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said he had spoken this week with representatives of the European Parliament and other people and was concerned about their threats to not participate in the supervision of the National Security Agency in anti-terrorism organizations.
“It is very important for the national security interests in the United States, that Europeans remain towards our common efforts towards terrorism,” said Murphy, who first as a democracy in the Senate and works as President of the Senate Subcommittee for External Relations and European Affairs in Washington.
I also go to Europe to clarify that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their infirms over the NSA programmes.
The media reports, which the NSA has discussed millions of telephone data in Europe, have reported the relationship with some US associates, while the head of the Secret Service has explained this week, the reports were unacceptable and based on a misunderstanding of metadata collected by Nato partners and were discussed with the United States.
Other enthusiasms quoted by Snowden, where NSA has observed the phone of federal officer Angela Merkel and up to 34 other state supervisors worldwide.
The Chief of National Secret Services, James Clapper, defended the spirit of associates as necessary and explained that this is normally on both sides.
In all the Tumult, Murphy said that his authority prepared the trip of the Congress to take place this year, and hoped that the delegation will include members of both parties and rooms.
The names of the other Members participating should be published in the next days.
He said that the exact reiserout will still be developed.
While Murphy stressed the purpose of traveling is the improvement of the relationship, he also said that it would give some “precedent words. ”
He said that the European Governments should be honestly against their population about the type of sponsoring programmes which they themselves have used for years.
“If we can change our monitoring programmes and protect better the rights of the Europeans, they must also be found in the fact that we are not the only ones that spontaneize,” says Murphy.
During the weekend, John Kerry is a journey in the Middle East and to Poland in order to go together with the Growle over the US Strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, and the US supervision activities.

Australia's occupation against prison punishment in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced in Phuket for 15 days in prison because she was wrongly encountered to be a taxi driver, infringed the sentence and released on a cup.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first condemned by a Province Court in Phuket on 15 June to have made a false shock after she gave an indication against the Thai police, and a local taxi driver was arrested on Sunday, June 10, while two other men were arrested.
Later, however, the accommodations of a video camera showed that she had been safe in her hotel after she was separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket listened to Bamford two days until she thought about the story.
Before the court negotiations, she was held in police in place.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison penalty in a prison in a low security stage at Rande Phuket, rather than in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgiy Liga, who has used the Foreign Minister in Canberra with the request for help for his daughter.
Tunks explained about Sunday Telegraph in Sydney, the entire family is “extreme concern” about the well-being of his daughter and wanted to return to Australia.
“We, of course, make us great concern, but we hope they're home as soon as possible,” said Tunks.
Bamford has opposed the sentence and is against a cup of 50,000 Baht on a free feet.
In Australian reports it was to read that she is making vacation in the Krabi holiday place in Souththailand.
On the side of the court, Bamford will be held by a local lawyer in Phuket and was warned that the profession could also lead to a higher punishment of up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it can also be possible that Thailand may be trying to improve his encouraged tourist image after the recent murder of the travel coffee Michelle Smith in Phuket, and therefore it comes to an exemption.
