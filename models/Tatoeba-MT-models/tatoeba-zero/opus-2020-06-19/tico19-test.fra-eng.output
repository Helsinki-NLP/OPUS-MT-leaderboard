Quick increase of the cumulated impact of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) within the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The cumulated impact of the cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar development in the countries of the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming and, although it is in different cities, the COVID-19 pandemia is rapidly progressed in all countries.
According to Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care services must be prepared to a small number of patients at COVID-19 needing care, particularly intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a home of unknown ethiology pneumonia was reported in Whan, in the province of Hubei, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Centre for Prevention and Diseases Designed the responsible agent as a new coronavirus known now under the name of Coronavirus 2 of the severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting in infection with SARS-CoV-2 was baptized with coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Today, about 80 per cent of the people at COVID-19 have a pleasant affection, i.e. an infection of respiratory ways with or without pneumonia, most of which are cured.
About 14 per cent of the cases, COVID-19 causes a more severe inclination that requires hospitalization, while the 6 per cent of the remaining cases are developing a serious form of intensive care.
The mortality of patients hospitalized because of COVID-19 is around 4 per cent.
In the context of this study, we evaluate the development of COVID-19 accumulated impact in each of the European Union/Economic Area (EU/EEE) and the United Kingdom (R.-U.) and compared with the development that has known the province of Hubei in China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEE and the United Kingdom with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
After China, COVID-19 continued to promote, and the dynamic of COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world is now following the country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) would declare that COVID-19 is a pandemic.
In the edition of 5 March 2020, Spiter et al. reported the first cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Europe according to the definition of WHO cases.
In the EU/EEE, the first three cases confirmed were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in persons returning from Whan, in the province of Hubei, China.
On 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 were detected in each of the 30 countries of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom (R.-U.) with 39 768 cases and 1 727 deceases declared, including 17 750 cases and 1 441 deaths for Italy only.
Obtaining the cumulated number and the cumulated impact of COVID cases-19
In the European Health Prevention and Diseasing Centre (ECPCM), the number of cases of COVID-19 reported in each world, only from official sources such as health departments, national and regional health authorities in different countries, as WHO, is updated daily at 08.00 p.m.
These data were used to evaluate COVID-19 development within the EU/EEE and the United Kingdom, and to establish comparisons with Italy's experience.
In order to evaluate the prevalence of the active COVID cases, we calculated the cumulated impact of 14 days of COVID-19 cases, taking into account the natural development of COVID-19, within each EU/EEE and the United Kingdom, for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compared the cumulated number of cases reported in each country from 15 March 2020 to 8 a.m. with the data from Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 development in the EU/EEE countries and the United Kingdom
Evolution of the cumulated impact on 14 days of COVID-19 cases within the EU/EEE and the United Kingdom has generally monitored that of the Hubei Province (Chine) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EE and the United Kingdom, the cumulated COVID-19 impact began to grow beyond 21 February before a drastic increase in the outside of 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This development was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other countries of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom presented a similar increase in the accumulated COVID-19 impact.
Figure 2 presents the cumulated number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEE and the United Kingdom compared to Italy's data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It is noted that, on March 15 to 8.00, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to Italy only three weeks before or less.
Our results indicate that the number of COVID 19 cases are rapidly increased within the EU/EEE and the United Kingdom.
Evolution of the cumulated impact of COVID-19 suggests that pandemic progresss to a comparable speed in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are different cities and that there are differences in the responses to national public health services, potential variations in case definitions, and differences in the selection protocols of patients to be tested for the confirmation of COVID-19, including for rattrapage tests.
In March 2020, Italian doctors indicated that about 10 per cent of the patients reached by COVID-19 needed intensive care, and media reported that hospitals and intensive care services in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data relating to the admission of COVID-19 cases in hospitals and/or intensive care services are currently available at the EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (not submitted).
However, a systematic collection should be achieved in order to complement the current monitoring data focused on the number of signed and death cases.
A study carried out in 2010-11 showed an important difference in the number of beds available in the intermediary and intensive care services in Europe, from 29.2 beds for 100.000 persons in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 in intensive and intermediary care beds for 100.000 individuals in 2010-11).
Modalization scenarios for the saturation of care capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEE country and the United Kingdom of the prevailing case of COVID-19 hospitalized cases associated with risk & gt; 90% over-intensive care capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the rapidly update of the COVID risk evaluation.
Since the cases were to be grouped in certain regions of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and the hospitals and intensive care services generally accept a defined regional population, the data on intensive care and care should preferably be established at the level 2 of the Statistical Territories Nomenclature (NUTS 2).
Italy's experience and the current development in other countries show that COVID-19 has rapidly progress within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The countries, hospitals and intensive care services should therefore be prepared to a supported Community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2, as well as to increase the number of patients reached by COVID-19, especially intensive care, such as in Italy's affected regions.
As highlighted by the recent rapid risk assessment of the CEPCM, an rapid, proactive and exhaustive approach is essential to delay the dissemination of SARS-COV-2, through a approach to an accumulation approach, where fast and precise increase in the number of cases could not leave sufficient time to decisions and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly, if nothing has been implemented in mount.
The rapid risk assessment also includes public health measures to improve the impact of pandemic.
There is a short window in which each country will strengthen its control efforts to raise the propagation of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce health pressure.
Without what, health systems in the other EU/EEA countries must be addressed to a small number of patients needing intensive care in the days or weeks to come.
The epidemic of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus 2 of the severe respiratory syndrome (SRAS) (SARS-CoV-2), was up to more than 3000 deaths and infected by more than 800,000 people in China and otherwise in the world, causing an humanitarian catastrophic.
Like its homology, SARS-CoV, which involves thousands of cases of ttäS in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by sugar chairs and cause similar symptoms by a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 presents a less severity and mortality than IAS, but it is much more transmissive, and it affects older people than younger and more than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on this emergency disease, this article is striving to provide an appropriate and comprehensive review of this subject of full-speed research.
We will address the basic elements of epidemiology, ethiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, pronostic and disease prevention.
Although many questions are still waiting for reply, we hope that this consideration will be better evaluated and eliminated.
The spring Festival, on 25 January 2020, has never marked the Chineses, which have been forced to remain closed for the whole week of gold, as well as for many other weeks because of the propagation of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologue to the coronavirus (COV) which causes a severe respiratory syndrome (SRAS) in 2003; therefore it has been baptized by the World Health Organization (OMS) on 11 February 2020, and associated disease named coronavirus 19 (COVID-19).
Epidemia started in Whan and rapidly propaved across China before extending about 50 other countries around the world.
On 2 March 2020, the virus had been incurred in more than 80 000 cases confirmed by COVID-19, with over 40,000 patients hospitalized and more than 30,000 deaths.
For WHO, COVID-19 is a potentially more dangerous public enemy than terrorism.
According to PubMed (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 works were published on COVID-19, in particular in the fields of virology, epidemiology, ethiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020 on virus sequence, isolated from several patients.
This review tries to synthetic the progress of research on this new subject in full.
As far as possible, we'll try to compare COVID-19 with the COS and another coronavirus disease, the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS, epidemia occurred in 2012).
We will also make the point of what we have learned until now in terms of prevention and prognosis of disease, and we will consider some questions still suspended but even urgent.
The coronavirus is traditionally considered as non-mortal pathogenes for humans, which lead to most 15 per cent of common rhymes 4.
However, during this centuries we have known two high-patogenic coronavirus for humans, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which have caused a epidemic in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively before promoting rapidly to many other countries with high morbidity and mortality.
Current COVID-19 is therefore the third epidemia of coronavirus of the recent history.
As presented in Fig.1.1, then unknown pneumonia homes were first reported to Whan on 31 December 2019 at the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the sequence of the coronavirus was declared.
On January 15, 2020, the first case was reported in Whan.
Among the time, epidemia was rapidly propaged to cities, provinces and neighbouring countries.
On 20 January, it was reported that health professionals had been infected, suggesting that inter-human transmission could be possible.
On January 23, the city of Whan was placed in quartain with interruption of all its public transport.
On January 24, the first clinical study on disease indicated that, in 41 cases confirmed, only 21 patients had been directly contacted with the Whan's sea fruit market, considering the start point of infection with an unknown animal source.
On January 30, WHO qualified world health emergency epidemic.
At the time of the drafting of this report, disease has already been promoted throughout China as well as about 50 other countries around the world (Fig.2).
When the situation is rapidly evolved, the final port and safety of epidemia remains to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicentric study carried out on 8 866 patients, with 4 021 cases confirmed by COVID-19, presented an updated view of epidemia as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/lBi-HX_rHHP1QA).
SARS-CoV-2 was infected by people of every age, but more than 30-65 years.
About half (47.7%) of infected persons older than 50 years older, very fewer than 20 years old, and only 14 were less than 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 was more infected by men (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was developed in homes, mainly in the province of Hubei and the periferia.
The average period between the appearance of the symptoms and COVID-19 diagnostic was 5 days (2-9).
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The average period between the appearance of symptoms and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The basic reproduction rate (R0) was 3,77 (95% IC: 3,51-4,05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected persons had been exponentially increased until 23 January 2020, which corresponds to the massive movements that took place before the spring festival in China.
The mortality of patients identified as cases confirmed was 1,44% (95% IC: 1,10-1,86%) and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3,06% (95% IC: 2,02-4,59%).
The three main risk factors of COVID-19 were sex (human), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
The coronavirus is a sub-familiar of large developed virus containing a simple brin ARN.
They can be classified in four kinds, namely alpha, beast, gamma and delta, the known coronavirus to infect the man belonging to the alpha and beast.
The glucoprotein Spike (S) of the cover is linked to the angiotensine 2 (ACE2) conversion enzyme and the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) of its cell-coV receptives for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, then a membrane fusion is produced.
Virus ARN is released in cytoplasm; after the replication of the viral genom, genome ARN accompanied by glucoproteines of encoding and nucleocapside protein forms of virus containing virus, which then fusion with plasma membrane to release virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was presented on 10 January 2020.
The SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus, with more than 99.98% genetic identity between 10 sequencing samples produced on the source site of epidemia, the Huanan sea fruit market in Whan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
By means of the electronic microscope in transmission, parts of SARS-CoV-2 have been detected in ultrafinal sections of human breathways.
Human ACE2 was identified as a SARS-CoV-2-receptor and SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 protein is linked to ACE2 humans less strongly than that of SARS-CoV, which is in combination with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less important infection than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 may also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b, as well as a secret protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b could play a role in viral pathogenity and inhibit the expression of IFN _; however, orf8 does not contain known functional areas or reasons.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, and al., the complete human CR2 crio-ME structure was presented with a complex resolution of 2.9 m with the B0AT1 amino acid transporter.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed compliance, was assembled in the form of diam and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could link two proteins S, which provides indications for recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for the clashing of medicinal products to eliminate the infection of SARS-CoV-2.
Heritage and intermediate host
It has been established that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated sugar keys and that they have been transmitted to humans through cities and cameras, respectively.
Following a phylogenic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronavirus, the suuri keys have been advanced as the native SARS-CoV-2 host, since the new virus is identical to 96% of the two types of SRAS coronavirus named ba-SL-CoVZX45 and SL-COVX21.
However, the intermediary host that allowed the virus to franchise the species' barrier to infect humans remains unknown, and the transmission way still is to elect.
Ji, and al., issued the hypothesis that the virus could have been transmitted to humans by the serpents, which would mean a homological recombination within the protein S.
According to a study conducted by Guangzhou researchers in China, pangolin - a museum's long-spot breeding mom, often used in traditional Chinese doctors - could be the intermediary SARS-CoV-2 host if it is judged by the genetic homology of 99% between a coronavirus found in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a distance of 1% between two genoms is an important difference; therefore, it should be expected to conclude results to establish concrete evidence (Fig. (Fig.33).
The physics-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very little known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may survive in vitro 48 hours in sec environment and up to 5 days at a temperature of 20 °C and a humidity of 40 to 50 %.
SARS-CoV-2 could have similar properties.
It seems that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet radiates as well as at a temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol to 75%, clore-based desinfectants, peractic acid, chloroform and other grass solvents, but not clorexidine, can effectively disable virus.
Human populations in its entirety are generally disfunded of immunity in SARS-CoV-2 and therefore are vulnerable to the new virus.
At present, no detailed study has been reported about immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to studies previously carried out on other coronavirus, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fiig. (Fig.4).
In general, when a virus infectes a host, it is first recognised by the immune system inhibited by the bias of molecular reasons recognition receptors (PRR), including the type C electrical receptors, the Toll type (TLR), NOD-receptors (NLR) and RIG-I-type receptors (RLR).
In different ways, the virus induces the expression of inflammation factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I (IFN) interferes that limit the dissemination of the virus and accelerates the macrocytosis of antivirals.
However, SARS-CoV protein N may allow the virus to escape immune responses.
Nevertheless, the adjustive immune response is joining the fight against virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ cells, play an important role in defence.
The CD4+ cells stimulate the B cells that produce specific antibodies of the virus, and CD8+ cells immediately eliminate infected cells.
Help T cells produce pro-inflammatic cytokins to support defence cells.
However, the coronavirus may inhibit the T cell functions by inducing their apoptose.
Human immunity, with supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a retail patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an excessive reaction of the immune system causes a localized explosion of the number of free roots, which can cause serious lesions to pulmones and other organs and, in the worst scenario, a multivisual deficiency, or death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by home appearance, is more likely to affect older persons with comrbidities and pregnant women.
It is acknowledged that persons exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised are more risked to be infected than others.
It is estimated that the average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is from 1 to 14 days, but more generally 3 to 7 days after a study carried out on the first 425 cases reported in Whan.
However, a study carried out at 1 099 case showed that the incubation period was 3 days in average, for a quarter from 0 to 24 days.
A recent study, as described above, concluded in an incubation period of 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) according to a demonography of 8 866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adjust the effective period of quarentaine after the most precise incubation period to avoid infected persons but asymptomatics don't transmit the virus.
Generally, persons exposed to, or infected by, virus are placed in quarentaine for 14 days.
The quarter should be extended by 24 days?
Fire is often the first and main symptom of COVID-19, and it can be accompanied or not with other symptoms such as a seed towel, a shock, muscular pain, smuggling, head-fat, gorge bad, rhinorrhee, theoracical pain, diarree, nausea, and disaster.
Some patients presented a disphine and/or hypoxime a week after the bleeding of disease.
With regard to serious cases, patients quickly developed a acute respiratory syndrome, sectic choc, metabolic oxygen and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms, as well as those with a acute fever, even in the absence of thoracic radiography anomalies, should be tested for virus to allow precoce diagnosis.
A demographic study carried out at the end of December 2019 showed that diseases presented fever to 98 per cent, 76 per cent, 55 per cent, and 3 per cent; 8 per cent of patients needed ventilative assistance.
Similar conclusions were reported by two recent studies on a family and on a home appeared following the transmission of virus from one asymptomatic individual.
Similarly, a demographic study carried out in 2012 showed that the main symptoms of the patients reached by MERS-CoV were fever (98%), a sequencies (47%) and a disphine (55%).
However, 80 per cent needed ventilative assistance, or more than the patients reached by COVID-19, which is coherent with higher letality of MERS compared to COVID-19.
A diarrey (26%) and a gorge (21%) were also observed in patients reached by MERS.
With regard to the SAS, the main symptoms were fever (99-100%), a seed tube (29-75%), a disphine (40-42%), a diarrea (20-25%) and a gorge bad (13-25%), and a ventilatory assistance was required for approximately 14-20 per cent of patients.
On February 14, COVID-19 mortality was 2 per cent, for 66 576 cases confirmed at the world level.
Comparedly, the mortality of the SAS in November 2002 was 10 per cent for 8 096 cases confirmed.
According to a demographic study carried out in June 2012, mortality was 37 per cent for 2 494 cases confirmed.
A previous study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 6.47 with a trust interval (IC) to 95% of 5,71-7,23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
A comparison of symptoms, mortality and R0 of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV is presented in Table 1.
Data suggested that SARS-CoV-2 has a more important capacity to promote MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but that it is less literal.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control SARS-CoV-2 epidemics that it has not been for the MERS-CoV epidemies and SARS-CoV.
The appearance of a home is often involved in a family or within a assembly or vehicle, such as in the case of a cruise.
Patients often traveled or stayed in Whan or other affected regions, or were contacted with infected persons or patients in the two weeks before the appearance of symptoms.
However, it has been demonstrated that individuals may be virus portators without having a symptom for more than two weeks and that retailable patients may be re-relators of the virus, which emphasizes the need to increase the period in quarantine.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of device white globes (e.g. lymphocytes) in the first towns.
For example, a lymphopenia with a number of white & lt; 4 × 109/L and a number of lymphocytes < 1 × 109/L, and a high rate of aminotransferase asparate and Viremia were identified in 1 099 patients at COVID-19.
Some patients had hepatic enzymes, muscular enzymes and high blood myoglobine rates, and most of them presented an elvasion of the C-reactive protein rate and the erythrocytarian sedimentation.
In the most serious cases, the rate of D-D-D-dimère was high, and the number of lymphocytes gradually reduced.
Thoracic radiography anomalisms are observed in most patients reached by COVID-19, characterized by bilateral shadows or an opacity in glass level.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute pulmonary lesion and a syndrome of acute respiratory depression (SDRA).
In the case of SDRA, uncontrolled inflammation, liquid accumulation and progressive fibrosis are seriously compromising gas exchanges.
The disfunction of type I and type II pneumonics leads to a decrease of surfacent rate and an increased surface pressure, thus reduced the capacity of pulmonary pulmonary pulmonary pulmonary pulmonary pulmonary pounds and increased the risk of pulmonary collapsus.
Thus, the most worried therapeutic reviews often coincid with the most serious form of disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed a dequalization of pneumonites, the training of hyalin membranes, interstitutional lymphocytal infiltration and the presence of multinucleated synctic cells in the pockets of a deceived disease, which corresponds to the pathology of viral and SDRA infection and apparent to the patients reached by MOS and MERS.
SARS-CoV-2 detection of SARS-CoV-2 through polymera reaction after inverse transmission (RT-PCR) was used as the main criteria for COVID diagnostic (19.
However, due to the high rate of negative false, which can accelerate epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which wasn't only on the RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation had been observed for the diagnosis of AVS.
Thus, the combination of medical anticents, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radioological reviews is essential and imperative to establish effective diagnostics.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a SERLOCK technology protocol based on CRISPR technologies for SARS-CoV-2 detection purposes, which allows to identify synthetic ARN fragments of SARS-CoV-2 between 20 × 10-18 mol/L and 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies with a micro-scannyl band with less than one hour, without needing sophisticated equipment.
It is hoped that this new technique will significantly improve sensitivity and practice, if its use on clinical specimens would have been concluded.
Because of the lack of experience in the new coronavirus, doctors may only provide support for patients at COVID-19, while trying to try a variety of therapy already used or proposed for the treatment of other coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-COV, as well as other viral diseases (Tableau (Table 2).2).
These therapy include existing and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressors, steroids, retail patients plasma, Chinese doctor, and psychological support.
Even the plasma of retable patients has been proposed for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are all employed to develop anticorps and vaccines against virus.
The SARS-CoV-2 attacks the pulmones in the first time and probably also, in a less measure, to other organs expressing the ACE2, such as the gastro-instinal system and the rings.
However, disfunction and respiratory insufficient are the main threat for patients, and the main cause of death.
Thus, respiratory assistance is essential to highlight symptoms and save life; this includes general oxygenotherapy, high debit oxygenotherapy, non-vasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, according to the illness.
Patients suffering serious respiratory symptoms should receive extracorporal membrane oxygenation (OMEC), a changed cardiopulmonal derivation technique used for the treatment of critical cardiac or respiratory insufficiency.
Furthermore, the maintenance of electrical balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and sectic shocks, as well as the protection of the functions of vital organs are also essential for patients reached by SARS-CoV-2.
It was established that excessive reaction of immunity system leads to cytokinic shock in patients reached by ERS and MERS.
A cytokinic shock is a form of systematic inflammatory response characterized by the liberation of a whole series of cytokins, including TNFal, IL-1ś, IL-2, IL-6, IFNAL, IFNō, IFN.* and MCP-1.
These cytokins induce immunity cells to free a large number of free roots, which are the main cause of SDRA and multivisual deficiency.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokinic shocks, especially for serious cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibodies, were used to treat cytokinic shocks.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokinic shocks include the modulation of immune response by T cells, IFN- Gamma blocking cytokins, IL-1 and TNF, JAK inhibition, blinatumomab, cytokins 4 signal suppression and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressing agents, have been widely used in the treatment of the SAS to reduce the gravity of inflammation lessions.
However, high-dose steroids did not have benefits on serious pulmonary lessions in patients with COVID and COVID-19.
Instead of this, they would lead to serious secondary effects, including a vascular osteonecrose, causing so significantly the pronostic.
However, the careful use of short corticosteroid cycles of low-mode dose was recommended for patients with a serious shape of COVID-19.
At the time of the preparation of this report, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, the intravenous administration of redésivir, a nucleosid analogy, was effective in an American patient reaching COVID-19.
Redesivir is a new antiviral medicine developed from Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg virus.
In addition, redésivir also demonstrated possible inhibition of other simple ARN viruss, including MERS and ARN.
In view of these findings, Gilead transmitted the composition to China to allow a number of tests on individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2, and the results are very expected.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-alpha, lopinavir/ritonavir association and ribavirin were developed as potential treatment for patients suffering acute respiratory symptoms.
A diarrey, nausea, disorders, hepatic lessions, and other unwanted effects may occur after treatment combined with lopinavir/ritonavir association.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicines used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Retailable patients plasma and anticorps production
Blood collections with patients who have been curated from a contagious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or protecting healthy individuals of this disease is an anti-state practice.
Indeed, retail patients often represent relatively high anticorps against pathogen.
Anticorps are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to combat pathogenes and other foreign bodies; they recognize unique molecules in pathogenes and neutralize them directly.
Thus plasma was extracted from blood from a group of patients healed from COVID-19 and injected 10 seriously affected diseases.
Their symptoms improved in 24 hours, in association with a reduction in inflamation phenomenon, a reduction in viral charge and increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, a verification and clarification are needed to provide this method for large-scale use as long as no specific treatment has been developed.
Furthermore, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-related inconveniences should be carefully examined.
For example, antibodies can cause excessive stimulation of immunity response and cause syndrome of cytokine release, potentially fatal.
The concentration of anticorps in blood is generally low and the plasma demand for seriously ill patients is important.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies enough to combat global epidemics.
Therefore, it is more important and effective to isolate retailable B cells and to identify genetic codes that encode relevant antibodies or to investigate effective antibodies against the main protein of virus.
This would allow fast increased anti-corps production.
MTC is used since thousands in China to treat a wide variety of diseases.
However, its effects are widely on the combination of multiple components in a form that varies according to the MTC theories.
Most effective components remain little or not known as it is difficult to extract them and check them or to know their optimal associations.
At present, because of the absence of an effective treatment of COVID-19, MTC is one of the main alternative treatments for patients with low-mode symptoms or in a serious form of disease.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen have been effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The best rate of COVID-19 was observed in Chinese provinces with MTC recurring to 87 per cent of their patients, including the Gansu province (63.7 per cent), the Ningxia region (50 per cent) and Hungary (50 per cent), while Hubei province, which had not been acknowledged by 30 per cent of the patients reached by COVID-19, presents the lower guerrison rate (13 per cent).
However, this is a relative comparison because many other factors of impact, such as the number of patients and the gravity of disease, must be taken into account for the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and its collaborators publish a study that compared a treatment with western physicians (MO) only and a combinated treatment associated with MO and MTC.
The time of return to normal body temperature, the loss of symptoms and the time of hospitalization was quite shorter for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only.
More impressive, the rate of aggravation of symptoms (grain-weight) was clearly lower for the MO+MTC group as only for the MO group (7.4 per cent against 46.2%); also mortality was less for the MO+MTC group than only (8.8 per cent against 39 per cent).
However, the efficiency and innocentness of the TCM remains to be specificated by the larger controlled tests carried out to a larger scale and in more centres.
It would also be interesting in characterizing the action mechanism and clarifying the effective components of MTC treatment or associations, if possible.
The individuals identified as likely or confirmed cases of COVID-19 generally feel a living concern for this highly contagious and mortal disease, and those placed in quarantine also prove anxiety, solitude and cold.
Furthermore, infection symptoms such as fever, hypoxie and toxine, as well as indeseable effects of treatment, such as corticosteroid induced infection, may cause an increased anxiety and psychological deterioration.
During the first time of the Epidemidemia, several psychiatric morbidities were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic crisis, psychomotive excitation, psychotic symptoms, an acute confusional status and even self-suicide trends.
The binding investigation of contacts and the involvement in quarentaine, within the response of public health services to COVID-19, can increase the fear and cause certain responsibilities to the diseases in respect of the effects of contagion, quartainine, and stigmatization of their family and their friends.
As a result, mental health care should be provided to patients reached by COVID-19, individuals identified as likely cases, persons in contact with these populations, as well as any other person in suffering.
This psychological support should include training of multidisciplinary teams, clear communication with regular and specific updates on SARS-CoV-2 epidemics and treatment plans, as well as the use of professional applications and electronic equipment to avoid any approached contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupte the transmission chain of animal reservoirs and humans infected to vulnerable hosts, and are often supplementary of antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emergency viruses.
Activities have been made to develop protein S vaccines in order to produce long-term neutralized antibodies and/or induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Life vaccines have been evaluated on animal models for ARS.
However, the in vivon efficiency of these potential vaccines in older people and on models subject to legitimate provocation and their protection against infection by a zoonotic virus remain, as no clinical study has yet been initiated.
This is probably due to the fact that the CES had been completed 17 years ago and that no new case has been reported.
Instead, sporadic MERS cases and homes continue to declare themselves in the Middle East and in other regions because of the continuity of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Various vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS through the inactive virus, DNA plasmas, virus vectors, nanopartical vectors, virus apparent particules and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated on animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunized individuals is an urgent and essential objective to control epidemic current.
However, it is a real challenge due to the important (18 months in average) necessary to develop a vaccine and dynamic variations of the coronavirus.
As it is an emergency disease, COVID-19 is completely understood by thousands of patients.
In most cases, sickness is progressively resolved.
However, in the context of the SAS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high mortality and higher mortality for the most serious cases.
The establishment of a prognostic model is therefore essential to enable health agencies to priorize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
According to clinical studies until now, the factors that can affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients are the following (Tableau (Table33):
age: the age was the main factor for the prognosis of the SAS, and it seems also to be the case for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects individuals from 30 to 65 years of age, with 47.7 per cent over 50, according to a study conducted at 8 866 cases, as described above.
Patients needing intensive care were more likely to present sub-year-old comrbidities and complications, and were clearly older (Mean age of 66 years against 51), suggesting age as pronotic factor for patients reached by COVID-19.
Success: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 against 0.27/100 000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients at COVID-19 who need intensive care are more likely to suffer acute heart lessions and symptoms.
The cardiac events also constituted the main cause of death in patients reached by ARS.
The SARS-CoV-2 may also be linked to positive ACE2 cholangiocytes, which can lead to hepatic disfunctions in patients reached by COVID-19.
It should be noted that the age and presence of health problems are strongly correlated and can interfere with each other.
Annual laboratory results: protein C-reactive (CRP) in blood reflects the severity of inflamation or tissular lessions; it was developed as a factor of potential prognotic of disease, treatment response and treatment.
The correlation between CRP and severity and COVID-19 was also proposed.
In addition, a high rate of dehydrogennase (LDH), aminotransferase (AST), aminotransferase (ALT) and kinase creatin (CK) may also be involved in establishing pronostic.
These enzymes are widely expressed within several organs, including at the heart level and the heavy, and are released in the case of tissular lessions.
These are therefore traditionally the cardiac or hepatic disfunction markers.
Main clinical symptoms: Thoracic radiography results and temporary progress of clinical symptoms should be examined in association with other elements for the determination of pronotics and COVID-19 complications.
Steroid use: as previously described, steroids are commonly used immunosuppressors for infectious diseases to reduce inflammation lesions gravity.
Since high dosing of corticosteroids has been widely used for serious cases of ≥S, many survivors presented a vascular osteocree resulting in permanent incapacity and medium-sized life quality.
So, if necessary, the administration of steroids to patients at COVID-19 should be limited to a low dose and a short duration.
Mental stress: as previously described, COVID-19 epidemia involved a large number of exceptional stress cases, patients who often known long periods of quarantine, extreme incertitude, and neighbouring diseases or other patients.
It is necessary to propose a psychological accompany and a long-term support in order to help these individuals to overcome this stress and find a normal life.
According to the demographic studies until now, COVID-19 seems to present different epidemiological characteristics than those of the SAS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory ways, SARS-CoV-2 is also effectively reflected in the higher respiratory ways and does not lead to symptoms in the first phase of the infection, in order to introduce the coronavirus to the origin of common rains.
Therefore, recently infected or incubated individuals may produce a large amount of virus during their daily activities, which significantly impede the control of epidemic.
However, it was considered that SARS-CoV was transmitted by seriously sick patients, with a very low probability of transmission in the first phase.
Current COVID-19 epidemia is therefore much more serious and difficult to control than it has been the COVID.
There are currently considerable efforts in China, including Whan's confinement and neighbouring cities, as well as the continuing development of almost all the population in order to interrupt SARS-COV-2 transmission.
Although these measures had a dramatic impact on the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases decline, indicating a decline of epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates suggest that epidemia will end in March and that the decrease phase will last from 3 to 4 months.
However, all experts do not share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, and al., believes that COVID-19, which seems to be clearly infectious than COVID, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, and al., have established a model to prevent epidemic impact and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the average natal corne and the gorge of retail patients, two weeks after their outlet of the hospital, indicating that newly identified virus could become a cyclic episode in the influenza.
However, encouraging signs have been observed in China with the progressive reduction of new cases, suggesting that the implementation strategies would work.
According to the initial predictions, Ebola virus had to lead to a million cases and a half million deaths.
However, thanks to a quartery and a strict isolation, the disease was finally controlled.
It is possible, as for SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 has failed in terms of infectiousness to finally end up or develop in a less pathogenic virus associated with humans.
A comparison of COVID-19 epidemia with the COS and MERS is provided below (Fig. (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible by tuberculosis or forecasts, and may also be directly contacted with contaminated materials.
The virus was also identified in slases, thus disabled a new possibility of feco-oral transmission.
A recent study conducted at 138 patients showed that 41 per cent of the cases were possible to cause nosocomial infections, with 17 patients with previous diseases and 40 health professionals.
It should be taken care to protect individuals, including health professionals, social workers, neighbors and colleagues, and even any person may be contacted with patients or infected persons.
The first defence line possible to reduce the risk of infection resides in the port of facial masks; the use of chirurgic masks and respiratory masks N95 (1860) is involved in controlling virus propagation.
Surgical masks prevent the projection of potentially infected balls or their deposite on surfaces where they could be transferred to other people.
However, only N95 (1860) masks are protected against the hepatic of 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of the virus that can be fully covered; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size, as both measured around 85 nm.
Since particules can cross five surgical masks on each other, it is imperative that health professionals in direct contact with patients have N95 (1860s) masks and not chirurgic masks.
In addition to mass, health professionals must take adjusted isolation browns to reduce the contact with viruses.
Virus can also infection a person by eyeway.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor had been infected in the SARS-CoV-2 even when it brought a N95 mask; the virus could have pulled its organ by ocular ways because of inflammation.
Therefore, health professionals should also provide transparent visa or protection to the contact of patients.
For the populations of the affected or potentially affected regions, it is strongly recommended to lay hands with desinfects more often than computers, to remain confined to maximum and to limit any contact with potentially infected persons.
It is advised to keep a distance of a metro with the sicks.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent virus propagation.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new human virus, its high level of homosexuality with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, must have placed China in a high state of warning after the epidemic of COS in 2003.
However, in January 19, 2020, the Director of the Whan's Control and Prevention of Diseases would raise the population by claiming that the new virus was little contagious, that it had a limited inter-human transmission and that it would not be difficult to prevent and contain disease.
This message has introduced a notable delay, especially at the time when the whole country was prepared for the spring Festival, and the critical opportunity to contain the disease in Whan has been missing.
The Chinese disease control agencies must take lessons and take measures.
For example, these agencies should be more careful in their public advertisements, since every word can affect the behavior and the decisions of the population; (2) showing more sensitivity and reactivation to clinical inhabited data rather than expecting formal reports of medical or official bodies; (3) showing more restrictive to contain potential epidemics instead of trying to re-establish the population; and (4) to achieve more targeted and relevant exercises in order to acknowledge the population about epidemic diseases, but also to monitor and to regularly develop society response systems.
COVID-19 epidemia caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus started at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of the drafting of this report, it expanded across China as well as about 50 other countries around the world.
As this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 are also close to those of the SAS, COVID-19 epidemia is born as an already impression.
However, there are considerable differences between COVID-19 and COS, which should be taken into account in order to contain epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people than young and more men than women; severity and mortality are also more important in older people.
The CIVS presents a mortality exceeding that of COVID-19 (10,91 per cent against 1,44 per cent).
The transmission of the COVID-19 virus is even possible in the absence of symptoms, while ARS was mostly transmitted by seriously ill by patients; therefore, it is much more difficult to contain the propagation of COVID-19.
This is partly explaining why SARS-CoV-2 has promoted much more quickly and widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular SARS-CoV-2 detection tests may be observed negative for some patients at COVID-19.
On the other hand, retailable patients may be re-posed to virus.
This significantly increases the risk of propagation.
Despite rapid progress in the COVID research, several critical issues are still suspended, including:
Where's the SARS-CoV-2 coming?
While a genetic homology of 96% has been established between SARS-CoV-2 and two type coronavirus of COV-type, which originates suuries, it is not sufficient to conclude with certainty that SARS-CoV-2 providing chiroptères.
What is the intermediary species that allowed the transmission of the initial host's virus, such as sugar keys, to man?
Without answers to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to interrupte effectively the transmission, and epidemia can be re-interrupted at any time.
Molecular modalization and biochemical analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 is linked to ACE2, but how does the virus precisely imply in respiratory way cells and how does it lead to pathological changes?
Is virus also linked to cells expressing the ACE2 of other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible to define a fast and accurate diagnosis or effective treatment.
How long will epidemia get it hard?
How does the virus evolve on the genetic level during inter-human transmission?
Is it going to evolve in global pandemics, to disappear such as the COS or to re-evolving the surface as the grippe?
It is essential, even if it can take time, to obtain answers to all these issues and to many others.
However, unlike the expenditure that this must lead, we do not have any other choice to end this epidemia as soon as possible in order to restore the normal course of our existence.
Generally, the incubation period of these two viruses is lower than one week, followed by about 2 weeks of illness.
Only rare immunodepressed patients have presented a serious infection of lower respiratory ways.
The first case of S.S. was at the end of 2002 in the province of Guangdong in China.
Without the super-transmissioners, each case could almost generate two secondary cases with a incubation period between 4 and 7 days, the pic of viral burden appearing on the 10th day of disease.
Patients infected by SARS-CoV initially present a myalgia, head skin, fever, males and skins, monitoring of disphine, tumor and respiratory depression as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, false tests of the hepatic function and high kinase creatin are current anomaliees observed in laboratory analysis in the case of suspecting ≥S.
Disabled allergyal lessions, proliferation of epidemial cells and increased macrophages are also observed in patients reached by ARS.
About 20 to 30% of patients need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to lower respiratory ways, several organs including gastro-intestinal ways, feed and king, may also be infected in these serious cases, often accompanied by cytokinic chocolate, which may be particularly fatal in immunodepressed patients.
Since then, huge efforts have been made to HCOV research.
HCOV-NL63 was isolated in a child of 7 months in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was prevailing in young children, older people and immunodepressed patients suffering respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjunctitis, fibre and bronchiolite is common in the disease caused by HCOV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from the birth of a 8-month child who suffers pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although he has been identified in the Netherlands, he is in reality in the whole world.
HCOV-NL63 is associated with an obstructive laringite, also called crops.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was isolated in a 71-year-old hospitalized man because of a pneumonia and a bronchiolite in Hong Kong.
In HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 is present at the global level, causing moderate respiratory diseases.
Generally, when these HCOVs obtain the ability to effectively transmit themselves and maintain a continuous man, they also become less virulents or pathogens.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 cases confirmed.
MRS clinical manifestations are similar to the CRSs and are characterized by an evolutionary pneumonia.
In contrast to YAS, many patients suffering from MERS also developed an acute renal deficiency, which is characteristic of MERS in relation to pathology in HCOV.
More than 30% of patients have gastro-intestinal symptoms such as diarrey and disorders.
In February 14, 2020, more than 2 500 cases confirmed in laboratory were reported with a high death rate of 34.4 per cent, which makes MERS-CoV one of the most known mortal viruses in humans.
A diarrey is also observed in some patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected in SARS-CoV-2 were reported and could contribute to its rapid propagation in the world.
The comparation and opposition of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCOV showed similarities and very interesting differences.
First, incubation period and HCOV diseases are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCOV.
Secondly, the gravity of COVID-19 symptoms is between the SARS-CoV and the four Community HCOV (see HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small subgroup of serious COVID-19 cases is also observed as in the case of SARS-COV infection, although the proportion is lowly lower.
Finally, like other HCOV, SARS-CoV-2 can be deleted in samples.
However, the features of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, patience and sustainability after transmission to man will have an impact on the last destination of the current COVID epidemic.
The four Community GCVs caused moderate symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
In other words, both could be the survivors of the previous HCOV pandemics.
In order to achieve this, HCVs should be explained in humans in a sufficient proportion to enable adaptive changes that comply with host restriction factors.
In this option, more SARS-CoV-2 epidemia continues and more the number of infected people are important, there are more chances that the virus is totally adapted to humans.
If it fits well, his transmission between men will be difficult to stop by a quartenine or other infectious control measures.
For many years, the four CoV acquis in community are circulated within the population, starting a simple rhythm in immunocompetent subjects.
These viruses do not need to save animals.
However, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, high pathogens, have not been properly adapted to man and their transmission between men is not sustainable.
They must maintain and propago in their zoonotic reserves and seek an opportunity to achieve human target potential, probably through one or more intermediary hosts and amplificators.
SARS-CoV-2 presents similar characteristics to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four HCOV acquired in community.
However, it is more pathogen than acquired HCOV in community and less pathogenic than SARS-Cov or MERS-CoV.
It is still to see if it will be completely adapted to human beings and circle among these latest without animal accommodation or intermediary hosts.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCV, we will be useful to discuss the definitions and features of the evolutionary, natural hosts, reservoirs, intermediaries and HCV amplificators.
An evolutionary host service of HCOV is opened by a nearly sharing a high-level homology at the level of nucleody sequence.
The origin virus has often been very adapted and is not pathogenic for its host.
Similarly, a host opens HCV in a continuous and long term.
However, HCOVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish a long-term indemicy.
In that case, the intermediary host becomes a natural reservation host.
In particular, since 80% of the animals of the Guangzhou market present anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibilities that several small-scale mammals may also be excluded can also be excluded.
These suuri keys are positive to the anti-SARS-CoV anti-corps and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These studies have put the basis of a new concept that the sugar chairs are the emerging hosts of human pathogenes.
Human angiotensin conversion enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as SARS-CoV receptor.
Despite a high homology among these two viruss, the WIV1 is generally not the immediate parent of SARS-CoV and the sugar keys are not the immediate reserve host of SARS-CoV.
This is why the sugar keys can not be the intermediate reserve of MERS-CoV.
In addition, studies carried out in the Middle East showed that drugs were severe to specific antibodies that neutralize the MERS-CoV, as well as the mid-east chameres presented in several African countries.
Furthermore, the infected chameles exceed not only virus by respiratory ways but also by fecal way, which also represents the main way of excretion of sugar chairs.
We cannot exclude the possibility of pangolin is one of the intermediate SARS-CoV-2 animal hosts.
Moreover, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even less important than that which separates the coV animals associated with SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-2 of the pangolin.
Recombination is a significant factor for the development of the CoV beasts.
Scientists remain divided on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to high-pathogen HCOV, the zoonotic origins of HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenic evidence indicate that HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-229E could both be issued from the sugar CV, while the parent virus of HCOV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1 were found in randoms.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E was genetically associated with another cowboy cow, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, while cameras were also suspected to be intermediary hosts.
When HCOV-OC43 cut the barrier of species to infect humans from housebirds around 1890, an respiratory infection pandemic has been reported.
The history of the inter-specific transmission of HCOV-229E is less clear.
The HCOV-229E chair-coV was found.
First, in contrast to the alpagas, men may have a contact with the sugar keys in a shared environmental neck.
Instead, people have close contacts with the alpagas.
Then, the high-coV alpha of the suurie chair appeared in HCOV-229E are many and non-pathogenes in sudour chairs, while Alpaga’s alpha coV caused a respiratory disease epidemia in infected animals.
Finally, Alpaga's alpha-CoV alpha has not been found in wild animals.
In fact, the sugars are the direct source of human pathogenic virus, including raw virus, Ebola virus, Nipaha virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprised that the suuri keys can directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
Another possibility, while the HCV-229E alpha-CoVs are serving genetic reserve, alpagas and droids could serve intermediary hosts transmitting human viruses, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of the inter-south-south-sus key transmission to drugs and human drugs.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV found in the Southern Chaves is known through its initial identification and has also been strengthened by later discovery.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV is present in drugs for decades.
It has been well adapted in these rooms that have been intermediate hosts to reserve stable natural accommodations.
In contrast to the role of chameals in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolines in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if they have one, is different.
In particular, pangolin CoV beasts are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
several inter-specific transmission opportunities for human-coV-2 transmission have been included or excluded from future studies.
First, the suuri keys may be the host's reserve of a virus apparent in SARS-CoV-2 almost identical with SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share an ecological neck with the sugar chairs through the decoration or carbon mines.
Secondly, pangolins could be one of intermediary amplificators with which a virus associated with ≥S-CoV-2 has been recently introduced.
Humans contract the virus by defeating and consumption of meat to compare.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, can be sensitive to SARS-CoV-2.
Thirdly, as indicated above, the recombination and adjustment of the SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred within a third species that have been in contact with the sugar chairs and pangolins.
Research on animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 are undertaken.
Compared to other simple ARN viruses, the estimated COV change rates could be considered as "modified" to "high" with a mean substitution rate of ~10-4 replacements per year by site, according to the CV Adaptation phase to the new hosts.
However, the COV change rates are about a million times higher than those of their hosts.
Furthermore, the change rate is often high when the CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
With regard to SARS-CoV, having a high variation rate, the change rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher human adjustment rate.
It may be suggested that it has already been adapted to another guest near the humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this applies also to MERS-CoV, which has been well adapted to drugs.
In theory, it is unlikely that genetic decrease makes vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 inefficients in short terms.
Thirdly, CoVs are randomly and frequently changing models in the replication of the NNA through a single "copy selection" mechanism.
Phylogenical evidence of natural recombination were found both for HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, as well as for animal coVs, such as SL-COV and batCOV-HKU9.
Virus interaction in connection with transmission
Besides these three viral factors above, the viral interaction with a host receiver is another key factor that influences inter-specific transmission.
The recombination of the SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example here; it also shows evidence of positive selection during inter-specific transmission episodes.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be key factors for the adaptation of human virus.
It is interesting to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellal receptor as SARS-CoV.
A difference of 30% between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the protein S1 unit S means that the association affinity of this protein S with human ACE2 can have been changed.
Indeed, an electronic chryomicroscopie study indicates an affinity of 10 to 20 times above this connection compared to the observed between human ACE2 and SARS-COV protein.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-receptor may be required for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Hence, HCOV-NL63 is also linked to ACE2 but with a different part of the protein S.
There are many other HCOV receptors, such as aminopeptidae N for HCOV-229E, and 9-O-accetyted sullic acid for HCOV-OC43.
The divergence of hosted proteins between humans and natural reserves of HCVs, such as sugars, droids and routines, could be a barrier for inter-specific transmission.
New HCOV emergency: return to the start case
The diversity of the Suuri Key CoVs offers many opportunities for emergency of new HCVs.
In this sense, the sugar cows are genetic reserves of the HCOV.
Among SARS-CoV accessive proteins, ORF8 was considered important in human adjustment, since the SARS-CoV was isolated, but codified different ORF8 proteins.
This removes ORF8 in ORF8a and ORF8b and is pressed as a adaptive change that promotes host change.
Recombination sites have also been identified in Nsp9, most of the nsp10 and some Nsp14.
Similarly, it was demonstrated that MERS-CoV epidemia had known recombination episodes between different lines, which were produced in drugs in Saudi Arabia.
While an ORF4 could be observed in the virus of the sugar chair and the chameau associated with the HCOV-229E, the alpha CoV alpaga presents a simple insertion of nucleoid, generating a decay of the read frame.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCOV is also encouraged by selective pressure in their hosts to be reserved.
The cases of asymptomatic or moderate symptoms were detected when the sucres were infected by CoVs, indicating mutual adjustment between the CoVs and the sugar chains.
It seemed that the suurie keys were well adapted to the CoV on anatomic and physiological point of view.
For example, annomysis in the activation of pro-inflammary response in sugar tube reduce effectively the pathology deployed by CoVs.
Furthermore, the high level of reactive oxygen (DRO) generated by high metabolic activity of sugar waste could both remove the replication of the CoV and affect the "relecture" by exorbonuclease, which would create selective pressure and give place to high pathogenic viral skins when they are introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic cows could also be developed by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein features intended for the adjustment of the host.
Thus, it is not an accident if three new HCOV has appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are not pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their guests to reserve such as sugar and chambers.
They are firmly replied without caused a strong immune response to the host.
Here is the resident of the secrets of observing asymptomatic portors and the cause of serious infection in humans.
Severe symptoms are essentially due to the hyperactivation of immune response and cytokinic shock; more immune response is strong, more pulmonary lessons are severe.
However, in the case of the asymptomatic portfolio, immune response was discovered from the replication of the CV.
The same strategy for dissemination of immune response could have benefits in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, the administration of type I interferon should be benefited at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome is deteriorating in suuri keys.
According to this reason, NLRP3 inhibition with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
While a wild-souric-CV-cove-cove shared by 95% nucleo-homologic with SARS-CoV has been found, there is also a sudour-sweet CV coV that shares 96% of nucleo-homologic with SARS-CoV-2.
Beat-CoVs of pangolin markedly similar to SARS-CoV-2 have been found, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediary hosts or that pangolin CoV can contribute to the genetic fragments of the final SARS-CoV-2 version.
CoVs were returned under the fires of the ramp because of the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the Dromadary for a long time.
These rooms are an important means of transport and a large source of meat, milk, coal and milk for locals.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to save all rooms to control MERS, as it has been done on the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the propagation of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the recurrent MERS epidemias, a global approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-COV in chambers, associated with other infectious control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could evacuate and cause epidemics.
several zoonotic coVs circle in nature.
In particular, the Cove-Souris CoV, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
The culture of wild animal consumption in certain Chinese regions should be abandoned in order to reduce human and animals' unnecessary contacts.
In fact, many viruses exist on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reserves until a contagion opportunity is presented.
A continuous monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of CoV and their natural guests, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animal to humans and future epidemies.
To conclude, the most effective means for human prevention of viral filosofs is to keep away from the environmental necks of natural zoonoses.
First, if the suuri keys transmise a parent virus from SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it would be interesting to observe in what circumstances the sugar chairs and pangolins could share the same ecological neck.
Secondly, if the suouris keys play a more direct role in the transmission to humans, it should be necessary to determine how humans enter into contact with the suuries.
Thirdly, if a third mother plays the role of real intermediary host, it is still clear how it interacts with the different species, including men, sugar and pangolins.
What it is with a sugar chair, a pangolin or another mammalize, it should be possible to identify SARS-CoV-2 or the parent-identified virus observed in their natural guests.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as influenza or rhythm, for example, by stopping the hands before touching the eyes, nausea or mouth (e.g. mournings).
The main medical goal for the lavage of hands is to eliminate pathogenic agents (bacteria, virus or other microorgans that may cause diseases) and chemical products that may be harmful or cause diseases.
The lavage of the hands has many benefits for health, including the reduction in the propagation of grip, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; prevention of infective causes of diarrey; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as the reduction of child mortality rate in household accommodations.
In developing countries, children ' s mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrey may be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as the lavage of hands to savan.
The pneumonia, one of the main IRA, is the first cause of mortality in children under five years of age, which makes about 1,8 million victims per year.
Similarly, diarrey and pneumonia lead to the death of about 3,5 million children each year.
The lavage of the hands also protects the impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
The low-scale effect, the frequencies lavage of hands can skin up by causeing a cut-off skin.
A 2012 Danish study revealed that excessive lavage of hands could lead to eczema or dematite at the level of hands, characterized by a squamed skin and demangeous skin, and especially frequent in health workers.
The too frequent lavage of hands is also considered as one of the symptoms of the compulsory obsessional problem (TOC).
The disappearing two times a year, associated with daily lavage of hands in the savan and daily brossage of dental with fluored dentists, is in the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The main action of knowledge and detergence is to reduce obstacles to solution and to increase solution.
The only water is not an effective cleaner for skin as the lipides and proteins, which are organic materials of the earth, are difficultly solved in the water.
The solid savine, due to its reuseable nature, can refer to previous use bacteria.
There is no evidence that suggest that the use of recommended anti-septics or desinfects allows to target antibiotics in nature.
Therefore, even if antibiotic skins are not the fruit of antibaterian skins, these lasts could not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the tensioactive and skin protection agent, the most complex forms can contain acids (actic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) to regulate the pH, benzoic acid, with an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloa, vitamins, mental, extracts of plants), a rigorous analysis of the Oregon University of Public Health has indicated that the ordinary systems were effective as well as the antibactrics used for individuals and triangles, to prevente diseases and the batteries of main diseases.
The warm water used to laugh the hands is not sufficiently warm to kill bacteria.
The bacteria is much more faster than the body temperature (37 °C).
However, the tea and saving water is more effective than the cold and saving water to eliminate natural oils of salt and bacteria.
But in contrast to the popularity, scientific studies showed that the use of tea water was not contributed to reduce microbian burden on the hands.
A desinfectant or an antiseptic for hands is a non-water hand hygiene product.
Most are formulated on the basis of isopropyllic alcohol or ethanol associated with a divided agent such as carbon (acrylic acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a heat, or to a humidant such as glycerine, to obtain liquid or museum for a greater use facility and reduce the effect of alcohol.
Diluted hydrogen peroxide increases the antimicrobial activity.The desinfectants for hands containing at least 60-95% alcohol are effectively eliminated by the germs.
Alcohol solutions kill bacteria, multiresistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and some virus (including HIV, herpes, VRS, rhinovirus, vaccine, grip and hepatitis), and champions.
The hydro-alcohol solutions are almost inefficient against norovirus (or Norwalk), the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis. A sufficient amount of desinfecting for hands or hydro-alcolic solution must be used to move or cover the two hands.
The increased use of these products is due to their use facility and rapid elimination activities of microorganismes; however, they do not need to replace a suitable hand lavage if you don't have water and saving in hands.
The frequency use of hydro-alcohol solutions may result in a cut-off disappearing if the formula is not strengthened by emolytics and/or skin hydroatric agents.
The adverse effect of alcohol may be reduced or eliminated by adding to gluycerine and/or other emolyans to the formula.
In clinical trials, the hydro-alcohol solutions containing emolynts have undergone netly less irritation and cut-up sequence than antimicrobial detergents.
The allergical contact demativity, contact urtic or hypersensibility to alcohol or additives present in alcoholic solutions are rare.
In spite of their effectiveness, non-water products do not eliminate organic materials on the hands, but only desinfect them.
This is why desinfects for hands are not so effective as saving and water to avoid propagation of many pathogenic agents, since these are still on the hands.
The efficiency of alcoholless hands depends strongly on ingredients and forms, and has always been clearly lower than alcohol and alcohol desinfectants.
More recently, the forms used by benzalconic chlorure have presented a sustainable and cumulative antimicrobial activity after the application, at the difference in alcohol, which has been at times after repeated use, probably due to progressive progressive reactions.
The cedar or earth can be more effective than the water only, but less than they save it.
If the earth or cedar is contaminated by microorganismes, it may increase the propagation of diseases instead of frozening it.
Instead of savine, the cedar is also a desinfective agent because, in contact with water, it forms an alcaline solution.
WHO recommends cedar or sand as an alternative when it is not available.
Move your hands with the current water tea or cold.
The current water is recommended because of the risk of contamination of water points, while water temperature seems not to be different).
Make a generous amount of savon on the hands by frozen them against the other, without forgetting the dust of the hands, between the teeth and under the nails.
Savine removes the skin germes, and studies show that people tend to lay their hands more carefully when they use the savings with the water.
Frotter for at least 20 seconds.
The frotter action is created from the flight, which helps to eliminate the skin grums, and frozen more longer to remove more germes.
Bring too much to the current water.
The ring in a swimming water basin can lead to the recovery of the hands.
Search with a own or free air service.
Mood and humid hands are easier recognised.The most often forgotten areas are the pocket, the bridge, the spaces between the dogs and the bottom of the nails.
The artificial eggs and the scattered sheets can hide microorgans.
A hidrating lotion is often recommended to avoid having seed hands; skin seed seeds promotes the appearance of coated lesions that can increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to lavage the hands when the robinet water and/or savan is not available, for example, to cover the water of a slow or swimming vessel and/or use the ceder if necessary in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (e.g. in schools or rural areas of developing countries), there are solutions to economize the water, such as “type-taps” and other economic options.
A tip-tap is a simple technology that uses a suspended cross using a cord, and a pedale that allows to save a small amount of water on the hands and a saving pan.
The effective thickness of hands is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to switch the hands into the public toilets is being discussed.
More research suggests that paper service is much more hygienical than electric sechs than often found in the toilets.
After lavaging and shocking hands at warm air, it was shown that the total number of bacteria increased in 194 per cent on the dog pulp and 254 per cent on the palms.
A average increase in the total number of bacteria on dentists of 42 per cent and 15 per cent of the palms.
Following the hands, the following variations of the bacterial number were observed:
There are many different sech-room manufacturers, and the seach-rooms have been compared to the sequence by using paper serviettes.
The lavage of hands with desinfect rings is a alternative solution during the movement, in the absence of salt and water.
Hydrocarbonal solutions must contain at least 60 % of alcohol.
There are electronic devices that escape reminders when hospital personnel forgot to lay the hands.
The medical lavage of the hands must last at least 15 seconds by using a generous quantity of salt and water or glass to move and frozen each part of the hands.
The hands must be flewed against each other by passing between the dogs.
After the sending, the paper servicing should be used to close the robin (and open the output door if appropriate).
The goal of hand lavaging in health structures is to remove pathogen microorgans (hermes) and to avoid their transmission.
A relevant analysis was carried out by Whitby and al.
After an exposure to blood/a biological liquid;
before a aseptic geste; and
All skins must be removed.
In the context of this procedure, hands and fronts should be laid down up to the coast, generally for 2 to 6 minutes.
When the ring, it must be avoided that water on the fronts goes up to the hands.
In order to reduce the propagation of germs, it is preferable to lay hands or use an antiseptic for the hands before and after being occupied by a sick person.
With regard to the control of stafylocotic infections in hospitals, the main benefits of the lavage were obtained during the first 20% of the lavage, and there were only a few additional benefits to increase the frequency of hand lavage over 35%.
More research are needed to discover what the most effective interventions in different health structures are.
For example, in the largest part of rural Africa, it is rarely to find routines to lay the hands near the private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options to build hand lavage stations.
However, low hand lavage rates may also be imputable to thin habits, rather than to a lack of salt or water.
When the minimum standards are reached, schools can pass from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand lavage stations can be included in hand higiene campaigns that are conducted in order to reduce child diseases and mortality.
The World Day of Hands is another example of awareness campaign that aims to promote the development of conduct.
However, a magazine suggests that the promotion of the lavage of hands in the savan is quite more rent than other water and sanitation interventions.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to the fetidian odors called mysm.
For example, in Germany shows the “good hand lavage techniques” were placed next to the ships in the public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The expression "wear the hands" refers to the refusal of a person to take the responsibility or to be compliant of something.
Furthermore, those who are allowed to lay their hands after these thoughts are less strict to deliver to other compensatory measures of “purification”, such as the beneficiary.
Similarly, hindousism, bouddhism, cykhism, Jewishism and Islam requires to lay the hands before and after each feed.

It should also be emphasized that artificial selection can contribute to involuntary changes of virus genoms, which are very likely to be resulted from the pressures carried out during the selection, in particular by the host immunity system.
For example, the loss of ORF4 can be quoted in the HCOV-229E prototype smoke, due to a deletion of two nucleotics.
While an ORF4 could be observed in the virus of the sugar chair and the chameau associated with the HCOV-229E, the alpha CoV alpaga presents a simple insertion of nucleoid, generating a decay of the read frame.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCOV is also encouraged by selective pressure in their hosts to be reserved.
The cases of asymptomatic or moderate symptoms were detected when the sucres were infected by CoVs, indicating mutual adjustment between the CoVs and the sugar chains.
It seemed that the suurie keys were well adapted to the CoV on anatomic and physiological point of view.
For example, annomysis in the activation of pro-inflammary response in sugar tube reduce effectively the pathology deployed by CoVs.
Furthermore, the activity of natural killing cells in the sugar chains is removed by the positive regulation of the receptor inhibiting natural mortal cells NKG2/CD94 and by the low rate of expression of the majority of class I's compatibility complex.
Furthermore, the high level of reactive oxygen (DRO) generated by high metabolic activity of sugar waste could both remove the replication of the CoV and affect the "relecture" by exorbonuclease, which would create selective pressure and give place to high pathogenic viral skins when they are introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic cows could also be developed by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein features intended for the adjustment of the host.
Thus, it is not an accident if three new HCOV has appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are not pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their guests to reserve such as sugar and chambers.
They are firmly replied without caused a strong immune response to the host.
Here is the resident of the secrets of observing asymptomatic portors and the cause of serious infection in humans.
Severe symptoms are essentially due to the hyperactivation of immune response and cytokinic shock; more immune response is strong, more pulmonary lessons are severe.
However, in the case of the asymptomatic portfolio, immune response was discovered from the replication of the CV.
The same strategy for dissemination of immune response could have benefits in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
The answer to the interferon is particularly strong in the sugar keys.
Thus, the administration of type I interferon should be benefited at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome is deteriorating in suuri keys.
According to this reason, NLRP3 inhibition with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 was appeared following the general scheme by the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While a wild-souric-CV-cove-cove shared by 95% nucleo-homologic with SARS-CoV has been found, there is also a sudour-sweet CV coV that shares 96% of nucleo-homologic with SARS-CoV-2.
While civets and other animals present on the market were discovered as identical virus portators at SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate SARS-CoV-2 host has been identified.
Beat-CoVs of pangolin markedly similar to SARS-CoV-2 have been found, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediary hosts or that pangolin CoV can contribute to the genetic fragments of the final SARS-CoV-2 version.
Although there are questions, there is no evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 was designed by the man, that it is voluntary or accidentally.
CoVs were returned under the fires of the ramp because of the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of the CoVs in the sugar and other animals has strongly changed our perception of the role that plays the zoonotic origins and animal reserves in the transmission of HCOV to humans.
Many factual data showed that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originates from the sugar chair and are transmitted to man through intermediate hosts.
Since the infection of the SARS-CoV providing contact between human and market civets, the closure of the free products markets and the slaughter of the civets that were found would have been effectively enabled to end SARS epidemia.
Following the same reason, pangolines should be removed from the free products markets to avoid transmission of zoonos, taking into account the discovery of many pangolins-Cove lines closely associated with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the question of whether the SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to man by pangolines and other mammals and, where appropriate, how this transmission will be produced, will remain determined in the studies that will follow.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the Dromadary for a long time.
These rooms are an important means of transport and a large source of meat, milk, coal and milk for locals.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to save all rooms to control MERS, as it has been done on the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the propagation of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the recurrent MERS epidemias, a global approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-COV in chambers, associated with other infectious control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could evacuate and cause epidemics.
several zoonotic coVs circle in nature.
In particular, the Cove-Souris CoV, whose zoonotic potential is very high.
The occasions are not missing to evolve and recover, caused the emergence of new transmissible and/or mortal CV in the future.
The culture of wild animal consumption in certain Chinese regions should be abandoned in order to reduce human and animals' unnecessary contacts.
In case of ravages caused by the COVID, MERS and COVID-19, it should be established a better preparation and intervention plan.
In fact, many viruses exist on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reserves until a contagion opportunity is presented.
While the sugar keys present many qualities that are favorable to disseminate virus, the probability for human being in contact with the sugar and other wild species can be minimised if people are sensitive to the need to keep themselves away.
A continuous monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of CoV and their natural guests, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animal to humans and future epidemies.
To conclude, the most effective means for human prevention of viral filosofs is to keep away from the environmental necks of natural zoonoses.
Not all the secrets of the zoonotic origin of the ARS-CoV-2 are yet known.
First, if the suuri keys transmise a parent virus from SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it would be interesting to observe in what circumstances the sugar chairs and pangolins could share the same ecological neck.
Secondly, if the suouris keys play a more direct role in the transmission to humans, it should be necessary to determine how humans enter into contact with the suuries.
Thirdly, if a third mother plays the role of real intermediary host, it is still clear how it interacts with the different species, including men, sugar and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, are likely to contract SARS-CoV-2, they should be conducted both in monitoring and experimental contamination.
What it is with a sugar chair, a pangolin or another mammalize, it should be possible to identify SARS-CoV-2 or the parent-identified virus observed in their natural guests.
Research in this area will enable the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and have significant impact on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
A update of the diagnostic criteria for "subspect cases" and "confirmated cases" of COVID-19 is necessary
On 6 February 2020, our team published a rapid recommendation directive for diagnosis and the treatment of the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), and this Directive described our experience and provides references to combating this pandemic at the world level.
However, coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease is recently, our knowledge and knowledge gradually progress on the basis of the results of current studies and experience of clinical practice; therefore, the diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this email, we have responded to a comment on our directives and we have provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for a "subspective" case and a "confirmed case" in accordance with the last guidelines of COVID-19 (seventh version) published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCOV) caused epidemia that now officially brings the name of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus was called a severe respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO qualified the COVID-19 pandemic.
To be able to fight SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has made a rapid recommendation that was published online on Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
She highlighted a lot of attention since its publication.
However, please note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our knowledge and our knowledge are slightly progressing on the basis of the results of current studies and experience of clinical practice; therefore, the diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment directives published by the National Health Commission of the People ' s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) have known seven editions from 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020, some of the contexts have been substantially changed.
Our directive received a comment from Zhou and al., these recently presented a simple evaluation proposal on the basis of their clinical experience.
They have made new evidence for our directive and are also a valuable reference to this world pandemic.
We approve their important work and thank you for them.
However, their work should also be updated in accordance with the last COVID diagnostic and treatment directives (seventh test) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), the confirmation of a suspect case should be associated with one of the elements of epidemiological ancients with two elements of clinical manifestations to form a complete analysis, or must match three clinical manifestations in the absence of clear epidemiological events:
Epidemiological ancients: (1) travel or residence in the city of Whan and in neighbouring areas or in other communities where COVID-19 has been reported during the past 14 days before the symptoms appearing; (2) an anxiety of contact with infected cases of SARS-COV-2 (with a positive test of nuclear accidents) ; (3) a contact rate with patients present in fibre or symptoms of the city of Whan or neighbouring areas or other communities where COV-19 cases were reported during the last 14 days before symptoms appeared; (4) a contact of the symptoms of the city of Whan or the neighborhood, the syndrome of the surgeon.
Clinical diagnostics: (1) fiber and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) images with the characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) Total number of white globes indicating normal, decreased or reduced lymphocytes since the beginning of symptoms.
The confirmed case diagnosis should be supported in the suspect with any of the following pathological or serological evidence elements: (1) a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the sequence of the entire viral genome with a strong homogeneity with the new known coronavirus; (3) positive serial tests for IgM and IgG of SARS-COV-2 anticorps; or) the specific IgG anticorps of SARS-CoV-2 passing a positive or increased title ≥ 4 times in the phase of recovery by the augmentation phase.
We can see that the PCR test in real time of nucleic acids in respiratory ways or blood retreats has been added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third edition (22 January 2020).
The pathogenic detection of blood injuries was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and the fifth edition (8 February 2020) and then the seventh edition was added.
These changes are supported by the continuing work of researchers to find a optimal kit for the detection of nuclear acids for a fast diagnostic, as well as samples of respiratory ways including blood throwing, with an increased availability of different specimens, and contributed to the extent of the positive result of the specific anticorps in the confirmed criteria.
Furthermore, more evidence remind us of cautiousness for typical symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the graphic representation of Zhou and al. should be updated since they classified people who did not present clinical symptoms as “low risk”.
The evaluation system should also be checked in clinical practice and in future studies.
To conclude, we hope the emergence of more direct evidence and ask readers to submit their comments.
As regards the diagnostic of the "confirmed cases" and "confirmated cases", we suggest that they follow and respect the most recent directives in their country.
Our team will also update our directive to provide its help.
Bangladesh announces five new deaths related to COVID-19, a daily record
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths related to COVID-19 in one day.
The country thus records a mortality record because of the virus in one day.
Today, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Diseases and Research (IEDCR) stated that the number of containers registered included 114 active cases and 33 healthy persons, who remained in a household.
A total of 17 deaths was registered.
The closure of public transport began on 26 March and was to end on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential goods (medicational, fuel and food) was always authorized.
On March 19, those three were already rebuilding.
Thursday, the total number of cases of infection by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus exceeded the million in the world, according to the Johns Hopkins University's data.
In the world, countries have announced more strict measures to prevent dissemination of disease.
Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the master of Moscow, extended the confidence of the city until 1 May.
Parliament of Portugal voted to extend the national emergency status of 15 days; the vote was adopted with 215 votes for, 10 abstentions and a vote against.
Sonotic origins of human coronavirus
Severe respiratory symptoms (SRAS) and the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS) have turned into the tendency to find out how a HCOV infection could be devastating and potentially mortal.
Most of the HCOV are sweet-souris chairs where they are not pathogenic.
The intermediary hosts of some HCOV are also known.
The identification of animal guests has direct implications in human disease prevention.
The study of the CoV-hôte interactions in animals could also make better understanding of the CV in humans.
According to the differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified in four types (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV). The type of Beta-CoV contains the majority of HCOV and is divided in four lines (A, B, C and D).
Phylogènetic evidence showed that the sugar chairs and ringers play the role of genetic source for most of the alpha-CoV and CoV beasts, while the birds are the main preserving CoV gamma and delta-CoV.
To date, seven human coV (HCOV) are known.
Among them, HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five coV beasts include HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), the breathing syndrome of the Middle East (MERS-COV) and SARS-CoV-2.
The trace of the zoonotic origin of HCOV offers a framework to understand the natural history, the motor forces and the restrictive factors of the burning of species.
It can also guide or facilitate the research of the hosts, intermediate and simplified SARS-CoV-2, with significant impacts in the prevention of future containers.
The animal coVs are known since the end of the 1930s.
In recent decades, seven HCOV have been identified.
The first tube of HCOV-229E was isolated in the respiratory ways of patients with higher respiratory ways in 1966, and then was adjusted to grow in WI-38 pulmonary cells.
Patients infected by HCOV-229E presented symptoms of classic rhythm, including headbreaks, eternations, males and grain lacks, with fever and tough observed in 10 to 20% of the cases.
HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 are both present worldwide and seem to be mostly transmitted in winter countries to warm climate.
The shops in Australia reduce the amount of toilet paper limits by purchase
Thursday and Saturday night, the Australian Wolworths and Coles shopping chains reduced their toilet paper purchase limits to two and a shopping package in all shops at national level, respectively.
Monday, ALDI also introduced a limit of a package.
These limits have been displayed in the form of messages on the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the chain.
The buyers apparently massed reserves by fear of COVID-19 and the need to be confined.
Mercredi, Woolworths has also limited toilet paper purchases for household deliveries to a package per command.
These measures followed the previous restriction of four packages by purchase introduced by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March respectively.
Coles, in his press report on 8 March, stated that with the restriction of four packages in force, " numerous shops are still in stock rupture in the hour following the delivery" and qualified the request of "no previous", while ALDI, in a Facebook publication on Tuesday, qualified it "unexpectedly".
The sales have known a strong increase last week, according to a Woolworth's talking port.
The Costco shop in Canberra has also limited the quantity allowed to two packages last week.
In order to reduce the debt, Coles commanded larger packages to providers and increased the delivery frequency, Woolworths commanded an additional stock, while ALDI had already available stocks for a merger planned promotion.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Detailing Association, said that detaillers are trying to increase stocks, but the local counsel restrictions on the car delivery time make it difficult.
It is expected to increase production costs, while suppliers try to respond to the request, and less promoting.
On Monday, ALDI announced that after the pre-deblocation of stocks, some stories are not able to honor the promotion of mercredi.
In a article published on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, experts from the Queensland Technology University of Technology, explained that shops reapproved stocks every night.
It has noted that the toilet paper is a volumed article, involving stocks of a reduced quantity that, once disrupted, leaves large white spaces in radios and strengthens the impression of a penis.
"Coles and Woolworths consider [who] if the radios are full, if products such as toilet paper rolls and desinfectants can be purchased and are available in large quantities, this would probably reduce panic", explained Russell Roomman in ABC News.
The toilet paper manufacturer recycling Who Gives a Crap declared last Wednesday that they were in stock rupture.
Kimberly-Clark, which produces the Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris paper that produces the Sorbent paper, stressed that they worked 24/7 to maintain the supply, according to the News.com.au article.
Domain.com, a real estate site, stated that some buyers of real estate goods offered free toilet paper at the first buyer in Melbourne, while less sales to buyers were organized because of the buyers were sold in the long weekend of the workshop.
The NT News edition, a daily newspaper in Darwin, included eight pages to be discovered and used as a toilet paper.
The shops were first refusal to impose restrictions, according to a report of 3 March by ABC Australia, where they announced that they were not expected to introduce purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also had a strong demand, including masks, desinfectants, sectic products, hygiene products for hands and fat.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed on Wednesday night that the British online supermarket Okas was limited to toilet paper buyings Andres to two packs of 12 ruleles.
The World Health Organization qualified the COVID-19 pandemic
Mercredi, the World Health Organization (OMS) qualified the current COVID-19 epidemic (the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2) pandemia coronavirus.
While the word “pandemia” refers only to the degree of dissemination of disease and not to the dangerousness of specific cases, WHO indicated the need to put governments into action:
"All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If the countries deceive, test, treat, isolate, localize and mobilize their populations in the context of the response,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the WHO.
"We are very concerned, not only by the alarming levels of propagation and gravity, but also by the alarming levels of inaction."
According to Dr. Tom Peace, the former Director of the Centres for Control and Prevention of Diseases in the United States, pandemia is “no previously. ”
He declared, in the proposals published by CNN in February, that "no other respiratory virus was observed by its appearance until its continued propagation at the world level."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, declaring that “We have never been witnessed from a pandemic caused by a coronavirus.”
What he added, "and we have never been witnessed from a pandemic that could be managed at the same time."
The new pandemic status followed the WHO decision in January to declare epidemia an emergency of international public health.
The director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectional Diseases in the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said epidemia: "In order to make short, the situation will run."
Thursday, Associated Press announced that at least 126.000 cases of COVID-19 were in the world, with more than 4 600 deaths.
The pandemic of coronavirus 2019-20 is a coronavirus disease epidemic since 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe respiratory syndrome of the coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2).
The epidemic was detected in Whan, China, in December 2019, announced an emergency of international public port health on 30 January 2020 and recognized as pandemia on 11 March 2020.
On April 10, 2020, some 1,61 million COVI-19 cases were reported in 210 countries and territories with about 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people are healed.
The letality rate is estimated to 4 per cent in China, while in the rest of the world there is 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
The current symptoms include fiber, all and suffle.
The complications may include pneumonia and the syndrome of acute respiratory depression.
The deadline between exposure and appearance of symptoms is generally about five days, but it can swim between two and fourty days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptoms and support therapy. The recommended preventive measures include the lacking of hands, opening the mouth, staying away from other people, and monitoring and confidence of the suspected persons to be infected.
The world's authorities reacted by establishing restrictions on movements, quartans, cables, risk controls on workplaces and establishments closers.
Pandemia has generated serious socio-economic disorders at the world level, report or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events, as well as generally aggravated losses of panic purchase.
Schools and universities have been closed at the national or local level in 193 countries, touching nearly 99.4 per cent of the world students.
A false information on virus has been circulated on the Internet, and the incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred towards China, other people of origin and appearance Asian and South-East, as well as other people coming from regions with many cases of virus.
Because of the reduction of travels and closures in the heavy industry, there has been a reduction in the air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Whan, China (the capital of the Hubei Province) reported a home of unknown cause pneumonia cases on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was opened in the beginning of January 2020.
Most of the cases were linked to the Huanan Sea fruit market and, therefore, the virus would be a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused epidemia is called SARS-CoV-2, a recent and closely linked to the coronavirus of the sugar coronavirus, the pangolins coronavirus and the SARS-CoV. The first known person who had presented symptoms was deceived on December 1st, 2019, and the person did not have an identical link to the following home of the free product market.
In the cases of the first home reported in December 2019, the two thirds had been linked to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unspecified report from South China Morning Post suggested that the first case could return to 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old person of the Hubei province. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as the new cases seemed to be decreased in China but soon increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceededed the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There could be a strong sub-simmation of cases, including those with blessed symptoms.
On 26 February, relatively few cases were reported among young people, 19 years and less than 2,4 per cent of the cases in the world. The United Kingdom Chief Scientist Patrick Vallance estimated that 60 per cent of the British population had to be infected before they could reach an effective collective immunity.
The cases designate the number of people tested in COVID-19 and the test has been confirmed positively according to official protocols.
On 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and many countries have been in official policies to not test those who had only blessed symptoms such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that, up to 23 January, the COVID-19 infections were estimated by 86 per cent, and that these unregistered infections were the source of 79 per cent of the documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the reported cases.
The first estimates of the basic reproduction rate (R0) of COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the Centres for Control and Prevention of Diseases in the United States concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people at the COVID-19 are cured.
For those who do not cure, the deadline between the appearance of symptoms and death is between 6 and 41 days, the most common one is 14 days.
On April 10, 2020, about 97,000 deaths had been imprisoned to the COVID-19.
In China, on 5 February, about 80 per cent of the deaths were more than 60 years old, and 75 per cent suffered prerequisite health problems such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official accounts of COVID-related diseases are generally referring to deceased persons who have been tested with COVID positively according to official protocols.
The number of real victims of COVID-19 could be much higher, since it could not include non-tested persons, for example, at home, in retrait houses, etc.
Partial data from Italy indicated that the overmortality figures during pandemic are 4-5 times higher than the official COVID mortality decount.
An U.S. Control and Prevention of Diseases (CDC) has recognized “We know that [the number of announced deaths] is underestimated”, a statement confirmed by the anecdotic reports of the sub-evaluation in the United States. Such sub-session is often produced during pandemics, such as sugar grippe H1N1 of 2009. The first confirmed death occurred in Whan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside China was held on February 1st in the Philippians, and the first death outside Asia was held in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, outside the continental China, more than twenty-five deaths per country were registered in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
On March 13, more than 40 countries and territories had reported deaths on all continents except Antarctics, and more indicators are used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary according to regions and with time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the therapeutic options, the time developed since the beginning of the epidemic, as well as the demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and especially health. The case report represents the number of deaths separated by the number of cases diagnosed in a given period.
According to Johns-Hopkins University Statistics, the world case report is 6.0 per cent (97 039/1 617 204) to 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, the estimates of the case report reduced from 17.3 per cent (for the symptoms occurred between 1 January 2020) to 0.7 per cent (for the symptoms occurred after 1 February 2020). Other indicators are the rate of legitimacy (legality rates), which represents the percentage of diagnosed persons who succeed to a disease, and the infectious rate (infection rates), which represents the percentage of containments (diagnosis and diagnostics).
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination in the end of disease.
Many scientists have tried to calculate these figures for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of the University of Oxford believes that pandemic infection rate in its globality is 0.1% to 0.39%.
The highest value of this floor is coherent with the results of the first randomised tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analyzing the impact of tests on the rate estimates.
WHO supports the control of pandemia.
The pic and final duration of epidemia are incertain and can vary by region.
Maciej Boni of the State University of Pennsylvania stated: "No control, generally infected epidemias are stabilized and then start to resolve when sickness comes to lack of available hosts.
But it is almost impossible to make relevant previsions today at the time that this will happen."
The Chinese medical advisor Zhong Nanshan said that “It could be completed from June” if all countries are able to mobilize to follow WHO's recommendations on measures to address virus propagation.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski from London University of Hygiene & amp; Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 "is going to continue to circulate, potentially for a year or two."
According to a study of the Imperial College conducted by Neil Ferguson, physical distance and other measures will be needed “to until a vaccine is available (as far as possible 18 months or more).
William Schaffner from the University of Vanderbilt said: "I think it is impossible that this coronavirus - because it is very easy to be transmitted - is completely disappeared " and that he could be transformed into seasonal disease that may be re-apparition every year."
The virulence of this return would depend on the collective immunity and the extensive change.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are sometimes unspecific, and infected persons may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and sesh towels (68%).
Current symptoms include fatigue, respiratory secreations (mucosities), loss of odorat, sweat, muscular and articular pain, gorge, cephalized, skin, skin, heoptysia, diarree, or cyanosis. WHOS states that a person in six is seriously sick and has respiratory difficulties.
The United States Control and Prevention of Diseases (CDC) reports emergency symptoms such as breathing difficulty, pain or persistent thoracic pressure, sudain confusion, difficult bleeding, and face or blue lips; immediate medical care if these symptoms are presented. The post-evolution of the disease may lead to a serious pneumonia, a severe respiratory syndrome, a sectile, a semitic chocolate, and death.
Some of infected persons may be asymptomatic, without any clinical symptom, but with test results that confirm infection, researchers gave recommendations that persons who had closely contacted with infected persons should be closely monitored and examined to eliminate the risk of infection.
Chinese evaluations of the asymptomatic ratio vary from some to 44 per cent.
The habitual incubation period (the time between contamination and appearance of symptoms) is oxide between one and 14 days; it is more often five days. A good example of incertitude, the estimation of the percentage of COVID-ported persons who lost the odort was initially 30 per cent prior to 15 per cent.
Some information on how diseases continue to be determined.
The disease is intended primarily to be transmitted in a closed contact and by fines produced by all, eternally, or speaking; this approached contact corresponds to a radiation of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that all of them without protection can design boards at a distance of 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
Some suggested that the virus could also be transmitted by guittlets that would remain in the air in longer periods, which could be designed by speaking. The breathing boards may also be designed during the expiration, including speaking, whether the virus is not generally airported.
Postillons may swim in the mouth or nak of other persons located on the side or even be inhaled in the powders.
Some medical procedures such as cardiopulmonary invasion and reanimation (RCP) may cause respiratory secreations that are pulvered and therefore lead to air propagation.
It can also be repared when someone touchs a contaminated surface, including skin, before touching his eyes, his neck, or his mouth.
If some are afraid that it can be transmitted by schools, this risk is considered to be weak.
The Chinese government excluded the possibility of a feco-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious over the first three days after the start of symptoms, however, propagation may be possible before symptoms appear and for advanced cities of disease.
Persons have been tested positive to disease until three days before the symptoms have suggested that transmission is possible before the development of significant symptoms.
There are only some reports of asymptomatic cases confirmed in the laboratory, but asymptomatic transmission was detected by some countries during contact research.
The European Diseases Prevention and Control Center (ECDC) states that if there is not yet aware of how to facilitate disease, a person generally contain two to three other persons.
precisely, the virus could be detected in three-day bottles on the plastic (polypropylene) and inoxydable axe 304, after one day on the card, and four hours on the cup.
However, this depends on humidity and temperature, and domestic animals and other animals have been tested positively at COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, but the British authorities recommend to lay their hands after touching animals, as after having been contacted with other surfaces than infected persons.
The severe respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, initially isolated in three individuals with pneumonia connected to the home of Whan’s acute respiratory disease.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in the coronavirus appearing in nature. Out of the human body, the virus is destroyed by domestic savine, which removes its protective encoding. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the initial SARS-CoV.
We think he'd be a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus belonged genetically to betacoronavirus, the sub-gent Sarbecovirus (Lignage B) associated with two shoes of the sugar.
It is identical to 96 % throughout the genome of another sample of coronavirus-suuri (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one amino acid of difference in some parts of the genome sequences between pangolin viruses and human isolates.
The comparison of the whole genome has now revealed a maximum of 92% of common genetic material between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is sufficient to prove that pangolins are the intermediary host.
Virus infection may be temporaryly diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, however, the final confirmation is performed by inverse transmission of polymerara reaction by polymerase (RRT-PCR) of infected or scanning secretions.
A study compared to the PCR and scanner in Whan suggested that the scanner is quite sensitive than the PCR, which is less specific, because many of its image features coincidence with other pathological pneumonies and processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "scanner is not used for detection or as a first test of COVID-19 diagnosis".
WHO published several ARN test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with a first post on 17 January.
The test uses the inverse transmission of polymerara reaction in real time (rRT-PCR).
The test may be carried out on respiratory or blood precipitations.
The results are generally available in a few hours or days.
Generally, this test is performed on a rhinopharynx precipitation but can also be used. several laboratorys and enterprises currently develop serial tests that detect anticorps.
On 6 April 2020, none of them had been sufficiently reliable to be approved for generalized use.
In the United States, a seerological test developed by Celex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratorys only.
The characteristic image elements on radiographies and tomodensitometery (scanner) of persons present symptoms include asymmetric devices and the absence of lacking.
The Italian Radiology Society is currently an international online database of confirmed case image results.
Because of recovery with other infections such as adenovirus, PCR is a limited precision to detect COVID-19.
A significant study in China compared the results of the GDP theoretical scanners and showed that if the image is less precise for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, predicting its consideration as a detection tool in epidemic areas.
Convolutionary neurones networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect virus characteristics in the image both on radiographs and scanners.
Disease prevention strategies include globally have a personal hygiene, laid hands, avoid touching the eyes, nausea or mouth with non-laught hands, and strike or eternize in a swimming powder, then shoot the shock directly into a powder.
It was recommended to those who had already been contaminated to bring a surgical mask in public.
Physical distance measures have also been recommended to prevent transmission. Many Governments have prohibited or dismissed all non-essential movements to countries and sectors affected by epidemic countries or sectors.
Nevertheless, the virus has reached the stage of Community transmission in broad areas of the planet.
This means that virus is infected in communities, and some of these communities do not know where or how they have been contaminated, and it is advised to health professionals who may be infected to take usual precautions and contact precautions, and to bring contacts to protective lunets. Contact research is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent future transmissions.
The use of telephone location data carried out by Governments in this regard highlighted confidence problems, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations, which publish a communication to putting restrictions to such a type of monitoring.
A number of mobile applications were launched or proposed on the basis of the voluntary, and from 7 April 2020, more than twenty-five experts groups worked on private life solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth to register the presence of a user nearby other portable phones.
The users will then receive a message if they are closely contacted with someone who has been tested with the COVID-19. Fair ideas are now circled on how to prevent the infection; for example, slowing the nest and safeguarding with the mouth bath is not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, but many organizations are currently trying to develop it.
It is advised to lay the hands to prevent dissemination of disease.
The CDC recommends the people to lay the hands often in the saving and water during at least twenty seconds, especially after having been at the toilets or when the hands are visiblely salt; before eating; and after being mourned, hesited or permanent.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by the savior household, which breaks its protective cover.
The CDC also recommended to use a desinfectant for alcohol base hands containing at least 60% alcohol when saving and water are not easy to access.
WHO advises people to avoid touching eyes, nests, or mouth with unleavened hands.
The surfaces may be decontaminated in several ways (in a minute of desinfectant exposure for an inoxydable steel surface), including Ethanol to 62–71 %, isopropanol to 50–100 %, sodium hypochloride at 0,1 %, hydrogen peroxide to 0,5 %, and iodated povacine 0,2–7,5 %.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chloroxydin gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that, if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed in a establishment such as a office building or a cryque, all parts such as offices, toilets, common rooms, as well as common electronic equipment such as tablets, tablets, claviers, telecommands and automatic distributors used by nursing persons are desinfected.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouth and nail with their further sweet or swimming shoe when they all go or ever, and to shoot all right immediately.
The surgical masks are recommended for those who would be infected, because taking a mask can limit the volume and distance by the postills designed by speaking, ever and all.
WHO has issued instructions that explain where and when the mask is used.
According to Stephen Griffin, the virologue at Leeds university, “Makes can reduce the propension of people to touch their face, which is an important source of infection in the absence of good hand hygiène.” The use of masks has also been predicted to those who care about a potentially infected person.
WHO recommended the mask port to healthy people only if they face an important risk, for example, if they care for a disease with COVID-19, even if it recognised that mask port can help people not touch the face.
Many countries began to encourage their population to use masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the port of non-medical masks in tissu. Chinese specifically recommended the use of jetable medical masks to healthy persons, especially in case of nearness (1 metres (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends to bring a surgical mask into public transport or linked places.
In Thailand, health authorities encourage the population to manufacture facial masks in themselves and clean them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibited public outputs without mass or other ways to cover their nest and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam imposed the mask port everywhere in public places to protect himself and protect others.
The Austrian government ordered that everyone enters a supermarket to take a mask.
Israel requested all his residents to take a mask in public.
Taywan, who produced 10 million mask per day since the mid-march, imposed the mask port to train passengers and interurban bus on April 1.
The Panama forced the port of a mask for any exit, while recommending the manufacture of a artisanal mask to those who can't buy it.
The masks were also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapur.
Social distance (equivalently called physical distance) includes control measures for infections intended to raise the dissemination of disease by reducing contacts between persons.
The methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and the closure of schools, workplaces, cities, theatres and commercial centres.
The social distance methods can be applied by staying at themselves, by limiting their travels, avoiding the peoples, without contact and by maintaining a physical distance with others.
Many Governments now order or recommend social distance in the regions affected by epidemic.
The maximum number of meetings recommended by the United States government and health agencies has been rapidly reduced by 250 people (if there is no known presence of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 persons, and later 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany has banned public assemblies of more than two persons, and the older and the most older health problems such as diabetes, cardiac diseases, respiratory diseases, hypertension or a disappointed immunity system have been a increased risk of serious disease and complications. They have thus been invited by the CDC to stay at home as possible in the areas affected by the epidemic. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health organizations began to replace the term "social distance" by "physical distance" to clarify the objective of reducing physical contacts in the social conservation, as well as in the end of March 2020.
The use of the term "social distance" was to believe that it was necessary for a total social isolation instead of encourageing people to keep contact with others through other means. Some authorities have published guidelines on sexual health to be monitored during pandemia.
They understand the recommendation of not having sexual reports only with a person with whom you live, who has no virus or does not present symptoms.
The home isolation was recommended for positive COVID-19 people and those who think that they are infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for a correct isolation, and many Governments have imposed or recommended the establishment of quarters for whole populations in affected areas.
The most strict individual quartainline instructions were given to people of the most dangerous groups.
Persons who have been exposed to a disease with COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region where transmission was very important have been invited to place in quarentaine for 14 days since the last time they have been exposed.
Epidemia control strategies are adjustment or removal, and attuming.
The injury is implemented during the first phases of epidemic and aims to monitor and isolate infected people, and to introduce other measures to control infections and vaccination to prevent disease propagation in the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent dissemination of disease, efforts are turned to the stage of intensification: measures are taken to raise this propagation and to intensify its effects on the health care system and society.
Measures to be taken at the same time.
The removal requires extreme measures to inflame pandemia by reducing the base reproduction number less than 1. One part of the management of a infectious disease epidemia is to try to slow the epidemic pic: this is called to switch epidemic curve.
This allows to reduce the risk of overloading health services and gain time for vaccine development and treatment.
Among the non-pharmaceutical interventions that can be managed by epidemia include personal prevention measures, such as hands, mask port and quarterness; public social distance measures such as school closure and religious offices; public efforts to encourage the acceptance of such interventions and participation in those; and environmental actions such as the cleaning of the surfaces; more dramatic measures have been taken in China since the gravity of this has become apparent, as well as the establishment of urban entities and a strict interaction of travel.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures to limit the propagation of virus.
South Korea introduced the mass detection and the localized quartainine, and warnings on the movement of infected persons.
Singapore has provided financial support to infected persons who have been placed in quarentaine, and has inflicted deeply amended to those who have not done it.
Taywan has increased mask production and sanctified the adaptation of medical supply. Simulations for Great Britain and the United States show that the attainment (the decline but not the elimination of epidemic propagation) and the elimination (reverse epidemia development) faces important challenges.
Optimum accumulation policies may reduce health care requests of 2/3 and half deaths, but cannot avoid hundreds of thousands of deaths, and health care systems are undermined.
The elimination may be privileged, but it must be continued as long as the circle virus in human population (or until a vaccine is available, if it is first), because in the contrary case, transmission was rapidly reached during the delay of measures.
The long-term intervention to eliminate pandemic has a social and economic cost.
There are no anti-viral treatments approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are undergoing, including existing treatment tests.
Without ordering medicines against rhyme or drinking, as well as relaxing may contribute to highlighting symptoms.
On the basis of gravity, oxygenotherapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory assistance may be necessary.
The use of steroids can increase the results.
several compounds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently studyed for COVID-19 treatment.
WHO stated that some “traditional and artisanal remedies” may adopt symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The increased capacity and adjustment of health care for the needs of patients reached by COVID-19 is described by WHO as a basic response measure.
The ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have published guidelines on hospitals and primary health care services for the redistribution of resources at different levels, in particular by providing laboratory services to COVID-19 tests, by cancelling non-urgency interventions when possible, separate and isolating the positive COVID-to-level patients, and enhancing intensive care capabilities through staff training and increased number of vendors and treatments available.
There are various theories regarding the origin place of the first case (called with a zero patient).
The first known case of the new coronavirus could return on 1 December 2019, in Whan, in the province of Hubei in China.
In a month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei gradually increased.
They are generally associated with the market of huanan's fruit fruits, which also sold live animals. According to a theory, the virus would come from one of these animals; in other words, he had a zoonotic origin. A unknown cause pneumonia house was observed on December 26 and was treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian in the hospital of Hubai Province, which informed the Whan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors from the Whan Central Hospital reported their colleagues of a “coronavirus similar to the S.H.”.
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were recruited by the police for promoting false faults, and another, Ai Fen, was repressed by his senior to give warning.
The municipal health committee of Whan published a public opinion on 31 December and informed WHO.
There were enough cases of unknown pneumonia reported to Whan's health authorities to initiate an investigation in the beginning of January. At the first phases of epidemia, the number of cases were doubled about every seven days and half.
At the beginning and mid-January 2020, the virus promoted other Chinese provinces, helped by the new-Chine migrations and the fact that Whan is a shipping pool, as well as a main road matching place.
On January 20, China reported almost 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Pekin and one in Shenzhen.
The following official data showed that 6 174 persons had already developed symptoms on 20 January 2020. On 26 March, the United States exceeded China and Italy with the most confirmed cases in the world. On 9 April 2020, more than 1,61 million cases were reported in the world; more than 97,000 are dead and more than 364,000 have been healed.
About 200 countries and territories have occurred at least one case.
As a result of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted the movement and the establishment of border controls.
National reactions included involvement measures such as quarttain (as called household orders, opening or confinance) and coppers. On 2 April, about 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population are subject to a form of confidence in the United States, more than 50 million are confined to the Philippians, about 59 million in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On March 26, 1,7 billion people known a form of confidence, a number higher than 2,6 billion two days later — about a third of the world population.
The origin of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was dated on 1 December 2019 to Whan; a not confirmed report suggested that the first case would be recovered on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a home of unknown cause pneumonia case on 26 December, where she informed Whan Jianghan's CDC on 27 December.
Initial genetic tests of patients' samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a similar coronavirus in the CRS.
A public opinion was issued by Whan's municipal health commission on 31 December.
The WHO was informed on the same day.
The doctors in Whan received a warning to have “propaved rumors” about epidemic.
The National Commission of Health of China initially claimed that there was no clear evidence of transmission between human beings.
By the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by the Chinese Communist Party secretariat Xi Jinping as a “guere of the people” to end virus propagation.

several cars and ferry ports have also been closed.
Epidemia co-engaged with the Chunyun, a major tourist season associated with the New China Ancient.
A number of events involving important clusters have been cancelled by national and regional governments, including the annual festivals of the New Year, and private companies also closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many events related to the New Monday Year have been cancelled and many tourist attractions have been closed to avoid assemblies of mass, including the prohibited city of Peking and the fires of the traditional temple.
In the 24th of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the New Year holidays until 10 February, implying most of the workplaces not to open before that date.
These regions represented 80% of the country GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has been the highest level of response to infected diseases and has declared an emergency situation, shut schools up to March and cancelling its New Year festivals. The distribution sector has been affected at the global level, with temporary reducing shops opening or temporary closures.
Visitors in trade in Europe and Latin America have lost 40 per cent.
In North America and in the Middle East, traders found a decrease of 50 to 60 per cent.
This also decreased 33 to 43 per cent of the Peetton movement in trade centres in March compared to February.
The operators of the whole world’s commercial centres have implemented additional measures, such as the increase in cleaning frequencies, the installation of the thermal scanners to control the temperature of customers and the cancellation of events. According to a estimation of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by pandemia could leave from 14 to 22 million additional persons with extreme poverty in Latin America in relation to a situation without pandemia.
In January and February 2020, during the shock of epidemic in Whan, about 5 million people in China lost their job.
In China, a large part of some 300 million rural migrants were blocked in provinces in Hubei provinces. In March 2020 more than 10 million Americans lost their employment and requested assistance to the Government.
The coronavirus epidemia could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to the estimates of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. In India's confidence left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (of a daily salary) to unemployment. The Angus Reid Institute reported that 44% of Canadian homes had experienced a certain type of unemployment.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers requested temporary unemployment and 1 million British employees requested a universal credit request, and about a half million German businesses have made their employees to a part-time operation device called the Government Kurzwork.
The German job compensation device was adopted by France and Great Britain.
The art sectors of the spectacle and cultural patrimonie have been deeply affected by pandemics, affecting organizations and individuals at the global level.
The organizations of the art and culture sector have tried to maintain their mission (for state financed) to provide access to the cultural patrimonie to the community, to ensure the safety of their employees and the public and to support artists as far as possible.
In March 2020, the museums, libraries, spectacle rooms and other cultural institutions have been closed to new orders and their exposures, events and representations canceled or reported.
In response, intense efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Other recent and accelerated consequences of disease, the cancellation of religious services, major sport events and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and mode deployments.
The cinema industry also announced an interruption. Vatican announced that the celebrations of the Holy Seed in Rome, which took place last week of the Christian Pennsylvania period in the Caribbean, had been cancelled.
Many dioceans recommended that the older Christians stay their home instead of assisting the Sunday's mixes; some churches distribute their religious services at radio, online and online or television while others propose to practice their worship in “Drive-in”.
Instead of the Roman Catholic diocese of Rome, which closed its churches and chapels and the place of Saint Peter, who had seen from all his Christian peers, other religious institutions also canceled their services and limited public assemblies in churches, mosquitos, synagogues, temples and gardens.
The Minister of the Health of Iran announced the cancellation of the sales prayers in the areas touched by epidemia and the holy places were closed after, while Saudi Arabia prohibited the entry of foreign peers as well as its inhabitants to the holy sites of La Mecque and Medicine.
Pandemia has caused the most important interruption of the global sport calendar since the Second World War.
The most important sports events have been cancelled are reported, including the EUFA 2019-20 Championship League, the UK football Championship 2019-20, the EUFA Euro 2020, the NBA 2019-20 season and the LNH's 2019-20 season.
Epidemia was deteriorated by the 2020 Olympic Games Organization, which initially had to start on the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "replaned over 2020, but at the summer 2021." The casinos and other world games were closed and the poker turns were reported or canceled.
This has also been touched by many players to be online, and many online game sites have found a significant increase in their number of new registrations. The world of the spectacle has also been touched, with several music groups who suspended or canceled their concert tours.
Many large theatres, such as Broadway, also interrupted all their representations.
Some artists have been looking for ways to continue to create and share their work on the Internet in replacement of traditional direct representations, such as online and direct concerts or online festivals, so that artists will produce, disseminate and promote their work.
Online, many internet ms on the theme of the coronavirus promoted because many privileges humor and distraction face insecurity.
Since COVID-19 epidemia, a recruitment of prejudiciary, xenophobia and racism has been observed against Chinese and East Asian people, and against people from sensitive areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
In many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America, and in the Pacific region, there have been incidents related to fear, suspicion and hostity.
Reports from February (if the majority of cases were still limited to China) described racist feelings expressed in different groups around the world, according to which the Chineses granted the virus or have been justified.
Some African countries also found an increase in the feelings of anti-China.
Many of the inhabitants of Whan and Hubei have reported a reliable discrimination on their regional origin.
The Chinese were supported, online or outline, and against the inhabitants of the virus zones.
Following the progress of epidemic towards new sensitive countries, Italy, people of the first European country to suffer a serious COVID-19, could also face the suspicion and xenofobia. The citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea first signed the demands to ban China to enter their country to stop disease.
In Japan, the #ChineseDontComeToJapan has been angry on Twitter.
China, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States have reported an increase in racist insults and aggression.
The American President Donald Trump faced the criticism to have qualified the "China Virus", a term considered by its detractors as racist and anti-China.
In Ukraine, manifestants attacked buses transporting Ukrainians and foreign evacuations between Whan and Novi Sanzhary.
Students from the northeastern India, who shared a border with China, and students in large Indian cities would have had been linked to the epidemia of coronavirus.
The Chairman of the Western Bengale Unit of Bharatiya Janata Party Dilip Ghosh said that the Chineses had destroyed the nature and “is why God took his place on them”.
The comments were later condemned by the Chinese consulat in Kolkata, which is the qualified of “flasses”. In China, xenophobia and racism against the non-Chine were observed by pandemia, foreigners are described as “foreign waste” that would be “willing”.
Many newspapers paying them for all or part of their cover on the coronavirus.
Many scientists have available their scientific articles in connection with epidemia in free access.
Some scientists have chosen to spoil their results on prepublication servers such as bioRxiv.

The laboratory detection of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods for detecting virus and detecting antibodies in response to infection.
The presence of virus in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronavirus ARN.
This analysis is specifically designed to detect only SARS-CoV-2 ARN.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
The detection of anticorps (seerology) may be used both for diagnosis and population surveillance.
Anticorps tests show how many people have contracted the disease, including those whose symptoms were too slow to be declared or asymptomatic.
An accurate mortality rate of disease and collective immunity among the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Because of a limited detection, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of virus in its population in March 2020.
On March 23, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests carried out in each country.
This variability is likely to affect significantly the notified legitimacy rates, which may be significantly overwhelmed in certain countries.
Using the inverse transmission of a real-time polymeration reaction (rRT-PCR), the test may be carried out on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including the nasopharined equival or the sample of exploitation.
The results are generally available in a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test carried out from pharynged ecuvillons is only reliable during the first week of disease.
Then, the virus can disappear from the gorge while it continues to multiplicate in pulmones.
In persons tested during the second week, a sample can also be preleved in the deep breathingways by aspiration catathester, or a cracket (expectory) can be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by Charity in Berlin in January 2020 through an inverse transmission of a real-time polymeration reaction (RRT-PCR), which was the base of 250 000 Kit distributed by the World Health Organization (OMS).
The United Kingdom has also developed a test on 23 January 2020.The South Korean society Kogenbiotech developed a clinical quality kit of SARS-CoV-2 based on the PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
He detects the gene "E" shared by all bees-coronavirus, and the specific RdRp gene in the SARS-CoV-2.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive the urgency authorisation of the Chinese National Medical Administration for a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the CR. In the United States, the Heart Control and Prevention Centres (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC) distribute their diagnostic devices by RT-PCR in real time from the Coronavirus 2019 (2019-19) to public health workers through the International Resource.
Among the old versions of the test kits, a genetic test obtained unfinished results because of defectuous reactions, as well as a slow-scale testing goult in Atlanta CDC. Indeed, a average of less than 100 samples per day had been processed successfully throughout the month of February 2020.
The tests used by two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and only at this time federal and local laboratorys received authorisation to start detection.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use permit. The trade laboratories in the United States started the detection at the beginning of March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability at the national level of COVID-19 tests based on RT-PCR.
This diagnosis has also distributed COVID-19 tests at the national level on 9 March 2020.
No quantitative limitation has been announced. The collection and processing of samples must be performed in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the National Virhology and Biological Research Centre VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Monitor Service. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic had developed a COVID infection detection test. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA's authorisation for a test that could be carried out in large quantities at 3,5 hours, so that a device was performed at about 4 128 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted an emergency use permit (USA) to Abbott Laboratory for an Abbott system test. The FDA had previously granted a similar authorisation for Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepcity also received an EUFAD for a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test using the isothermal simplification technology of nuclear acids instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternative temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are now some 18 000 of these devices in the United States, and Abbott intends to intensify the manufacture to provide 50 000 tests per day. A test using a monoclonal antibodies which is specifically linked to the protein of nucleocapid (protein N) of the new coronavirus is in the development in Taiwan, in hope that it can provide results in 15 to 20 minutes, as a fast influenza test.
An bibliographic study of March 2020 concluded that “Lunghearted radiographies have a low diagnostic value in the first towns, while the results of the TDM [tomodensitometria] may be concluded even before the appearance of symptoms”.
Some of the typical symptoms on TDM are typical options in view of multi-lobal bilateral depolis with a device, asymmetric and post-section distribution.
A sub-plural predominance, a "clazy paving" and a consolidation are developed as a result of disease.
A study compared to the TDC to Whan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, suggested that TDM is significantly sensitive than the PCR, whereas less specific, several of its image results associated with other pneumonies and diseases.
In March 2020, the American Radiology College recommends that "TPM is not used for detection or as a first line test to diagnose COVID-19". In March 2020, the CDC recommended the GDP for initial detection.
The production of anticorps, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to infection.
These may be used to detect infection in persons from about 7 days after symptoms appear, to determine immunity and population surveillance.The tests may be performed in central laboratorys (TLC) or by testing of the patient's cheese (point-of-care testing, PoCT).
The automatised systems of many clinical laboratorys are able to achieve these analysis, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For the TLC, one single device blood sample is generally used, although serial samples can be used to follow immunity response.
For the PoCT, one single blood sample is generally preleved by cutting point.
In the difference of PCR methods, no extraction step is required before the analysis was analyzed. On 26 March 2020, FDA has appointed 29 entities that had duely informed the Agency and, therefore, can now distribute their anti-corps detection tests.
On April 7, 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under an emergency use permit.Fin March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorisations for their test kits, capable of detecting IgG and IgA anti-virus in blood samples.
Detection capacity is several hundreds of samples in a few hours, which is quite faster than the virus ARN PCR test.
The antibodies are generally detected 14 days after the beginning of the infection.Deb April, the United Kingdom realized that no anti-corps test kits purchased by the country was enough to use.
Hong Kong has established a plan in which the suspect cases can remain at their home, “the emergency service will provide to the patient a sample tube”, patients who are inflicting it and then receive the result of the test.The British NHS announced that it carries a pilot project to test cases of suspects at home, which eliminates the risk that a patient is not infected by other people by making an hospital or need to defeat an ambulance in the case of use.Dens the framework of COV-19 drive for suspect cases, a precautional health risk in a precautional precautional precautional precaution.
The “Drive” centres allowed South Korea to achieve one of the fastest and exhaustive detections in the world. In Germany, the National Medical Association of Compulsory Diseases Declared on 2 March that it had the ability to perform some 12 000 emergency tests a day, and 10 700 patients had been tested during the previous week.
The costs are supported by disease insurance when testing is required by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160 000 tests per week.
On March 19, Drive tests were available in several large cities.
On 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, since only positive results are declared.
A first laboratory study revealed that at the 12/2020 calendar week, a total of 483 295 samples were tested until the week 12/2020 and that 33 491 samples (6,9%) had a positive result for the SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers of the Technion and the Hospital Rambam developed and tested a method of analysis of 64 patients, collecting the samples and not resulting in the detection that if the channel combined is positive. Whan, an improved laboratory of 2 000 meters of carredoned 2000 meters of cards can be used by the French "Furone of 5000" and "Furone of the French" of the "Fucians" was a transitor.
By its 5-day construction by Wang Jian, the BGI founder, the modalization showed that the cases in the Hubei province would have been 47 per cent higher and that the costs corresponding to the quartery would have doubled without this detection capacity.
The Whan laboratory was quickly followed by Huo-Yan laboratorys in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai in 12 Chinese cities in total.
On 4 March 2020, the total daily capacity was 50 000 tests per day.Origami Assays has been published to test up to 1 122 samples of patients for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced models can be implemented in small laboratorys without liquid manipulator robots.
In March, the insufficient reacting pensions and quantities have become a slow-scale for the detection of mass in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States.
The situation has been understood by some authors to consider sample preparation protocols that implies to shoot samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release ARN genoms to continue detection. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates were now the most important part of its population by the Coronavirus, and they were able to intensify the detection to achieve the majority of the population.
These results have been achieved by combination of the ability to conduct drives and purchase a high-free laboratory at the population level at Group 42 and BGI (based on their emergency detection laboratory in China).
In 14 days, the laboratory is able to conduct tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory of this capacity to be operational outside China.
Different target test forms were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula to produce kits sent to countries with low income, not the resources necessary to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020, and the Protocol developed by the United States Diseases Control Centres was not published only on 28 January, delaying the availability of tests in the United States. China and the United States had problems at the level of fiability of testing kids at the beginning of epidemia, and these countries, as well as Australia, had not been able to provide sufficient kits to respond to the request and recommendations for the detection of health specialists.
However, specialists point out that the great availability of tests in South Korea has contributed to reduce the propagation of the new coronavirus.
The detection capacity, mainly in private sector laboratorys, has been strengthened in several years by the South Korean Government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization recommended the intensification of the detection programs as a better way to reinforce the advanced COVID pandemic.The strong demand of tests due to the broad dissemination of the virus has resulted in the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in the United States private laboratorys and the reserves of cowl and chemical reactions have been broken.
In March 2020, China reported problems related to the reliability of its test kits.
In the United States, CDC's test kits presented “defaults” and then the government removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented private tests.Island purchased test kits at the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd but found that the results were not reliable.
The company explained that the wrong results could be linked to the inability to collect samples or to correctly use kits.
The Spanish Ministry stated that he will remove the wrong results and replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits purchased to China by the Czech Republic provided false results. Slovakia purchased in China 1,2 million tests that have been disabled.
The first minister Matovič suggested to go to Danube. Atheist Kara from the Turkish Health Ministry stated that the test kits that Turkey had purchased in China had a “high error rate” and that it did not use them. The United Kingdom buyed 3,5 million test kits in China but announced that they were not useful.
The detection, followed by the quarter of those who obtain a positive result and the trace of persons in contact with SARS-CoV-2, has resulted in positive results.
For researchers working in the Italian city of Vó, the place of the first death linked to COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two series of tests at the total population of about 3,400 people, around 10 days of interval.
About half of the people obtaining a positive result did not present symptoms, and all the cases found were in quarentaine.
With the limitation of movements in the common, this measure completely eliminated new infections.
With the aggressive trace of contacts, the restrictions of incoming travels, the detection and the quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemia in Singapore has progressed very quickly than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions, such as the forced closure of restaurants and sales in detail.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore began to advise the residents to stay home on March 28, but the schools took place at the time scheduled at the end of the holidays on March 23.
A number of other countries also managed pandemics through aggressive contact trace, income travel restrictions, detection and quarterness, but with less aggressive convictions such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries who have performed the most tests, compared to the number of deaths, have much lower letality rates, probably because these countries are more able to detect people only low or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without analysis and whose national laboratorys have only a limited experience of COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and ten negative samples of COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratorys for confirming tests.
Among 16 reference laboratorys, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the "Positive in % tests" column depends on the national detection policy.
A country who tests that the hospital granted persons will have a positive value in % of higher tests than a country which tests the entire citizens, which present or not symptoms, is the same.
The lavage of hands, also called the hands, corresponds to the fact that they clean their hands to remove salts, grass, micro-organismes or other unwanted substances.
The fact of being systematically laid hands with saving to some "clear moments" of the day prevents the propagation of many diseases, such as diarrey and cholera, which are transmitted by gold-feceal way.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as influenza or rhythm, for example, by stopping the hands before touching the eyes, nausea or mouth (e.g. mournings).
It is important to lay the hands in the savings to five key moments of the day: before and after the defect, after cleaning the fees of a baby or changed its beds, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling of the flesh, fish or crude fleet.
If you don't have water or saving under your hand, you can lay your hands to shine it. The World Health Organization recommends to lay your hands:
prior, during and after the preparation;
prior and after being occupied by a sick person;
after changed the beds of a baby or cleaned a child who went to the toilets;
after being shocked or sit down/term;
after having touched a animal, food for animals or wastes;
Hygiene of medical hands refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
The fact that your hands are laxed before administration of medicines or medical care may prevent or reduce disease propagation.
The main medical goal for the lavage of hands is to eliminate pathogenic agents (bacteria, virus or other microorgans that may cause diseases) and chemical products that may be harmful or cause diseases.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but also for the large public.
The lavage of the hands has many benefits for health, including the reduction in the propagation of grip, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; prevention of infective causes of diarrey; reducing respiratory infections;
as well as the reduction of child mortality rate in household accommodations.
According to an study carried out in 2013, the improvement of hand hygiene practices could lead to low improvement in children’s growth in less than five years.
In developing countries, children ' s mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrey may be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as the lavage of hands to savan.
This simple practice may reduce the mortality rate related to these diseases by about 50 %.
The establishment of action to promote the lavage of hands could reduce about a third of the episodes of diarrey, a number comparable to that obtained by providing potable water in low income regions.
The lacquering hands allows to reduce diagnostic episodes of 48% and is the most effective and less costful means of preventing the diagnosis and acute respiratory infections (IRA). It is an act that should be automatically conducted in homes, schools and communities of the whole world.
The pneumonia, one of the main IRA, is the first cause of mortality in children under five years of age, which makes about 1,8 million victims per year.
Similarly, diarrey and pneumonia lead to the death of about 3,5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, the habit of taking the hands with sweat before you eat and after being moved to the toilets can save more than any vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce nearly half the deaths of diarrhee and a fourth degree of imputable diseases to acute respiratory infections.
The lavage of hands is generally associated with other health measures under water, sanitation and hygienic programmes (WASH).
The lavage of the hands also protects the impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
The low-scale effect, the frequencies lavage of hands can skin up by causeing a cut-off skin.
A 2012 Danish study revealed that excessive lavage of hands could lead to eczema or dematite at the level of hands, characterized by a squamed skin and demangeous skin, and especially frequent in health workers.
The too frequent lavage of hands is also considered as one of the symptoms of the compulsory obsessional problem (TOC).
It is important to lay the hands in the savings to five key moments of the day to reduce the oro-phaleal transmission of diseases: before and after using the toilets (miction, defection), after cleaning the fees of a baby (or changed its beds), before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling of meat, fish or crude flight.
The hands should also be laid correctly for preventing the transmission of diseases, including before and after treatment of a cut or blessure, after having been long-term, sit or shocked, after touching animals or handling distances and after touching horses.
In many countries, the level of cleaning of hands is low.
According to an investigation carried out in 2015 at 54 countries and with the main hygiène, 38.7% of the households were with savans. A study carried out in 2014 showed that it was the highest rate in Saudi Arabia (97%), the United States was in the medium of table (77%) and China showed the lowest rate (23%). Today, there are several methods to evolving the behaviors and democratize the use of the savings for the use of the mains at the key moments of the day.
For example, the Ministry of Education of Philippine has implemented a “primical health care program” in order to promote children's health and education.
The disappearing two times a year, associated with daily lavage of hands in the savan and daily brossage of dental with fluored dentists, is in the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
To better eliminate the micro organisms present on the skin, it is necessary to add skins or detergents to water.
The main action of knowledge and detergence is to reduce obstacles to solution and to increase solution.
The only water is not an effective cleaner for skin as the lipides and proteins, which are organic materials of the earth, are difficultly solved in the water.
However, a adequate water debit facilitates cleaning.
The solid savine, due to its reuseable nature, can refer to previous use bacteria.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated salt concluded that the transfer was unlikely because bacteria are raised with museum.
The Diseases Control and Prevention Centre (CDC) also indicates that "automotive liquid salt distributors are preferable".
Antibacteria has been strongly recommended to the concerned persons of their health status.
There is no evidence that suggest that the use of recommended anti-septics or desinfects allows to target antibiotics in nature.
However, antibacteria knows contain current antibacteria agents such as triclosan, with many shoes of organs.
Therefore, even if antibiotic skins are not the fruit of antibaterian skins, these lasts could not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the tensioactive and skin protection agent, the most complex forms can contain acids (actic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) to regulate the pH, benzoic acid, with an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloa, vitamins, mental, extracts of plants), a rigorous analysis of the Oregon University of Public Health has indicated that the ordinary systems were effective as well as the antibactrics used for individuals and triangles, to prevente diseases and the batteries of main diseases.
The warm water used to laugh the hands is not sufficiently warm to kill bacteria.
The bacteria is much more faster than the body temperature (37 °C).
However, the tea and saving water is more effective than the cold and saving water to eliminate natural oils of salt and bacteria.
But in contrast to the popularity, scientific studies showed that the use of tea water was not contributed to reduce microbian burden on the hands.
A desinfectant or an antiseptic for hands is a non-water hand hygiene product.
At the end of the 1990s and at the beginning of the 21th century, hygienic products of non-water hands (which called hydrocole solutions, anti-septic solutions for hands or desinfects for hands) began to be popularized.
Most are formulated on the basis of isopropyllic alcohol or ethanol associated with a divided agent such as carbon (acrylic acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a heat, or to a humidant such as glycerine, to obtain liquid or museum for a greater use facility and reduce the effect of alcohol.
Diluted hydrogen peroxide increases the antimicrobial activity.The desinfectants for hands containing at least 60-95% alcohol are effectively eliminated by the germs.
Alcohol solutions kill bacteria, multiresistant bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and some virus (including HIV, herpes, VRS, rhinovirus, vaccine, grip and hepatitis), and champions.
Hydro-alcool solutions containing 70% of alcohol are 99.97% (reducing 3,5%, log equivalent to 35 decibels) of bacteria present in the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.99% to 99.999% (reducing 4 to 5 log) of bacteria present on 1 minutes after the application.The desinfects for hands are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some virus.
The hydro-alcohol solutions are almost inefficient against norovirus (or Norwalk), the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis. A sufficient amount of desinfecting for hands or hydro-alcolic solution must be used to move or cover the two hands.
The pam and two of the hands should be crossed, as well as the interruptions between the dogs and the nails for about 30 seconds, until the liquid, the museum or the seed glass.
The American Centre for Control and Prevention of Diseases recommends the lavage of hands, rather than the use of hydrocarbon solutions, especially when the hands are visiblely salt.
The increased use of these products is due to their use facility and rapid elimination activities of microorganismes; however, they do not need to replace a suitable hand lavage if you don't have water and saving in hands.
The frequency use of hydro-alcohol solutions may result in a cut-off disappearing if the formula is not strengthened by emolytics and/or skin hydroatric agents.
The adverse effect of alcohol may be reduced or eliminated by adding to gluycerine and/or other emolyans to the formula.
In clinical trials, the hydro-alcohol solutions containing emolynts have undergone netly less irritation and cut-up sequence than antimicrobial detergents.
The allergical contact demativity, contact urtic or hypersensibility to alcohol or additives present in alcoholic solutions are rare.
The fact that hydro-alcohol solutions are less tending to cause irritating contact demates made them more attractive than the lavage of hands in water and saving.
In spite of their effectiveness, non-water products do not eliminate organic materials on the hands, but only desinfect them.
This is why desinfects for hands are not so effective as saving and water to avoid propagation of many pathogenic agents, since these are still on the hands.
The efficiency of alcoholless hands depends strongly on ingredients and forms, and has always been clearly lower than alcohol and alcohol desinfectants.
More recently, the forms used by benzalconic chlorure have presented a sustainable and cumulative antimicrobial activity after the application, at the difference in alcohol, which has been at times after repeated use, probably due to progressive progressive reactions.
In low income populations, many are those who do not have the way to purchase the savings, instead of using the cedar or the earth.
The cedar or earth can be more effective than the water only, but less than they save it.
If the earth or cedar is contaminated by microorganismes, it may increase the propagation of diseases instead of frozening it.
Instead of savine, the cedar is also a desinfective agent because, in contact with water, it forms an alcaline solution.
WHO recommends cedar or sand as an alternative when it is not available.
The United States Centre for the Control and Prevention of Diseases recommends that the hands are correctly laid to prevent the transmission of diseases, as follows:
Move your hands with the current water tea or cold.
The current water is recommended because of the risk of contamination of water points, while water temperature seems not to be different).
Make a generous amount of savon on the hands by frozen them against the other, without forgetting the dust of the hands, between the teeth and under the nails.
Savine removes the skin germes, and studies show that people tend to lay their hands more carefully when they use the savings with the water.
Frotter for at least 20 seconds.
The frotter action is created from the flight, which helps to eliminate the skin grums, and frozen more longer to remove more germes.
Bring too much to the current water.
The ring in a swimming water basin can lead to the recovery of the hands.
Search with a own or free air service.
Mood and humid hands are easier recognised.The most often forgotten areas are the pocket, the bridge, the spaces between the dogs and the bottom of the nails.
The artificial eggs and the scattered sheets can hide microorgans.
A hidrating lotion is often recommended to avoid having seed hands; skin seed seeds promotes the appearance of coated lesions that can increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to lavage the hands when the robinet water and/or savan is not available, for example, to cover the water of a slow or swimming vessel and/or use the ceder if necessary in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (e.g. in schools or rural areas of developing countries), there are solutions to economize the water, such as “type-taps” and other economic options.
A tip-tap is a simple technology that uses a suspended cross using a cord, and a pedale that allows to save a small amount of water on the hands and a saving pan.
The effective thickness of hands is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to switch the hands into the public toilets is being discussed.
More research suggests that paper service is much more hygienical than electric sechs than often found in the toilets.
In 2008, a study financed by the Swiss Paper industry, European Tissue Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster (Londres), to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper serviettes, warm air-sweet-sweet-sweets and modern air-sweets.
After lavaging and shocking hands at warm air, it was shown that the total number of bacteria increased in 194 per cent on the dog pulp and 254 per cent on the palms.
A average increase in the total number of bacteria on dentists of 42 per cent and 15 per cent of the palms.
After the lavage and slaughter of hands with a paper service, the total number of bacteria was reduced by 76 per cent in average on the dog pulp and up to 77 per cent on the palms. The scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was an increased contamination potential with other tube users and the environment of the toilets according to each seat method.
The air sequencies, which suffers from the air outside of the device at an advertised speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is able to pull the hands and device microorgans, and may contain other tubes users, as well as the tubes environment in a metro walking up to 2 m.
The use of a warm air seed allows the distribution of microorgans to a maximum distance of 0.25 meters of sech-made.
Paper services showed that there was no significant propagation of microorganisms, and in 2005, in a study conducted by the TUDV Product and Environment, various hand-set-up methods were evaluated.
Following the hands, the following variations of the bacterial number were observed:
There are many different sech-room manufacturers, and the seach-rooms have been compared to the sequence by using paper serviettes.
The lavage of hands with desinfect rings is a alternative solution during the movement, in the absence of salt and water.
Hydrocarbonal solutions must contain at least 60 % of alcohol.
The lavage of hands in medical environment was well obliged after the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis found its effectiveness (1846) to prevent hospital diseases.
There are electronic devices that escape reminders when hospital personnel forgot to lay the hands.
A study revealed that their use was a decrease in infection rate.
The medical lavage of the hands must last at least 15 seconds by using a generous quantity of salt and water or glass to move and frozen each part of the hands.
The hands must be flewed against each other by passing between the dogs.
In the case of residues under the sheets, it is possible to use a powder brown to remove them.
As the helms present in the water are likely to stay on the hands, it is important to swim well and swim with a own service.
After the sending, the paper servicing should be used to close the robin (and open the output door if appropriate).
This allows to avoid recovering the hands on the surface contact.
The goal of hand lavaging in health structures is to remove pathogen microorgans (hermes) and to avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the inadequate hand cleaning rate remains inacceptable in most medical institutions, a large number of doctors and nurses that are often forgotten to lay their hands before touching their patients, which promotes the transmission of microorganisms.
According to a study, the fact that the hands are laxed correctly and other simple procedures may reduce 66 per cent of the blood infection rates related to cathéters. The World Health Organization has published a brochure that describes the standard procedure to be monitored and frozen the hands in the field of health.
The draft guidelines on the Hygiene established by the Organization may also be consulted on the website to collect the comments of the internal.
A relevant analysis was carried out by Whitby and al.
Trade devices may measure and certify hand hygiene, if respect for the regulation is extended.
The World Health Organization defines “5 indications” relating to the hygiène of hands:
After an exposure to blood/a biological liquid;
before a aseptic geste; and
After have been contacted with the patient. The fact that you add anti-septic chemicals to savon (as "medium" or "anti-microbians"), you see the hand lavage agent an action to destroy germs.
For "frotter" hands for a surgical operation, it is necessary to have a robine that can be opened and closed and closed without touching it with hands, a product of clorhexide or iode lavage based on clorhexin or steel servicing to seal the hands after wearing the hands, a frozen browl to frozen and other instrument for frozens underlines.
All skins must be removed.
In the context of this procedure, hands and fronts should be laid down up to the coast, generally for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to shut your hands for 10 minutes.
When the ring, it must be avoided that water on the fronts goes up to the hands.
Once the hands are laid, hands should be sit down by a steel line and a surgical kitchen.
In order to reduce the propagation of germs, it is preferable to lay hands or use an antiseptic for the hands before and after being occupied by a sick person.
With regard to the control of stafylocotic infections in hospitals, the main benefits of the lavage were obtained during the first 20% of the lavage, and there were only a few additional benefits to increase the frequency of hand lavage over 35%.
In comparison with the lavage of hands carried out with a normal savine carried out with an antibacterial savine, the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food is more than three times higher, and in comparison with the cleaning of hands with an alcohol based solution and the lavage of hands with an antibacterial salt during a mean period of 30 seconds, it is observed that the first bacterial contamination of 26% in relation to the second.
But saving and water are more efficient than alcohol-based products to reduce the influenza virus A (H1N1) and the difficult Clostridium spots on the hands. To improve the hygiène of hands in health care institutions, it is possible, in particular, to train the hand lavage personnel, to put more alcohol based products to the disposal of it and to give it written and verbal reminders to this subject.
More research are needed to discover what the most effective interventions in different health structures are.
In developing countries, it is considered that the lavage of hands in the savan is a little costful and essential tool to maintain health, or to food properly.
However, due to the lack of reliable water points, saving or installations to lavage hands at home, school and workplace, it is difficult to establish universal hand hygiene habits.
For example, in the largest part of rural Africa, it is rarely to find routines to lay the hands near the private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options to build hand lavage stations.
However, low hand lavage rates may also be imputable to thin habits, rather than to a lack of salt or water.
The fact of promoting the lavage of hands in salvation and conducting sensibilisation activities in this regard may affect political decisions, know the benefits related to this practice and lead to a long-term behavior change in the population.
In order to enhance this approach, follow-up and evaluation activities must be carried out.
A systematic review of 70 studies showed that local approaches are effective to increase the main lavage rate in the countries of low and intermediary, and that social marketing campaigns are less effective, and in terms of promoting the lavage in schools, the example of the " Approximate three stars " of UNICEF, which encourages schools to take simple and costful measures to ensure that students are laid down with savine, while respecting other hygiene rules.
When the minimum standards are reached, schools can pass from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand lavage stations can be included in hand higiene campaigns that are conducted in order to reduce child diseases and mortality.
The World Day of Hands is another example of awareness campaign that aims to promote the development of conduct.
Many studies have examined the overall cost-efficient report of the lavage of hands in developing countries in comparison with the number of healthy life years (e.g. DALY dismissed).
However, a magazine suggests that the promotion of the lavage of hands in the savan is quite more rent than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of the lavage of hands for human health, especially for persons in situation of vulnerability, such as mothers who come to accommodate or soldiers in hospitals, was identified for the first time in the middle of the 19th century by two publishers of the hand hygiène: the Hungary Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the modern nursing founder.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were due to the fetidian odors called mysm.
In the 1980s, food epidemias and niocomial infections led the United States Centres to control and prevent diseases to promote their hand hygiene as an essential means to prevent infection.
The appearance of the sugar grip in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to a higher conscience in many countries about the need to lay hands with salt to prejudice against these infected diseases.
For example, in Germany shows the “good hand lavage techniques” were placed next to the ships in the public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports.
The expression "wear the hands" refers to the refusal of a person to take the responsibility or to be compliant of something.
It is made from a Bible verses of Matthew, in which Ponce Pilate lacks the hands of the decision to cross Jesus Christ, but this expression has been widely expanded in certain English communities.
In Macbeth, from Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth undertakes the hands into a compulsory way to try to clean a imaginative tache, symbolized by her wrong conscience towards the crimes she made and urged her husband to do.
It was also noted that, after being reminded of having acts contrary to ethical or considered to do so, some have tended to lay their hands more often than others and to grant more value to the hand lavage devices.
Furthermore, those who are allowed to lay their hands after these thoughts are less strict to deliver to other compensatory measures of “purification”, such as the beneficiary.
Some religions require the lavage of hands for both hygienical and symbolic purposes. The symbolic lavage of hands, which consists of the use of water and not saving to lavail hands, is part of the rituals of hands imposed in many religions, including the baaiism and the hinduusm, the implantation (tevilah) and the ritual abuse of hands (Netilat Yadayim) in the Jewishism, the lavabo in Christianism and wudula in the Islam. The religions also prescribe the invasion of hands to the final hygienical, after certain actions.
According to Hinduism, Jewishism and Islam, it is obliged to lay the hands after being gone to the toilets.
Similarly, hindousism, bouddhism, cykhism, Jewishism and Islam requires to lay the hands before and after each feed.
COVID risk controls on workplace
COVID-19 risk controls are designed to implement health and safety methodologys for risk control in the prevention of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriate risk controls on the workplace vary according to the workplace and tasks, based on an evaluation of the risks of exposure sources, the severeness of disease in the community and individual risk factors of workers that can be vulnerable to an infection by COVID-19.
According to the Operational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, the lowest risk of exposure jobs have a minimum professional contact with the public and other collaborators. In this case, only basic prevention measures are recommended, including hands, encouraging workers to stay in the home if they are sick, breathing label, and maintaining cleaning and desinfection of the labour environment.
Medium-exposure jobs includes the need for frequent or close contacts with people without COVID-19 suspected or known, but which can be infected because of an existing Community transmission or international travel.
This includes employees in contact with the large public, in particular in schools, high-depth population work environments and some large-scale details.
The risk controls in this group, including the basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation of high-efficient air filters, hygienic vitros and the disposal of individual protection equipment in case of meeting with a person reached by COVID-19.
The OSHA considers health and funeral workers exposed to persons with a suspected or known COVID-19, which is a high risk of exposure, which is a very high risk if they perform aircraft procedures or shoots or samples of persons with suspected or known COVID-19.
The risk controls for these workers include technical controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and individual protection equipment adapted to the task.
COVID-19 epidemias may have several effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent because they are ill, they must take care of others or fear a possible exposure.
Trade models can change both in the goods requested as well as in the means of acquiring them (e.g. their courses outside point hours or use delivery or drive services).
Finally, the expedition of articles from severe geographical regions affected by COVID-19 may be interrupted. A plan of preparation and response to infectious diseases can be used as a guide for protection measures.
Plans take into account risk levels associated with different workplaces and tasks, including exposure sources, risk factors related to the family and Community context and individual risk factors of workers such as advanced age or chronic pathology.
They also forgot the controls required to address these risks and emergency plans for situations that may be presented after epidemics.
The preparation and response plans to infected diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
Epidemia response goals include the reduction of transmission among staff, the protection of higher risk of medical complications, the maintenance of commercial operations and the reduction of unwanted effects on other entities of their supply chain.
The safety of disease in the community where the company is located is influenced by the answers applied.
Risk control heerage forms a comprehensive framework for health and safety in work in order to group risk controls by efficiency.
If COVID-19 risks cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are technical controls, monitoring administrative controls and individual protection equipment.
Technical controls include isolating employees of risks related to workers without having to stand on the behaviour of workers, which can be the most economic solution to implement.
Administrative controls designate the changes in policy or working procedures that require action from the employee or employer.
The individual protection equipment (EPI) is considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but may contribute to preventing certain exposures.
All types of EPI should be selected according to the risk for the worker, correctly adapted according to the needs (e.g., respiratory masks), correct and systematically, inspected regularly, entered and replaced according to the needs, and correctly removed, cleaned, and stored or put into the rebut to avoid any contamination.
According to the United States Occupational Security and Health Administration (OSHA), exposure jobs have a minimum professional contact with the public and other partners.
The basic prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include the lavage of the frequent and minute hands, the encouragement of workers to stay at home if they are sick, the breathing label, including covering the mouth and the narrowing and snake, providing swifts and powders, teletracking or working hours, dissuasion of the tools and other equipment, and maintenance of the cleaning and the desinfect of the labour environment.
The identification and rapid isolation of potentially infected persons represent a crucial step in the protection of workers, customers, visitors and others on a workplace.
The Centres for Control and Prevention of Diseases (CDC) in the United States recommend to employees who are present with acute respiratory symptoms to stay at home until they are not present for fiber, fever signs or any other symptom since at least 24 hours without use of feblifuges or other drugs in the symptoms. They also recommend to apply flexible disease congession policies, to allow employees to stay home to provide care for a family member and to inform the employees of these policies.
According to the OSHA, people who need a frequent or close contact, at least six feet (1.8 m), of people without COVID-19 suspected or known, but can be infected by SARS-CoV-2 because of a Community transmission around the company or because the person recently traveled a international journey in a region with a republic transmission of COVI-19.
This includes the technical controls for this group and the higher risk include the installation of high-efficient air filters, the increase in the ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plasma visions and the installation of a drive window for the client service. The administrative controls for this group and those who are higher risks to increase the ventilation rates of workers to stay in the house, the location of meetings by persons in communications, the age of the ancestors of the older age of the age age of the age of COWs, the age age of age ancesters of the older age in the oldest age age, the age age of the age age of the age of the older age of the age of the older age of the age of the old age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the ages of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age of the agesss of the ages of the ages of the age age agess of the ages of the age ages of the age ages of the ages of the ages of the ages of the ages of the ages of the ages of the ages of the agesss of the ages
Employees of this group of risks have random need to use respiratory masks.
If a person is sick on a flight, the appropriate controls for the protection of workers and other passengers include the following measures: separating the disease from the other by a distance of 6 feet, designating a staff member to take care of the sick and offering a protective mask to the sick or requesting to cover the mouth and narrow when he goes or ever.
The chain equipment shall take jetable medications when he cares for a sick passenger or touchs organic liquids or surfaces potentially contaminated and, if possible, additional individual protection equipment if the sick passenger is present in the fiber, a continuing towards or respiratory difficulties.
Gants and other jetting items must be put in a sack for dangerous biological wastes and contained surfaces should be cleaned and desinfected after. For commercial navigation, including cruise vessels and other passenger ships, the risk controls include the travel report in the case of disease, the auto-isolation and immediate information of the board medical centre if it is developed a fiber or other symptoms once on board.
Ideally, a medical monitoring should have been carried out in the chain of the isolated person. For schools and child guards, CDCs recommend a short-term closure for cleaning and desinfection if a infected person has become in a school building, independently of the Community propagation.
In the case of minimum Community transmission, social distance strategies may be implemented, such as cancellation of pedagogical outputs, assemblies and other important assemblies such as physical or chorale education courses or cantine feeding, increased space between offices, scaling the arrival and outcome hours, reduceing non-essential visitors and using separate nurse for children presenting gripped symptoms.
In the case of important transmission in the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, a long-term school vacation can be considered. For the order forces that carry out daily routine activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by CDCs.
Order forces agents who have to contact people with COVID-19 suspected or confirmed must follow the same directives as the ambulances, including the port of adequate individual protection equipment.
In cases of contact in arrest, employees must clean and desinfect their equipment and service cenelling before reuse by means of a ringet or a detergent spray to house and follow standard confinance and establishment of the EPIs used, as well as the confinement and landing of clothing.
OSHA considers some health and funeral workers as high or very high risks of exposure.
High risk of exposure jobs include health care, support, laboratory and medical transport workers that are exposed to patients with suspected or known COVID-19 patients.
They become very high-risk exhibition workers if they perform aerosols or plotting or manipulation of patients with suspected or known COVID-19 testing procedures.
Aerosol procedures include invasion, tube induction procedures, bronchoscopies, certain dent reviews and procedures or invasive sampling of samples.
The high risk of exposure work includes workers in the preparation of persons with COVID-19 suspected or known at the time of their death; they apply to a very high risk of exposure if they practice an autopsie. Additional technical controls of these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with suspected or known COVID-19 patients, including during the implementation of aircraft procedures.
A negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health and funeral environments.
The samples should be handled using biological security precautions of level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends to separate patients in separate COVID-assisting chambers. In addition to other EPIs, the OSHA recommends respiratory masks for persons who work less than 6 feet of patients with suspected or known infection by SARS-CoV-2 and for aircraft procedures.
In the United States, respiratory N95 filter masks, approved by NIOSH or higher, should be used in the context of a complete and written respiratory protection program including adjustment, training and medical reviews.
Other types of respiratory mass may ensure higher protection and better comfort of the worker. WHO does not recommend combinations because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted by organic liquids.
WHO recommends the port of a surgical mask only by the detection staff at the entry point.
For those who collect respiratory samples, take support or transport of COVID-19 patients in the absence of aircraft procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective lights or facial screens, a brown and gants.
In the case of aerosol procedure, the chirurgic mask is replaced by a respiratory mask N95 or FFP2.
Since the global EPI supply is insufficient, WHO recommends to limit the need for EPI by telemedication, physical barriers, such as transparent windows, to limit access to a local employed by COVID-19 to persons directly involved in their care, the use of EPIs required to specifically task, the continuing use of the same respiratory mask without retiring it to support several patients with the same diagnostic, monitoring and coordination of the supply chain and the dissuasion of the use of massacres for the asymptomatic individuals.

ENVOY DATE/HOur : 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENCE : CC0 : No reserved right
We find this month in an exceptional situation.
COVID-19 epidemia is a clear demonstration of our global human interconnection and of the responsibilities we have to do with each other.
His challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best response is on the type of empathy, cooperation and Community strengthening at the world level, which is in the heart of this organization.
The careery and the kindness we have observed among all our colleagues in the emails, the calls and the instant conversations are a marvelous witness of the unbelievable human beings with which we have the opportunity to work.
I couldn't be more grateful and proud to all of you among my colleagues.
Last week, someone made me a part of his gratitude to our work.
This person recalled me how important it is for the world to be able to consult Wikipedia at the current time, and the strong symbol that represents the fact that this essential resources remain online and available to all.
This is possible thanks to your work, which you maintain the operational websites, to pay our colleagues or to the security of our communities.
The world needs information provided by Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a moment where not only what we do, but also how we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
As a result of the importance of this mission and the role you play on it, we will process resulting adjustments in the way we work together from the next week.
Adjustments of our work and time jobs
As Robyn mentioned above, the team was meeting last night to discuss our approach and our job of time in the days and months to come.
During this conversation, we considered what would be an appropriate response to the situation we face and the best way to ensure the organisation's sustainability during that period.
We first tried to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to take back, don't worry.
All staff members, subtractors and contractors:
Our daily work time goal will be around 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week to new order.
We will not declare holiday day: if you are able to ensure more normal working hours, you may be useful for the mission.
However, the world is unpredictable at the current time, and if you need to take care of your neighbors, to cut courses or to consult a doctor, your welfare is our priority.
We're not watching your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
That should go without saying, but we'll say it.
No illness or payment stop required: Prevent your superior and help your team review time calendars and jobs to ensure that the main work areas are covered.
(If you are positively diagnosed in COVID-19, please prevent Bryan of the T&amp;C Division to help you and ensure that your situation receives the necessary attention of the direction).
The temporary staff will be completely paid.
We have already announced it, and we will reiterate our commitment to respect our responsibilities to our sub-tractors and colleagues of temporary staff.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of its normal working hours carried out in normal conditions.
That's if you're sick and in the ability to work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people use the work as a way to evacuate their stress in the world that is around us.
What we are doing can be incredibly gratifying, especially in periods like that.
Once again, the goal is to keep you.
We simply ask you to communicate with your superior, so that we know what we expect and can take the necessary provisions.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are some things that we must continue to do.
SRE teams, Ops RH, Confiance & amp; Security and fund collection (including other) carry out an essential work that might need for strengthening.
We will start a process with all departments to assess the current objectives and focus on supporting the fundamental tasks for our mission.
There is enough work for each of us, and we will simply focus on the most essential projects.
Ralentir now won't make it bad later.
We don't intend to "work more than two times to ratify the lost time" when pandemia will pass.
We will not ask you to make additional hours to comply with unrealistic deadlines now.
We recognize that the circumstances have changed, and we will try to establish new objectives and so far as possible.
What is the planning of the APP?
In order to adapt us to our new reality and the daily worktime objectives, we are expecting to adjust the timetable for the delivery of our annual plan 2020-2021.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which provides more time to establish a budget to allow employees to focus on the essential work, take care of them and their neighbouring to those who need or want to see their reduced working time in the coming weeks.
This prolongation of periods significantly reduces the labour and pressure of the current planning in all the organizations.
We will present our proposal to the Council in the next week, and we will inform the delegates and teams of the next steps as confirmed.
Thank you for the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Situation, exposure and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues based in San Francisco could have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, by exceeding prudence, we called a antiviral cleaning team to desinfect all the surfaces of the San Francisco Bureau.
They used an anti-viral solution of hospital quality to desinfect all surfaces, as well as the entry hall and the ascensor boxes leading to our floor.
The building has requiring its own protocol to deal with diligence that uses products that ensure the safety of its localists.
We are convinced that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return.
Our Washington DC office is located in a site of WeWork, who shared with us and all the staff members based on its COVID-19 protocol.
Since last week, our Washington DC office has adopted a completely distance configuration in accordance with San Francisco's advice.
As we know some of our colleagues established in New York, we also discussed the idea of loving a local in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue, but they could be gathered.
Some of our colleagues work at distance for the first time.
Our distance work colleagues have conscious that adjustment can be difficult and wished to offer you a few advice:
Reduce the duration of meetings at meetings of one or two hours.
If longer meetings are needed, consider to divide them a few days.
Determine the meeting clearly, have a agenda and send the documentation forward.
Make the standard, thanks to tools such as Google Docs and Zoom, to encourage cooperation and direct exchanges.
A coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the immediate conversation and the list of speakers, and someone who helps to take notes (or take a collective note).
Send an email to technical support if you need a comfortable box.
Use your well-becoming refund for collations.
To join the #remoties on Slack to talk to your colleagues about the distribution of work
The RH Operations Team is studying the ergonomic guidelines based on weblinarys to support increased labour distribution in the Foundation.
Last week, we requested all the beneficiaries of the Community's subsidiary to cancel public events financed by Wikimedia, such as the editors, until WHO announces the end of pandemic.
We have explained that we understand that our demands for cancellation and other restrictions could not make possible the achievement of their agreed subsidiary activities and that no one would be penalized in cases of delay or amendment of these objectives.
The next week, we published additional guidelines on Wikipedia and other thematic and regional Community conferences.
The general sense of the international community seems to be a tragic face to the smuggling and smuggling faces of clarity and the possibility of focusing on its own communities, Wikimedia and others.
As soon as possible, CRT works for the creation of a page on Meta-Wiki in order to provide a space so that the community can monitor the impact and continue our communications with them.
Keep in contact, despite the problems related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendar for an extraordinary meeting of the next Thursday staff, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will benefit from this time to share other updates, answer your questions and take together time.
This situation concerns us all and we are here to help you in any way.
From here you can always find information contained in this email, as well as all other essential information related to COVID-19, about the Wiki Office.
The CRT will update these pages and gather all the information on the same place.
We are also striving to maintain regular communications with the members of the resident personnel in countries that are now seriously affected.
If you have questions regarding movements, events, a important flow of work or difficulty of covering, or if you need help for anything else, don't hesitate to prevent and work with the CRT.
We're here to support you and ensure the connection where appropriate.
For any confidential or sensitive issue, please send an email to Bryan Judan, Director of International Transactions RH.
No of these amendments should be considered as a abandonment of our work and our obligations.
It is contrary to recognise that at the current time our work and our responsibilities must probably be adapted in a way without previous.
These steps are what we consider necessary to support us mutually and can continue our work, provide help to our movement, and provide the world's service on which everyone can account.
Our planned work will be here to wait for us for the coming time.
For this moment, it is time to get married and prepare for the important work that will happen in weeks and maybe the months to come.
We need each of you to achieve it, that is why you must keep and take care of your families so that you can give the best time of yourself.
Finally, if you go: Lay your hands and don't touch your face!

b'The conversion enzyme of angiotensine 2 (ACE2) is a enzyme associated with the external face (cellular membranes) of the pulmonary cells, arteries, heart, kingdom and intestin cells.
ACE2 against the activity of the transformation enzyme of angiotensine (ACE) by reduced the amount of angiotensin II and increased the Ang (1-7), which makes it a promising medication target in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.
The human version of the enzyme is often appointed under the name of HACE2.
Angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme is a metalenzym containing the zinc situated on the surface of the endothelial cells and other cells.
ACE2 protein contains a M2-peptidase area at the end of the N and a field of renal amino acid collector at the end of C.
ACE2 is a single membrane protein of type I, with the active area on the enzymatic level is exposed on the surface of pulmonary cells and other tissue.
The extracellular area of ACE2 is cut from the transmembranary area by another enzyme called icedae; the solution protein that is in result is released in the blood flow and finally excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is presented in most organs: ACE2 is connected to cell membrane mainly with the cell cells of the type II pulmonary alveols, the enterocytes of the green intestin, the art and veinary endothelial cells and the arterial cells of the lingery muscles of most organs.
The expression of the ACE2 ARN is also presented in the brain cortex, striatum, hypohalamus and the cerebral tronc.
The primary function of ACE2 is to compensate the ECE.
The ACE clevers angiotensin I hormone in angiotensine II vasoconstrictor.
ACE2 clicked to its tour the fenylamin amino acid with carboxyl termination of angiotensine II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tir-Is-Pro-Phe) and hydrossi in angiotensin vasodilatory (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also cut several other peptides including [-Arg9]-bradykine, appleline, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghreline.
ACE2 also regulates the membranal movement of neutric amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmember protein, ACE2 is the main entry point in certain coronavirus cells, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus original of CIS), and SARS-CoV-2 (the COVID-19 virus).
More precisely, the connection of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 sculpture protein S1 to the enzymatic field of ACE2 on the surface of cells resulting in enzytosis and translocation as well as virus and enzyme in the endosems located within the cells.
This input process also requires the love of S protein by host protein TMPRSS2, the inhibition of this last fact is currently the object of inspection as potential treatment. This leads some to think that ACE2 rates in cells may contribute to combating infection.
However, several professional companies and regulatory bodies recommended that the standard treatment of AEC and ARB continued.
An systematic review and meta analysis published on 11 July 2012 showed that “the use of ECE inhibitors has been associated with a significant reduction of 34 per cent of the pneumonia risk in relation to witnesses.”
In addition, “the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced in patients treated by ACE inhibitors that presented a higher risk of pneumonia, in particular AVC victims and cardiac deficiency.
The use of ECE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less probable than the global risk of pneumonia."
Human recombinant angiotensine 2 enzyme (rhACE2) is stressed as innovating treatment of severe pulmonary lesions and seems to improve pulmonary hemodynamic and oxygen saturation in porcels resulting in acute respiratory syndrome induced by lipopolisaccharide.
The mid-weight of rhACE2 in humans is around 10 hours and the time of action is 30 minutes over the (term) duration of 24 hours.
several findings suggest that rhACE2 could be a promising medicine for persons who are intolerant to classic inhibitors of the renal-angiotensine system (SRA) or for diseases with high angiotensin II. rhACE2 was evaluated in the context of clinical tests for the treatment of the acute respiratory syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are mobile applications designed to facilitate contact tracking in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the identification of persons (contacts) that may be in contact with a infected person.
Several applications have been developed or proposed, with the official support of the Government on certain territories and in certain courts.
several infrastructures have been designed for contact trace applications.
These systems, in particular those with regard to the tracing of the geographical location of users of applications, suffer questions regarding private life.
There are other less intrusive options, including the use of Bluetooth signals to store the proximity of a user with other portable phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced direct integration in their Android and IOS systems of functionality to support these Bluetooth applications.
The Chinese government, in association with Alipay, has deployed an application in China which allows citizens to check whether they have been contacted with the ports of COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore has opted for a application called TraceTogether.
Developed by a local informant community, it was provided in an open source and will be delivered to the government. The Northern Macedonia launched a Bluetooth application that ensures the transmission of exposure to potentially infected people and quickly communicated with health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
Since April 14, 2020, the application was in waiting for approval by Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the implementation of contact tracing was at an advanced stage of development and could be deployed during the next weeks, and that a similar application was planned in Ireland and France.
Australia and New Zealand consider the establishment of applications on the TraceTogether model in Singapore and on the basis of the BlueTrace Protocol. Russia wants to introduce a geo-operation application for patients with a COVID diagnostic and living in Moscow to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Safety Ingenieur at Cambridge university, identified a number of practical problems related to the use of application systems, including positive false and the lack of potential efficiency if only a small part of the population uses the application.
In response to the concerns about the propagation of false or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple authorises only the "official" or generally confidence organizations to add applications related to the App Store.
Google and Amazon applied similar restrictions.
Warriors for the protection of the private life have been concerned about the implications of the coronavirus applications in mass monitoring, in particular the events of the infrastructure of monitoring established to address the pandemic of coronavirus once the distant threat.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have published a statement called for the limitation of this type of monitoring.
These organizations have established eight conditions to comply with government projects:
monitoring should be "law, necessary and proportional" ;
monitoring and monitoring extensions should contain extinction clauses;
Data use should be limited to COVID objectives19;
data security and anonym should be protected demonstrablely;
digital supervisory should ensure that any exacerbation of discrimination and marginalization should be avoided;
any share of data with third parties should be defined in the law;
Provision of protection against abuse and remedies for citizens in case of abuses should be provided;
The "important participation" of all "related parties" would be binding, including the of public health experts and marginalized groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and unlimited Reporter (Reporter without border) (RSF) also published lists of verifications in Germany.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims at attacking the problem of continuing monitoring by removing the control mechanism of the exploitation system of their devices as long as it will not be necessary.
Some countries have used a network geolocalization system instead of applications, which eliminates both the need for downloading applications and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, the network trace was approved.
Network solutions with access to brutal geolocalization data present significant potential problems in respect of private life.
However, all systems on central servers do not need to access personal location data; several systems have been created to use central servers only for intercommunication, which allows to respect private life (see next section).
In South Korea, no application was used for contact tracking.
Instead of using a decrease application, the system collected tracking information to various sources, including mobile devices and card transactions, which they have then associated to send SMS warnings to potentially infected persons.
In addition to the use of such information to warn potential contacts, the Government also provided information on public location available, which was permitted following the deep changes in the information protection laws of confidence after the epidemic of MERS that had affected this country.
These information are available to the public by means of several websites and websites, and countries such as Germany have considered the use of centralized systems that preserve private life.
The details have not yet been reported on 6 April 2020.
The trace of contacts with private life is a well-established concept, established by a large data volume of research since 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than twenty-five experts groups worked on solutions regarding private life, including Bluetooth Low Energy technology (BLE) to register nearby a user with other portable phones.
However, the PEP-PT project is a coordinated effort that associates centralized and decentralized approaches and does not constitute a single protocol. Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact Numbers (TCN, old named Contact Numbers, CEN), Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT), among others.
These protocols are enabled to ensure that identification personal data never leave the device and that all corresponding devices are performed on the device.
The Privacy Group of the MIT Media Lab is currently developed by SafePaths, a private life conservation technique platform in the collection and use of data of location or contact to follow the propagation of COVID-19.
This technique is based on the results of the white book "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an epidemic" published in March 2020. The SafeTrace Platform of Enigma MPC, a company that develops private life protection technologies, which is initially based on the MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses safe material technology to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities, without compromising confidentiality.
On 5 April 2020, the International TCN Coalition was founded by groups assembled around a common approach and protocols essentially equivalent to reduce fragmentation and the interoperability of trace and warning applications, a key factor of their adoption by a wide public.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapur announced the publication of the source code of the BlueTrace Protocol used by its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which controlled Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact trace initiative, declaring that it would enable private life to maintain and associate Bluetooth Low Energy technology and a confidential cryptography.
They also published the specifications of the basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
deployment of tools to create official applications for the transmission of the coronavirus with respect to private life
Direct integration of this functionality in iOS and Android. Google and Apple are intending to resolve the problems for the adoption of the solution and continuity of monitoring by initially distributing the system through the updating of the operation system and then removeing it away.
The reposition of a medicine (equivalently called reorientation, reprofilation, re-assession or change of therapeutic indication of a medicine) designates the conversion of an approved medicine for a disease or for a different medical affection from that for which it was initially developed.
This is an current scientific research axis to develop safe and effective treatment against COVID-19.
Other research axis include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and the transfusion of plasma of convalence persons. SARS-CoV-2 presents about 66 therapeutic target protections, each of them has several link link sites.
The analysis of these link sites offers the real development of an effective antiviral medicine against COVID-protein.

The Governor of New York, Andrew C. Human, announced that the tests of the New York State on cloroquin and hydrochloroquin would begin on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of hydrochloroquin sulphate and cloroquin phosphate under an emergency use permit (EU).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical test process and is authorized only under the EU only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients but not able to receive treatment in clinical trials.
The CDC stated that “the use, dose or duration of hydrochloroquine for prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection is not yet established.”
The doctors indicated the use of this medicine “if there is no other option”.
A Turkish research team in Istanbul takes a small study on the use of clorocine in association with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
More broader studies are in Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Medical School tests the safety and efficiency of the preventive use of hydrochloroquin.
Chinese clinical trials carried out in Whan and Shenzhen claimed that favipiravir was “classfully effective. ”
35 patients in Shenzhen were negatively tested in a mean period of 4 days while the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study carried out in Whan on 240 patients suffering pneumonia, half of them received favipiravir and the other half of the humenovir.
The Italian Medicine Agency recalled the public that the evidence that exists for the medicine are mining and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase the medicine in Japan for its reservations and that it would use the army to deliver the medicine to university hospitals where the medicine would be used to cure patients from COVID-19.
According to South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe opened opportunities for Trump administration to purchase the medication. The medication may be less effective in serious cases of disease where virus has already been multiplied.
It can't be sure for pregnant women or those who try to pursue.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaaletra), a association of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirals, concluded that "no benefit was observed".
These medicinal products have been designed to inhibit HIV replication in relation to protease.
A Colorado University research team tries to modify these medicines to find a composite linked to SARS-CoV-2 protease. There are critics in the scientific community on the use of resources for the reposition of medicinal products specially for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in international Solidarity test.
The redisciplinary was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as the treatment of Ebola and Marburg Virus infections. Gilead Sciences then found that the residicivir had an antiviral activity in vitro against several philosovirs, pneumonius, paramyxovirus and coronavirus.
A problem of antiviral treatment is the development of a resistance by the bial of mutations that can generate more severe disease and transmission.
Some early studies suggest that redésivir can have a high genetic barrier against resistance. Several clinical trials are in place, among which two of Cleveland University Hospital Hospitals are conducted; one of the people suffering a moderate pathology and the other on those reached by more serious forms.
There are three current clinical trials on vitamin C in intravenous for patients who are hospitalized and seriously ill by COVID-19; two controlled against placebo (China and Canada) and one without control (Italia).

several anticoagulants are under test in Italy.
The heparin of low molecular weight is widely used to treat patients, which encourages the Italian drug agency to publish Directives on its use.
A multicentric study of 300 patients and studied the use of sodium ennoxaparin in preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a large number of researchers focused on the reposition of approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for previous epidemias such as MERS, NAS and West Nil virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th issue of Chinese guidelines
Umifennovir: Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th issue of Chinese directives
Some antibiotics were identified as potentially repowerable as COVID-19 treatments:
tocilizumab (anti-receptor-IL-6): approved by China.
Tests are also undergoing in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab #COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetic vaccine against coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed clinical tests, many development attempts are undergoing.
Finally, in February 2020, the World Health Organization (OMS) stated that no vaccine was expected against SARS-CoV-2, virus originating disease, at least 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were in phase I security study.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major epidemic has been declared over the world in 2020, leading to significant investments and research in order to develop vaccine.
Many organizations use the genes published to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Determined in April, the imperatives of the CEPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are the speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, ECPI scientists indicated that 10 different technological platforms were conducted in research and development projects at the beginning of 2020 in order to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The targets of the previous main platform in Phase I security studies include:
Nucleic acid (ADN and ARN) (developer Fase I and vaccine candidate: modern, mRNA-1273)
Virus vector (fase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, adenoviral vector type 5)
As the CEPI scientists stated in April, 115 vaccine candidates are in the first development centres of 78 (79 according to the Milken Institute) confirmed as active and 37 other announced, but with little available public information (presummary in planning or design).
A I-II test of preliminary safety and immunity tests, is usually randomised, controlled against placebo and performed in several centres all over, determineing more effective doses.
Phase III tests usually include more participants, including a witness group, and test the effectiveness of vaccine in the prevention of disease, while monitoring the indesecurable effects of the optimal dose.
Among 79 vaccines for active development (confirmed early April 2020) 74 were not still in a period of evaluation on human persons (the always “preclinical” research).

In March 2020, the United States government, the industry and three universities have generally made their resources to access IBM supercomputers, associated with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google IT resources.
Some vaccines have heterrine effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can provide benefits beyond their predicting disease.
Another randomized test in Australia requires to include 4 170 health professionals.
It is possible that development vaccines are not secure or effective.
Initial research to evaluate the efficiency of a vaccine using specific COVID-19 animal models, such as ACE-2 transgenetic mouses, other laboratory animals, non-human primates, indicate the need for implementing bio-safety-related measures for the manipulation of living virus, and international coordination to ensure standardized security procedures.
Vacuums against OAS and MERS were tested on non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no curative or protective vaccine against the IAS showing both human security and effectiveness.
According to research documents published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines for the treatment of the SARS was a priority for the overall world governments and health agencies. There is no vaccine tested against MERS.
When the MERS was broken, it was thought that existing research on the IAS could serve a model to develop vaccines and medicines against a infection with MERS-COV.
In March 2020, a single vaccine against the MERS (DNA based on the human phase I) had been completed by humans and three others; all vaccines were viral vectors, two to adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Publications on social networks distributed a complex theory that the virus from COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
Patents referred to in various social publications are referring to existing patents on genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus shoes such as the coronavirus of the SRA.
Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a infectious disease caused by Coronavirus 2 related to severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The current symptoms include fiber, all and suffle.
Other symptoms can include fatigue, muscular pain, diarree, gorge pain, loss of ghost and abdominal pain.
The deadline between exposure and appearance of symptoms is generally about five days, but it can swim between two and fourty days.
While the majority of cases generate moderate symptoms, some evolve to a viral pneumonia and a deficiency of several organs.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2,24 million cases have been reported in the world in 210 countries and territories, generating more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 5680,000 people have been healed, and the virus is mainly produced at close contacts, often by balls produced by all, eternity or speaking.
These bottles are produced at the exile, they are generally dropped on the ground or on surfaces instead of representing an infectional risk on long distances.
People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface, then touching their eyes, nausea or mouth.
Virus can survive on surfaces up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious in the first three days after the appearance of symptoms, although the contagion is possible before the symptoms appear and during the following phases of disease. The standard test method uses the inverse transmission of polymeraric reaction in real time (RT-PCR).
The use of masks is recommended for those who think they are infected by virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations on mask ports by the public generally vary, some authorities recommend their use, other recommending their use, and others still imply their use.
There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of disease was recorded in most countries of WHO's six regions.
Virus infected persons may be asymptomatic or develop gripped symptoms such as fever, tumor, fatigue, swelling.
Emergency symptoms include difficulties to breathe, pain or continuing thoracic pressure, confusion, difficulties to walk and blue face or lips; in the presence of these symptoms, it is advised to consult a doctor immediately.
Not frequently, higher respiratory symptoms such as everlasting, birth eruption or gorge pain can be observed.
Gastro-instinal symptoms such as nausea, digestion and diarrey were observed in different proportions.
Some cases in China initially presented only a thoracic pressure and palpitations.
In some cases, disease may cause pneumonia, deterioration of several organs and death.
That's what we call the incubation period.
The COVID-19 incubation period is normally 5-6 days, but may go up to 14 days.
97.5% of those who are developing symptoms will do it within 11,5 days after infection. Reports indicate that all infected persons will not develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic drivers in transmission is not yet completely known, but preliminary elements suggest that they may contribute to the propagation of disease.
The proportion of infected persons who do not present symptoms is now unknown and at the study. Korean prevention and control centres (CDC) reported that 20 per cent of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their hospitalization.
The Chinese National Health Committee began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; on 166 infections found this day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
Expectoring and salt can both carry out important viral charges.
The fact of speaking stronger lies more than the fact of speaking normally.
A study in Singapore revealed that all of them without protection can be designed with a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not generally transported by the air, the National Science Academy suggested that bioaerosol transmission could be possible and that air collectioners positioned in the pool outside the patients' rooms have produced positive samples to the virus ARN.
Some medical procedures such as cardiopulmonal invasion and reanimation (RCP) may be dispersed by respiratory secreations and therefore lead to air propagation.
While there are concerns about the propagation by the sleeves, this risk is seen as weak. Virus is the most contagious when people have symptoms; although propagation may be possible before symptoms appear, the risk is weak.
The European Diseases Prevention and Control Center (ECDC) states that if there is not yet aware of how to facilitate disease, a person generally contain two to three other persons.
precisely, the virus could be detected on a day's side on the card, three days on the plastic (polypropylene) and inoxidable steel (IASI 304) and four hours on the skin to 99%.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
Savine and detergents are also effectively used as well; savine products degrad the protective lypidemic skin of the virus, which disables skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalconium chloride and chlorohexidine glucoonate (a surgical desinfective) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, salt samples were produced in average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five patients in six, the first sample showed the highest viral charge, while the highest viral charge was at the sixth patient at the second day tested.
Coronavirus 2 associated with severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new responsible coronavirus of the severe respiratory syndrome, initially isolated in three persons affected by pneumonia in the home of Whan’s acute respiratory disease.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are presented in the coronavirus apparent in nature.
Out of the human body, the virus is destroyed by household savior, which breaks its protective cover. SARS-CoV-2 is a closer parent of the origin SARS-CoV.
The pulmones are the most touched organs of COVID-19 because virus is accessing host cells through angiotensine 2 (ACE2), which is the most abundant in the alveolary cells of type II of pulmones.
The virus uses a specific surface glucoprotein called “picture” (pleplemore) to connect to ECE 2 and to pull in the host cell.
Age heart lessons were reported in 12 per cent of the people administered to the Hospital of Whan, China, and are more frequent when disease is worse.
The rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to the systematic inflammatory response and immune disorders during the progress of the disease, however, myocard acute lessons can also be linked to ECE 2 receptives in the heart.
The ECE 2 receptors are strongly expressed in the heart and in the hearts involved.
A high impact of thrombosis (31%) and veinable thromboembolic disease (25%) was observed in patients in intensive treatment units with COVID-19 infections and may be associated with defective pronostics. The autopsis of COVID-19 deceived people showed diffused allergic damage (DAD) and inflammation infiltrators containing limphocytes.
While SARS-COV-2 presents a tropism for the epidemic cells of the respiratory ways expressing the ECE-2, patients attained in COVID-19 are severe symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
These are in particular GM-CSF secretor T cells that have been associated with the recruitment of inflammation monocytes secreted by IL6 and the severe pulmonary pathology of patients reached by COVID-19.
Lymphocytic infiltrators have also been reported in autopsie.
WHO published several test protocols for disease.
The standard test method uses the inverse transposition of polymerara reaction in real time (rRT-PCR).
The test is generally performed on respiratory samples obtained by rhinopharynge precipitation; however, birth or exploitation can also be used.
Generally, the results are available in a few hours, even up to two days.
Blood tests can also be used, but they require two blood injuries taken at two weeks of interval and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists could isolate a coronavirus shock and publish genetic sequence so that laboratorys all over the world were able to develop independently from the tests of a chain polymeration reaction (PCR) to detect virus infection.
On 4 April 2020, anti-corps tests (disceptable to decepte active infections and previous infection of one person) were in the course of development, but not still widely used.
The Chinese test experience showed a specification of only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States adopted the first test nearly to the patient on 21 March 2020 to be used at the end of this month. The guidelines of the Hungary Hospital of the University of Whan suggested methods of detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemic risks.
Multi-lobal bilateral depolis options with a device, asymétric and posteral distribution are typical symptoms that are visible at the beginning of the infection.
Domination under pleurale, crazy paving (seven interlobulary spacing with variable alveolary comblem) and consolidation may appear with the progress of disease.
Many data are available on microscopic lessons and COVID-19 pathhysiology.
The main pathological findings of autopsie are:
Macroscopie : plousea, pericaride, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary odem
Four types of gravity of viral pneumonia may be observed:
Modified pneumonia : pulmonary odem, pneumonic hyperplasis, atypical pneumonics extensive, interstitual inflammation with lymphocytatic infiltration and multinucleated gene cells
Severe pneumonia: diffused alveolary damage (DAD) with alveolary exsoms diffused.
DAD is the cause of the acute respiratory depression syndrome (SDRA) and severe hypoxymia.
Hepatic pneumonia: organising exsumed in alveolary cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Sang : intravascular diseminate coagulation (ICVD) ; leuco-erythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce infection risks include remaining at themselves, avoid bound places, slowing the hands to the water and saving during at least 20 seconds, having a good respiratory hygiene and avoid touching the eyes, nausea or mouth with unlated hands.
The CDC recommends to cover the mouth and nail with a shock when it is sweet or permanent and to use the inside of the cow in the absence of shoot.
A correct hand hygiene is recommended after being sit or eternized.
The CDC recommended to cover the face by using a tissue in public places in order to restrict transmission in the case of asymptomatic individuals. Social distance strategies aim to reduce the contact of persons infected with large groups by stopping schools and workplaces, reducing movements and cancelling the important groups of persons.
The distance directives also include the compliance of a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) minimum between persons.
There is no medicine known to be effective in the prevention of COVID-19. Since a vaccine has not been expected before 2021, a key element of COVID-19 management is to try to reduce the epidemic pic, which is also called “approving the curve”.
The CDC also recommends the individuals to lay the hands often in the saving and water during at least 20 seconds, especially after having been at the toilets or when the hands are visiblely salt; before eating; and after being mourned, hesited, or permanent.
It also recommends to use a desinfective solution for alcohol hands containing at least 60% of alcohol but only if water and savan is not available. For areas where desinfectants for the hands of the trade are not available, WHO proposes two forms for a local production.
In these forms, antimicrobian activity produces ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacteria sprays in alcohol, which is not “un active anti-septic substance for hands.”
Glycerol is added as humidant.
Persons are treated by support care that can include hydrogen treatment, oxygenotherapy and support other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that people suspected to be virus portfolio have a simple facial mask.
Extracorporal oxygenation by membrane (ECMO) was used to treat respiratory deficiency cases, but its benefits are still analyzed.
Personal hygiene, healthy life mode and food were recommended to promote immunity.
Support treatments can be useful for those who have pre-infected symptoms. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of hospitalized persons for COVID-19.
Reanimators and pneumonics in the United States gathered therapeutic recommendations from several agencys in a free resource, IBCC.
In April 2020 there is no specific treatment of COVID-19.
As regards symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminofene) instead of the first line ibuprofene.
Precautions should be taken to minimise the risk of transmission of virus, especially in care conditions when the implementation of the procedures can generate aerosols such as insulting or manual ventilation.
The CDC recommends to place a person in a isolated room to airway infection (IIR) more to use standard precautions, contact precautions and precautions for air traffic transmission. The CDC stresses the directives on the use of individual protection equipment during pandemics.
The recommended equipment is: PPE blue, mask respiratory or facial, eye protection and medical gants. If available, the respiratory masks (the facial masks).
N95 respiratory masks are approved in industrial conditions, but FDA allowed the use of these masks under an emergency use permit (USA).
They are designed to protect air pieces such as powder, but their effectiveness against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for non-specific uses.
Where the masks are not available, the CDC recommends to use facial protection screens, or in the last time, artistic masks.
The majority of COVID-19 cases are not sufficiently severe to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases.
The type of respiratory assistance for persons with high deficiency of COVID-19 is actively studied for hospitalized persons. Some evidence indicate that insulation can be avoided by using a high-frequencies natal or a positive pressure of respiratory ways at double level.
It is ignored if one of the two or both generates the same benefits for people in a critical state.
Some doctors prefer to hold it to the invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the distribution of aerosol particules compared to a high debit skin, and serious cases are more frequent in adults older than 60 years of age, and in particular more than 80 years of age.
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds for persons, which limits the capacity of the care system to treat a smooth number of cases of COVID-19 sufficiently serious to need hospitalization.
A study in China showed that 5% of the cases were administered in intensive care, 2,3% had needed respiratory assistance and 1.4% deceived.
In China, about 30 per cent of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 are finally admissible in intensive care.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) during COVID-19 and oxygenation is more difficult.
ventilation devices offering pressure control modes and high PEEP are required to optimisize the loss of oxygen and minimise the risk of pulmonary lesion associated with ventilation and pneumoniax.
The higher PEEP cannot be available on older venture devices.
Research of potential treatments to be started in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are subject to clinical tests.
Redesivir seems to be the most promising one.
Although new medicines could not be developed before 2021, several testing medicines have already been approved in other indications and tests have already been advanced.
An antiviral medicine may be tested in persons suffering serious disease.
WHO recommended volunteers to participate in tests on the efficiency and security of potential treatment. FDA granted an temporary authorisation to the plasma of convalence persons as an experimental treatment in cases where the life of the person is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not been subjected to the necessary clinical tests to demonstrate security and effectiveness for disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to manage epidemic.
Users are requested to enter their name and an identifier.
Application is able to detect close contacts by using monitoring data and therefore detect a potential infection risk.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application is not only recommended by the quarter, it also warns local health authorities. The analysis of the massive data of mobile phone data, the facial recognition technology, the localization of mobile phones and the artificial expertise are used to localize infected persons and those with them in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to localize mobile telephone data from suspected persons to have the coronavirus.
The measures aimed at respecting the quarentaine and protecting people who could have been in contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Germany Telekom shared aggressive phone location data with the German Federal Government Office, Robert Koch, to analyze and prevent virus propagation.
Russia has deployed the facial recognition technology to detect people who do not respect the quarter.
In Italy, the Regional Minister of Health Julio Gallera has been informed by mobile telephone operators that “40 per cent of people continue to move.”
The German Government conducted a hackathon weekend of 48 hours with more than 42.000 participants.
The Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid launched a global call to find creative solutions to prevent the propagation of the coronavirus.
Persons may suffer from quarentaine, movement restrictions, secondary effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
The BBC pointed to Rory O'Connor, which states: "Augmented social isolation, solitude, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are a perfect cocktail to smell mental health and people's welfare".
The disease may have a moderate evolution with little or not symptoms, similar to other common respiratory way diseases such as rhino.
Moderate cases are generally retailed in two weeks, while the serious or critical cases need three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may present a higher risk of COVID-19 infection, according to similar virus data, such as COVID and MERS, however, lack of data for COVID-19. In some cases COVID-19 may affect pulmones and cause pneumonia.
In the most severely touched cases, COVID-19 can rapidly progress towards a syndrome of acute respiratory deterioration (SDRA) caused respiratory deficiency, secttic chocolate or multivisual deficiency.
COVID-19 complications include setticemia, coagulation disorders and heart, renal and hepatic lessions.
Coagulation problems, particularly an increase in prothrombine time, were described in 6 per cent of the hospitalized cases with COVID-19, and renal insufficiency was observed in 4 per cent of the people of this group.
About 20% to 30% of people at COVID-19 have a high rate of hepatic enzymes (transamines).
According to the same report, the average time between the start of symptoms and death was ten days, of which five past in hospitalization.
However, patients transferred to intensive care had a mean period of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an early study of cases, the average period between the start of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total beach between 6 and 41 days.
In a study of the Chinese National Health Committee (NHC), men presented a mortality rate of 2.5 per cent, while women presented a mortality rate of 1.7 per cent.
The histopathological exams of post-mortly pulmonary samples present a allerolary damage with fibromyxoide cell exsoms in the two pounds.
Virus cytopathic changes were observed in pneumonites.
The image of the pulmone is similar to a acute respiratory depression syndrome (SDRA).
For 11,8 per cent of the deaths reported by the National Commission for Health, cardiac lessions due to high troponine rates or heart arrests have been observed.
According to the data from Mars from the United States, 89 per cent of hospitalized persons had presumable pathology, and medical resources and socio-economic conditions of a region may also have an impact on mortality.
The rate estimates of disease mortality vary because of these regional differences, but also because of methodological difficulties.
The sub-numbering of moderate cases may result in an overall assessment of mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of previously contracted cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
The smokers were 1.4 times more enclined to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and have a risk of 2.5 times higher decline in intensive care or decrease in non-food care.
The Hungarian administration of Hong Kong has observed a decline of 20 to 30 per cent of respiratory capacity in some healthy persons, and pulmonary scanners suggest organic lessions.
This may also be conducted in an intensive syndrome after treatment.
In March 2020, it was ignored if previous infection had an effective long-term immunity in disease-related persons.
Immunity is considered likely, on the basis of the behaviour of other coronavirus, but cases of generic COVID-19 tests in the coronavirus were reported at a later date.
These cases are considered as a aggravation of a latente infection instead of reinfection.
We think that virus is natural and animal origin, through dissemination of infection.
The real origin of the virus is unknown, but in December 2019 the dissemination of infection was almost conducted by a human transmission.
A study of the 41 first confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in The Lancet in January 2020 showed that the most old date of appearance of symptoms was returned to 1 December 2019.
Official publications of WHO indicated the first appearance of symptoms on 8 December 2019.
several measures are generally used to assess mortality.
These figures vary according to regions and in time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the therapeutic options, the time spent since the beginning of epidemia, as well as the demographic characteristics such as age, gender and health status.
In the end of 2019, WHO affected the pathological emergency codes CIM-10 U07.1 for infected diseases confirmed in the laboratory infection in SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for the cases of COVID-19 diagnosed by clinical or epidemiological point of view without infection to SARS-CoV-2 confirmed in laboratory. The Dece/cas report reflects the number of deaths diagnosed by the number of cases diagnosed in a given time interval.
According to Johns-Hopkins University's statistics, the global deceased/case report is 6.9 per cent (153 822/2 240 191) to 17 April 2020.
This number varies in the region. Other measures include letality rates (CFR) which reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals that deceive disease and the rate of infected letality (IRF) which reflects the percentage of infected persons (diagnosed or not).
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination in the end of disease.
Although all infected persons do not develop anticorps, the presence of anticorps may indicate the number of persons infected.
In Italy's epidemia, a small village of 4600 inhabitants, 80 of them have already been deceived (1,7%).
In Gangelt, sickness has been promoted by festivals, and young people, generating relatively low mortality rates, and all diseases related to COVID-19 may not have been officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system has not been discovered.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of people may have anticorps, according to an evaluation of blood donors.
69 deaths (0.004 per cent of the population) were confirmed as COVID-19.
The impact of pandemia and mortality are different in men and women.
Mortality is higher in humans in studies carried out in China and Italy.
The higher risk is in the five-year-old men, the difference between men and women who disappeared by only 90 years of age.
In China the death rate was 2.8 per cent in men and 1.7 per cent in women.
The specific reasons for this difference between gender are unknown, but genetics and behavioral factors could be part of it.
Immunological differences according to gender, the lower prevalence of smooth smooth in women and development in men of commerbidity, such as hypertension at less advanced age than in women could have contributed to a higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57 per cent of infected individuals were men and 72 per cent of COVID-19 deceived persons were men.
In April 2020, the United States does not collect the data associated with COVID-19 infections.
Studies shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influence and ARSS affect men and women.
A higher percentage of health personnel, in particular nursing personnel, are women and presents a increased risk of being exposed to virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of disease would be COVID-19.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means corona, VI means virus and D meaning disease, 19 is the first identification of epidemia: 31 December 2019.
This name was selected to avoid references to a specific geographical place (e.g. China), to a animal species or to a group of people, in accordance with international namenclature recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The virus caused by COVID-19 is called coronavirus 2 related to the severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses “COVID-19” and “COVID-19” in its public communication.
The disease and virus are both commonly called "coronavirus".
During the initial epidemic in Whan, China, virus and disease were often called "coronavirus" and "Whan's coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended the use of providing disease names 2019-nCov and acute respiratory disease for virus and disease, in accordance with Directive 2015 against use of places in names of disease and virus.
Official COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Taking into account the capacity limits of standard supply chain, some digital manufacturers print the care material as ecublons and breathing parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed an emergency respiratory valve and the provider could not provide it in time, a local startup recovered and printed the 100 valves required in one night.
After the initial epidemic of COVID-19, complex theories, false information and information have been experiencing about the origin, expansion, prevention, treatment and other aspects of disease and rapidly spread online.
It seems that man is able to promote disease to some other animals.
Studies have not been able to find viral replication evidence in porcs, canaries and powders.
No medicine or vaccine is approved to treat disease.
The international research on vaccines and drugs against COVID-19 is currently conducted by government organizations, university groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched “SOLIDARITY” to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compositions with the most promising effectiveness.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are being actively developed in vaccines.
Previous SARS-CoV works are used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are both using the ACE 2 receptor to switch in human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are the object of research.
First, researchers try to create a whole virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, which is inactive or dead, aims to cause a rapid immune response of the human body in the case of new COVID-19 infection.
A second strategy, sub-unit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensibilizes the immune system to some sub-units of virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, these research focused on the S-pic protein that helps the virus to filtrate the ECE Enzyme 2.
A third strategy is that of the vaccines based on nuclear acids (ADN or ARN vaccination, a new vaccination technology).
Experimental vaccines from all these strategies should be tested in terms of safety and efficiency. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical test of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an inoffensive genetic code copyed on the virus that causes disease. The activement of anticorps was suggested as a potential challenge in developing a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, but it is controversed.
In April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials have been undertaken.
Seven tests have evaluated the treatments already accepted against malnutrition, including four studies on hydrochlorokine or cloroquine.
Converted antiviral drugs represent the majority of Chinese research, with nine clinical phase III tests on redésivir in several countries whose reports are expected in April.
A dynamic analysis of vaccines and medicinal drugs against COVID-19 was also established in April 2020. several existing antiviral drugs are evaluated in the treatment of COVID-19, including resivir, chloroquin and hydrochlorokine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir associated with beta interferon.
Provisional data suggest the efficiency of redistribution in March 2020.
Clinical improvements were observed in patients treated with compassional recodecivir.
Phase III clinical tests are undertaken in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, which was previously used for the treatment of paludism, was studied in February 2020, with preliminar results.
However, some request an independent analysis of research work.
Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend the use of cloroquin.
However, Whan’s virology institution, although recommending a daily dose of a gram, indicates that the dual of this dose is very dangerous and may be mortal.
On 28 March 2020, FDA authorized the use of hydrochloroquin and chlorokine under an emergency use permit for the discreation of doctors with COVID-19 patients. The 7th issue of Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umphenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirine are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for the continuation of an in vivon study after demonstrating a low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies showed that the initial sculpture protein was affected by the transmembranary protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE 2.
The studies on cloroquine and hydrochlorokine with or without azitromycine have major limits that prevented the medical community to adopt these treatments without additional studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and does not present any role in the treatment of COVI-19.
The cytokinic shock may be a complication in post-commerce cities of COVID-19 severe.
There are evidence that hydrochlorokine can have cytokinic antichoc properties. Tocilizumab was included in the guidelines of treatment by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study has been conducted.
Phase 2 tests are being not randomised at the national level in Italy after having demonstrated positive results in persons with a serious form of disease.
It should be contrary to such developments that are suspected to be caused by the death of some touched individuals.
Interleukine-6 antagonist was approved by the FDA on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of the syndrome of refractric cytokine rating caused by a different cause, the treatment by CAR T cells in 2017.
There is no randomized and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment of the SCR.
The transfer of concentrated and cleaned antibodies produced by immune systems of people healed from COVID-19 to people who need it is to study as a non-vacual method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for the SAS with few conclusive results.
Virus neutralization is the action mode expected by which passive anticorps treatment can generate a defence against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as cell cytotoxicity depending on antibodies and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other passive antibiotic treatment forms, for example using monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
The production of convalscent people, constituted from the liquid part of the blood of hepatitis patients and contained specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased to a faster deployment.
Coronavirus diseases, a closely apparent syndrome group
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Whan's Central Hospital, who then contracted the COVID-19 and died after the attention to the propagation of the virus.
