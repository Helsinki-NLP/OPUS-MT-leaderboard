Inflation in Europe has declined on food
The accelerated inflation measured in the euro area is mainly due to the rapid increase in food prices.
In November, the increase in prices in the 13 countries of the euro area was more important in comparison with the previsions, after a inflation rate of 2,6 per cent in October, a annual inflation of 3,1 per cent was registered, stated the office of the European Community statistics situated in Luxembourg.
Official predictions indicated only 3 per cent, reported by Bloomberg.
In contrast to the United States Central Banks, England and Canada, the European Central Bank (BCE) did not decrease the direct interest rate, saying that the reduction of interests, with the growth of primary materials and the decline of the unemployment rate, would lead to the generation of a spiral inflationist.
The ECB would like to maintain the inflation rate below but nearly 2 per cent.
According to an analyst, it is Catch 22 for the ECB: "It must be dissuaded" inflation in order to have no further action on this subject.
In Germany the inflation rate of 3,3 per cent is a record during the last twenty years and in Spain, it is deleted from 3,6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has resulted in rapid increase in food and energy prices.
The market rates of cereals increased 88 per cent and the soya rate also reached its highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and milk products also has significantly increased in 2007.
This year, the global oil price increased 52 per cent and the last month, a black gold bar costs almost $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008 the inflation rate will pass from 2.5 per cent in 2008, but in 2009 it will decrease at 1.9 per cent.
According to analysts, the inflation rate of 12 months remains around 3 per cent, but the next 3 to 4 months, the average annual rate will be 2,1 per cent.
At the same time, they expect that the ECB reduces the management rate twice in 2008.
Gallup indicates a government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of youth Democratic Partyers in Fidesz has significantly increased the beginning of December 2002. Thus, since 2002, it has now a larger number of partisans, while Gallup (Sandage Institute) has never found such a low socialist support, that is, 13 percent.
For faithful electioners, the difference would be, due to the largest determination of opposition electors, a support of more than two thirds (71 per cent) against the support of a fifth (20 per cent) for the MSZP (Hungary Socialist Party).
According to the survey, the MDF (Hungary Democrats Forum) and SZDSZ (Free Democrats Alliance) are below the parliamentary level: their support is two per cent in the whole population.
On the faithful elections some to vote, the number of parties of the two parties increased by 1 per cent.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate in the previous lowest point, the proportion of those who believed that the economic situation of the country has never been so serious, and the situation is to be 41 per cent and the 46 per cent supplementary is sufficiently serious.
After the most optimistic perspectives of spring and summer, families are again pessimist about their financial situation.
For the next year, the majority of the population is expected to be aggressive and only a tenth is expected to improve the situation.
In December last, 71 per cent of the surveyed people, namely a majority never seen in previous Gallup's analysis, found that the first minister had done its work as bad as well.
13 per cent of the sons trusted or much trusted in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 per cent supported Victor Orban.
54 percent do not trust the first minister and 27 per cent of the President of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of change in the political situation is the proportion of society who think that the unconsciousness against the first minister can be treated without changes of government.
While, according to the last October emissions, 35 per cent of the sons wished that the Government and the Prime Minister remain in function, this rate is only 20 per cent, and the relative majority (33 per cent) estimates that the holding of new elections would be the solution to this situation.
In the issue of the vote, 60 per cent of the sons respond that they will certainly vote, and the 20 per cent of the supplementary claims that they will probably vote.
For comparison, only 55 percent of the sons would take part, and 15 per cent would probably be involved. As regards the current intentions, the result of the referendum would not be doubted.
74 per cent of the people were not inscribed in higher education, 79 per cent would not say consultation costs, and 84 per cent would not say to the hospital residence costs.
When we consider only the same proportions among those who expressed their intention to vote at the referendum, respectively 81, 84 and 89 per cent of voters would reject the introduction of registration rights, consultation costs and residence costs in the hospital.
Tesco also has increased its prices near twenty percent
The hypermarkets imposed in the commercial triangle of Budaors maintained the average increase of prices of 16% of the last year to the difference that the rate of TVA has not increased this year.
Article of Gazdaság (day economy)
This year, in the commercial triangle of Budaors, the daily Kerier of Christmas also increased by 16 percent in average, there was a net increase of more than thousand forecasts in all hypermarks.
The prices, which were already enrolled in the large food stories in December last, have no longer increased brutally in comparison with the previous higher base.
Nevertheless, consumers are obvious to see that the items purchased clearly below nine thousand forecasts in the last year are now costing more than ten thousand forecasts.
The daily carriage in the sound hypermarks exceeded 91 forcings at least the psychological level of ten thousand forecasts.
And the highest value of the carriage was 10,573 forcings.
(In 2003, this value was of 6 800 forums.)
The prices of the Unicum and of the Life Fish remained almost at the level of the last year, but the prices of the dinner, nickel and pavot have significantly increased.
In the shops, the price of fain and bread followed the data of the KSH (Center of Statistics Institute) but also, at the same time, 1 kg of bread was found only 139 forenses.
Competition has not decreased the product price below 200 forcings.
It was surprising to see, too, that the price of the bottle consigned by two litres of Coca-Cola was below 200 porints, therefore it was only 257 forrents of the designed bottle.
It prevents only this year, in terms of Carier daily, also the most cherished and Cora less cherish.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of its daily carriage of 15 per cent while Tesco and also increased around 18 and 18 per cent.
By comparing the cherishest carriage of the last year and the less cherous carriage of this year, we find a distance of 12 per cent, while the difference between the less cost of the last year and the most precious of this year is 21 per cent.
The prices increased from 1 480 forcings in average.
Last year, prices increased 1 206 forecasts, noting that the impact of the increased TVA rate was already marked in the Christmas prices of the last year.
This process made simplified trade, and hypermarkets could not be visiblely determined what margin of application on products as they were incapable to prevail the impact of consumption price change.
(If a trader calculates badly the rotation of a product, it is risking to lose a great benefit on the margin adapted to trade intensity.)
As a result of change in TVA rates, the price increase in the daily carriage has grown so exceedingly that the cheapest carriage was up to 1,720 benefits from the value of 2006, while the difference between the less costed carriage was only 844 foreigners.
This year, the difference was not so exceeding, since the value of the carriage was higher than 1 630 forecasts in the last year, and the prices of the less cost also increased 1 284 funds.
By approaching the two Christmas seasons, we found a catastrophic increase in prices, at least 20 months the prices of daily consumption products increased by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not strongly confirm KSH data: for some first foods, the Statistics Institute has found an increase in prices of more than 30% in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, of fat and egg.)
According to the daily Carrier, this seems almost absurd because the price level of this product, which has already been careful in the last year, has increased by more than 10% in relation to the base.
According to the index, the providers employ a stronger position than egg providers because they have been able to accept the brutal increase of the prices also by multinationals.
In the commercial gold triangle, hypermarkees do not regret themselves, they constantly registered good years.
According to our experience, most customers do not look at the prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They purchase everything in quantity, they take long conservation foods by palettes.
Mercredi's morning of the important ones were formed in the boxes of the three hypermarks, as the number of customers has been slowly increased.
However, according to our information, the number of businesses is less important in the province, many multinationals are attracted to analysis companies to not even reach the expected number of business, not only for food but also for sustainable consumption items.
Many hospitals make the economy on desinfects
This year, more than thousand infections, mostly caused by the incorrect use of antibiotics, were recorded in hospitals.
The hygienical conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds, the increase in medical personnel does not help to block infections, claims the doctor of the National Epidemiology Centre.
Many hospitals also make the economy on desinfects
There has been no longer a MRSA infection in Yanos hospital traumatology.
The resistant bacteria of antibiotics was detected on a hospitalized man after a serious accident.
The sick was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, similar infection occurred at the same place.
The damage of a serious car accident was out of the hospital, but a few days after it returned to it because of an MRSA infection, and since the doctors did not have a significant operation because of the bacteria found in his body.
Until 10 December of this year, 1 094 hospital infections generated by a multi-resident pathogenic agent were declared in the National Nuocomal Monitor System, stated Carolina Böröcz, Head of the National Epidemiology Centre.
Knowing that it is the number of infections caused by a multi-resistent pathogen agent who has been actually registered in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
About two thirds of infected infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, otherwise, by the urine staphylococcus resistant to the methicilline-oxacilline.
A third of the people are the bacteria of the Staphylococcus areus (SA) in their nest without developing a disease.
Infections caused by SA (such as angins, amygdalites, cut-infections, traumatic infections) are well reacting to antibiotics, they are easily healable.
However, if antibiotics are used in excessive or inappropriate way, the bacteria, which reacts well to antibiotics, will develop a well-resident bacteria to antibiotics that will soon proliferate in the bad hospital conditions.
In the case of interim or prolonged immunity system, this bacteria may cause serious hospital infections such as traumatic infection or sectycemia, older diseases, small weight or a pregnant body.
According to the Director of the Hospital Yanos doctor, there is nothing special in MRSA infections, these infections are part of the hospital’s daily.
In particular, it is not necessary to confusion the infection with epidemia, no MRSA is found only or is not searched for them, said Tibor Nyulasi.
SAs are antibiotics.
"The diseases are isolated, the careful staff put gangs in coutchouc and protection masks and we have an adapted antibiotics to cure them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Previously, hospitalized diseases are reviewed if they are MRSA-traders, but infection can not always be avoided.
The sampling of the sample is not in mode
The large majority of infections caused by MRSA could be prevented but the current conditions and circumstances are not favourable in Hungary hospitals to prevent and proliferation of multi-resistent pathogen agents, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection is particularly shown in hospitals and residents for older people, hospitals should control hospitalized diseases and immediately isolate MRSA diseases.
However, microbiological prelevation is not the mode in Hungary hospitals.
It is necessary to know that the National Social Security Case does not finance these reviews.
The majority of the cases do not see only if MRSA infection is detected in the disease, the physician head of the epidemiological center declared.
The European Union has strict recommendations regarding the adapted use of antibiotics in human medicine, and there are also Hungary guidelines for the curation of certain infections and syndromes.
Antibiotic therapy should be targeted, and otherwise, microbiological reviews should be conducted in order to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take account of them.
The achievement of microbiological precautions is even more rare in ambulatory care and basic care, reported Karolina Böröcz.
Many hospitals make the economy on desinfects
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA proliferation from a disease to another most often through medical personnel.
It is therefore important to lay hands, put gants and protective masks, but important lacunes are also detected in hospitals in this area.
The MRSA proliferated by infection transmitted by guittlelet inhalation and contact. However, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, contaminated disease can not always be isolated.
Moreover, rooms are often full, beds are often too close to each of the other, while in the term of epidemic, diseases should be removed from one of the other 1.5 meters at least.
Unfortunately, we also realize that hospitals, in difficult financial situations, make economies on desinfectants, they lack nurses, sicknesses are many, so the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals or preventive measures are respected, the number of infections is demonstrable or the proliferation of pathogeneous agent may be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection represents exorbiting expenditure for social security boxes, and therefore it is struggling towards this infection.
In England, for example, the Government has established a programme to prevent or reduce the impact of MRSAs.
According to data published, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Prevention and Diseases (ECDC) shows priorities to prevent multi-resident pathogeneous agents (such as MRSAs) and to prevent hospital infections caused by these pathogenic agents.
The Commissioner, author of a death accident, was not able to slaughter
The official report on the death accident caused by the Commissioner of the 22th Arrondication was deleted.
It may be excluded that the Commissioner of the 22th rounding, the deputy of his post since, who slaughtered a pietton by causeing his last Monday death, had led to the state of evil or shooting, has reported the sale of Attila Morvai, the port of the Public Minister of Capital after the relative constat was established.
The test confirmed the first result of the investigation that already found that the former Commissioner had not consumed alcohol prior to the flight.
On Monday, the former Chief of the 22th Arrowing Commissioner was a 55-year-old man who had faced him when he turned, with his personal car, in the Kossuth Lajos Street of 22th round. The man wanted to pass through the road by not passing by piettons.
(In addition, the fact that it crossed the road outside the path for peettons is not an accurate circumstances, according to the Road Code, a car that loves a virgin must leave the piettons.)
Pieton died after being transported to the hospital.
Following this accident, the Commissioner dismissed his post and requested his retirement because, according to the police communication, this accident was a lot of struggle.
The investigation of this case is conducted by the Budapest Park.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former Commissioner had co-operated the beginning with the judges responsible for conducting the investigation.
Additional EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Yanos Veres, Minister of Hungary Finance, and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (BEI), signed, on Thursday, three agreements of a total value of 400 million euros on a credit line in order to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (BEI) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for the Hungary budget funding of the transport and environmental projects to be achieved from the Cohesion Fund, which has already been signed by the parties, and the signed contract refers to the use of the 200 million euro remaining.
The EUR 150 million credit agreement also applies to the funding of projects related to education.
The EIB approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungarian, 150 million remaining euros will be used later, following the extension of the credit contract.
The parties signed a contract of 50 million euros for innovation, and the state budget will first use this support in the framework of the research and development project to achieve the Debrecen University.
In the negotiations, the project of line 4 of the metro has also been discussed.
The parties agreed that they would rediscuss the possible amendment of the initial contract when Hungary would end the details of the financing of the metro with the EU.
According to Yanos Veres, this could be done at the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has granted a total of EUR 8.4 billion for the financing of 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants its appropriations according to the EURIBOR interest rate, with a time limit of eight years and without commitment committee.
Bulgaria, Paradise of the EU real estate market
The evolution of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of the whole Europe is turned into this country of the Balkans in the past.
What, or who has purchased on this EU market, which is always less cherished but will become rapidly cherished?
Analysis of the Bulgarian Division of Re/Max.
Today, in the immobilier, Bulgaria is inconsistently the most powerful target in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and houses on the edge of the good market.
In the mountains, the most popular regions are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, at the edge of the sea, Albena, the "Ore", the Coast of the Sun, the former Sozopol and Nessebar, but more are looking for a building in the Kavarna and Balcik region.
According to Re/Max Bulgaria's analysts, soon or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also increase the interest of investors and are also more to buy in the Russian area.
Sofia, the capital, also offers attractive opportunities, trade surfaces and offices promise the highest standardisation rate.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive golf paradise in Europe and is thus a priority destination, after the summer season and the winter season, also in the other two seasons of the year.
The most supervising investors have already purchased a larger number, for example in the river of Bansko.
According to analysts, people buy a building in Bulgaria seek in the same time to change their life, their life mode.
Most buyers are English but other come from France, Belgium, Spain and more than Romania.
Malta and Cypriot investors are also present. On the edge of the Black Sea and in the most reputed ski stations, we find many Russian buyers traditionally.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, said Georgi Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who are able to buy renewed buildings, a price between 50 and 100 000 euros, or old houses slaughtered, at a price from 5 to 15 000 euros, which are then renewed.
The criteria are easy access and communication opportunities, nearby a large city, shops and generally that of local doctors.
The second group includes secundary resident purchasers (on December last, Bulgaria is mentioned among the first 10 vacation destinations in Germany).
The third group is composed of commercial investors who purchase in the hope of a higher or long-term value.
The price of capital buildings increased without a stronger demand.
In the European Union, the real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the past five years they increased 21 per cent each year.
The increase of real estate prices is mainly exceeding payments.
Fodor and 6 percent Hungary
According to the report of Gabor Fodor, the Minister of Environment and Water, the meetings of professionals have reached march, however, after official opening, the negotiations of Ministers on the international climate regime will continue after 2012.
The experts and politicians from 192 world countries will discuss on the Bali Road Folder which intends to determine the efforts to be made after the Kyoto Protocol reduction period until 2012.
There are live discussions on this subject between developing countries and developing countries.
The United States also reported that, at the time, they did not want to discuss exact figures, but they were ready to sign a reduction agreement until 2020, gas emissions from 25 to 40 per cent in 1990.
Another important issue of the Conference is to see whether the developing countries are involved, without reducing emissions, in providing financial and technological assistance to countries that need it.
A agreement was also signed on aid to developing countries.
The Kyoto Protocol support fund will be managed by a administrative advisory of 16 members probably in the framework of the United Nations Global Environment Fund (GEF), reported Piac es Profit (March and Profit).
6 per cent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, confirms the environment of the EU to maintain its role of a friendly vessel in global efforts to protect the climate and to encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU was able to reduce its gas emissions by 20 per cent from the level reached in 1990, depending on the success of the signing of the Agreement after 2012, and was willing to reduce them until 30 per cent if other large world regions and/or developing countries were also prepared to take appropriate commitments to their responsibility and capacity.
Gabor Fodor recalled that in 1997, Kyoto's signatory countries had a total decrease of 5,2 per cent and all of the 15 EU members in that period had taken the commitment of at least 8 per cent.
Hungary has undertaken the commitment to reduce the emissions of gas for 6 per cent in relation to the period 1985-87, and our country will comply with its commitment, recalls the press communication of the Ministry of the Environment.
The summary is great in Bali because the long-term international climate policy agreement should be implemented within two years, unless the entry into force would be certainly retreated after 2012. In this case, the commitments to reduce the values provided for in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international system of emissions reducing the need to be stressed in the new IPCC report, the international scientific body, which obtained the Nobel Peace price, which is responsible for the care of climate change.
The reduction in emissions would be delayed and the average temperature of the Earth was more than 2 degrees of Celicio could not be avoided that, according to the scientists, would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
The British army recruits YouTube
The British Army units communicate, on the video share site, records carried out during its operations in Iraq and Afghan to become popular.
First, it is the British Air Force (RAF) who has been on YouTube: the special units in Afghan and charged video sequences on the Taliban operations since March 2006, announced the BBC.
These registers, obtained by mounted miniature cameras on the ship, are controlled in the general district of air force operations in Kandahar and then transferred to London or the loaders on the Internet.
Political message is inconsistent
Aircraft soldiers have already been 139 sequences on the net through this way and their "chain" was considered by over 750,000 people.
The British Defence Minister was registered in the spring of 2007 and communicated videos on operations in Iraq and Afghan, while the Commonwealth Commonwealth Office and the international peacekeeping forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own YouTube chains.
Mission in Afghanistan
According to the initial aim of the air force, videos were carried out on the net to recruit. According to the Ministry of Defence, they also used to make the real goals of the military presence in the foreign.
The propaganda published by this way does not cost practically with regard to the publicities of ordinary recruitment at television, which was reported to the BBC Gordon Mackenzie, consulting in defence, and also inevitablely brings a political message because it justifys in a special form the well-being of military operations decided by the government.
Americans have played a game
The army is embarked because, unlike the well-composed videos, amazing videos have been carried out on the share site, which also presents the death of soldiers, for example, in the "official" propaganda films, a little hypocrite, officers do not avoid talking to loss but never present the bloody side of the fight.
Furthermore, many videos were already on the net presenting operations in Iraq and Afghan, which were undertaken in real mission, but the British army has not returned to the loading of these videos since now.
Americans make the recruitment a little different in serving the American fusillade Army freely downloaded. In this game, the player can direct to soldiers' place in the context of a more or less real simulation.
Tombs and birthdays in the Ministrys
Monika Lamperth, Minister of Work, does not seem to be sensitive: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold a year-end meeting with its collaborators who will be able to add to the year 2007 by taking guests and coffee.
Another minister will organize a holiday with life music, another will engage the officials with a tombola and offer a drink to create a Christmas ambience.
Festival, Christmas ambience, concerts and buffet, so it diverted the power.
The public authorities also prepare Christmas.
This year, the largest Christmas feast will be organized by the Defence Ministry, but they are not the employees of the Ministry that will be invited.
In Christmas, from the Orphelins, the children of the soldiers will receive gifts for the missionary Christmas, the members of the soldiers who are currently serving in foreign missions are invited, and a press receipt will also be held.
The Ministry provides a budget of 25 million foreigners to create the end-year environment.
In comparison with the other ministers, the National Development Agency (NFO) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will celebrate.
The GKM Festival will be held in the future with a total budget of 4 320 000 forums and, on the six cent employed in large, three hundred fifty.
At this celebration, Christmas environment will be rigorous, there are actors and also a stomach.
The NFU Christmas costed 4 700 000 forecasts and was organized in the building of the National Justice Council (OIT) with concerts and a dinner.
The location of the room costs a million foreigners, the rest has been expendied for more than four hundred visits.
According to our information, a NFU service is invited to another Christmas feast, which is organized with European money by the National Economic Development Centre, the management company of offers.
The building of the Gaîte Theater was lodged for these purposes.
This information has not been confirmed by MAG Zrt because we have failed to join the responsible.
The cost is not binding
The OIT building was not only welcomed by NFU but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which, instead of a Christmas feast, organized a bal at the occasion of the Holy Luca on 7 December.
OIT did not pay the use of its rooms.
The bal was five hundred people.
The feast began by the words of welcome of the Minister and dinner was followed by a nightmare on life music.
Response to the question of [origo]: the garden of the evening was not all obligatory to this bal.
The Ministry of Health, Labour, and Local Collections will prepare an overcome.
The Ministry of Health will organize a spectacle and a party to its employees in its walls for 4000,000 foreigners.
On the contrary, Monika Lamperth, Minister of Lamperth, is not officially invited his collaborators to a Christmas feast but to a final year workshop.
Hundredty-two people are expected that they will be invited to take a coffee and eat guests, reported the press service, the party will not cost as well as 3500,000 forecasts.
Gordon Byanai, the Ministry of Local Collections, will simply invite its collaborators to take a drink in the hall of the Ministry of Local Collections and Territories.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will organize a Christmas feast in its large room where 436 employees are expected.
It costs 2 500 forecasts per invitation including a buffet and a drink.
Since Yanos Veres' arrival, employees of the PM celebrate Christmas every year in the same way.
Not a prescribed festival environment, the official character is strengthened not only by the Minister's exposure, but also by the hour of the afternoon party.
The Agricultural Ministry will organize a receipt on January 20 to celebrate the new year, the Christmas Festival will not be placed.
The receipt will be held in the Vajdahunyad Castle, located in the city Bois, and, according to the Ministry's communication, 1,000 forests for persons are calculated for hundred visits.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail that will only be invited foreign diplomas in Hungary.
These cocktails are organized every year by a few welcome words from the Minister ' s follow-up of modest food.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Cultural is not a party for Christmas, reported [origo] respective press services.
The press service of the Ministry of Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas party.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the celebration organized at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The Great Mega forces gather
The signs of the Ligue and the National Employers' Workshops Association will, on Thursday, represent their grief committee, which will be responsible for the coordination of the undetermined midday greenage.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and Monday, on the day of the final vote on the Health Case Act, the grief will start.
This will certainly cause important shuttles in the movement because rail traffic will be almost totally arrested and BKV employees (common transport company) will also grow up to 13 hours.
The links will know, on Friday afternoon, the details of their lunch green, organized with the National Workers Advisory Association.
The LIGA Grave Commission - MOSZ will also be constituted, it will serve as a Coordinator for Monday Actions.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and, from Monday, the organizations joining the Great will stop working for an undetermined period if they are not able to find an agreement with the Government.
This means that the date of the end of the crowd, from the day of the vote to Parliament on the Health Case Act, is not defined.
If the national Assembly does not adopt the Health Case Act, the unions will immediately retire the call to the grief.
However, if the law is voted, the Great Committees will gather and decide to follow.
According to the day of Monday of the National Assembly, it is likely that the vote on the law on health boxes was only late evening, even even night.
As a result of the greenage planned for Monday, important shoes are planned in the movement: Iron roads will stop working for an uncertain period and during the morning a share of common transport in Budapest and more than half of the Volan companies may be arrested.
At the same time, at various points of the country, half of the road will be blocked.
Many of the citizens and civil organizations joined the call to the Grève, the list of those are continuously updated on the Liga site.
Some organizations report to make the grief for an uncertain period, others declared an temporary stop.
To Thursday after midday the MÁV (Hungary fer Chains) and the Free Travel Syndicat (VDSZSZ) have not been able to find an agreement on minimum services, or, at the approach of Christmas feasts, more are those who take the train.
According to the current communications, the common transport of Budapest will be decreased from the beginning of the service until 13 a.m., the Budapest Airport between 7 p.m. and 9 p.m., the Industrial Systems of Electricity and the Thermic Energy of the Liga will be a degree of four hours, the Syndicate of Professionals and the Democratic Syndicat of Professionals called for a degree of 2 hours and 2 hours to 8 hours.
The National Medical Association will grow in the whole country, the Syndicate of Employees of Health and Social Sector (EDDSZ) raised to the SZEF will be a degree of 2 hours warning.
The most important of the four versions formulated by the Ligue requires that the Government remove its proposal on health reform and submit a new concept to the social debate.
The second return requires that the new calculation method of the retrait to be implemented from the next year will be introduced in several steps.
The third revendication wants to ensure, in the case of starting awards before the legal age, that would enable the functions granted in the system before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Travel Syndicat (VDSZSZ), raised by the Ligue Unions, the proposal for the Ministry of Economy and Transport on Sexual Railway Lines and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: Hungary Garden has increased the risk of country
According to the Political Capital risk analysis Division (Risk Analysing Division), the activities of the Hungary Garden, which was established in August last, with the support of the Jobbik Magyarerszágenrt Mozgalom (Moviment for A better Hungarian) increased, under several aspects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its “risk warning”, the company notes that, in relation to the activities of the Hungary garden, the largest political risk is already that “a short term of aggressive ethnic conflicts may result in achieving the already existing ethical tension between the twin and non-twin population of Hungary”.
The research institute added that the Hungary Garden's political strategy to really cause this situation is the main reason.
As they say, this is one of the main lacunes of Hungary political actors: "Peace actors have conducted the public debate on the matter of the Romes to representatives of the radical and extreme political groupings that have based on a political strategy on the difference between the Tzigans and the Hungary."
The problem is aggressive, the normal dialogue is impossible, the extremists are strengthened and the arrival of aggressive conflicts is more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, under the increased attention of Hungary and international media, the activity of the Hungary garden “deteriored significantly the image of Hungary to the foreign, particularly on the trust in the stability and democratic maturity of the country”.
They recalled that, following a larger publicity given to the reorganization of the extremely Hungary-related radiological and legal groups since autumn 2006, many associations have been established in Hungary since the summer 2007, named 'national autodefense Association'.
“The common treaty of these assemblies is that they are defined as a civil organization while they publicly declare the preparation of their members to defence missions (catastrophes, national defence, defence of order), if necessary, overwhelming, calling on the invalidity of the police, of the army, otherwise say of the state” they added.
They reported that everything was done according to the method that, based on the ransom of the policy and parties society, seeks to develop various political ambitions under a civil aspect.
The citizen nature and the association status are therefore only to avoid the legal stages of the registration of these associations to the court but also to be a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that Hungary Garden's activity is a factor that also increases the risk in relation to neighbouring relations.
"In recent months, many neighbouring countries cite the Hungary garden as a potential risk source and the ultranationalist politicians of some border countries want to justify their anti-Hungary policy in referring to the Constitution of the Hungary Garden.
This influences the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research institution, the Constitution of the Hungary Garden is not a unique phenomenon in Eastern Europe, political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the functioning of the Hungary Garden is like, for example, to the activities of the Bulgarian National Garden whose Constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (UNB) in August 2007.
The many challenges of Romans that have raised in a Sofia district (Kraszna Poljana) are originating the Constitution of the Bulgarian guard.
With the benefit of these events, UNDP decided to form a guard by saying that the objective of the organization is “national self-defence”.
According to them, in the past 17 years, the Tskinians were "terrorized" Bulgaria but the state remained inactive and neutral, remembers the Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had brought lived discussions in the bulgar public view.
As they say, the statement of certain Bulgarian Rome organizations on the Constitution of their own guard in resistance reports the increase in the risk of ethnic relations.
The function of the Hungarian garden showing similarities with the national Bulgarian garden does not exclude Hungarian Romas to the same way by organizing their own self-defence, it may be read in the risk warning of the Political Capital.
To request telegraph information, Attila Juhász, Political Capital Research Director, said: The risk analysis is one of the research institutions.
As he said, their risk analysis was published every year and if events could have an impact on the risk change, they report the public opinion, as in the present case, by publishing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red all over
In Hungary, the Law defines exactly the feast days and, around the festivals, it has become useful to reorganize the working days of which the number will reduce the next year.
Festivals are not uniform in the EU and the United States.
Hungarian legislation distinguishs national, state feasts and the rest days.
The rest day is often related to religious feasts or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the new year, the last day of the year that ends and the first day of the new year are also relaxing days, the last more so that the revelers can relax.
Furthermore, in one year, we have all nine Red Festivals.
The 15 March is a national party, in the memorial of the revolution of 1848, as also on 23 October, that is the memorial day of Revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrate the Constitution of our status, on 1 May is the work party and on 1 and 2 November, we remember members of our family and our deceased friends.
Moreover, we have two days in Pascal, Pentecost and Christmas.
The days of our status, national or religious feasts rarly falling on a weekend, according to the calendar, it has become useful to reorganize the working days in cases or only one working day before or after a red party.
It is true that we pay the prices of long-end weekends in working or going to school on Saturday prior to the long weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has been established in a special regulation on the days of replacement of the days before or after the feasts.
The law is extended for all employees and for all their employees, on staff and on persons working in the public service.
However, it does not be for services companies, institutions turning without interruption and service, by their vocational vocation and for the rest days.
This year, work days will only be changed around the final year partys: from 24 December, life is almost in the country because, according to experiences, the majority of people makes additional hours or takes holidays that they have made for these purposes to be able to pass through the day of Christmas and the day of the new year in their homes.
In the next year, many feasts fall at the average or end of the week, so there will be less changes at the level of working days in relation to this year.
The calendar will be reorganized the first time around the work party to allow employees to stay home for four days.
Saturday, 25 April, will be a working day to have a day of stay on Thursday, 2 May.
Another change is scheduled for October 23: on Saturday, 18 October, will be a working day to replace Friday 24.
Instead, the next year, the end of the year is announced under the sign of the festivals since 24 December, everyone will break a non-stop even if the day of the new year falls on a lunch.
Six shuttle things that may embarrass the colleagues
E-mails that we forgot to send, vocabulary messages that we never receive, innocent lies that make us almost more: these are things that "beat" the daily place of work.
The question is to know whether these injuries are involved or the challenge is repressed and the ambiguous situations are conscious, caused by injury to others.
Examples.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that we called you on the marketing service," said a colleague.
Did you shoot a shooting?
Instead it is sorry and tried to arrange things by calling the marketing service to tell them that it has forgotten the message (that is the least used solution).
In most cases, the thing is arranged with apologises.
Before having punishable explanations, it is useful to consider how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
Are you doing something that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more urgent than wanting to take a folder, a office tool or the phone, and you don't find them anywhere.
You remember the old age you put the board on the office, but she's gone next morning?
Do you find your style that you thought you had lost on the office of your college?
Don't take anything to your colleagues without asking, except they have reasoned to be angry against you to have cut their goods.
Don't get back, from post to your pocket because it may be embarrassing that there's no more and that you need it immediately.
You're the private life of colleagues?
There are no good ways to stop pounds that offer.
Who did it, with who?
Or why?
Don't tell everyone of your information (supply) about your colleagues' private life!
If a colleague shares his intime secrets with you, don't blame his trust!
Enter the shared information in you and do not discuss it with your colleagues in their absence even if your colleagues are well known.
You say sick without just reason?
When you call the office and you declare sick in the pretext of a head-in-law, because you feel bad, or you think you need to rest on that day, think that your job, your urgent business, your long-term missions must be carried out by someone else in your place.
Don't worry about your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next morning you're not going to work or that something may happen to you who would stop staying home, you don't forget to prevent your chief and colleagues to prevent them from your absence on the next morning.
Fredoning, Rising, Phone
You're pulling you into your job, but your colleagues' rebuilt you're cruel?
You've become, without wanting, a witness of a phone discussion that you could better do not listen to?
Do not strike your colleagues with colds, smells, high voice discussions (which you bring up above their head), feet battles, big words or miscontentings expressed with high voice.
They may be depressed even if your colleagues are not broken in a project (redaction, design, organization).
Are you accused of the others for a mistake?
If your job is not done for the deadline, you forgot to send an important email or message, no one accuses for this forgotten!
Don't put him on the account of the possible chaos in the office or your bruyful colleagues!
Recognize him if you've made a mistake and if it has presented inconvenience for others, repair the fault!
Ask how you can repair your fault, repair your neglectance!
You feel too much at your office?
Put a game and chaussing is comfortable at home, but they do not agree to the office!
Don't put comfortable jogging even if your function allows it!
Don't be disfellowshipped, respect your colleagues and your own colleagues by swearing you correctly, and if your function requires it by putting sweet and elegant clothes, to go working!
If you want to answer the expectations, you're not more interesting.
We're slightly advanced in the morning's normal bottle.
However, a special melodie is heard at the radio: the voice of a violon with which electronic effects are associated.
I'm taking the sound.
The music change of ritme and the low arrives to accompany the tones of all the time, then a feminine chorale joined there as a true shoe.
M2 diffuses the song Wings of Love de Zagar.
Hungary musical life has not made us a long time with an electronic pop of good quality.
But now it seems that the shooting becomes different if you listen to the new album of Zagar.
The appearance of Yunterboi, the several new interesting productions born from the Hungary numerical round began little to change the image of the whole and, despite the new mode of the garage rock, the Hungary Elektroop tests that there is new under the sun.
Balazs Zságer came from Pécs and played himself in the Yunterboi group before he was launching on his own way, perhaps because "no place for two feet in the same chaussure."
His project (Zagar) and his music, a jazz alliage, an electronic and pop music alliance, began to know when the composition of the filmed soundtracks (e.g.
The season of Ferenc Török.
The training at first in small clubs began to be known by a larger public when the wan2 magazine mentioned their first album in 2002 among the fifty more important disks of the Hungary market and to announce Zagar, with Yunterboi, the only creators of the Hungary trend, which would also be competitive in the West.
Zagar and his together became inconsistently "Traindy" but nobody asked them if they wanted to take this label.
The group reacted as necessary, a new and better disk was out.
The titled Cannot Walk Fly Instead album, which recently appeared, can open new ways for them, although the title wants to represent a continuity with the past years in Pécs.
It was a line of the old group of Balazs Zságer Peeks.
We are well with the flight reference but at the side of the air music now appears, according to the spirit and trend of the time, the stronger guide it, the impact of rock and roll.
Giggy Ligeti, who is currently working in England with the Puzzle Group, showed his talent in these songs during the first time of the album at the Millennium Park.
On the album, a real tube is found for the radio, Mr2 Petæfi, which has been distributed from a few of the morning's popular music, began to introduce the melodies of Wings of Love with six Hungary songs ("Underground Divas").
So everything's okay (?).
hvg.hu put questions to Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new tube tries to ask me: Is your music well remained a music for a certain kitchen?
Zságer Balázs: The term of music for a certain sweet doesn't tell me a great thing.
For me there are two boxes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial and sincere music.
The musics say alternative, underground can also be mediumcred and only made to sell them and become so commercial.
But a good pop song can also be honest.
Receiving in this spirit also works independence on language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between the Hungary and Foreign public, is one or another more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Foreign, especially western light music has older traditions.
The people go to concerts and not only the young ones of a ten or twenty-year-old years, but also the older.
They follow with much more attention the changes in light music because they think that it is also part of the modern culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who, or how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: I'm obviously pleased to see that people come more to our concerts.
However, we have never made music for the market.
It is not for us to achieve a goal but for a specific reason.
The role of the public is more important to concerts or mutual influence works, but it is not considered only in unselfish changes in the moment.
But I noticed that if you wanted to answer the warnings of the public, you'll never be interesting.
hvg.hu: Do you have to follow Yunterboi's example?
He worked alone and made career instead of western.
Zs.B.: We do not really follow his way even though some try to find tracks in our music.
Instead, we are team players who have confidence in the musical presence of the other and let them move.
At the beginning, it was well inevitable that our music is compared to Yunterboi's because we are several to leave his group and take another way.
hvg.hu: on the palmarès of mr2 Petōfi, Wings of Love takes the first place.
Many are those who heard the name of Zagar for the first time through the way of this song.
With this more popular style you opened consciously to a larger shoe?
Zs.B.: We have not planned to make a tube to sell the disk.
This song means more things.
We wanted it for the end of the album to try to adopt the soundorgy and the most difficult topics discussed in the entire disk.
hvg.hu: How have you chosen the six songs?
Why was they the direct line?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a shore of the kind of gospel.
We had the idea of composing this shore of good solists from the Hungary musical scene.
Thus was the chorale of six members, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Peterfy, Enikō Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, who later got baptized Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like that, or have the girls changed it a little?
Zs.B.: This piece has already been in a instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought he was missing something to this song.
The suite of agreements has touched the voice of the song.
I sing even the melodie that the girls learned later.
I had it almost soon and everything was terriblely spontaneous.
I remember that this galvanized me at the time, but surely we need Divas.
With my voice, she wouldn't have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the disk and concert also seemed to me that girls were back.
There's no single (except only one piece of Judy Jay), they don't have a role alone, they sing all together and they're not sing stronger than music, so music does not only meet their songs.
They were back on the scene too.
Is that desire?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the back is only to technical problems.
On the contrary, what was volunteer, is that we did not want to distribute solitary roles.
The song also says that we need to forget our ego, forget that comes from where, who goes or, must just leave these families, the love familys, to us.
I wanted the others to feel this euphoric state that we have felt when the song is born.
hvg.hu: The song has made you the most worker?
Zs.B.: Really, no musical creation process has been harder in the mix.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play at a concert plan, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the biggest didn't want to work for a long time, and then, a little little, everything's built in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes always with the concerts and the fact that I already have left this disk.
Now, these are the prophet Is A Fool, Escape From the Earth and Never The Same.
Trade perfide to risk billions because of its infection complex
A smiling frauder.
Thus, his former employee is the French Gender the General Society, owner of the Czech Bank Commerční banka.
The bank lost about five billion euros because of him.
But instead, it seems that Kerviel is only a big player who wanted to equal his colleagues, and which, in addition, cannot be considered incapable.
On the contrary to all large bank houses, he has recognised the crisis of the market of American hypotheks at time.
"He's fragile," they left to hear his superiors who sent him to the police.
However, if Kerviel was deposed by the French media, including the World, the transactions of this man finally produced a profit of EUR1,6 billion in the last year.
The crisis exceeds the United States
"It was all I wanted, it was winning money for my bank," he said in the deposite.
Last summer he has successfully benefited from the American crisis to win a half billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity since the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February according to the fact that hypothetics said " sub-prime " were granted to low income customers or to those who had met in the past of reimbursement difficulties would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it, and he did well.
Thus, at the end of the year, its benefits were up to EUR 1.6 billion.
"When I had won my first half-million, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel replied, and adds that he, of course, had nothing guarded for himself."
In the whole questionnaire, he admitted that he had required the reports to not be dealt with.
He succeeded to dump his superiors, although the Eurex bourse began to interest in his transactions.
Who does not risk anything
Did he be discovered?
Not soon.
"I think that the simple fact that I got 1,6 billion for the bank would be satisfied."
Where does his will come to risk so big?
It has not been achieved in his position only progressively.
He had started working at the General Society in 2000 just after finished his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual wage turned around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already assisting to trade, and in 2005 he became an independent sale of $90,000.
However, he knew he would never win as well as others.
"When I had first entertainment in 2005, I knew that I was considered very less than the others.
In view of my university course and my professional and personal journey," Kerviel explained.
But, just after his income, he brings his first big success.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, he won a half billion euros through the decline of this title during London's attacks.
And the mechanism was delayed, and he wanted more.
As long as you win, we'll leave you in peace
"There was like a swimming effect," he said to the police.
But the superiors were well known, or instead, they were able to do it.
"When I win, they were doing the same way to close the eyes."
But then the start of the year is happening.
He lost a billion euros in one day.
On Monday, after the weekend, he decided to hide the sum.
Monday, when he arrives to work, he isn't employed by the bank.
A few days later, the bank announces that she lost $5 billion because of him.
And how did we find it?
It has become a suspect because of his officers.
"In the last year, I took only 4 days of congestion.
A trader who does not take vacation is a trader that does not want to leave his book to another," Kerviel concludes.
Czechium has the opportunity to get 365 billion
Today, the Czech Government ministers signed in every nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, bring EUR 14 billion (around 365 billion of Czech krones) to the Czech Republic.
It is nearly half of the total amount that Czech can obtain from Brussels in 2007 to 2013.
About 125 billion corones of seven operational programmes will be used to the Czech regions.
Czechese enterprises will be able to get about 100 billion corones within the Enterprise and Innovation Programme.
The transport sector will benefit from the largest part, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the most important operational programme and represents up to 22 percent of the financial resources that the Czech Rep. can be obtained in the framework of these projects.
This money will be based on an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund that will be managed by a sum of 90.8 billion corones in the next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation Programme, for KMUs and entrepreneurs, must provide financial resources to promote innovation within the company.
Enterprises should obtain financial means for the introduction of new technologies, research in the industry, but also for the introduction of new more efficient management methods.
Czech Rep. was part of the least successful beneficiary of EU funds among the new members.
The Court confirmed the sentence of 20 years of prison for the former President of Nicaragua
The Nicaragua's Call Court confirmed the sentence of 20 years of prison for the former President of Arnold Germany, which was sentenced in 2003 for a fraud of $100 million (approximately $1,8 billion).
But later he was released and lived in his hacienda near the Nicaragua capital.
If the former Head of the Central American State, functioning between 1997 and 2002, it is not clear, according to the AP Agency.
According to the President of the Heavy Court Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on prison agents, or they will let Aleman finish his punishment in his home, or will be again in prison.
4 years ago, the Court has proved that Germany regularly moved the government's money into foreign company accounts in Panama.
It was fixed companies and accounts actually belonged to members of his family and its most closest parties.
A part of this money was taken into the funds created by Allemán to finance its election campaign in 2001.
The budget was adopted
That's it.
The state budget was adopted.
What is this budget exceptional?
It is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the majority of the government without supporting the opposition.
This one for the present year has been a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - SSD, since it was the Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and the SSD could not allow it to refusal.
In contrast to the agency debate before the vote of the Government ' s deficiency declaration, this time, nothing dramatic.
The Chamber of Members has adopted this law without any problem, which, although the most influenced, is normally unnecessary.
This is a kind of paradox.
That the sweet or not, each chapter and each article are the beginning and end of each government.
The budget is part of the policy, which has been hidden behind the competition of government and opposition.
This is more attractively, and therefore it is given more attention to the media.
Political men's controversies are much more interested in view of the abrupt numbers.
The national socialist budgets of the past socialist governments had three degrees that the current budget is not able to resolve both:
The first is the important part granted to the expenditure of mandates set by the Law, which is not only by recruitments but also by social charges adopted last year by the "coalition" silent grouping parties sSD and KSśM.
The second is a deficit economy, resulting in the first badness.
The third obstacle is the deficit of public finances, namely the deficit of cities and communities.
However, it is not the deficit of the state budget that represents the largest alea.
This is public and relatively under control.
The truly late bomb is the deficit of cities and communities.
Many of the maires were often employed, slowly, from their municipalities to obtain money from taxes, tax rights and bank credits, new investment sources.
In the past years, they were successful to repay these debts by sale in mass distribution systems, including the energy systems obtained from the State in privatization.
Today, they do not have any more than this source.
If only official and verified facts are carried out, it is noted that:
Our economy has already been over a few years, as the rest of the world, a growth phase and SSD is missing to sell it.
It was a unique opportunity for the next Governments of this party to regulate public finance.
However, instead of that, they ended the State again.
Other countries, including Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their business in a much more reasonable manner than our Republic.
It is a monstruous shame that is mainly returning to the previous governments.
We are part of countries who are the least threatened by poverty at the global level.
We therefore have no need for massive social programmes that have, just in recent years, have been unnecessaryly inflated.
Although a part of the absurd popular expenditures adopted last year before the elections, if a decay of the age limit for retrait, and a reform of the retrait system will not be done nextly, any policy will stop existing in that country and whoever will be the power, it will be administred.
By exercising punishment, political men will become bureaucrats which mechanically distribute the majority of the money imposed between retraits and social benefits.
This is the reason why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism that makes usual costs are restrainted by mandate costs.
The deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be absolutely unnecessary if previous governments had not dismissed all the money they could.
If we really don't want to happen to the government policy to become a simple bureaucrat, we must be patients and grant this fragile government coalition, conscious that the State can only expend the equivalent of what is going to preserve taxes and tax rights, the peace necessary for the preparation of new reform laws.
There are only the latters that will enable progressively to achieve a balanced state budget.

Banks want to regulate the crisis
The Federal Bank for the United States Reserve, the European Central Bank and the English, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to combat the financial market crisis together.
More than 100 billion dollars will soon be placed on monetary markets through shopping markets.
It will be involved in the banks to sell the interest rates for which they are ready to pay money.
For example, the American Federation will send $40 billion to the purchase and provide 24 billion to the European Central Banks and Swiss.
It is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the Central States Banks have decided to take action to this concerted point to prevent and to reduce the impact of the financial crisis.
"This current approach tends to resolve the major economic problems, namely, the growing lack of free capitals that banks could provide", wrote in its report to the Bernard Baumohl clients of the Outlook Economic Group advisory company.
"The concerted action of Central Banks has reduced the probability of recession to the United States of 65 per cent to approximately 50 per cent", adds Baumohl in its report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion because of non-employed loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts are still waiting for other losses in billions.
"If the Central Banks have chosen this outcome, they must actually appreciate what can still be done," said the economist of the ADN Amro Kieran Davies.
"He seems to be really bad," he adds.
The Central Banks are afraid that if the banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will provide more money to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and decline the American economy in a recession that could affect global economic growth.
The Central Banks made this choice after the failure to reduce London's interbank rate called LIBOR, which was used to employ on the interbank market.
This means that banks were always afraid of mutual loans, although the United States Central Banks, Canadian and English banks have reduced several times during the automn their interest rates.
"It will have the same effect as a new decrease of interest rates," said the Reuters Greg Saving company Tempus Consulting Agency.
Some analysts do not believe that the movement of Central Banks will not contribute to the crisis because it does not resolve the main problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the United States.
President Klaus: The discussions of ecologists are incredible
Global climate changes are predominantly weak to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again discussed the problem of global warming.
The criticism of the United Nations International Conference on Climate Change in Bali has been attacked this time.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The blue planet, not see you, he said that the debates of ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, which is made by a curious medium of representatives of non-governmental organizations and non-governmental organizations, which is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the registry and the reality.
"The debate is not structured, it is only a smooth of words, replaces solutions to current problems," said Klaus.
The Czech President emphasized, at the presentation of its book, that his subject has a great importance for him, and that is why it is both responsible for this cause.
He also expressed its satisfaction of what his book appears as well in the German translation, as he said, "I often meet only the load of my opinions."
Now, interested persons can read their positions without being deformed.
Klaus recalled that, although it is not climate, he, in his view, had enough provisions to edit such a book.
It is actually academic to follow and appreciate scientific treaties, he has the practice of statistics and is also economist.
The major conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following themes: Evolution of the climate, changes of it are therefore normal, there is no opinion shared by all researchers on global warming, the effects of current changes are not too important or too serious, therefore they are no danger and, finally, efforts to influence climate development are unnecessary, unacceptable and inacceptable.
In addition to experience of a totality regime, it is considered unacceptable to impose uncertain opinions to others, which it is as a dangerous arriving to freedom.
In response to the issues of the present person, he explained several times that it was not against "a reasonable environmental protection, but against an integrated environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the benefits they give".
In Vienna, Klaus had already spoken about this two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600 000 people have not been able to renew their driving permits in time
Six hundred thousand drivers left the deadline and failed to renew their elderly allowances to conduct with validity at the end of the year.
We are the last day where people can still ask for renewment, so that the authorities are through delivering them a new permission before the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers will take the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their permission to drive, especially those who do not want to conduct.
While the Commons report a disappearance of the number of requests for renewing the permission, the capital authorities are invaded for applications and the number of requests for renewing the permission has been increased this week.
Mayor was satisfied with about 2000 clients per day.
There's a chair of a half hours near.
Prague, nearly 140.OOO drivers have not yet renewed their drive permits.
The release of a new permission takes 20 days.
But it is possible to request deliverance within five days.
In that case, the driver pays an additional of five hundred corones.
The vehicle drivers that will not be able to renew the license of the driving permit from the end of the year and take the road without a valid permission will risk, since January, a amendment.
The complainant will be bound to pay two thousand krones to the maximum.
However, the police may also treat infringement with a friendly approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the amendment of 2500 corones is grimped.
According to old information, it was likely to be an amendment even a person who would not be circulated.
This could be obliged to pay up to 30,000 corones.
The Ministry had called the authorities to modify and to impose amendments not exceeding 1000 corners.
According to Karel Hanzelka's Department's Chamber, no one risks amendments in tens of thousands.
The driver permit is, according to it, a document that people can decide whether they want to have it or not.
It is not like the identity card that it must be valid without exceptions.
Persons who do not want to conduct should be allowed to drive.
It is sufficient to bring or send it to the corresponding municipality.
The driving permissions from 1964 to 1993 will remain valid at the end of the year.
However, vehicle drivers are also forced to progressively renew other types of drive permits.
Persons with documents dated from 1994 to 2000 have still three years of renewal.
The validity of driving permissions issued in the 2001-2004 years expired in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2,6 million other documents.
The Court has reduced the punishment of the detectives treated with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Kośaśík, former police accused of conciliation with David Berdych's gang, will be respectively thirty and ten years of prison.
The Supreme Court of Prague has so finally condemned them by reducing their punishment respectively of 1 and 2 years.
The detectives of the Department for Combating the Organized Crime were risked by sentences of 14 and 12 years of prison.
It is no longer possible to call against today's judgment, only a call to the Supreme Court is expectable.
Although Berdych is also accused of this case, he is not waiting for just the first instance.
However, he has already received in other proceedings of punishment over 16 years of prison.
He can't receive any more.
In January, the Departmental Court acknowledged 19 persons to participate in hold-up, and today the Supreme Court was treating the appeal interventions of 16 of them.
The majority of the infringements remitted, since the beginning of the investigation, the accused by claiming that it was a manipulated case.
According to the Court of Justice of the Central Body, police members, after another agreement with Berdych, transmitted to criminals of information from police sources, covered different hold-ups and helped the members of the gang to avoid criminal responsibility.
The gang was 30 per cent of the latrine in Opava and Kośaśík.
In the accused, it is questioned of the criminal activity of gang in the 1999-2001 years.
In particular, army flights whose victims, in most cases, suffer seriously from health, but also from the abuse of the power of a public and prohibited weapons.
When home searching, the police actually discovered illegally detained weapons, buses with a shoe, a vision for the direct laser shoes or a snake.
According to the accused, the gang was rid of tens of millions of crowns.
In addition to a twenty-five of men in this case, the courts have already recognized the guilty of other hand flights of Berdych and the whole number of others.
Other men of the Berdych neighbor are still in explanation before the court in another proceeding, some cases have not yet occurred before the court.
At the time, the main hearing avoided Tomáš Pśta and Maroš Šulej, who are now in detention in Ireland, where they are waiting for the final decision on their extradition in the Czech Republic.
Child substitution price: 12 million
Igor Veleba's lawyer wants to obtain a detriment of 12 million corones more expenditure.
Three million for each mother, two million for fathers and one million for each child.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each of the parents.
This is why the lawyer of the Hospital Ondśej Dostal is not absolutely agreed with the Veleba's proposal.
"We refuse such a return, that is very high," said Dostal to hearing.
"In order to make an opinion on the opposition, we need the expert report of which the counterparty has commanded the edition.
We'll check if it has any explaining value.
But we continue to think that the total amount should not exceed hundreds of thousands," said Dostal.
The amount should, according to him, be fixed between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jabloōov's family requested a million corones for each month where she couldn't remove her biological daughter.
Veleba was a expert report prepared for him by the University Hospital Center in Prague-Motol, as a document supported for defect negotiations.
According to psychology experts and psychiatrist, parents suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress at different levels and deep deep.
The stress situation was better supported by men, although they have been faced with the resents of not have prevented the replacement of new births.
Women, they remain less severe before the life of traumaism in the current and what is exactly happening at this time, summarised the content of the Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses in the hospital of Täebíč on 9 December.
Last week, children were returned to their biological parents - Nikola at the Pśibyslavice and Veronika at Libor Broś and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jablośov.
The Governor of the Vysočina Miloš Vystrčil, finally in October, delivered 100,000 corones for the reimbursement of the expenditure caused by the case of the hospital of Tōebízh.
All hospitals in Czechy are undertaken by the law on civil responsibilities.
In the case of lack, they must power in the reserve fund, exceptionally, they may request support to the manager.
As far as the courts recognized relatively few deteriorations, the figures were calculated after hundreds of thousands of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka lost Valašské Kralovstvi (the Kingdom of Valašsko)
Bolek Polívka lost the complaint about the Valašské kralovstvi (Royaume of Valašsko).
According to the court of the regional court of Ostrava, he was actually used for the first time the King's title of Valašsko, but the project was put on foot by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, the former collaborator of the actor.
Polívka was not present today's hearing.
But, according to his lawyer, the case is probably not done, and his client will call.
"The crime relates to the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team appear on the popularity of Bolek Polívka," said after the prosecutor of Polívka.
According to him, the Kingdom words of Valašsko speak to everyone just this actor and comic.
Harabiš is the same opinion.
"There's been a job of almost ten years behind us.
Search for money and development at the point of events," he said.
According to him, it's the money that's the cause of the fight.
"Besides the years, they found that the project had success and that they could benefit it.
They want to go on our work," he added.
It's a children's book, right?
According to the court, it is Polívka who first used the Valašskī král title (Walašsko king) in his television.
The actor Radoslav Brzobohatý had king it in 1993.
But at the time, it did not have a relationship with the project to put a valid kingdom on foot.
A few years later, Harabiš came with the idea to show passports from the Valašské Kralovstvi.
From a humoristic action to origin, it was a profitable business and trade activity, followed by Harabiš, the Valašské society, the creation of the Valaschské kralovstvi.
In 1997 Polívka agreed that his name and signature were quoted in the passport, and he even proposed the salary holders on the price of his firm visit and the theatre spectacles.
Who's going to sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also indicated that Harabiš was only using the nine idea published by Polívka in the emission handled to commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainly helped the Valašské kralovstvia project," said the judge.
However, she added that the soul of the project was formed by Harabiš and its team that would be intensified to the project.
The cooperation between today's enemy parties continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized a official coroning for Polívka in Vsetín.
But from there, conflicts began to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, which culminated with "the King Boleslav 1er elected forever".
The role of the Kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabiš, taken by the song Jamila Šulákova as the Reine of Mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka complained against Harabiš and its company, requested that the court has rejected today.
What could clearly shoot the case is the throne for the throne and a half of the princess.
He should get out of a new king.
He did not still want to trace details and date.
"We don't want to go fast.
That would be something like the kings' deceased in Slovacko.
The king would be elected for a certain time.
Even Mr. Polívka may obviously be inscribed," added Harabiš.
Test of Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VT: loss of prejudices
Actually, I have never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
His ruling quality was nothing extraordinary, the quality of speed change, conduct, and also the manufacturing could, at the same time, be qualified of inferry at the average.
However, there is now its successor on the market, the Peugeot 207, which is quite better.
As far as the named SW will go a step further, I'm still more to think better.
When I tested the classic haschback of the Peugeot 207, I sweared, for example, space for the head on the back seats.
When you finish the complaints because the combiner means that even the great devils will be in this regard.
Let's see fast done
I'm going to smile the inside so that I'm not too repeated.
This is a little successful design, my only comment on the central tunnel that seems to be poor.
There, I would like a little more inventive design, since the car seems so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the time when they could be complained of seats or too short files is revoked.
The Latin Guide has also been clearly improved in comparison with the 206 model.
As far as space, the increase in the carriage size is also sensitive.
The quantum can also lose the lack of place above the head already mentioned.
Coffee in the coffee
The most important on this vehicle is, therefore, his bag shoot.
I have to evaluate that as well available (equivalent by the back swimming glass) and a quite easy switch.
The green spaces are munius of arrest elastics that are an ideal compromise.
It is not composed and can be extended as able to hold sufficiently heavy objects.
But let's stop.
This is, according to tables, 428 l in the basic configuration, which is a relatively medium number in relation to competition.
Skip to škoda Fabia Combi, the most sales vehicle of this category in Czech.
If the 207 SW is compared to the new generation of Mlada Boleslav product, it is noted that Peugeot remains very sensitive behind, the difference is 52 litres.
When it is to go into ships to the foreign or to load a pocket, this number is almost critical.
But if I had to make the advantages, I would mention the lower box remaining after the reverse of the back seats perfectly right, or a very low walkpied.
120 redistributed horses on four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with a Otto motor of four cylinders with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And actually, this should be like a 1,6 that makes walking a family hashback.
He is quiet, consums little and, especially, he smells well.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by škoda that often gives the impression of having a swimming pocket cut by a snake, then I can only be entusiasmed.
Tariffs
The vehicle price is not approachable by everyone.
However, it must be aware that it has been tested a very well equipped car, with a spacious internal and a very good engine.
The base price of a vehicle with a Otto engine 1,4 litres from 329 900 Kč is still passable.
The vehicle we tested cost from 410 900 Kč, which is already enough.
Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price of 80 000 Kč.
But we have available more head-ups, automatic climateization, automatic swimming-flacks, an automatic command of the back windows...
In fact, the vehicle costs at the end of the account 531 900 Kč.
It's a lot, but try to add additional equipment to the Fabia price and you will get a very similar number.
So there is no more to choose the mark.
The integration of Slovakia students in British schools is bad
The number of children originating in Eastern Europe in British schools will grow, which causes concern for the development of local education.
The integration of the Europeans is now challenging to a series of obstacles.
The British schools even find cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of origin are transformed into violence.
The case of the Ken of the north, where the opposite conflicts remaining and immigrants of Slovakia, there is a great illustration of the problem of the integration of children originating in Eastern Europe.
Disputes, chicanos and bagarres among students have been transposed in the relationship between parents.
The situation was so far that the police arrested a Slovakia woman in Chatham who slaughtered a 10-year-old student.
The accused defended by claiming that the boy was insulted by racist proposals.
The police should also be involved in the attack against a Slovakian immigrant conducted by two adolescents.
The young girls were pretendingly addressed to this man of racist comments and cast stones to him.
"When we returned home, a young man gripped on the bus stop and began to smell us above.
When I told him to stop, he answered by pounds and weights and then found his fees," described another unpleasant adventure a mother of Slovakia students.
The complaints are made by the two parties.
One of the remainers went to qualify conflicts with immigrants in the fight for survival.
The higher cases show that atmosphere in the British schools between the people of origin and immigrants begins to be tendencied.
70.000 Slovakia comes to find work is registered in Britain.
And about 300,000 Slovakia students frequently have British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors, it's really a island of freedom.
Everything you're waiting for your conges can be achieved if you do a good choice.
Deep and white beaches such as snow, high vagues, or then a calm sea like a tang.
Palms and all inclusive with servers offering you on the beach a pizza, glass or swimming cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and rule.
On the Caribbean Islands, you will not find this list only in its integration but enrichy.
But there's only one island on which you'll find much more and it's Cuba, the greatest and beautiful island of the Great Antilles.
During the Spanishs, Cuba was the base of their American invasion.
Christophe Colomb qualified it as the most beautiful place that human eye has never seen.
Havana became the deposite and the place of transbordation of the treasures shooted by Spain and transported in Europe.
Then the American era came.
The National Hotel was established at the beginning of the 20th year.
It's Lucky Luciano, one of the chiefs of the United States mafia, who built it, because everything was a crime in the United States (for all under the ban) was accepted and supported in Cuba: drugs, hair games, prostitution.
Among his customers, there was, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havane, high buildings were rolled and cars, belonging to the worship symbols of the last 50th century, circulated on the large boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway purchased a property in San Francisco de Paula, near the Havane, and, in Cojímar, he had his yacht.
The stars of the business show and the political men of all America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita of the Medio.
And today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of the Havane Bodeguita.
In the National Hotel bar, a luxury hotel, you will mix the cocktail of your choice.
And these cults cars are always round to Havane, since the jigoulis and the imported fiats have already been in a so-called and humid climate.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is sensitively decredible, there are no wonderful colonial monuments that there are exactly there.
Other places become better, for example Trinidad.
Since tourism brings money if necessary, its development has green fire.
During the past 15 years, new hotels were not only in Havane, but especially in Varader, the coast of Holguín, and on the small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba also proposes a fanatie that is unique in the world and that will be particularly appreciated by small train amateurs.
The cane was returned from the extensive plants in sugars on a closed way by small vapor and motor trains.
Their rolling material has not been renewed for decades and this is how it can be seen in walking of small locomotives whose moderns are not only in museums.
Where to lead his steps?
Most visitors do not miss the most known places.
So there is no need to write it long on Varadero or well on Havane.
Unless remembering that in the property of Hemingway, already mentioned, there is a museum and that those who love this writer should not raise the visit.
The Valley of Viśales, west of the island, is one of the most pintors in Cuba.
A excursive vegetation and pushed on a calcaire soil.
Mogots, calcary balls and rocks mount in cookle from the valley, and, from the fertile land, they take into their wings, even their stones are recovery of a very deep vegetable mass.
The valley is the place where it is probably cultivated the Cuban smoke of the best quality.
You can meet the final form of this product if you visit one of the Havane cigarette manufactures.
Someone may also find interesting that there was turned the Chile episode of Major Zeman.
Trinity
An older one founded a few days after the Spanishs colonized the island.
This is the market of slave trade and the sugar that brought to him glory and riches.
The riches were incarnated in the beauty and the vineyard city of this reduced city.
Colonial španṣṭlská architecture, Vêrazná ovvná pozdjšimi Francouzskīmi osadniky, if twelve tèmi is têmníla.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the mountain massive Escambray, is a place such as in the last 50th century, there was no way to link this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay on the side.
We didn't build anything, and because we weren't demolizing anymore, everyone was pleased to have a roof over the head.
If there are, in Trinidad, more than a midday afternoon, it should be the pain to go also to see interesting places in the neighborhoods, such as Playa Anconn Beach or the Valley of Sucrees.
Then, the evening, it is convenient to go to the House of the Music, who lives after the sun bed and where music is just a little morning.
Baracoa
Some designate this bargade located in the extreme Eastern Cuba as the most beautiful island.
This opinion is certainly influenced by the way it leads.
The two roads from Guantánamo have to switch high and accidental mountains and cross a landscape almost without marks of human activity.
UNESCO has registered the East Cuban school, through its intact landscape, on the list of the global patrimonie.
There is the best chocolate, at the church, there is Christophe Colomb's cross (in fact, she saw a few hundred years after the colleague of Colomb) and from the colline where the old chateau-force and the current hotel El Castillo is seen several table mountains, the most famous of El Y даже.
About the coffee, the rhum, the cigarettes, the mountain massif Sierra Maestra, the Baiie of the Trues and the Pinos Island, the Tropicana cabaret, the sanctuary of the Holy Patron of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, Santeria, the African religions practised by the descendants of the former slaves, all of this could be filled with a number of pages.
Just as we just say, it's better to see once.
Alliances in Afghan are passive, as a result, the Americans
The lack of soldiers and equipment necessary is influenced, according to the United States, on the launch of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to the Minister of Defence Robert Gates, NATO should choose a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghan was not carried out as it should, in Edinburgh, Scotia, the representatives of the countries who have troops in the south of the country agreed.
In addition to the growing contest of the Taliban movement, the eight States involved are now discussing future plans and the coordination of the allies.
While the United States called for this week by the Minister of Defence Robert Gates the NATO troops to a greater activity, the United States considers the strengthening of the Afghan Government and the intensification of development aid.
"Evolution in Afghanistan is perceived, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other means to allow people to start a new development of the economy and security", said BBC Chamber, the British Minister of Defence Des Browne.
Four-twenty-dix per cent
The activity of the Afghan insurers is, according to the American Army data, the most intense of the past five years.
The number of violent actions increased 27 per cent in the past year, up to 60 per cent in the province of Helmand, located in the south of the country.
NATO countries have about 400,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, which are nearly one fourth in the southern part.
However, according to the United States, alliances have reached their absolute limitation and in the organization and in the equipment of armies.
Concretely, they ask other helicopters, soldiers and experts for the training of the Afghan armies.
"We must seriously reflect on the concrete objectives for the future period as well as on the way to achieve them," said Gates.
The secretariat-General of the NATO of Hoop has held similar proposals today.
"I am not pleased of what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghan.
We have some 4-20 percent of soldiers and equipment we needed, and that's not enough," said De Hoop to the Reuters Agency at the end of talking with the Japanese government in Tokyo that had three days.
Who is passive
These last months will also rule among the countries involved in conflicts on the issue if all the allies are effectively in Afghan as possible.
For example, Germany was criticized for its passiveness.
"The Germans had a relatively numerous representation in Afghanistan.
But they are involved in areas where violence is minimum, the fight requirements which they are subject are not so strict than those in the South and Eastern countries where we work", said Gates.
The British Sun Table has qualified German soldiers this week.
"The Afghan fans found: Germans play, while we fight," wrote Sun in a document complemented by photos of German soldiers playing at the table tennis.
The German Journal Image was on the counter-attack by publishing the photo of a British troop during a ruby match in the south of Afghanistan.
The debt of the State will be a billion in 2009
The charge of a debt of the State exceeding 84.000 Crowns is complied with each Czech.
The total debt has been allocated to 842.7 billion of corones at the end of September.
The government had planned to take this year 159.2 billion corones.
The Ministry has reduced the sum planned to 152.8 billion corones through an evolution of the budget of the State.
The debt of the State of the Czech Republic is allocated to the end of September to 842.7 billion corones.
During the nine months of this year, he increased 40.2 billion corones.
However, from June, he decreased 13.4 billion corones.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has confirmed its data on the debt of the State dated early October.
The load of a debt exceeding 84.000 Czech.
During the last year, the State was over 111 billion corones.
"For this moment, it seems that, through a less important deficit planned for the next year, the border of an billion coron only in 2009 could be exceeded.
The next year the debt should be between 900 billion and a billion corones' analyst of Patria Finance David Marek for the iHNed.cz server.
The provision of the next Finance Analyst Vladimir Pikor is likely: "We could exceed the billion in 2009.
The specific date will depend on the next budget that is not yet known.
If the situation on the political scene seemed to be changed, that policies were ready to increase economicity, the date could be delayed in 2010.
But I don't expect this change," he said.
Debts grow
The debt of the State is constituted by the debts of the Central Government and is mainly generated by the accumulation of State budget deficiencies.
The debt of the State is financed by goods of the treasurer, retail titles, direct loans or, for example, by employees to the European Investment Bank.
This year, it increased 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion corones.
The external debt of the State has increased this year at the time of 1.7 billion corones to 123.3 billion corones.
The debt of the called negotiatable State reached at the end of September 803.3 billion corones and from June he decreased 13.7 billion corones.
The average requirement of the State debt was 6.5 years old.
" The total debt has increased inter-yearly from the first to the third half of 13 percent, which is taking into account the current economic health of a too high number.
It is interesting that growth is especially generated by profit titles where it reaches 20 per cent.
It is bad that debt believes, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be a matter to negotiate when the retrait reform will come", commented Pikora's data.
Better than what we expected
It was understood by the State financing and debt strategy for 2007 that the Government had planned to allocate 159.2 billion corones this year.
However, at the beginning of September, thanks to the evolution of the economy of the State budget as expected, the Ministry reduced the sum planned to 152.8 billion corones.
The sum is mainly constituted by the deficit of the State budget, which is obvious to reach 76 billion corones this year, at the place of the initially planned 91.3 billion corones.
It is then the maximum sources for the Czech Republic of Consolidation, which are 13.3 billion corones, the reserve of 10 billion for the payment of retraits, the financing of state refunds for 43 billion corones and the reimbursements of the European Investment Bank resulting from 1.8 billion.
She compared today before a court in Khartoum to have named a sweet bone
The British Teacher judged in Sudan for insulting in Islam was sentenced on Thursday night by a Khartoum court at 15 days of prison and exploding, announced his lawyer.
The British was accused of having left students from 6 to 7 years of age to give Mahomet's name to a sweet bone while all representation of the Islamic prophet is illegal.
She was able to pass the punishment of a bitch shock.
This British Institutor of 54 years of age at the High School of Khartoum in Sudan was arrested Sunday at her home and accompanied by the Islamic and Section, under article 125 of the Sudan Criminal Code, following several complaints of student parents at the Ministry of the Sudan education.
The story is in fact restored in September, when this teacher requests his students 6/7 years old to choose a name for the hour in the class.
"There are names from the mouth of the children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," tells the director of school Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 children on 23 have chosen Mohamed as a favorite name.
Mohamed is certainly the name of the Muslim prophet, but especially a very common name in the Sudan.
The children then performed a book for the class with the photo of the hour followed by the legend "My name is Mohamed".
The smell itself did not have any label with that name, but the problem is just the representation of the prophet considered as an insulto in Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' musulman colleagues, who teached in the same school in Sudan, explained that he knew it well and that she would never have done anything that could be insulting against a religious faith, "I regret that she had asked the children to vote for a name," it is only to say to him "innocent error".
Advisory shared by many students from the institutor who describe it as "speakly attention to his students" and "who never speaks of religion in class".
Remember that the first name Mohamed is also the second most name given in Britain, it writes in 14 different ways.
This name often chose by Muslim families is a way to honor the prophet (which is given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules on the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give him a game?
It is, of course, a question of interpretation.
They have not reached a merry agreement on the future status of the province at the last negotiations meeting in Vienna.
Finally, the failure.
The Serbs and the Albanians of Kosovo finished Monday in Baden, Austria, a sixth and last discussion meeting without having been able to overcome their divergences on the future status of the separate province.
“It is regrettable that the parties were not able to reach an status agreement” said the European Mediator Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Recalling that peace in the region was “in game”, his American homology, Frank Wisner urged Belgrado and Pristina to respect their commitments to maintain peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
“We do not preserve violence in immediate but we are in a very difficult period”, he added that “a clear tension exists.”
End of mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the Troika, who group the European Union, the United States and Russia, will take place last Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province of 90% of Albanophones could become more clear when Ishinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will bring their report to the United Nations Security Council from 10 December.
Baden's debate near Vienna was the sixth and last negotiation session since Troika was taken by the United Nations in August last.
Americans and Europeans believe that their mediation will be completed on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the Security Council's authorisation of independence in Kosovo, insist on a continued negotiation over the time of busy.
"The Russian was and remained involved in a negotiated solution, a compromise solution", said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Declaration of unilateral independence?
After eight years of the Dutch administration of Kosovo, the Westerns believe that the EU's independence under supervision is the only viable solution.
Pristina is prepared to declare it unilaterally if the Security Council does not take place in his favor.
Belgrade insists on an increased autonomy.
"Thankly, no agreement has been found", announced the President of the autonomy authority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the Baden Hotel where these "negociations of the last chance" were deployed since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, the former commander of the cosovary rebellion and the future Prime Minister of the province, was part of his regrets.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade “is belonging to a past that led to murder and deportation”.
‘Domain effect’
The Serbian President Boris Tadic estimated that a commitment was always expected by maintaining the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of an unilateral declaration of the province's independence.
Belgrade, in particular, said to reduce a 'domino effect' in a region still fragilized by the 1990s-related wars of independence.
“For Serbia, did it say, it does not mean that a compromise is impossible.”
Thursday, the Serbian delegation had emphasized that any decision would return exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian alliance had a veto right.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word"
“As a solution within the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia” said the Serbian Prime Minister, Vojislav Kostuni.
"These negotiations have been held two years.
They must end as they have started: to the Security Council.'
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had answered that “the Kosovo Parliament will be the last word on the status”, adding that any unilateral declaration of independence of the Albanians would be ‘in concertation’ with the Western.
Bush struck an agreement between the Israelites and the Palestinians
President George Bush announced, at the opening of the International Peace Conference, its care in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israelites and Palestinians finally agreed on a common declaration.
He explained that the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had heard to initiate negotiations immediately in order to find a definitive regulation of the age of 60 years between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them to conclude a "life Trade" before the end of 2008.
Among the time, the Palestinians must defeat "terrorism infrastructure" and Israel must end to its colonization activities, said Bush, recalling both parties to their obligations in view of the "road fire" for the peace they have accepted in 2003.
The Chief of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim " to conclude a peace treaty which resolves all issues suspended, without exception, including central issues".
This call is recovered by the three deep problems of the content of the Israelites and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestinian, the status of Jerusalem, and the sort of Arab refugees cast out of their homes in what is today the State of Israel during the conflict of 1948.
By taking the word after the President of the United States, Abbas emphasized that future negotiations should be "global and deep" and are on all aspects of a regulation, which means "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others".
As far as his tribe turned, Olmert understood the future talkers to be "direct and continuous" and to "develop an effort to strike them in the course of 2008".
Bush established at the end of 2008 the time for its implementation of the "vision of two Palestinian and Israeli States" which coherently exist.
Saudi Arabia revealed that she had received a commitment to Bush before decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a successful success for Washington, is the origin of a plan, which is engaged by all Arab countries, which proposes the peace of Israel in exchange of its retreat of all Arab Territories occupied during the war of 1967, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a carrefour in the Middle East history, especially because he attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", believes Prince Saoud in his interview with the Saudi Arab newspapers.
For the provision, the police are not responsible.
What happened exactly Sunday?
As every time in this kind of fact, official and rumor versions are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the survey of the National Police Inspection (IGPN), a police car circled a Sunday after 17 hours, Louise-Michel Street in Villiers-le-Bel.
“He was not in intervention but in patrol, and circulated 40-50 km/h, without gyrophare”, explains a police source.
A green moto of the Kawazaki Mark, “not authorized, therefore not allowed to circulate on the public road” (lease below) and piloted by two young people without ships, circled “to very alive”.
“He surveyed the police car on his left, after a priority refusal to the right,” a police officer explains.
The control of alcohol practitioned on vehicle occupants was negative.
The state of the car (from shocked, shocked, shocked shocked) has witnessed to the violence of the shock.
Soon, last morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Theere de Gibry, announced a investigation for "involuntary murder and non-assisting person in danger" at the IGPN, which is with the headquarters of the public security of the Val d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the assure states that the investigation of the IGPN at this stage was deleted by police officers.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, heard Sunday night, confirmed "the version of the police, that this mini-moto has arrived relatively quickly on their left."
Last night, a kind of rain, unlikely caused by the fleet of the soil chairs, showed that the two vehicles remained full of the time that the police's car had come to shut up.
The vehicles have been entered and will be obtained in a technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsised last night.
What happened just after?
On the other hand, a roller quickly circled in Villiers-le-Bel, according to the fact that the police would very fast leave the places, not preparing so for the two young people.
The IGPN, while remaining careful, would also disappear “all serious fault” in this regard.
“It is an aspect of the harder investigation, which requires more surveys, on which it must be very careful,” said a police source.
Liberation met an ocular witness of these seconds that followed the accident.
One of its windows given specificly on the scene.
"We've immediately descended, with my cousin who is nursing to the hospital, to try to rebuilt them, tell this witness.
There was nothing to do."
He then saw “un policeman who bought.
Two other tried to restore one of the young people, the fourth talked on the phone."
With the tension that quickly turned around the scene, and it seems to be the certainty that the young people had presented the unexpected situation, the police were taken in car by colleagues arrived in the place.
According to this testimony, the help has arrived “around twenty minutes after the department of the police”.
They also practiced cardiac mass, and just.
"I will not let you say that police services have not helped youths.
These young people have been shocked.
The bombs arrived immediately.
Everything was done to try to save them," stressed the prosecution from his side.
The mounting tension to Pakistan
Pakistani police repressed the first events since the emergency status was established two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, in the east of the country, some 2.000 lawyers who expressed the measures taken under the emergency state were blessed by the lacrymogen grenades used by the order forces, according to witnesses.
The last ones have been ridden by stone jets, blessing policers.
At least 350 lawyers have been interrupted.

In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court called on a general strike and announced manifestations, following some 500 arrests during the weekend of opposites, human rights warrants and lawyers.
The streets with access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday to prevent the assembly.
Other manifestations would have been held in Multan (center) and Peshawar (on-west).
The movement of lawyers was gathered for the support of the religious parties grouped in the powerful Buthida Majlis-e-Amal Alliance, whose President called for the population to send flowers to judges who have been proclaimed against the state of emergency and detrition to those who have been prepared in order to Musharraf'.
'The promise of Musharraf does not hold'
The Palestinian Supreme Court is directly referred to by the measure of exception declared Sabbath night.
It should be held in the next days on the legal basis of the election of the President, on 6 October, at the indirect question of President Musharraf.

More than a third of the grossy remains unexpected
This calculation takes into account the unwanted grossies (24 per cent) as well as the unexpected or unexpected births.
Today, more than a pregnancy of three (36%) is not planned (36%), a study conducted by the National Institute for Demographical Studies (Inded), 40 years after the vote of the Newer Law, which liberalized the contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account the unwanted grossies (24 per cent) as well as the unexpected or unexpected births.
The different contrast methods such as pills or sterel are still a failure rate of 5% to 6%, estimates Ined.
The liberalization of the contraception has also allowed a better "master of fecondity", according to the Institute, which notes that the use rate of pillar in women from 20 to 44 years has been from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight births on ten would be well planned today.
You can be calculated nearly for a couple in five and if possible in the spring, you'll be jumped as the most pleasant for having a child.
Spectacular reparation on the space station
There would be more than seven hours of work in the space at the Scott Parazynski astronaut and the international Space Station (ISS) vessels to perform the spectacular reparation of a discovered solar panel, essential for the continuation of the scientific activities of the station.
A risked output that accumulated the records from the fact of its duration, from the distance of the habitable modules, of the speed with which it was imagined, of the tools "brilled" by the astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem occurred march when the astronoms had downloaded the Harmony Module, a large cylindric part of the European and Japanese laboratorys (see framework).
This module is a type of appendix for laboratory modules.
But there is a need to be able to provide them in electricity.
The second task of the equipment was therefore to move an electricity production module by weighted solar panels, 17.5 tonnes already on the ISS, in order to put it on its final position.
After moved it, the team has engaged the re-deployment of the module's solar panels with a 76 meters.
And that's where one of the panels, which divide themselves as consenses, was damaged near one meter by a cable cut down.
The deployment was stopped to do not hurt the panel anymore.
The astronauts, who had to originate a control output of the Discovery ship, then go to repair another sun pane, the rotation system was defectuous, were obliged to connect to the damaged panel.
And this is Scott Parazynski that was chosen to go to characterize the top of the 30 meters long of the telecommanded arm of the ship added to the station to perform the repair.
It's one of the best "spacewalker" (space marchers) of Nasa.
The big, resisting, very widespread, he taste him very developed and long arms.
So, at 46 years, this training doctor was responsible for ‘operating’ the sun pane 'free'.
After specifically inspected the degrees, he separated the fault and installed types of "attics" on the damaged area.
He was helped by a second "spacewalker" remained near the salt and, inside, by the other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the commander of the team.
The tool that he used was designed, an isolated mini-hockey channel to avoid electricity on the solar panels which produced several hundreds of volts, was designed and broken by the astronauts on the board of the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski expected the panel to be completely disployed before making its tools the inventor and rearing the inside of the station.
Last afternoon, the astronoms benefited from a half-day detention before today, seven astronautes do not rule the Discovery ship for a return to the earth planned Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned in Bourse
The EADS Action is currently slightly slow to Paris's bourse, after the Aeronautic and Defence Group announced that it should be expenditure between 1.1 and 1.4 billion euros to face the delays of A400M.
EADS lost 4% to 21.96 euros at the Paris Bourse currently.
The group was obliged to revise its operational result prevision for 2007 following the delays generated by the slow progress of the development of the A400M engine, which constitutes the inaugural flight of the aircraft.
The cost of rolling the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft, announced in October, is '1.2 to 1.4 billion euros of more than 1 billion for Airbus', announced the mother house of the European EADS constructor.
As a result of these charges, EADS will be committed to announce new operational result objectives for 2007 during the presentation of its next quarterly results on Thursday, it adds no more crypted specifications.
The group also indicates that the estimation of new charges is coherent with the delay of six months.
In reminder, the operational result of EADS was 86 per cent in 2006, mainly due to loads related to the delays of another program, the larger A380.
Initially, the Group proposed a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
There will be no suspension on Sunday at the exit of the urnes: the Russians will spend massively for the party of President Poutine, Russians.
Reaffirming their aspiration to stability, even the authorism, after a very slow campaign.
At three days of the legislative elections, the Russian President Vladimir Poutine addressed today to the elections a television message on public chain, already already, but whose content is secret.
He made it as the head of Russian unity list, the pro-Krimlin party whose victory is advertised.
Today, the President has nothing to transparency by receiving foreign Ambassadors, joying to deliver a new load against the Western accused of inheritance - his prediction theme during the campaign.
"We know the price of a true democracy and we want honest elections, the most transparent and the openest elections, without augmentation elections," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we're far from the account.
It declares a press campaign.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov said that there have never been "also selling elections, even at the time of Eltsin".
After the repression of the manifestations of the last weekend, the former champion of the world of failure Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days of prison for illegal manifestation, remains prohibited by visiting according to his lawyer.
"The Russians have maintained the mentality of the Soviet Homo"
Afterwards these unstopped legislatives are profiled two more open questions:
- Who will happen to Putin at the presidency?
The official newspaper published on 2 March 2008 the first tour of the presidency; the candidates were until 23 December to take place.
Elected in 2000 and re-electioned in 2004, Vladimir Poutine can not commit a third consecutive mandate.
Or no poster is embarrassed.
- What role will Poutine play after March?
Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and all the powerful Russian unity party that would choose the government and the President?
Whatever it is, both legislative and the President, the triomphere power is.
It's a tradition.
“The Russians have maintained the mentality of the Soviet Homo, they do not feel masters of their destination”, estimates the sociologue Lev Goudkov, director of the Levada Independent Centre.
The historical Nikolai Kopossov, from the University of State of Saint Petersburg, was far away: civil society has delayed in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous Community spirit has delayed the training of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Poutine renewed with the model of a paternalist state, perfectly accepted by the population as much more than this new patriarchism has not been followed by the terrestrian, but by a certain economic asylum," says Mary Lipman, the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians “affirmed full gratitude to personal responsibility” whom they had writtenly proved after the U.S. dismissed.
"What do you think?"
The phenomenon affects all social beds, including the business world.
And the administrative election intends to preserve the status quo: 65 rulers (before 85 Russian leaders) leading to the local Russian lists.
The new freedoms imported from Western is often synonyms of chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
On behalf of which the Russians will not vote for extremists.
Tamara Tcherednitchenko, Professor of 54 years of age, concludes: "What do you think?
Those who are in power aren't too bad, why change them?”
A Low Memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the nazis archives of Bad Arolsen, who retrace the destiny of 17.5 million victims of the Chile regime, are freely accessed.
The 47 million archiving documents, delivered on 27 km line at Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were only consultable in a “humanitarian goal”, namely individually and nominatively, on request for an elderly victim or his rights.
The 11 States supported their management - from Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historical researchers.
The ratification process by all States has been completed, the opening is effective since yesterday.
Sensible information
The access of historists to Bad Arolsen will be enabled to conduct research “in particular on the movement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health status of forced workers” explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, opposed the public to these designative documents, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the proposed homosexuality or mental disability of certain deportation victims.
The registers of the concentration camps or arrest mandates established by Gestapo were gathered after the war in a practical purpose: to restore the deported citizens or to submit to the binding work and, where appropriate, to give them a evidence of their internal provision to open the way to their compensation.
Today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees relate to tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is limited.
“There is nothing new to wait for these documents,” said Pr Wolfgang Benz, director of the University of Berlin Technology, in 2006.
EU and India want to achieve a free exchange agreement in 2008
Today, the Indian-European bilateral trade has already reached nearly 60 billion euros per year.
EU is India's first commercial partner and represents 18% of its external trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free exchange agreement in 2008, reported the European Commissioner to Commerce Peter Mandelson and its Indian homologue Kamal Nath.
The Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the EU gave in April their green fire to the European Commission for negotiations to sign free trade agreements with India, South Korea and South-East Asian Countries (Asia), which already reached nearly 60 billion euros per year.
EU is India's first commercial partner and represents 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also his first foreign investor, but India is only the nineth trade partner of the EU, according to the European Commission figures.
"Everything free trade package of the two economys" and "India would improve its access to a market of 450 million Europeans", justified Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, specificated by the European Commissioner. The Asian and European Gentiles are exchanged annually for "47 billion euros of goods" and for "10 billion euros of services", stated this week, the President of the European Commission's delegation in New Delhi, who regrets that the bilateral trade has not yet reached the potential.

The Bank of England takes concerns by offering 10 billion books over five weeks
The English Bank was concerned about the current return of concerns on credit conditions, and announced a offer of ten billion books at the base rate of 5,75% over five weeks, an inhabited period.
"To emphasize the concerns that the financial market conditions will be particularly closed at the end of the year, and to give the banks a greater certainty in the way they will organize their liquidity positions in this period, the Bank intends to offer an important proportion of its allocation of reservations for the maintenance period of 6 December, as a form of an open market operation for five weeks," indicates in a communication.
The bank precisely shows that 10 billion books (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on 6 December to 12H15 GMT, at the base rate and up to 10 January.
It seems to be the first time that the BoE places the liquidity market for five weeks in an open market operation.
That's normally one week.
In its communication, the EEA adds that "he is ready to take other measures to maintain the rates" of interbank loans on the day online with its basic rate.
The daily interbank rate was 5.829 per cent.
The three-month rate was 6.6%, one higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer’s financial crisis, the markets placed by the Bank of England were assured by a significant penalty rate that had distorted the banks to have received it.
According to some rumors, corrupted by the evolution of the book in relation to the euro, many prefered to subscribe markets by the European Central Bank, to more advantageous rates and with a more safeer discretion.
UMP and NC reject the review of PS proposals on purchase power
The UMP and New Centre groups refused to discuss the proposal for socialist law on the purchase power, which is equal to a rejection of the text.
The text, registered in a socialist 'now' (session at the initiative of a parliamentary group), declined a decade of measures taken by the National PS Office, among which the 50% of the prize for employment, the restructuring of the floating TIP, a cheque-transport or the introduction of loans.
UMP and NC voted against the consideration of the items (180 votes against 115), the meeting was highlighted at the outcome of the general discussion which was held to exchange, sometimes living, between majority and opposition at a few hours of the television intervention of Nicolas Sarkozy on the purchase power.
The Chairman of the PS-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of its proposals as amendments to the draft corrective finance law reviewed by the Assembly in the next week.
A new festival seeing the day
Following many rums about the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promotor/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with the British producer Melvin Benn Festival.
"For our company, it's a honour to work with a person who has no longer inspired the current movement of festivals in America," gave Charlie Jones from C3 to Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza of Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vienna, in New Jersey, is a statue destination for the campsite.
The festival should be held from 8 to 10 August on a private firm of 500 aras at about 40 minutes of Philadelphia.
Another time known under Mean Fiddler, the director of the Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festivals in the world.
In 1989 he took the Learning Festival Bar in the United Kingdom, which spends about 800,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, then, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Festival Festival Latitude of Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as a co-owner, Melvin Benn was also responsible for the production, granting licences and organizational tasks of Glastonbury Festival, which can now welcome up to 177.500 people.
Califiant Glastonbury's most inspiring event in which he never attended, Charlie Jones of C3 said that his company and Melvin Benn's company work parallelly to give the region a European style festival.
"Our aircraft chose Philadelphia as a market and we work with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in the centre of Philadelphia," supported Charlie Jones.
"We were talking with the city and the Commission was motivated and encouraging by this project.
Unfortunately, we have been engaged in politicians because of the current administration, Charlie Jones, continues.
"Happy, we have been able to discuss with Melvin Benn and we learn to create a super festival on a exceptional site that will lastly serve the population of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza Festival in 2005 at the Grant Park of Chicago, after being launched in the camping of festivals in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
The two events registered gross income of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals are held in the urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a camping festival, while our people are placed in urban green spaces," says Charlie Jones.
The objective is to fusion, in one way or in another, the two forms to give both a press of a camping festival to the European and urban American.”
Vienna is near the mid-chamin between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The community of Vienna, including the master, encouragingly supports the holding of this event,” said Charlie Jones.
This latter refuses to revele the conditions of the agreement, but says, "If they are sufficiently interesting to allow investing in such an event and welcome a festival that, hopedly, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the accommodation capacity of this festival is “which great” instead of the 800,000 people of Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said that invitations were launched to the groups, but that there was nothing to be confirmed at the time to go under press.
"Vineland will be saving rock, but music will be varied there, in the hope of shooting all kinds of spectators," said Charlie Jones.
His partners from C3, who received the Top Independent Prize Promoting the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It's not easy to touch Hollywood film plates in Montreal when no other than Terminator is opposed...
This seduction mission is part of the delegated functions.
A mandate - “politically difficult” because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denotes the “reunaway productions”.
Is it difficult to play in the "Governator" patches?
"It must be careful, it is the industry that decides where she goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she'll go.
Our role is offering those who will judge the best," he says.
The course to festivals
For now, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is the promotion of the film here.
The course at Oscars is started.
It will be of all the celebrations of the Western Cities, which is the Sundance, Denver, Seattle, or San Francisco, to present whatbecous films, to put them in value, and to ensure that the realists have interviews.
The age of darkness had a beautiful vitrine at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is at the show in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
The Quebec also presented four long and four short metros to the American film Institute Fest this month.
Is there a final year-end rally in swimming?
In less than five weeks of the completion of the year, investors are already frozen by expecting the arrival of the end-year rally tradition.
However, this year the experts are not even some that will happen.
Banif believes that " from the statistical point of view, the month in December is generally a positive behavior.
However, it should not be made exclusively based on statistics, as the current context has been given, incertitudes are at least on markets, in a short term. "
Although they are not partisan to take the ball for the last weeks of the year, these experts noted that "the boiling market is feeding by the existence of liquidity, available to invest the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially the fixed income, affected by the effect of escape to quality values as well as in the long periods and in the short."
For this, they believe that the barrier will be a late, not unexcept of volatilities, because it is not aware of the effect of the probable decline of the Fed rates, given the high level of brutal and the risk of inflational tension stimulation."
Javier Barrio, who is responsible for BPI sales in Spain, agrees that it is not the right time to say there's a rallye.
"It's not the best thing", ensures the expert.
Ibex, the Spanish boursier index, lost about 4 per cent since 8 November when the index was closed to 15.945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative vision.
Juan Solana, an analyst of Intermoney, believed that Ibex 35 could close the year to 16.000 points through the reorganization of portfolios and the traditional delivery to retreat schemes that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert nervous that things will be a little different this year, since he believes that rallye will take place from December 2nd week, after the bridge of the Constitution (6 December).
The analyst does not consider volatility to affect the market trend.
For its part, Federico Olucha, an Investis Bank analysis, evaluates that we are near the technical levels and "for this reason we could observe a rebonding of the index that could be caused on the basis of information coming from the European Union on the consequences of the crisis on the market".
The analyst hopes that these will be positive.
Analysts are agreed to choose the values that are responsible for conducting the Ibex to new maximum counts.
Solana, from Intermoney, claims "the great values are back for him this year."
The expert would include the two large banks and some constructors in the portfolio "for when the date is near, the electrical sector will be very valuable".
While Inversis Bankco, Federico Olucha, ensures that hairs will be from the bank and the industrial sector.
Constructions can also benefit from this rally, where they are put.
"ACS has been backing positions for a few months and we hope that the other buildings like Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same way," explains the expert.
Cyclic consumption will be protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technological enterprises will do so very well, although there are no representation on the Spanish market in this case.
Five times for seven years
During the last seven years, only for two occasions the month of December was a month of bathroom.
The authentic finish rally has occurred in 2003, during which the bourgeois markets have been deleted from the crisis caused by the technological swimmingness.
This year, in which Ibex 35 was recovered by 28.17%, the month of December registered an increase of 6,68%.
If 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of profit (for the time Ibex has increased 8.36 per cent since January) and if it has succeeded in computer on its final year rally.
The Popular Bank will open 200 offices on Sunday at 12 hours
The Popular Bank decided to renew a large part of its offices.
In total, 200 banks are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These succursales, which will operate under the Popular Max mark, represent a great change for the bank.
So for the rest of the Spanish organizations, since it was the first group that decided to start talking about the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 20:30, and to open the Saturday from 10:30 to 20:30.
Another group that also reiterates several times that it would like to extend the time of its succursales, BBVA, even if it has not yet decided to do the first step.
It is about to conclude an agreement with the unions to close 75 per cent of its agencies instead of opening a afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the experience of the Popular Bank will be decisive that other organizations adhere or not to this initiative which coheres to trade hours.
This is precisely the objective to search for the Popular Bank.
To access autonomy customers that are circle in these areas to make their purchase in SMEs and the trade of the streets selected to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 agencies throughout Spain for about 18 months, as it is not the opening of new agencies but a renewing of those already existing.
For this reason, the body will modernize the succursale that is already in the commercial areas, adapting them to the customers' profile of the different streets.
Thus, the simplification of the clocks is accompanied by a different design from the succursale and a new, more current design, with lighter colors.
The banking manager, Angel Rivera, ensures that this renewal does not include large investments, but the employees' employee number increases from six to eight or nine by agency.
The Agencys, which will also have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financing products.
A positive experience for the group
The Popular Bank has already tested its initiative in three Madrid Agencys.
And the experience was positive, as Angel Rivero explains.
The Succursales of the Murillo Brave Streets, O'Donnell and the Great Vía of Madrid are the streets to have been selected, and apparently, according to the Rivero.
The Popular Bank has now 2.500 succursales.
And 60 other who worked under the Mundocredit mark, specialized in the case of immigrants, also with very wide time, even the Sunday and the holiday days.
In these PopularMax agencies they do not copy the BBVA model, where many of its Agencys have a large number of non-financing products for their sale.
' We do not want to compete our customers, ' says Rivero.
For the moment, they arrived in an agreement with Telephone to sell mobile phones, with an external staff to the bank.
Tv for the first time the value in Bourse of its rival Antena 3
We've come there.
With this phrase Paul Vasile, a delegated adviser of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction, at the closure of the bourcier market, when he found that the chain he guided doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
A unique aspect of joy was: 'What does bad me, it's not the fact that we've been increasing but we're less low,' he stated.
However, he emphasized the fact that on a low market, we had less declined.
Telecinco finished last day with a progression of 2.54 per cent.
This gain stabilises its loss of 15.66% for one year.
The value in Bourse of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52 % of the capital) and announced by Vocento (13 % more) reaches 4.488.88 million euros, according to Bloomberg data.
His Rival Antena 3, which has ceased 1.52% last night and accumulated 40.5% from January, costs half, 2.193.46 million.
The value of the other communication companies in Bourse is of 3.575 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518.53 million in the Prisa (Finco Días editor) and 1.779 million in the Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenne 3 is due to the fact that we talk to two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do, on the same market, to what price and how we reward it in terms of hearing.
Telecinco announced last week that he intended to become the first television chain to exceed 1,000 million brutal advertising income, such as Joseph Tringali, the delegated advisor of Telecinco and Publicspana, the branch that manages the advertising of the group.
In order to be real, the television chain should register for the current year an increase of 3.6 per cent in its facture for publicity compared to 965.4 million of 2006.
For its part, the net facturation of Antenne 3 increased by 1.6 per cent in the first nine months of the biennium (to reach 734.4 million), while net television income increased by 0.7 per cent (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to the best relative trend of Telecinco in Bourse is the important payment that he has maintained until now: in 2006, Alejandro Echevarría has distributed 100 per cent of the benefit between its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that, although it is early to take a decision, this ratio could vary after purchasing Endemol 33% and in association with Mediaset.
' We have the official commitment to give at least 50 per cent, although we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to congratulate our shareholders, to those whom we have already given titles with 33 per cent of Endemol.
According to analysts, the market gives signs of fatigue at this time.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced the benefits estimates on Telecinco in 2008 to 4 per cent and 2009, to 7 per cent.
This should be explained to the decrease of the expected growth of income from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and of 5,5 per cent to 5,1 per cent in 2009.
The same enterprises reduced the expectation of Antena from 3 to 4,5 per cent in 2008 and to 7.5 per cent in 2009.

Good accepted to be the candidate of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo and to preside the Congress if they win the elections
The former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary-General of Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to be headed by the list of Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the next general elections and to be President of the Congress where socialists will win general elections.
Thus, the organization secretariat of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco, and Bono even announced it during a press conference after the meeting that held the mid-day meeting with Zapatero.
The Executive Chief justified the offer made to the former Minister because "is important to account on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best."
He also stressed that "hey seems to" that the political man of La Manche will be the candidate of the socialist group that will preside in the Congress if socialists will win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of the Congress, who made it public on 15 November last its decision not to be presented to the next general elections and to abandon his political carriage to engage in combating climate change in the university framework.
The former Minister acknowledged that the President of the Government did not stop attending that he returned to the previous political guard since he abandoned it two years ago.
He also noted that, even though citizens already know who would be the Economic Vice-President if the Spanish Socialist Party wins elections, his party wanted to announce that he would preside in a "transparency act".
If he reaches the post, Bono hopes to transform the room into "a house of respect and not insult or cri" and to make "that seems more like the citizens".
"For the time it seems regrettable that the only local in Madrid where we cannot speak quietly and calmly is the Congress, the President of the Government in Senate has been interrupted 26 times."
Similarly, he had words for his current President, Manuel Marín and "to know" and he did not want to do as if he had already worked for not to fall, as he noted, in which his adverse could be considered "a rule".
A climate propaganda
Since the movement against climate change is a persecution without misunderstanding, as well as the sceptics of its predictions and those who give priority to other political and social battles, it must be demonstrated in a ferry coherence.
This is even more for a leader of the movement that is the President of the Government as Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than that of Islamic terrorism and that is even proposed to sign a “new contract for the planet”.
This approach is the obligation to explain why the action, or inaction, of its Government has contributed in a decisive way to that Spain is headed by the European Union in the non-fulfilment of the Kyoto Protocols.
Those who are responsible for non-fulfilment, in which sectors it had been produced and why its Government, the contract with the planet, did not avoid it.
Moreover, it should be clearly explained to the Spanish what measures it will take to prevent climate change.
What enterprises will be affected, which customs of citizens will be chained, which individual and collective energy economy will be obliged to do, what economic consequences this would cause.
I mean, he will sacrifice and pay for saving the planet.
But there's nothing and there's no explanations.
precisely because it is to sacred and pay.
Measures against climate change, real measures are unpopular.
Costful, inconfortable and threatening for business accounts and individuals.
Until 100th of the absence suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party, he seen as dangerous as in Zapatero that he was employed from the ancestor.
It is to say that it is to save the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with white slogans of any real consequence.
With phrases that have the impact, committees, committees, protocols and new posts.
With these contracts with the planet, this man is so useful for the election campaigns that do not speak, who does not blame, and who does not require meetings and inspires the trend.
Since this is limited to be a purely virtual contracting party that does not claim to what we move in bicyclet or we refrigerate with the event.

My treating doctor told me one of his articles about an estrange research: " The money produces cerebral activity, especially if others receive less than " .
It is to say that the feelings that generate the monthly payment of workers depend on what the colleagues win.
The study was conducted by tomographic magnetic results at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest number of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, the author of the study and director of the group of neuroconscious images of the Life & Brain Institute in Germany: "The strongest activement was when the participant responded correctly and his companion failed."
The investigators noted that when the two persons were supposed to receive the same payment, the activation was moderate, but if one of them received the double, the activement was greater.
I don't know whether this conclusion would require so many sciences.

What insurance do I have?
The car insurance, which covers the driver towards wrong events, implies an important expenditure that depends on various factors, such as age, sex, old age, civil status, type of vehicle to ensure or actually use.
Having a car is the main one.
And it is that, selecting the suitable car security is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
And it is that, selecting the suitable car insurance, it is even more difficult than to choose the vehicle model.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurance company.
This commitment is materialized by an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the granted and in exchange it is responsible for the obligation to pay the indentification in cases of error.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is covered by taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, oldness of the driver permit, civil status, type of vehicle to ensure or actually use.
Insurance companies set their prices in accordance with statistics so that the likelihood of a accident is higher, the payment rate is higher.
This is why people more than 25 years of age and women have to pay lower prizes, since statistics show that they have a lower number of misunderstandings than their care.
Similarly, the company concluded that marriage persons tended to have less accidents than celibatary conductors.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and therefore the probability of having an accident.
By increasing the probability of the frequency, it increases.
They are many of the variables that the assurancers take into account at the time of establishing the price of the price.
This is why, the driver must well study the situation to choose the car insurance that is best adapted to his profile.
Here we will explain the most significant variables when you choose the one or another type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the assuranceer, offers it a reasonable price.
Youths under 25 years of age must face various inconveniences at the time of switching an insurance with a available price, as they can be the low experience in conducting and older conducting permits.
Although the ideal to be well assured is an insurance of any risk, there are other more economic options.
The most predicted drivers can opt any risk with franchise, so that they obtain coverages of an insurance at any risk but at a more accessible price.
This convention implies that the customer pays a part of the left amount.
"The part of the left amount that the customer's verse will be established on the basis of the value of the premium, which will be higher the amount will be lower," states Luis Noguera, responsible in Spain of First Europe, an online insurance mediator.
Another option is the assurance to broader third-party, so that the customer ensures the protection to face third-party damage, but by those caused by its own car.
In addition, it would be covered against the flight, the fires and the loss of the vehicle.
A advice.
If you're less than 25 years trying to be careful and avoid malicious as soon as possible, because this will affect bonification, which can reduce the insurance price for the future.
A bonification is a reduction in the basic tariff that has the company.
On the contrary, sanction is a majority of the basic tariff.
" Bonifications and sanctions will depend on the company and benefit of it.
If the company had a good year, it could enable them to increase bonifications ", explains Noguera.
Over 25 years this becomes easier for drivers at the time of a contract with an insurance, as the weakness rate is reduced by accumulated experience.
This is why it is preferable to choose an insurance all the risks with franchise.
" Normally youths cannot benefit from the pre-acquired experience after an accident," ensures the director of the European company in Spain and adds that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of conduct, once the fear of the novice was passed " .
However, if the customer is married but has no children, it is preferable to negotiate any risk insurance, at the time that its economic situation allows him.
Marriages with children are considered by assuranceers as people with the lowest malnutrition rate, since majority will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be an insurance of any risk with franchise (which could be 300 euros), or an expanded third-party insurance from the third year of life of the vehicle when the assurance has a high bonification level.
"They have a more detracted conduct and have a larger purchase power to allow the luxury to take a more important amount of franchis," judges Luis Noguera.
For recruitments, an insurance of any franchise risk is preferable (including 150 euros) or an extensive third-party insurance when the assurance has a high bonification level.
It is necessary to say that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver faced with events wrong, but also because it represents an important expenditure, therefore it is essential that we consider the insurance that is most appropriate according to our personal situation.
The Celtic will try to win a point in Milan to reach the eighth end
The Milan AC and the Celtic Glasgow are measuring next Monday in San Siro in searching for the lack of their respective objectives in the closure of the Champions, since it serves to Italians to be the first and the universities to classify themselves.
Italians totalize ten points and have already been qualified during the fifth day by a null match in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but it still needs another point to ensure that Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and which receives Benfica, who has four, is not passing before him.
These two matches of the D Group will play a week before the sixth day ends, since the Milan AC must discuss the semi-final of the Club World Coupe in Japan on 13 of this month in searching for a place for the end of 16 December.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the null match at the stage of Giuseppe Meazza seems to be the most expected result, although the two teams were trying to get victory, since Italians did not want to split their homes and the Celtic Glasgow knew he would remain first and would ensure a better crop in the eighth end.
A disappearing of the Gordon Strachan team could be enough to classify if Shakhtar Donetsk does not win, but she will not only be able to computer on this because there are nine points of game return to Ukrainians who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct dual.
Thus, the Milanians tried to emphasize the evening at the universities, which have a good hope to classify themselves for the eighth end of the second time at the League Champions, after being struck during the last edition by a goal of Kaka during the extensions (1-0).
While waiting for the victory of "rossoneri" the triomphe would only return to Shakhtar, where the Celtic would lose, to classify himself for the eighth end to enable the link to the EUFA Championships.
And it is that Benfica, although it is last and without possibilities to continue European competition, could reach the third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend in Vancouver at the first concert of the Spice Girls tour
Spice Girls started in Vancouver (Canada), before about 20,000 spectators, their first tour since the group was deleted in 2000.

About 20,000 people have shocked the tickets to attend the concert that was subjected to a video in which the group's history was raised at the end of 1990.
World meeting and tournament coincid with the launch of a new album that reiterates their primary success as well as two new songs, Headlines and Voodoo, published in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls are mounted on the scene by showing the armets that the wife of Posh Spice had offered them, the British footballer David Beckham.
The sporting public was filled with the GM Place, even if Victoria had forbidden him a few days ago.
Beckham noted before the spectacle that the British footballer "I haven't seen our costums so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think about spectacle."
Sporty Spice, which is part of the group in 1998 " because of the differences between us " and which has caused the dilution of the group two years later, has also expressed its nervousity during pressing, two hours before the beginning of the spectacle.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of people changed, the feeling for the Girls Spirits changed.
And I thought why not, I am glad to have taken a decision," said Chisholm on the meeting of the group that she has dissolved for nine years ago.
The song also noted that at the time, "the things have been arranged and that we appreciate much."
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl has been exhibited last time in 1998.
To begin, according to the CTV TV, the group arrived in Vancouver in a special aircraft of Virgin Airlines.
When they arrived to the airport, a baby army was waiting for them.
They account for her five sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the group exhibera in California (USA), in San José (the 4 December) and Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
They will be exhibited in Madrid on 23 December.
The new gas business between Russia and Ukraine is alarmed.
A disagreement on the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia, thus increased the risks of the export of fuel exports to Europe.
The majority of Russian gas exports to the European Union (E.U.A.) are carried out by gass, and each drive is slowly monitored.
Kiev announced that if Russia increases the fuel cost, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an alternation between the two, has caused a decrease in the supply to the United States countries.
The latest conflict between Kiev and Moscow was after the Ukrainian Government and Gazprom, Russian monopole company providing gas, tried to find an agreement on the cost of Russian gas for 2008.
Gazprom said that it would increase as expected, its prices to Ukraine since he agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gas from the Neighbor of Turkey.
The analysts said that this would be for Ukraine, an increase of 40 per cent of the import costs from Gazprom.
"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the discussions, remembering that we are a country through which most of the gases crossed", announced the U.S. Minister of Economy, Anatoly Kinkh at the Press Office of Reuters.
"Gas cost fluctuations would certainly be related to our discussions on transit taxes (which go to Western Europe) through Ukraine"
The latest alteration between Moscow and Kiev was caused in January 2006, the interruption of Gazprom supply for Ukraine.
This resulted in the decline of exports to Western Europe, thus increased prices.
Russian gas represents a fourth of the supplies of the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, even though most of them are still developed.
Accordingly, Gazprom completes its own supply of gas from Turkey and other countries of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health 'does control its foreign employees'.
The Scotland Health Ministry must improve controls to be carried out on its additional community employees to check whether they have previous criminals, stated the Monitoring Committee.
The warning of the General Reviewer, Robert Black, occurred after a foreign doctor working in Scotia, was involved in the attack of Glasgow airport in June.
Mr. Black also expressed his concern about the fact that the Scotland Health Ministry has no specific data on the number of people employed by other countries.
Its report was also in relief of other decisive controls, correctly carried out on a sample of five healthy authorities.
The general reviewer has conducted controls on the Community extra personnel following the attack of Glasgow airport.
Bilal Addullah, 28 years old, was arrested by the Royal Alexandra Hospital of Paisley, after shooting with his jeep, in the main terminal doors.
He was part of three doctors that were filmed in the Old Bailey in October, as suspected to be involved in various car explosion attempts in the UK.
The Ministry of Health will carry out pre-employed supervisions on the outer sea personnel, to be some of the validity of their qualifications, experiences, and work permits for the United Kingdom.
While the Scotland Health Ministry uses the ECSC to carry out previous criminal controls, the Agency has no right to obtain such information outside Britain.
Among the many warnings, the report of the general reviewer now states that the committees are required to address the Office on the Control of previous criminals, which allows employees to conduct controls on different countries.
“Only we have found that some information on staff have been well verified, it is not every time done.” report states.
Mr. Black said that the Scotland Health Ministry performed the majority of the pre-employment controls that it would do, but he also added: "In our report the aspects in which the system can be improved in order to ensure that appropriate information on some members of the other sea personnel are available to health services.
Mr. Peter Terry, BMA President of Scotia, said that it is "extremely impossible" that pre-employed controls could be identified by employees that could be made in future terrorist acts.
He stated "the report suggests that the current pre-employment controls operate well in the ecosystem and that it is not sure that these warnings can provide some additional value."
The Scozian health authorities have declared employees of 1161 outermers, constituted for most doctors and nurses.
But the general review stated that these figures must certainly be revised to increase, in part because of the problems relating to the identification of uncertain contract staff members, which could be chosen or not, to remain in our country.
The investigation showed that the current health control procedures in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are indeed appropriate.
These checks are performed on passport, work permits and qualifications.
At this time, the Scozian Government reviews its policy and the pre-employment control system for other ocean staff members.
The Secretary of Health Nicola Sturgeon said, "I was encouraging to achieve this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow airport. "
It added that the Scotiaan Government would consider health committees carefully the warnings listed in the report that should be published in the next month, and would be able to ensure a better implementation of the recently updated pre-employed and valid for all employees, including other people.

The last five months of the army forces have been undertaken by the rule of the Minister of Internal Television,” stated the door of the State Minister.
Between the detentors, 16 members of the Media are organized in a “mediate cell” to promote “Taxi thought”, the ideology of Sunni Muslim Radicals that supports violence against unfaithful and apostate musulmans.
Among the detentors, 32 persons are accused of having supported warriors.
The climate of Venus could reveal the future of the Earth.
Scientists told last night that Venus has certainly been a pleasant planet to live.
The data from the European Orbit ship showed that the planet is certainly two times smaller than the Earth, in contrast with what was previously thought.
Venus is the nearest planet of the Earth.
These two worlds are practically the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the sun.
Scientists now believe that there are billions of years, Venus could have had similar conditions to the Earth, and could even have been habitable.
But the heat effect resulted in carbon dioxide, the atmosphere due to solar radiations associated with a slower rotation levered Venus to all other types of evolution.
Today the planet is private of water, it is raised by weagans and light temperatures and has a quite warm surface to found it on the floor.
The discovery of Venus Express, the study of the European Space Agency, which studied the planet for a year, offers a tragic vision of the potential future of the Earth, due to the catastrophic changes of the climate.
Professor of the Physical Department of the University of Oxford, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the mission of Venus Express, said: "We begin to understand the reason why Venus’s climate is so different from the earth, although the planets in them themselves are practically similar.
"The new data allow us to establish a scenario that has been thousands of years, Venus had been originally identical to the Earth, may even be with a habitable surface."
The uranium was ricaned by the police.
A kilo of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was seized by the Czechslovac police and Hungary last night.
One police said that three persons were arrested and that the material is currently analyzed.
It has not confirmed that it was well uranium, but showed that the goods had a value of $1 million ($480,000).
Anyway open
Mitt Romney said not to be a candidate to the Presidency to answer the questions of a good nest man.
Despite this, the Republicn candidates to the Presidency finally agreed to participate in the Youtube debate, during which many regular electioners have registered their questions, submit them to the candidates.
Wednesday, 28 November, no questions have been so rigid that the issue of a further debate from You Tube, when a good neighbor requested the democratics their position in relation to the warming of the planet.
But this time, questions and answers have often reflected the conditions of the Republican Party, candidate to the next elections.
We do not know what criteria, CNN producers, who sponsorized the debate, have chosen the Tube clips to show to candidate aspirants.
But the first half of the debate, the longest approach to one theme, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strong ones for the Republicns.
CNN requested some voters to phone when they heard a pleasant thing: the government highlighted approximation hairs when candidates were expressed in a serious manner.
The hardest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney, who is head of the important elections of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to reiterate the fact that he was accompanied with regard to the domestic immigration during his New York Master's mandate.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former Governor of the Massachusetts, to employ clandese immigrants in his home.
The two fighters have become particularly fellow when they were asked whether they were ready to promote a 'amnesy' (of providing citizens a regular status and the possibility to become citizens).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressist, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado Congressist, have been able to extend the subject.
No one has the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the course, it may be thanks to the fact that they have started fighting the immigration before and in a more incisive manner than others.
Generally, candidates have at least the same views: more strict borders and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This subject, addressed to concerns particularly caused by the case of toxic games manufactured in China, or other fears against the outside world, promotes the Republicns to forget or minimise the divisions between freezers and Catholic conservators.
However, the debate has become particularly encouraging when other issues have been understood.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether water in the nest should be considered to be tortured.
One of the stakeholders asked whether the candidates believed in their entirety, the content of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even if it is not about to believe in Jonas' story and baile.
Another intervenant asked whether Jesus had been in favour of the death penalty.
We were not expected to see Mike Huckabee, - in pool position in Iowa during a recent election, through his long-term Christian conservatism - to declare that death penalty is so painful as necessary.
When it was emphasized to know whether Jesus had been favorable, he was riding and said that Jesus is too chic to present elections.
Human race remains insolently open to all.
Mr. Huckabee in Iowa co-initiated with the recent prodigious research of subventions conducted by the freezer Ron Paul, and those in the medieval debate.
These two are embarrassed by the neighbor, thanks to the fact that the two defenders of the party are not able to agree to decide who is the most famous and more traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate unified the party of good time and convincingly thanks to a successful message on the United States size, thus approaching leaders.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from being clear.
The pain of workers
Gordon Brown found a new strike in which darkness; even if he was dismissed, the situation would not change.
In view of the trend of British scandale, it is not particularly judging.
No sales decorations, no parish hotel factures, no swimming swimming swimming foot swimming pool.
But this is that a revelation shows that a rich businessman had been massed for four years, under false names, his contributions to the current Worker Party, equivalent to 650,000 ($1.1.3 m), that the party would not have declared: a new battle that Gordon Brown had been done.
Two months ago, the first minister has returned to his election project, smilingly the British intellecting proclaiming that opinion studies have not influenced its decision, and he hoped that it would give a competitive and effective government.
On the contrary, such as Vince Cable, the brilliant liberal leader, said that the terrifiant Mr. Brown was turned from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The purchase from Northern Rock, a difficult bank on the board of the crack, showed a fracture of directives and a medium-sized judgment in case of emergency.
Inadequate proposals to change the tax code have resulted in coalition of industrial groups against the Government.
The loss of 25 million personal data from the tax authorities showed an incredible administrative barrier.
A triumph of generals to retreat has launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting against the reductions of military expenditure: they declared that being Minister of Defence is for them, a part-time job.
At the present time, the suspicion of loose donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary-General of Travailists (and his former chief of supervisory) made that they had to leave.
Nothing means Mr. Brown's way to get out.
However, governments can arrive at a point where it would be impossible to governate.
People do not love politicians and do not trust in them, but generally leave their doubts of quote when a new government arrives to power.
It seems obvious that the first minister could not improve the things, nor govern it for a long time when it risks the suspension: public administration does not work; the minister offices make the balance; the press for bad historys; and the government is on the defence and without any goal.
In a sense, the position of Mr Brown is particularly difficult because in contrast to other political leaders, it cannot be a starting man.
Even though he would like to repower Tony Blair, he's just been his senior lieutenant.
The problems relating to Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to the decisions taken by Mr. Brown when he was lucky by the British treasurer.
And even if it is not directly involved in the disasters of Blair, such a long investigation on the funds of the Party 'the money counting for the members of the Chamber of Lord', the elections could think the other.
But the difficult situation Mr. Brown is not so tragic that she's in the air.
Gaffes are not so monstered as the members of the Tories party believe it.
Like Mr. Bean, there's no victims or shocks.
And the cure, although painful, could always be the stalinian trends of Mr Brown, in favour of a reliable and slightly cruel government.
The new scandale on political donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very special person who compares his gifts to the charity, stated that he did not want any public recognition of his goodness.
He may have his opinion, but it's not to decide him.
The laws against the anonymation of the large politicians are clear, and there is a good reason: the public has the right to know who contributes to the success of those who will rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who was declared to be aware of the programs of Mr. Abrahams, without knowing that it was illegal, should therefore be interviewed, as well as Jon Mendlesohn, responsible for the collections of subsidies that had spoken to doubtful donations in October.
But until now Mr. Brown is not involved: no one lets think that it has been known for these steps, even though most of the payments have been made after his arrival to the government in June.
Together, the first minister has done half.
He quickly condemned the legislative fault of his party, but he did not attract the fact that the decision-making authority is on a matter that he knows well, to provide an investigation committee on this subject composed of an each to the recruitment and a judge.
In that case, lessons to learn are not complicated.
And if the law was shocked, it's from the police's resort.
Furthermore, there are other things that Mr Brown must do, such as a permanent President for the independent Committee on Public Life Standards, without leadership for six months, and prepare a good reform on the financing of political parties.
This would force the Working Party, at a moment of weakness, to cooperate with the Tories, which could bring him to reject his special financial report with conferences; in brief, a friendly pillar for a partisan such as Mr. Brown.
But it should face some partisan facts.
The Conservators Party now has a good advantage for elections; he has two years to reconcile the elections, and the only way to obtain a victory is to demonstrate unreasonable integrity and solid skills.
Card shocks.
Will the crisis of hypothetics contain the American market of credit cards?
When there is blood in the water, it is normal to see shocked nagears, tourbillonner around.
Now that the American immobilist market is through a critical phase, predictors are seeing the U.S. credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts think that losses related to credit cards could reach $99 billion if the container is expanded to other forms of credit to consumers.
Presentation signs are clearly visible.
There are hairs in costs and insolvency rates, as measured by the non-recovery balance or which are, more than 30 days after.
HSBC announced the last month that he took $1.4 billion in its consumer credits, in part because of the lowness of card ports.
He's too early to panic.
The costs and insolvency are still modifyed.
According to Moody, a fiscal agency, the insolvency rate of 3,89% of the third quarter is almost a point compared to its historical average.
The deterioration of rates is partly explainable by technical factors.
A change in the United States in 2005, on personal banking route, has caused a decrease of the banking archives, which has caused the losses of credit cards; the number of archives (and therefore insolvency rates) could even increase if the payment conditions were to imply.
In addition, the industry announces fixed payment rates, which relieve the monthly sum of consumption that consumers need to resolve.
and trust in the security of the capital of credit cards is sufficiently strong, despite the paralysis of other aspects of the structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the emission volume for 2007 will be over 25% over the last year.
The direct infection link between hypothetic crisis and credit card markets are certainly available: consumers could prefer to increase their ends now that equity real estate loans have lost.
But card emissions make more attention to species flow than to the value of the patrimonie, and therefore the loss of the prices of the immobiliary has not forced to change the credibility of the payers.
They could even benefit from the credit appropriators.
Consumer prizes for the payment of hypotheques fall if the properties cost less than the value of the payment; therefore, credit card detention would be a priority to repay.
Card issuers are able to respond much more quickly than hypotheticals and with more flexibility to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or change credit limits.
This should, in the theory, reduce the risk of having a rapid recovery of actions.
"We're not going to wake up a morning and to reevaluate all the employees." Gary Perlin, director of Capital One, said.
If a financial disaster of credit card market is impossible, there are strong risks to have a decrease.
If the low prices of immobiliary and a contract on the credit market lead to the recession, the industry must certainly face a macabre future.
Please take care of dorsal nagears..
The British bankers claim to be guilty for Enron's case.
The three British bankers who had to go to witness their roles in relation to a fraud made by the former Financial Director of Enron, Mr. Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, condemning mercredious faults.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew first declared innocent seven accused of collusory presumed fraud in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial shock in order to enrich the employees.
They should be submitted to the court in January.
But during a hearing chaired by the American judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they all declared guilty for complaints.
The three former frameworks of Greenwich NatWest, a PLC Group of the Royale Bank of Scotia, have become famous throughout Britain, because of extraditions procedures that have been two years old.
In the United States, their case remains still a suspense question for this investigation started after Enron's fall in 2001.
The accused infringements in 2002 understood Fastow that it was the subject of the government's investigation in Enron's debate.
The accused of the bankers, who were appointed the "true of Natwest" declared come to Houston in 2000 to organize a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his former right arm, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in an Enron's partner in controlled by Fastow, who was the skeeper of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him to shoot banking procedures.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated its interest in the subsidiary as no one, but in fact the three British people already knew their value.
A company controlled by Kopper purchased the interest of the branch bank for 1 million £.
Bankers paid $250,000 in Kopper as an interest in this company.
According to the accused, Fastow had falsely announced in Enron that the energy company was ready to pay $20 million in Greenwich NatWest for its activities in the branch.
But indeed, these $20 million went into the pockets of the British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the accused, bankers would get $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the other would win $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow was accused of his active role in two conspirations in Enron's slaughter.
The British Trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow ends a six-year-old prison in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is incarcered for 3 years and one month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British chiefs were released after paying a $1 billion insurance, which obliges them to live in the United States during the process.
Enron, previously the seventh larger national society, in the bankway in December 2001 after years of accounting trucks, could no longer hide its billions of detention or even propose its bidon speculations as rewardable.
The expense has resulted in thousands of licenses, more than $60 billion of market losses and more than $2 billion of losses for retrait plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and the former President Jeffrey Skills were sentenced last year for their implication in the eradication of the society.
Skilling was sentenced for more than 24 years of prison.
The accusations against the Lay for Conspiration, fraud and other crimes have been seized because of his death caused a heart crisis last year.
Not under, nor out of Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce motor and has a sufficient fuel autonomy to fly without shoot from Moscow in Los Angeles with 54 million dollars.
But this is just a small change for some Russians.
“He can transport until 18 passengers” said Dan Firero, a representative of Gulfstream.
"If someone really needs so much seats as it is more than a family use aircraft or for the president of a society."
Mr. Firer was present at the state of Gulfstream, last Friday, at the Millennium Hall, a consumption incentive orgic for four days, which is in a huge capital exposure centre.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exponents were presented with their stands, expecting to highlight the interest of the new Russian riches for their varied products, going to the diamond cars of 50 Cents.
Mr. Firer was stealing a brilliant Dutch, exposed to his stand.
“It's a beautiful car, but nothing comparable to our product” he said.
After the United States, Russia is the second largest private aircraft market.
"The Russian capital seems to steal in black gold, such as Dallas"
“We lived the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and disabled in Europe where they would be considered materialists,” said Marshall Goldman, a senior Davids Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at the Harvard University.
Like the Saudites in the 1970s, Japanians in the 1990s, Russians are experiencing as the largest worldwide expenditure.
The largest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another place in Moscow, a luxury industry conference allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, President of LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to follow the sale of luxury goods, such as Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, which belongs to the New York Times Society.)
Russia has 53 billion dollars valuable, according to the Forbes list.
Moreover, two thirds of the rich are composed of $670 billion, according to a study on the development of personal riches in the former Soviet Union, conducted by economics of the Economic and Financial Research Centre.
(World Bank stated that in 2005, 15.8 per cent of Russia lived under poverty).
“There are hundreds of millions in Moscow, for this reason we are all there” said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davids Morris, London Dutch.
She participated in the room for the first time in the company of the Russian distributor, the Soho Dutch Group.
“Women are all well prepared, and men value a richness.”
The two real estate agents set on their 31th, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 declared being as their clients, millions.
"I looked at the cars and tried to choose between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche" said Mele Yumatova, who knew his high-cook rob as a veteran of the red mass like Joan Rivers.
The room seems to be able to fix new riches, the type of Russian brand buyers that are disposed to make the cheese in the legs to come to a large floor where the Cadillac Scalades are exposed to the Cadillac Scalades, platinum skins, Mövenpick glass, personalized billard tables, apartments in Dubaï and gund shoes.
The public could buy the tickets for 30 euros ($44,57).
“The Russians are interested in definiting the most cheerful and best marks” said Mr. Gijrath, a component who is proudly sit at the stand of the Royal Royal manufacturing of Hollandic porcelone Delf, in front of a Raimbrant's wall table on blue carreals, hands.
"It's sure Russians are more interested in bling bling"
Indeed, the salers said that Russians with old capital (10 to 15 years are too in accordance with the Russian standards) have already been expelled with a kind of limited edition mark that could not be sold in the room.
Despite this, thousands of people, or millions, millions or tourist employees, arpen the exposure every day.
And some even buy.
During the first night of the exhibition, on Thursday last night, Roman Ershow, the PDG of King Koil beds, declared having sold two sets of seals in soil, cahmer, and golden cotons.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, director of the A1 moto sale, a company who teams the cars with the last crying alarm systems, also declared that he sold to a Russian milliard, Porsche Orange brilliant, for $170,000.
From Sunday after midday, Andrei Karapetian, President of L.A. Connection, a company who personalizes the luxury cars, said he would sell three similar cars for the Rolls-Royce Phantoms to $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, which wanted it to be incomposed of Swarovski cristales so that it looks like a routine route.
The four cost set of $22,000.
"The Russian million who wants roues to be sweet, or a photo of her wife, made of cubic zirconium, will not swim with such pneumatics," said Mr. Karapetian.
It will certainly keep her in his garage with already 30 or 40 vehicles »
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the expression “Russian million” is not at the agenda, given the increase in the prices of the immobilier here.
“If you had bought a apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would be a million, at least on the paper, if it's not in the species” he said.
"There is more than you could think"
Those who are not millions may at least feel that emotion when they go to the Continental Alliance, a Russian heritage management company.
The company has established four stages representing the British phone chains, filled with a mass of counterface dollars.
Azad Karryev, company marketing director, said that his team printed 500,000 false tickets for the Millennium Salon.
Passers arrested to launch massas of tickets, request their friends to photograph them on their mobile, in a beautiful midst of this rich or well-being false false.
“You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel a million,” said Mr. Karyev.
Unacceptable surgery suspected in New Jersey
It was the vel of Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked at the winter bath of the restaurant Just a little Healthier and observed a ambulance that came to stop at the doors of the white Cape Cod on West Scott avenue.
Then come the police patrol.
And then another.
"The next time I saw the medical vehicle stopping," Mr. Livingston, a director of the restaurant, said mercredi.
That's where I realized that someone was deceived.
The authorities later learned that the deceased person was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant director of the Police Department of Newark.
The investigators now try to determine whether the cause of their death is due to a gestation executed by an unacceptable cosmic surgery, that the police has not yet identified, resident in 212 West Scott's Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Mele Arroyo's death, but they are expecting to be confident, the results of the toxicological tests that, helas, will take time, but should allow to solve this mysterious death that attracted the high parts of the Newark police.
Mere Arroyo was the assistant of the police director, Garry F. Mc Carthy, since September 2006, and his voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, great worker and teas," Mr. McCarthy said about Melle Arroyo in a phone interview, mercredi. "
" she was like a pit bull"
" she would have done everything to protect me."
Mr. McCarthy stated that Melle Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, an ex-agent of the Newark police who worked for the Commission for Alcohol Control, and that she leaves two sons of 14 and 11 years, as well as a beautiful boy.
Eileen Walsj, the word of the Union Continent Park, Theodore J. Romankow, said that detectives were trying to determine whether Melle Arroyo was deceived because of an unlawful surgery operation.
"It is a possibility to consider."
"The investigation continues."
The authorities declared that there was an arrival at 15.00 p.m.
and have found Melle arroyo on the sofa.
She was declared deceited.
A few more than one week ago, and the authorities did not say great-chose about the investigation or even on the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Mele Walsh couldn't confirm if Mele Castro was interrogated by the authorities.
The investigators seek to understand whether a part of the house was used as a medical office.
Mercredi, no one opened the door of Melle Castro where a fascinated roseer was located in the quarter front, and a darmate was back.
A blue bidon called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute of the kitchen vessel and for parfums, walked in a hamgar, next to a door that leads to the ground.
Two wheels all over the terrace raised on the coasts.
McCarthy said that since his arrival in Newark 25 years ago, at the police Department of New York, Melle Arroyo was very precious, helping him to navigate in the new city and to abandon its framework political culture.
“It said, 'You must take care of this,' he said.
“I was there when I arrived, and still there when I went.
"It was awesome"
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will reduce the rates related to world bourse.
The actions are explosed from the two counts of the Atlantic last, after the market hoped that the Federal Reserve would try to calm the credit conditions and then reduce the interest rates promoted by the disadvantaged statements of the Vice-President of the United States Central Bank.
Busiary markets are explosed in London, New York and all in Europe after Donald Kohn, 2 after Ben Bernanke, President of the Federal Reserve, stated that those who decide, must be "flexive and pragmatic" in their actions in the financial markets.
In a clear effort to re-establish the irritable markets since these new pressures related to credit, Mr. Kohn stated that the recent turbulence was partly “inversed some improvements in the market functioning in the end of September and October.
If this hard turbulence was to continue, it would increase the probability of a strict future of the financial conditions for owners and businesses, it was said.
These comments appear to investors as an obvious sign that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capitals in the United States markets, and that later reductions in interest rates could establish credit conditions.
These comments also allowed to calm Wall Street with even worse news on the American economy, as well as the largest decrease of real estate sales for October month.
The impact of this financial tuult has been highlighted following the statement of Bear Stearns, the Investment Bank, announcing that it will grant 650 people, i.e. 4% of its staff, to reduce costs to compensate losses due to loss of real estate loans.
Only 20 posts are planned in London where the bank employs 1500 people.
In New York, the second industrial average of Dow Jones has increased 331 points, about 2.55% concluded at 13.289.40, while the largest index, S&P 500, took 2,65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 has adopted 2.5 points of 2.1.7 per cent to 6306.2, adding more than 39 kg to the value of British companies.
The German Dax index increased by 2.6% and the French CAC40 was 2.5.3%.
Previously, the reapparition of the difficulties of credit on the market has been reaffirmed due to the strong request for sales for three-monthal funds issued by the European Central Bank, which has cut these loans to European commercial banks at a higher rate of 4,7%, which has been the highest since April 2001.
The pressures on the UK Bank to follow the ECB and the ECB and inject funds in London's financial markets which cause credit pressures, have resulted in the 3-month " Libor" banks, with a higher growth since September, at 6,59% of the UK banks since 12 November.
England is faced with an appeal to judgement in relation to the critics of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are faced with two dilemes, the same hard as the other.
Who will be the browser No.6 for Candy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a so large context than the first test against the Sri Lanka, who will take the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the electioners, who was here exceptionally to help Peter Moores, the trainer, and Michael Vaughan, to take his decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, President-General of England, began to fill the candidate forms to become a national selector at least part of time.
Those who will not be able to return the dossard No.6 will be unfair, but life is often injust and the sport is also.
It is never easy to advance what a man allows to reach at the top of his professionals while another will never be more than the lower level, sometimes by lack of chance than by lack of ability.
There is not only the cricket that the selection is difficult, as at the end, the judgment remains subjective.
Is that the right time to evacuate Bopara?
Is that just about Shah?
The same thing could be proposed in another context, which chooses between John Edwards or Banerjee “tubby”?; both, new frameworks that have been obtained from good, professional diplomas, should be promoted: but there is only one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricket at least one chance?
The figures have their importance in decisions, but also opportunities.
In the inside of a team, a crycler must capture the eye of the captain, and at the same time it must take the door and a browser must be lucky to touch the cryker of one day.
But capture the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
Many have done better the last season, for example, James Anderson who seemed to be sure to play the first test, even if Stephen Harmison was fully declared and continued to serve.
Anderson took 32 first doors on 33 tours to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same average, but both have already lived their time to glory at the largest level and hopes that they still offer.
If that's Shah or Bopara who plays at the Asgiria stage, it's just a question of opinion.
This choice could slow or build the carriage of a man, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each test and successfully successful in the first, with five doors and 40 useful tours, but Paul Collingwood, who also learned to swim, who had succeeded to become the first test cricket, and that, despite the fact that his double hundred marked against Australia could still be under estimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, after another debate after the today session at the Asgiria stage, will certainly follow their conservator instincts and will promote Shah's greatest experience against the outcome of the young Bopara.
The two have good arguments.
In favour of Shah, his brilliant and considerable start at the 88th Test in Bombay, 32 percent of the first class against six for Bopara, which is seven years older and its excellent launching class.
But Shah did only ten tours during his two instances in May against the Caribbeans during the witness to the Lord, his Middlesex player city, and that, immediately rejected by the selectors when Vaughan again in shape, claims his place for the next match, seems to have affected his elders as apparent in Bombay.
On the contrary to him, Esex's player is full of joy to live.
There was no fear of him on a crycket field and he was exagerated when he recently covered on a 4x4 at the presentation of Volkswagen, an England sponsor.
He noted that slight wounds, was shocked, even though the first thing he had done to take his Vodafone (sponsor well above) and call Alastair Cook, his team who looked at him from far, to ask him if he had seen it?
Bopara is far away from the best browser, his filling ring allows him to make services that goes to him, and he fights with confidence and professionalism.
Choose the just man is one thing, choose the right time in the other.
Maybe it's the real art of the selection?
I would like to give his chance to Bopara, which doesn't mean that Shah should not apply if, like the tea sheets suggest it, it'll be him who will play this weekend.
Buses bring people to work and fight against Qaeda.
The first bus filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria has arrived in Bagdad yesterday, crossing these exiles without money or renewment of visa, or others who hoped that the city had found normality.
Some have been returned to fight against warriors who abandoned them from their home.
At the Mansour bus station, even before Damascus's arrival of 800 people transported in twenty-five bus convoices of the official government, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan, which were returned by their means.
“I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad” said Sabah al-Qubasi, a doctor Sunni.
"I'm back today because I saw the TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and saw that the city is more secure now."
“They say that the Mahdi army do no more crimes!” he said, referring to the Milice Shia of the ecclesiastic militant Moqtada al-Sadr, who imposed his men to get away for the moment.
Qassim al Atwani, a teacher of 38-year-old Shia in the Sunni area, was returned with his two children, because he couldn't renew his Syrian visa, and the regime prevents the Iraqi workers.
His neighbors from Shia in Amariyah called him to inform him that the United States helped, allowed to catch Al Qaeda from the west of the capital, and invited him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the chief of a Sunni tribe and Shia who had to leave his home north of Baghdad because of a attack on the Grenade after he urged the citizens to rebelle against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to go back to fight.
"First two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me have established a mixed anti Al-Qaeda in Sleikh, and they needed me and my boys."
“This is why I'm back today” said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62 years old.
Many people say that they have been affected by the growing capital acalmy since the United States armies have arrived, and in the view of the continuing training of “groups of citizens involved” well-armed and cooperating with the United States militarys to defend their neighborhood.
However, others say that they had been obliged to return because of the problem of visa and the decade of the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million of Iraqi people have gone last year.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51 years old, was the father of three children, expressed the suspicion of all the visa for exilations that Nouri al-Maliki, Prime Minister Shia, had requested the Syrian government to restrict people to return to the country.
More than two million people would have escaped out of the country because of the secondary death scanners.
"We have no problem until Al-Maliki came to Syria and encourages the Government to give the Iraqi visa, to force them to return to Iraq," said Sunni.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house when I'm gone."
The decline of violence may in part be explained by the fact that the Sunnis has been discovered from the Shia zones and the next versa, establishing places where the tensions are less.
It is feared that a sudden flow of refugees does not again increase sectary tensions and bring fights.
Petite Sarre, good training.
The smallest federal state is in the field of professional training, and it is even slight by the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in a field that is a deficit on the Sarrus, like the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Sarrois that we're not French" - is the slogan that the smallest federalized state, by self-derision, shows for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg played a great role in the Sarre's training system, which is placed on the fifth monitoring of the Dutch Economic Institute.
Thus, for tradition, higher schools work closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Sarrebruck in 1948 by French.
To this day, students have the opportunity to complete their studies by a double, or a trial diploma.
The high rate of 15.6 per cent of foreign students is evidenced.
The Sarre also leads children from the country to higher schools above the average - many of them without a Gymnasium diploma.
"In Sarre, you benefit from the professional training system," says Axel Plünnecke, experts and training at IW.
More than a teenager of five have the title of schools in a professional school, so Sarre is located over seven points above the national average.
So the combination of professional and academic training is relatively well developed.
In view of the number of people, the double cursus panel is the second best in Germany.
In spite of a practical training and a growing demand, however, the number of technician diplomates have slowed a third in the past few years.
This is why the Ministry of Sarrus Education obliged the higher schools to a marketing campaign in engineering sciences.
"Besides the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools," said a speaking portal of the Ministry of Education.
The Government thus introduced comparison tests in all states of the federal state.
In order to begin early to learn, the last year of cry is exempted from law - a model that also copy with other federal states.
Only future comparison studies can show whether the performance of students will be sustainablely improved.
In PISA studies in 2003, risk student rates reduced from 29 to 20 per cent.
However, Sarre has not improved as well as other federal states.
The bavaroes get better out of here.
In spite of sarrows, knowledge in foreign languages is not measured by PISA studies - it could be able to win points in this area.
Because the language of the neighbourhood is binding in the schools - even if Sarrus isn't French.
Charves Rule the clocks
In Venezia, the tic-tac clocks will soon be different than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chavez will resign the cronograph of a half an hour in the South America country.
Keys become a load in Spain in time.
As the Official Journal of Venicela communicated it, due to a new law, the samples will be regulated at least four hours and half of universal time.
Thus, the South America country has obtained an temporary shock that is not in any other state of the world.
The anti-American Anti-American Chavez justified his position among others by the fact that the United States would have imposed the separation of clocks in full hours in the world.
Furthermore, Chávez announced mercy (local time) the end of relations with the neighbouring country, Colombia, because of a case of opposition.
The left nationalist announced that as long as the conservator Alvaro Uribe would remain President of Colombia, he would not hold relationships with the Head of State, nor with the Colombian government.
"I can't, just because of my dignity," said Chávez, who has a constitutional reform on which the oil citizens of the country have to vote on on the way of referendum tonight.
With this reform, he would enhance his power in the country.
The delayer of this dispute was the decision of Uribe to retire the negotiations mandate on the release of oppositions with the marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe had "classed to the face" of Venezia with this decision, he had criticized on Monday Chavez.
In Spain also Chavez is in all mouths.
A new portable phone phone sound makes angry in the country: "Why don't call you" (for you don't think) is the phrase that more than a half million people have downloaded the Internet.
She was pronounced by the king of Spain Juan Carlos, who, most recently Ibero-American Summit, was encouraging by the constant interpellations of the left-to-left popularists and told her that he was nervous.
A decrease of wages threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong conjunction, according to a prognostic, a real less value of payment threatens German employees this year.
Experts found all kinds of reasons for explanation of their pronostic pessimist.
According to Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees should expect to reduce their payment scheme in 2007 as compared to the previous year.
"The fault returns to low wages development, the increased tax on the added value and mount of food and energy prices", said Gustav Horn from the Institute for macroeconomic and Conjunction Research, in the "Image".
New charges could also be taken in the field of unemployment insurance for employee.
The Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück said to the newspaper "New Osnabrir Zeitung" that the decreased decrease of the unemployment in 3,3% for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency has no right to enter into the embarrassment to request the Federation of Financial Accounts or Financial Agency, according to the words of the SPD politician.
It was noted that the exploitation of the prices of food and hydrocarbons has been cut into inflation rates for its highest level for 13 years.
In total, prices increased by 3.0 per cent of one year to another.
Venus is the helmet of the earth.
Despite its hostile atmosphere to life, Venus is more like the Earth than what it was believed until now: the European space son of "Venus Express" has discovered lights in the atmosphere and pool wind tours, like those appearing in winter on the Earth.
Since almost three decades, scientists think there are lights on Venus.
The European "Venus Express" son today has proved - she has detected electrical waves at the limit of the atmosphere: the lights on Venus shut up to a height of approximately 56 kilometers of cloud cloud, Christopher Russel of the University of California at Los Angeles in the Scientific Nature magazine.
According to the famous Cyprin theory, the eclairs would have shown life on Earth: the hour would stimulate reactions in the oceans that leaded to the training of amino acids, a stone of angle of life.
This is not the case about Venus: "If life has been, it must have been at a very old date of history," Sean Solomon explains the "Carnegie Institute" in Washington.
Today, there should be no lot of things living on the surface of Venus: the atmosphere is about 100 times deep than on Earth, sometimes the temperatures of 500 degrees are dominated.
"Venus may be the helmet of the Earth, but she remains a jumelle," said Russel.
Why Venus, who is so like the Earth in mass and dimensions, has been affected by such a different development, is the fundamental issue of the ASE mission.
The start of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in Venusian research, as no sound was on the road for the exploitation of this planet since the four-twenty-third years.
In view of researchers, the most recent research results now presented in several articles of "Natura" not only highlight the individuality of Venus within the sun system.
They also show that the common points with the Earth of our neighbor planet are more than first.
Thus the researchers found, in addition to the wind turbines already known in the northern pool, a torch of clouds in the south pool, which turns even more faster.
The phenomenon recalls the air courses in winter hemispheres, wrote a team of researchers around Joseph Piccioni of the Astrophysica Space Institute and Cosmic Physical Italian.
The second planet of the sun system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12.100 kilometres, almost too large.
The skilled planet of stars of night or morning turns around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns slowly on its own: a day of Venice is 243 earthly days.
While Venus, with 460 degrees of surface, and 92 bar pressure, does not really remember the Earth, scientists suggest that the two planets have been constructed in similar conditions.
On both sides, the water was accumulated and remained on the Earth in the form of oceans, but it was lost in the Venus space.
And while the carbon dioxide has been fixed on the Earth as carbonate, it is the most largest part of the atmosphere.
Pohler defends the meeting of Merkel with Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Kohler requires the end of the chair of the parties on the welcome of Dalai Lama to the Chair.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPDs because of the attacks against the chances after the meeting in September.
The Federal President Horst Kohler is concerned about the appearance of Germany and summarises the great coalition of closing the coalition on the accommodation of Dalai Lama.
"We should not submit to the external world a divised nation on this matter", said Kohler to Commerce.
Parallelly, Kohler montrates the understanding for Dalai Lama's accommodation by the happier Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity, even though I have respect for the differences between cultures" said Kohler.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensible balance in the field of foreign policy, urged the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against reproachs that it would organize a new Chinese policy.
The German lucky has not taken its distances with the traditional policy of one Chinese only.
"The Chinese also knows it," Kohler said.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly known its inconsistence with regard to the recovery of Dalai Lama and was attacked outside the CDU.
Steinmeier was complained, in particular, of the "first policy" of the DDC in the field of foreign policy.
After receiving Dalai Lama to the Chancellery, virulent irritations felt in the German-China reports.
Thus, the Chinese Government has not only recommended the Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but also, according to Spiegel's information, the dialogue also entered in the dialogue of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the two countries.
The chief of the Chinese Wen Jiabao government requires now the German lucky Angela Merkel to recognize that the recognition of Dalai-Lama was an error.
China refused that European political men receive the Chief of Tibet in their official functions, supported Wen Jiabao so the Chinese position.
The words and acts of Dalai Lama would show that it would try to separate China the Tibet and other Tibeti regions, including other current provinces.
Schauble guards emblems like those of France.
Street battles with police, tisss, fire cars: Wolfgang Schauble keeps guarding emblems like those of France.
Everything must be implemented to ensure that social intacts in Germany do not get out of the streets by violence, the Minister of Germany requested.
Barricads that burn, shooters shocked on the police with chase shoes: after the serious young employees in France, the German Deputy Wolfgang Schauble Minister (CDU) fears like a development in Germany.
We need to ensure that a social explosive is not also home to us and is disappointed in violence.
We must take this seriously," he said to "New Presse" in Hanovre.
All young people would not be able to get out with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the Federal States and the Commons had already worked closely to reduce the problems, said Schauble.
This would not only affect immigrants' integration.
"The sums of integration in Islamic conferences, this already shows its first success."
But it would be too early for a warning end.
Schauble notes at the same time as in German banlies, there are no social problems or urbanism views as well as in France.
In the northern agglomerations, young people were delivered to serious street battles with the police during the last nights.
To the same time, public cars and buildings burned.
More efforts to integrate the German Government, this was what the President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
With regard to employees in France, Kolat was guarded against the "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
However, it would remain a need for action.
Kolat highlights that the rate of unemployment in young people under 25 years of immigration would be higher than the average.
There should be more training places.
Kolat emphasized: "We must give young people a prospect."
However, the President of the Turkish communities added that a social control in families was more than in France.
Many young people from immigration do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat called: "But we have to even be careful."
Youths should be "before giving the opportunity to participate in the work and training."
By waiting, in the Paris faubourg of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very calm during the night.
Police units were established, a helicopter overcome the area with projectors.
The officials were part of three arrests as well as of several burned cars and powders.
Since the conference, a deployment of about 1,000 security forces ensures peace.
The police will take as long as necessary, announced Michelle Alliot-Marie's Minister, after a visit to the Faubourg.
On Tuesday night, about 80 police officers were blessed during employees in Villiers-le-Bel.
The next night, the problems were discovered in Cœdès.
The emigrants declared after a movement accident in which two young people had lost their daily life.
According to the first elements of the Parquet, the police is not responsible for the death of young people.
In the Empire of Angela Central.
The Utopical Scene entry of the chances shows that coalition has ended with the background - and that there is no more to wait for it.
In what country lives this lucky life in righteousness?
After its delusive intervention in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor content, it must be said: not here - in the country which should finally be registered by it.
The opposition of too much focus on the policy was repressed by Angela Merkel by a hard and presumable phrase.
It is provincial, has she said and only shown that she did not want to understand what the critics want.
In Parliament, she made it clear to how exact this reproach was.
There was no concrete interest or no feelings for the problems of the country to feel.
On the other hand, Angela was present as a cloud: a spectacular politician who flew into foreign policy and still remains there.
For example, climate protection: In this regard, it still welcomes Heiligendam's agreements, but does not say how climate goals will be achieved in our country.
Even the lounge of himself - having too little modesty, the head of the CDU would have refused it two years ago.
Now it is slightly aware of all the facts that growth would affect people.
Thus it destroys its image of pragmatist, which resolves the problems instead of embarrassing the world.
But in the empire of Angela's cloud, internal policy problems are a marginal phenomenon.
The poverty in children and the concerns of workers at low salary?
There are some accessive phrases for this.
In this matter it is revealing the number of times where it makes children when it is family rental.
Here, Merkel needs three starts to express a specific half-specific phrase.
She's in unknown terrain, from the moment where it becomes concrete.
The Attaque branch
In the debate of the Republicn candidates to the President, the two favorite Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are a hard offensive battle - and they must now be afraid of a foreign candidate.
The tension of candidates is already the first issue.
He would have made New York a "refuge for the Clanists" replied Mitt Romney to his adversary Rudy Giuliani.
This is against his side by slowly reproaching: "I would say that his own house was a swimming pool for clands."Juliani answered and reproved the former gouverneur of Massachusetts to have employed immigrants without papers.
The candidates are divided into the attack: as the Republicn Base has no official favorites, the eight candidates to the President are being discussed on the CNN before all to discredit their opposers.
The amazing films of 30 seconds that the Internet users sent via Youtube are more than soufflers.
"It's with this kind of isolation we left Hitler to come to power," John McCain launched to his candidate Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round to claim an immediate return to Iraq.
Romney also took a strong lesson by Vietnam's veterans when it refuses to condemn as a torture what is called "Waterboarding", a method of questionnaire in which the noyade is simulated.
However, the fact that the important topics of the campaign are over time beyond the war in Iraq and the discussions on torture are seen in the reactions of the St. Petersburg Joint Room in Florida.
In order to loise conservative values or reject future tax hairs, applaudments are deferred in the audit.
There is again a revelation when the weakness of the two favorites resides.
"I've made a mistake at this time," Romney contrôled and expressed forgiveness on the basis and televisioned public for having yet been an abortion party in 1994.
Giuliani, on the contrary, passes in a shocked neck when he is asked for his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf ruled for the first time in civilian.
One day after his retirement as a chief of army, the Pakistanian man Musharraf was invested as President.
So eight years of domination by the army ends.
The President of Pakistan Pervez Musharraf was invested on Thursday for a new five-year mandate.
The Pakistani television has directed the ceremony to the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf pleaded to respect the Constitution and act for the well-being of the United Nations.
Mercredi had transmitted his army chief to his confidence Ashfaq Kiyani and thus increased international pressure, including the United States.
Eight years after his power taken by a pocket without blood flow, the former general now rule for the first time as head of civil status.
With this retreat of the headquarters of the army forces, Musharraf complied with the main requirement of opposition and Western.
Another central requirement is the end of the emergency state that Musharraf had decreed on 3 November.
Soon after his investment Musharraf will suspend the emergency state, according to the advocate-General Malik Muhammad Qayum, and so will meet another requirement from the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had been occupied after the establishment of the emergency status with its lawyers, rejected the last week all the remedies against the controversial resolve of the Head of State on 6 October.
Among the time, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region in the North Vaziristan in an attack against a military convoi, and four other blessed ones.
According to the statements of the army park, a bomb was explosed in a street near the Afghan border.
Krautrock's fathers return.
Germany's supergroups of seventy-10 years are welcomed: the three members of the Harmonia Group have again taken their console in a concert in Berlin.
For their return, records of their great success "Leve 1974".
By that time, they were well known in the foreign.
The planned sense will then be produced in the form of three messengers announced at the night show.
Everyone has his little bottle before him, his cable and all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, a 63-year-old throne in a white chemistry as dark.
It is flanked on the left of Michael Rother, a 57-year-old boy and a portable computer and a guide.
Right, observed by the whole audit, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73 years old, runs on his console.
Everyone contributes to the sound, among others, a Beat.
And sometimes this joys in an inadvertence to a traditional music piece.
This does not seem to be too depressed by their own masters.
The fact that the Harmonia group again played has assured some emotions among Klautrock's amateurs.
There is the right to declare it here: targeted analysis reveals that the name is certainly reasonable in the collective memory of the pop, but in no case so sustained so that this group lose too deteriorately for 32 years.
But why would German not have the right to celebrate its lively legends in the sixty-dix years?
More than what's wrongly called "Krautrock" is still more in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry decreased the Echo price to the survivors of the Cologne Can Group for their work in 2003, the Dutch-in-Speaking Pop faces were seen in the hall.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the Düsseldorf and New! Groups in the panegic lounge, the surrounding had no more limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother was saved on the scene of the Red Hot Chili Peppers as a old friend.
The problem of ignorance in itself and transfiguration in unknown is the only and unique.
The memory is already taken by Harmonia, because the trio has been only two years and that during this period, the effect power that feeled was very lower than what was given by others.
Moses and Roedelius had already played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
We first play in the caves below the Berlin scene.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a church-subsidy label for financial reasons.
Rother had writtenly deployed in power work and finally was a name as a guitarist with New!, which may have been at the time the rootest German group.
In 1973, however, Rother followed Cluster's musicians in exile in the Weserbergland flights.
There, in a firm old man of the Weser, a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as members of the communities fleeting the city.
Lime ideal than in the Commune I community, where Roedelius had the right to turn into as a nurse.
Soon an artistic existence in Spitzway.
It was in the powder a fanon of the Harmonia Ottenstein chhoro, and also a name for art.
Many residents Harmonia are far away from this.
The first album is called "De Luxe music", and the following "De Luxe".
Because also severe and modec that played music, the group suffered from material poor.
The collection of the dead wood would not be to him alone to seek himself.
The "Live 1974" CD was recorded at a concert in Greece before a public record about 50 heads, as well as someone believed to remember.
Rother employed the desire to force Harmonia in time.
This was an immoral requirement for Roedelius and Moses.
The group announces its separation in 1975.
Rother atterit in the shoes of the ecotherism and confirms its existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster re-animated in the twenty-twenty years and has been more successful than Harmonia ever had.
We need the Greek Live album to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His label Grönland was set to enter the Krautrock as an German contribution inherent to the contemporary music.
New! had already been detained in this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
The physical resurrection of Harmonia took place at the World Culture House in Berlin.
Publicly subsidied in the framework of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is here, the British, the former punk and author of the "Krautrock Sampler".
There's also the loveparade inventor, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire fluctuation margin of the influence of the Krautrock would be certified towards the future pop music.
The left place by the group will be compiled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno's phrase planned in the room at the middle of the unique sounds: "The only real music, you listen to the future."
There are photos showing producers with Harmonia in the close room.
The projections of other black and white photos of cable-based instruments serve the legend training.
Before, the three veterinaries are again occupied to improving.
But more in the collection of microphones to the orphan and the battery, to drive the inousive sound instruments through the self-building effect instruments.
Today, electronic music is like electronic music.
The three in big technical figmenters.
That's why the shore of the house will not change anything.
Under Barbara Morgenster's direction, we are shooted and shooted under the sound cloud, and we are sing at a nice moment "Ayaaaah" with emphasis.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
He never worked rock.
The roots have been less searched in the blue than in music conservatorys (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the escape of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
He who crys "68" has not completely wrong, and Harmonia also now does not let himself ridicule by this now.
But what's going most of you will be covered in a minute on the scene.
Where's music starting and where does it end?
This can be touched on the nerves of someone (?) or granted a lot of joy moments.
Richard Gere isn't just a cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Paix murderer", two films retrace the Balkan war.
But they're not convinced.
The projects are too much about the action and the exchange of insensitive tissue or on the other hand they are too slow.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news first: certainly the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but it's just there, in the back-stairs of Bosnia's war, that the actor Richard Gere is then found.
We lastly lost the most beautiful man in the twenty-twenty-five years, because too much of pleasant and funny roles in films with feelings for women and too many press conferences on the topic of buddhism had the desire to show herself.
Today Richard Gere is the most important argument to look at even "The Hunting Party" - when the chasseur becomes chasing (for what today's movies have to be so long and confusion as collective conventions of locomotive drivers?)
He booked a wonderful representation of eye clines: in the back, his personality of war reporter Simon Hunt was what Gerre could become, if the design and the film industry weren't so good: a man who had his best moments for a long time behind him, but who, even as a monument in the decline of his decline, maintained the visible remains of his old charm.
Nevertheless, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German "Payx Mortier", which also produces this week, the unterminable follow-up of the Balkans war.
The film speaks of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb of the Kosovar's drivers, one of which is still slowly lovely.
While it is welcome that the Serbs are not once presented as the only causes of all the moods, this film as soon as a movie lost too fast in the action and exchange of insensitive tissue.
It remains a kind of "Alarme for Cobra 11" without authorisation but with a war at the place.
On the contrary, the perfect example of "The Hunting Party" can be examined why there was never a real film on the Balkan war.
The story of the three American war reporters, which are condemned to shoot the high war criminal "le return", may have become, with another realist and another scenarist (all two times Richard Shepard), at another time, a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories seem to be shocked: two young men go in a small team in the forest, to achieve something that the military can't do and for the two men, this becomes a trip in the fool.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that we simply do not let Simon Hunt be the cynician deseared with a heart, as it is first presented to us.
No, the script must attribute him to overwhelm a romantic aventure with a Bosniac killed later.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitively bad when reporter, at the space of the last five minutes, by a accelerated process, leads to the NATO, the CIA and all world's prize chasers have not successfully successfully in five years: to touch the war crime and leave it for a fair vengeance to the Muslim Bosnians.
It is so bad that the International Court of Crime against cinematographic logic should be introduced.
In this case, the film has too deep concern for human concern.
He wants to admit that Karadzic and Mladic are still in freedom, and he suspicious Americans and French (for example, they must be exceptionally agreed) to not conduct the chase in a sufficiently intensive manner because of secret political agreements.
But the intentional and wicked are so like this time that a famous Brecht poem comes to the idea.
He speaks of a wood mask of a Asian demon on the poet's work table: "Compatible, I see the veins of the gonfled front, clearly: how it's fair to be bad."
Films such as "The Hunting Party" have precisely such tumorous heads, but which instructs at the point of being good.
The problem is not limited to the type of films on the Balkan war.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood films on Iraq were large fleets.
We can add: there's never been good films in South Africa.
What's going on every time: when a star goes on a crisis home or on a mine field, there's something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "I'm going to border" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still too close in time.
Whatever it is, decades have always been before Hollywood could turn a good film on the holocaust with "The List of Schindler".
Some films must still be shocked - those who today valuable classic works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Fulll Metal Jackett" have not been celebrated unununfairly at their time as work leaders.
But maybe we know today just too much about the world's conflicts, where each hecatombe is directly on two screens at the same time at home,
And this comforts the scenarists the lack of scrolls they need to tell beautiful stories.
"On or not being" or "The Dictator" have actually become so good as Lubtisch and Chaplin had not yet known how much the nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe we don't want to be good when we want to do good movies.
It may have to have the sarcastic and distance artist Lawrence Norfolk.
When it was asked about the parallel between his historical "Dictionary of Lemprière" and the Balkan war, he said, "If some things never changed."
"The great cities will always be terriblely dangerous, the men will always be killed in a horrible way, and the war will always rule in Yugoslavia."
By Beust collects the criticism for the cancellation of the Olympics.
The reculture of the master with Hamburg's candidate for the Sommer Olympic Games was in the policy and economy with critical virulents.
Many want to continue to fight for the games at the edge of the water.
But Van Beust calls for reality in appreciation of chances.
The main director of the Humbourg Trade Chamber, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described a leave as "mawn for the local economy".
In recent times, no other project had been developed as many motivation forces in the city as well as the idea of the Olympics.
"On this objective, the political and sporting alone could not be maintained in the same measures."
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senate to not enter the project, but to find him a new long-term start point, "what takes as a start point another agenda changed."
Major Olle van Beust remained merry to his previous statements, according to that the Olympic Olympic ambitions of Hambourg were irrealistic at least until 2028.
"This is not Hamburg that decides to a candidate to the Olympics, but the German Federation of Olympic Sports" said from Beust to WELT ONLINE.
It returns to the expected decision of the Sport Federation at the beginning of December, on the candidate of Munich for winter games in 2018.
This preference means for us that, in the time lap that we had planned up to 2028 until there, we have no chance."
However, the dream is not definitely belonging to the past, said Von Beust.
The Hamburg Sport Federation (HSB) regretted Beust's statements.
This would be the impression that Hambourg no longer wants to make his candidate for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to close an opportunity by entering projects already", said the President of HSB Beneter Ploß.
A candidate leave would be more contradicted to the statements of the Head of the Senate at the time of the plenary meeting of the German Federation of High Schools.
There, Van Beust had qualified Hamburg's candidate at the Universitys of 2015 as not "no substitute" at the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Sport High School Federation was first in the past weeks named Hamburg as a candidate city.
The SPD SPD fraction refused Senate to have not used this valuable time in the construction of housing in Hamburg.
"The development of Petit Grasbrook was rejected by the Senate for years because he has played the map of the Olympics and excluded the construction of housing," said the delegates of SPD Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always requested the Petit Grasbrook an integrated plan in the Olympics and the post-use of housing, the DDC would only be on the "factor".
The candidate for the Sommer Olympic Games in 2012 would be a great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
However, Hamburg was slaughtered against Leipzig.
It's not warhols boxes.
He who connects Sweden's concepts and falls in wood, thinks to Ikea, but not to Andy Warhol.
Or do you?
At this time, wood wood boxes made in Sweden have shadows on the list of Warhol works.
A large part of the twenty-twenty Brillo-Boxs listed "Type Stockholm" are opposite.
After the Swedish "Expressen" journal some months ago the authenticity of the Brillo-Boxs of Andy Warhol in 1968, the internal research of the modern museum of Stockholm reaches today a decent result: the six "Brillo-Boxes" whose former Museo Pontus Hulten gave a gift in 1995 at the Modern Museum, are copies, as well as a major part of the other hundreds of Brillo-Boxen of "Type Stockholm", which circled on the international market.
Ancient history is completed, an unconcerned enquiring of artistic and curative productions.
In 1964, Warhol created its first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, the wood boxes, which are based on the red-bleu-blank design of saving cards in powder "Brillo".
A exhibition of his work at the Modern Museum was presented in 1968 - with the Warhol Agreement - hundreds of Brillo cards made by Warhol, which did not come (for the financial reasons) but were directly delivered from the Brillo Carton manufacture.
It was not here with art works, but instead of their models, exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol was authorized in 1968 to produce a number of Brillo wood wood boxes in Sweden, which were not exposed to the Modern Museum.
The witnesses of the time speak today of about 15 wood boxes that would be right in the history of art and inquiries, as the original Brillo Boxes of Andy Warhol, with the call "Type Stockholm".
Some of them reached in sales to $1000,000.
The problem now is that the Legendary Leader of the Museo Pontus Hultén claimed, in a bad way, that about hundred bowls had been produced and exposed in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol had then ceased him later.
Indeed, the 105 Hultén castles were produced in Malmö in 1990 only for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
At that date, Warhol was already dead for three years.
Lars Byström, head of the modern museum, examined, along the six Brillo Boxs of the Museum, three other Sweden private collections, among which two were confected in Stockholm in 1968: their strategic panels were first printed and posted, then applied with a pink of white oil painting.
The texture of copies from 1990 deduces to the contrary that the painting has been applied directly without the underlying corner on the strategic paintings, using a painting routine, and moreover it is not an oil painting, but a acrylic.
"These casts have not been authorized by the artist and should be taken from the official list of Andy Warhol Brillo Boxes," lets the director of the modern Museum Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York did not come another decision, the modern Museum will class the six cases in its collection as an exhibition copy."
On July, the Board's Audit announced that he would investigate the "their charges" which will be understood in the case of powder slaughter boxes.
But since we're over there with an inexorable silence.
The rebellious soldiers of Manila abandon
In the Philippians, rebellious soldiers abandon, the same as they were in a hotel in Manilla, and those who requested the retirement of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The chief Antonio Trillanes, who revoked the President's corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters in the hotel that he could not answer any blood flow.
The faithful soldiers had just taken the hotel by the lacrymogen gas.
The two twenty-five soldiers were turned away from hours in the building.
About half of them were held merry before the courts because of a 2003 missing push temptation – among them Trillanes.
He benefited from the hearing to swim with about 30 sympathists.
Military police, who would normally monitor them, had apparently distantly and were joined with his mutiniary.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the retirement of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The loyal troops in the power burned the sector around the respectable hotel.
The Chairman convoked an urgent meeting of the Security Chamber.
The National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemns soldiers' action.
"The people have enough", said Trillanes.
"We call people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who commanded before the election unit of the Scouts Rangers, said that other armed units would like to join.
The critics of the regime had called a great manifestation against the President of Mercedes.
His Government has been rounded for months by corruption reproaches.
Manilla's funding district has already been the theatre of some 200 military members against Arroyo since 2003.
The insurrection was broken about 24 hours after the armed refusal of joining it.
Since 1986, at least seven temptations have been made against democratic governments in the Philippians.

However, all open options, particularly to increase participation in the Freenet, would have learned.
The negotiations between the United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended on the mid-October.
