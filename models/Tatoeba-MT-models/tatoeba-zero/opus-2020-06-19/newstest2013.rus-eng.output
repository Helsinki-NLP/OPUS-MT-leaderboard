The Republic of the Forum ' s Revocation Strategy
The leaders of the Republic justified their policy to combat flexibility.
However, the Brenann Center considers the last micro, claiming that the cases of the elections in the United States are more rare than the deaths of the moon attack.
Furthermore, the Republicns were only 300 cases of electrical flexibility in the United States for ten years.
One can be said with confidence: these new trends will have a negative impact on the appearance of the electors.
In this sense, such actions are partly disrupting the American democracy system.
Unlike Canada, the United States are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
That is why the majority of Governments have adopted laws in the registration or vote process since 2009.
This occurred newly after elections in November 2010, which brought the Republics 675 new places in 26 states.
Only one 2011, 180 draft legislation restricting the right to vote in 41 states were adopted.
New election laws require election laws from the electioner to proclaim personality with photos and evidence of the existing American citizenship.
Furthermore, these laws reduce the period of a period of time of vote, depend on the right to registration of the electioner on the day of the declaration, and denied the right to vote in citizens with courtship.
Before the elections of 2006, no American State had obliged elections to promulgate a personality certificate.
India became the first state that introduced such a requirement.
The High Court of the United States confirmed in 2008 the Constitution of the Law adopted in India.
The Republicn authorities have continued to distribute this practice and other states.
In the past two years, they have initiated draft legislation to commit electors to proclaim photo certification in 34 States.
It is important to note that, in contrast with Quebec, American citizens have no universal certification of personality as a card of medical insurance.
Indeed, 11 per cent of the American citizens, 21 million people who have been able to vote for a age, have no proof of personality with the photo issued by the Government of their state.
In addition, five million new elections in 2012 have no similar document.
The value of receipt of the requested personality is often exceeding $100.
New disproportional restrictions affect young people, minorities and people with low income.
Indeed, 25 per cent of Africans, 15 per cent of people who pay less than $35, 18 per cent of 65 years and 20 per cent of electorals from 18 to 29 years of age have no request for personality with photos.
But it's not yet.
Students, who are considered to vote for candidates from democracies, have not been allowed to use a person's personality certification in several States.
The same states authorize members of fishermen and voluntary clubs, which are mainly voted for the Republicns, to vote on the certification issued by the clubs.
To 2004 no State had required evidence of the existing American citizenship to vote.
The first requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than ten States adopted laws required by electioners to prove that they were the United States citizens.
These measures are obviously aimed at restricting the vote of departures from Latin America.
Two thirds of the Latin American electioners vote to the Democratic Party.
Furthermore, the Republicn legislators initiated in 2011 the laws that have registered electioners on the day of vote in eight States.
They also limited the right of individuals or groups to provide assistance to those who wish to register.
This restriction has not been passed without the consequences.
For example, during the elections of 2004, the election campaign helped about 10 million citizens to include.
At the same time, the measures taken since 2009 have been decreased at 17 per cent of the registration of new electioners in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republicn legislators adopted five other states of law aimed at reducing the period of long-term vote.
Similarly, during the overall elections in 2008 in Florida 33 per cent of the voters were Africans, although the last 13 per cent of the total number of state electioners was only 13 per cent.
Similarly, it was the same thing with the visitors from Latin America.
Only 11 per cent of the elections were 24 per cent of the people who voted for a while.
Rather than white people who, forming 76 per cent of the elections, were only 46 per cent of the voters.
Of course, democratic legislators and their parties are actively opposed to the adoption of the laws limiting the registration of elections.
Many of the legislation projects have been revised by democratic governators.
The latter laws were suspended in the intervention of the United States Prosecutor-General.
This allowed partly to limit negative consequences.
For example, only 16 of 34 states have adopted laws that require proclaiming personality certification.
However, the new rules involving the action of the elections of 2012 are obviously difficult.
Democratic criteria are condemned by the preceding of the laws adopted, showing that they are obvious to influence the results of the elections of 2012 in key states.
The report of the Centre of Brendan from 2011 shows that the states adopted by these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required in the election colleagues to win the presidential elections.
It is too early to say that these legislative changes at the level of the election system will have a significant impact on the results of the Presidential elections in 2012.
Only one of the uncertainly: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the appearance of the electors.
In this sense, such actions are partly disrupting the American democracy system.
Cancer schedule: to pass the test or not?
Indeed, the PSA tests sometimes gives false results, false, and sometimes false positions that lead to an inutilable medical involvement.
Mans, and so unwantedly dispatching, are more doubts.
Does it pass the test or not?
We asked the view of two specialists.
Studies carried out in the United States have been observed in many cases of infringement among the investigated groups, so it was difficult to interpretate and to develop any clear recommendations.
Another European study has found a different level of mortality in patients who have been scratched, and those who did not pass it.
The study also showed, after the 12-year-old monitoring, that the possibility of the metastas is 30-40 per cent above those who have not passed scratch.
So I would recommend that the test starts from 50 years or from 40 if one of the direct parents had a cancer.
Mans of African origin are also undermined to increased risk.
The key moment is to take a right decision only when cancer is found.
Rack may be aggressive and vulnerable.
The patient must clarify the risk of his cancer disease, proposing its possible options, without obliged cancer treatment, which is not dangerous for life in a long term, and by choosing, in these cases, for active monitoring of diseases.
Today, many men who have been identified cancer will not go to treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not represent a threat to life.
We will propose active monitoring, and if disease begins to progress, we will start treatment.
We are more accurately determined by the criteria to decide who should or should not be treated.
So I would recommend that the test is going on.
But it is also important to consult his doctor to determine, whether it is necessary or not.
In cooperation with the International Urology Association, Moweenberg has established a tool to evaluate all of the tests for and against the PSA test.

Prevention of Diseases
Unfortunately, there is no wonder-receptor to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress in scientific research, respect for healthy life is the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It seems that if all people were healthy and enough moved, 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
"If nobody would smoke anymore, this number would grow as at least 50 percent," stresses Andre Bole, Cancer Secretariat.
However, estimates are estimated that 10 per cent of cancer cases were inherited.
A few standards of cancer remain completely unexpected.
For the Canadian cancer Association, it remains priority, despite the reduction of the number of smokers.
The curury relates to 85 per cent of light cancer.
It is a risk factor for many others.
It affects the health of people.
"Actually in Quebec there are 1,5 million smokers," says the secretariat Andre Bole.
Insufficient fact: After 10 years after smoking, the risk to die from cancer is decreased.
Wes
According to the CAR data, lost weight and grain also contribute to diseases.
They increase the risk of milk iron cancer, accurate and direct skin, feed, jalous iron, and mass.
" The surveys show that regular physical activity is protected from cancer, " adds to the Association.
Question
The Association also recommends that the consumption of red meat be limited.
In too large numbers, it increases the risk of cancer of the tube.
It should also be avoided by colbase items.
Conservation of meat by copy, sweet or secret may lead to cancer education.
The Association explains: "The lasts may harm organ cells and lead to cancer development."
Vietnam
In recent years, many scientists have been investigating the impact of vitamin additives on cancer development.
But at the time, the results of these research cannot be identified.
In the view of SCC, Vitamin E studies have opposed results.
If one of them showed a decrease in the risk of cancer development, the other has resulted in anti-pollution.
In evaluation of the impact on the development of vitamin D, there is no fully clearness.
However, Mr. Bole emphasizes that his concerns and family anamnesis are important to discuss with a doctor.
"Paral analysis doesn't lead to cancer."
Higgs Bozon in details
Last year the report that the scientist may have found Higgs' Boss could be found, called the real glass, and not without grounds.
It seems that this bosom explains the mass of all parts in the universe, and there are no few.
Moreover, this is the last part of the existence that has been predicted in the Standard Model is our best, or, in any case, the description of the nature and the conduct of the mother, but has not been able to find an experienced way.
But the physicians aren't yet sure that it's about the Higgs Boy.
We know, without the darkness of doubt, that we have a real new part and that it very much remembers the Higs Boss predicted by the Standard Model.
Furthermore, new data presented this week at one large physical convention in Kyoto seem to be reaffirmed, although some data are still not sufficient for fully confidence.
Let's imagine that it's about the Higgs Booth, because the possibilities of being wrong are the minimum, and we're seeing what that means.
There is, in this world, one law is perfectly inevitable, that two things may not be in the same place at the same time.
Remember this rule does not have any possibility, even do not try to be too generous, otherwise injury.
However, although the physician of elementary parts is a very strange world, it is found that there is also one such law: the principle of exception of Paul, which claims that two parties cannot take the same space at the same time, at the same time when they remain in the same "qual" as the "condition" is, in general, in some of their characteristics.
As a result, physics are separated to two categories.
In one angle, we are good-going citizens called pharmacies, who are wisely subjected to the Paulian principle.
Otherwise, there are bobines, the smell of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least to this principle, which means that they may be prestigious in the same place at the same time.
As reports the website (which is unsigned) P article Adventure Labbera Berlin, these boosons are, on their own hand, separated by two groups: the mezones we're not talking here and the "participants of the forces" by which the main forces of nature are distributed, and some of them relate to the Higgs Boss.
These should be stressed, not all the ecologists as might be thought.
In fact, if you can read this chronic, it's due to an incredibly banal box: photon, or light part, which is the corner of the electronic magnetic power.
In fact, when one of the parts with electric loads accelerates or changes the direction, it "breaks" the electrical field in this specific place, such as a stone that is broken in the fleet.
The "break" is born by an electronic magnetic weather (the light, or an inflable elimination, or the ultraviolet, etc.) and this weather is nothing else as a photograph, and therefore one of the "transporters of the power".
More Stabilious Field
The same thing happens with the Higgs Boosing, with the only difference that for the appearance of the bomb, the other field, the Higgs field must be "tracked".
However, the Higgs field is a larger, stable electrical field; to rebuilt it, it is necessary to reach very and very high energy as if it speaks of an overwhelming floor, the surface of which could only be a very large stone.
That's why we need a large acceleration of parts, such as the Near, the Great Adroid Collider, which is a diameter of 27 km! to achieve such great energy.
An analogy with the electrical field is also useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs Boss and the Mass.
In fact, not all parts and not all materials are working with electrical fields.
Some, such as magnets, are interacting, others are not: the papers, for example, will never be maintained on the cold.
Similarly, not all of the parties share with the Higgs field, but those who are interconnecting have mass, even though others (such as photons, sweet) have it.
So what can you bring all these studies, ask Mrs. Plamondon?
They are used in science to check the validity of the Standard Model (SM), which also allows physicians to spend a divide between the results of monitoring and MT prognosis.
Furthermore, some of them are very desired that such disappearance might be found, so that the small inconsistent can open the doors for the "new Physicals" and close some of the models.
Lastly, there is still a substantial deficiency, not proposing any explanation to degree (a!). or for a dark mother, which forms about 80 per cent of the Universal (a!).
But until the CER hasn't found such divisions.
Consequently
The use of these studies for daily life of a medium-statistic person would be more difficult, but it would be a mistake to predict that it is not.
See: At the beginning of the 60th anniversary, the lazer study in the Bell Labs could not even propose what revolution their work will make.
They predicted their annexes in science, but not more.
Indeed, a dead physician Willerd Boyle, who worked at the Bel Lab, where in 1960 was developed the laser, which himself developed the first impossable laser (predicted) in 1962, said that the original laser was considered as a "layer thinks".
You're gonna imagine...
Furthermore, an application may be found for a research tool.
For example, the same William Boyle developed a small light tanner during its optical research in 1969.
Although this wasn't his original assignment, it now serves a "see" for all digital cameras of the world and was the Nobel Physical premium of 2009.
This is, of course, not that the work of the Great Adrian Collinder must change our life, but it only shows that it can be.
Pallitic assistance is the best way to die...
The Commission for Available Death in Quebec recently discussed the issue of the end of life.
Debates should soon be restored, and at that time the draft legislation is prepared.
However, there is still much to do in this important area.
Dorg tried to look closer.
Over a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived another in his apartment in Monterrey.
The rack of the smells that destroyed him from the outside gave him a delay for two years.
"I've been given five years, I lived seven," he said, between life and death, sit in bed in the accommodation of Victoria Gadbua in Belarus where he arrived.
"But it's always a shock to prepare this," he says.
The disease makes its work: an incredible weakness that does not make it self - controled to the toilet and even to feed self - control.
Sit on a table to which the appetitive dinner is to be paid and agreed to help him take food.
He is guarding, even smiling to smile, to talk to unconscious people who work around him, bring him medication and lead him to the bathroom.
Man before normal death.
"My greatest desire to be curated from the diare is low," he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found the medicine from this disease.
"In life, we learn that a man must stand up," says Peter Broder, psychologist in Victoria Gadbua's accommodation.
Regression to the state of the child is for some inadequate decline.
Everything depends on the ability of humans to die with a fall, he says.
As many people in the Palestinian affair, the most important events have occurred in the degree of this accident.
Patients in the palliative, Victoria Gadbua, are all cancer diseases.
Prognoses have a maximum of three months of life.
At that stage, the doctors and nurses do not provide any more assistance called "therapy".
Ms. A., 89 years of age, is worriedly to die "in awareness of loss".
But sickness allowed me to know my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I don't want anything anymore in life," she says, before she lets put her mask to breathe.
She continues to wait in the nearest days of the last visit of her son from Italy.
The Victorian Gadbua accommodation with the voluntary group provides body and food assistance.
This is a palliative department that remains when nothing else can't do.
To make death more comfortable.
There is one place in the Palestinian assistance institutions for each 11 700 people in Quebec.
This is very little, considering that we're all going to die early or later.
Here, life continues in the best conditions that can be possible, Dr. Christine Martel is one of the doctors of receiving.
Be physical, emotional or mental comfort.
The dead one we agree to provide sweet pockets from brenda or pep, seeing what he's going to ask.
We're not going to control the sugar levels.
And death is part of every day.
Tonight we brought Mr. J., who died tonight.
On the morning, his son took this drink in the legs of a quiet.
"We are helping closers as well as patients," says Nathani Savar, Director of Hepatic Diseases.
There's no day in Victor Gadbu's accommodation.
A 93-year-old old man who enjoys his last family meeting in the garden, putting on his suburbs during his honour, tragicly dies 36-year-old man, a parent, wife and two-children and tried everything to survive.
"In the last half of three to five kitchens, cancers are always employed by 45 years of age," says Dr. Christine Martell.
53 per cent of the patients receiving Victoria Gadbua have come from home and 47 per cent of the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative interface
77 per cent of Canadians only have access to palliative detention, which is provided to facilitate the suffering of sick men who have been in the final stage of their life, or at home, or in the hospital or in the hospital.
And some institutions, such as Victor Gadbua and the Palestinian Employee of the Grand Montreal House, are specialized more or less exclusively at the exit of cancer diseases.
That is the large space in the Quebec health system, and many physicians are concerned with the adoption of the Eutalysis Act and the assistance for self-assault.
Starting from October, he circled a manif signed by the Palestinians, Dr. Balfur Munt and Dr. Bernar Lapont, and witnessing their inconvenience with this initiative.
According to Dr. Christine Martell, the Quebec health system is inadequate to ensure the right to high quality involving the palliative way before it will be allowed to move to evahancing.
Recently, she says, I have seen a patient who took 14 days in the office of rapid assistance, in terrific pains, and no one has taken the necessary measures to facilitate them.
I'm afraid the patients want to die only because they don't get adequately.
At the same time, many hemologs are trying to save patients, despite pessimistic predictions.
The hope of surviving Elen Richard was at least at the time that she stopped deteriorating chemicals.
When I told my encyclopedia that I stopped the treatment, she answered me that I'm sorry to stop fighting, she tells me.
That's why she told me that my days were slow!
No Forced Income
Dr. Martell believes that 90 per cent of those who ask for death thanks to the nursing because they did not comply with their request, after the Palliative Disease Team facilitates their pain.
However, it should be noted that the palliative infringement is not absolutely powerful in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, the Palliative Invasion Director of the Palestinian Society in the Grand Montreal House, the patients were unconscious of 8 per cent of the cases.
At the end of the life, physicians often seek to a palliative ceremony in which the patient is sleeping before his death, or from time or time.
You can't be more able to make sure we don't know about these sufferings.
More and more sicknesses that are not able to facilitate pain will be able to have access to palliative seeds.
Those who suffer the pain always say the same word, "I want to die."
But this doesn't necessarily mean, "I want to make me eutanization", that means, "I want to make me easier."
This report was possible by the Canadian Health Institute’s Journalist Graduate.
Influence scandaries in Quebec
Those who are responsible for the construction of the road, construction contractors, assemblies of political partys and Italian mathematician specialists on the day of their day tell that they know the colonial " system " that is the construction industry, public officials, politicians, professional acts and matheomy.
The "Industry", which was very costly rewarded to the Quebec payers, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"True, as the system is cut off after all the means were made, Jack Ducheno, Deputy, and former police head of Montreal."
Thus, in 2011, he was scanned as a bad result of the investigation of official crimes related to road-building contracts in Quebec, whose Prime Minister, whose time from Liberals, had agreed very unfortunately.
The Ducheno Report has established a direct link between industry, secret financing of political parties and corruption.
" From the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he emphasized that only one of the Ministry of Transport would keep a billion dollars on contracts, if some of them had maintained their shares.
Mrs Sharbonno, "we have already smiled two masters," adds that it would be "aware of the schemes that are covered by individual personalities".
Permanent Corruption Unit established in 2011
The Permanent Corruption Unit established in 2011, composed of a broad state of government auditors, researchers and analytics.
In addition, staff of the Moroth Special Unit who set a "stay card" after 2009 to stop the cost of contracts.
During the past weeks, a series of surveys have been made, and some municipal officials, in particular Frank Zampino and Rishura Marcotti, had been sentenced to the lady and corruption.
On the road, Gil Weichenkur, a recent departure from Mrs. Lavalla, the third to the largest city of Quebec.
It is suspected in receipt of appeal once in the location of State orders.
Furthermore, a number of engineers of Montreal's way of communication and the Italian Builders, including Tony Akkurso and Lino Zambito, were officially accused.
The latter was overlooked the present bomb, resulting in the "system" of the receipt of State contracts.
Over a few years, Zambito gave 3 per cent of the value of contracts in Montreal, a mediator related to mathematicia, which, in turn, translated Ms. Gerald Traamble "United Montreal".
In the 2000s, Zambito spended the money to the right and left. He recorded more than 88.000 Canadian dollars (e.g. 68.000 euros) to different provinces, mainly on the Liberals that were then entitled to the authorities.
He also acknowledged that it was unlawfully collected for the former Vice-Minister of the Liberal Party of Natalie Normando.
Canal contracts in which values were increased
In Montreal, the "system" corruption worked unexpectedly.
Wil Surprin, former civil construction engineer, describes it in detail before the committee: for ten years he received the construction firms, invited to travel, to golf tours, to the restaurants, to the cocktail and towels in general $736,000 in exchange of changing contracts, which he highlighted.
Other officers who were responsible for the construction of the road were acknowledged that they received the laptop, higher accounts of 30 to 40 per cent through false supplements.
Then, one organizer of Mrs. Martin Dumon accused Mr. Tramble that he intended to close his eyes to the existence of a parallel budget filled by the partial casses.
After these openings, Mr. Tramble went to the departure at the beginning of November, loading Montreal in a deep crisis.
Chantal Rulo was one of the first deputy in Montreal, who was threatening.
Mr. Rivier de Priery's neighborhood in the east of the island is opposed to sell the municipality area purchased by $5 million and sold by... 1,6 million to the building paper.
70 per cent of injury money in predicted campaigns
She says that in the investigation that will finally begin, it "it will spend for a cut to understand the functioning of the muscles to stop the gang and determine the guilty."
This process characterizes it as a ill but positive.
We are in the prison cleaning process, but Montreal will need its own investigative group and observer to avoid returning to suspicious practices.
How we go home.
Regular.
Jack Ducheno notes from its part that “the chiefs have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars” but especially concerns the role of the "selected officials who know about this scheme" but not in the maquination.
Bearing in mind that the share of brutal money in the financing of the election campaign in Quebec reaches 70 per cent, he sweared: "I said that it was just a slight reflection of reality."
The Quebec Government proposes to limit to $100 of the donation to the parties, but, in his words, it will not change the situation: "At we are not strictly limited to the elected expenditure, the policy will be burdened. "
He requires a full rebuilding of government contracts and the financing of the party: "We can't go below, we can build a house on a more constant basis, with the best control and law."
If this story and casts the dark on the international mosquito Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Ducheno calls those who smile to look at their own door...
"PSJ is not FC Barcelona."
You've got an unexpected snack in this season.
How do you explain this growth?
This may be explained by individual consciousness, but it may be a new measurement of GDP.
The great games arrived.
I'll grow with them every day.
Technical staff has also been a lot of responsibilities.
These factors make me up the level of my game daily.
And at the time of the shop, it's easier.
It's so fast in the football.
But I don't miss.
From the beginning in the NIF pre-training centre in Clairefont and before I arrived in St-Etchen, I had always stepped forward.
So you're exciting benefits from the competition established by Carlo Anchelotti...
In addition to this summer, it is not a very high level player in the news.
They also know that each train is very important.
This leads to that player like me, wants to be at the level and get up to the maximum.
Furthermore, Carlo Anchelotti supports my position.
He's helping the Vice-Crowd McEl, who played in the same position as me.
Anchelotes are the master of the situation?
Sure.
Antiloths strive to respect all technical personnel.
He is not equal to the First League today and is included in the best trainers of Europe.
He has an extensive experience, and he won a few titles with high-level clubs.
He worked with great games.
I think he's gonna bring new Paris titles.
In January, I had a pleasant conversation with him.
Then I went away from the whole series of traumas.
The confidence he gives me also explains my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the CPS?
In the First Ligue, Leon took us a leader.
But we're still ready.
One of our main objectives is Liga Champion, which we effectively qualified in one eighth end.
What is the goal of the club in this tourist?
We're trying to go as far as we can.
It can be all right now.
We can say our own face to face with very good European teams.
We first wanted to finish the first in our group before Porto to have the possibility of taking the responsibilities in one eighth end.
Can CPS become the first-class European club in a short-term perspective?
He has a budget for that.
In order to become a large European club, Paris needs to win the titles and strengthen positions on a long-term perspective.
It's not so today.
Financially, the GSP has a means to make this project real.
Doesn't you take the title in the First Ligue, as in the past season, the biggest loss?
Of course, it would be a great disaster.
In this year, we really want to take this champion title.
We were close to that last session.
In May, there was a disappointment because we had everything to come to the finish first.
It was a very lucky season.
We've finished it with 79 eyes.
In general, 79 points are the champion named.
But the other team, Montpelle, has played more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's gonna be okay.
Despite the struggle of the titles, I think we have strong teams like Marcel, Lion and Bordo.
Don't you think that the media's waiting too much from the S.H.I.E.L.D.?
It's normal that we're waiting for a lot, taking into account how much and what we have played.
We're completely ready to do this.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 home against True and we still find out what to discover, of course, is a little disappointment.
We ask what is the first time that people are waiting for us.
We can't win every week 4-0.
We're not FC Barcelone!
We're trying to introduce a game project.
The team is formed with time.
We have proved in Liga Champion, that we could respond to the modern calls.
Look at Manchester Yunetted, who isn't able to go to one eighth finish, although they also lost great money!
In view of the amounts set, we represented you at 15 points forward to the winter break.
This would be a violation to our opponents and to the Championship of France.
Lion and Marcel, who were not at the height of the past session, were "fabriced" of this new CPS.
This shows how intensive the First League is.
I hope that in May we can smile and say ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have winned.
It seems to be fully dependent on the Zilatan Ibrahim shipping.
Well, if you say there's a little "Dependence".
That means that Ibrahimvic is very successful and that he forgot a lot of heads.
He's here for this, and he's proving that he's the First League star.
The train where he was playing, he showed that he was a big game and a star of the world.
We respect him as a man and as a player in the group.
He also respects people around it.
What he did is really extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their game.
The Devil Silva, one of the best protectors of the world, also motivates all to move forward.
How did you survive Euro-2012 from the French collection?
Like disappointment.
I wanted to learn to this Euro.
Unfortunately, my tragic stopped me playing a little time.
I saw there a lot of things, and I went out of there more stronger.
Today, I can play good choices.
That's what I hoped from the moment of my baptism in the Sons.
We have learned what happened to Ukrainian, and now we have to be sworn.
What do you think about the first months of the Day of Desham in the head of the Sons?
They're for him resulting.
He has a good position in the selected group to the Championship of the world.
He's a strict trainer, he's close to players and inspires the victory.
How was Loran Blan?
But I wouldn't like to compare.
Bran achieved his goal, he qualified us in Euro.
I hope that the Dead Desham brings the Blues to Brazil.
The good deserved nine (1-1), issued in Spain on 16 October, is a basic shop?
This match gave us faith in us.
Everyone fighted for all.
Before that shock in Spain, my career wasn't shocked.
Plan and sale without bank aid - with Bitcoin
The full contrary to the current currency exchange based on the central accounts provided by transactions between the parties receiving c committees on their processing.
Furthermore, how many of these technologies are, evidently, political vision: the conviction of the current currency system of bank monopy leads to financial crisis.
Indeed, Bitcoin, developed by Satoshi Nacamoto, is a virtual currency (converted to dollars, euro...) and a protected protocol of BitTorrent exchange, which allows to perform the exchange of files between the parties in one level.
About 2000,000 operations have already been registered from 150,000 computers in the network.
A number of thousands of websites are accepted for the implementation of donations or as a payment fund.
Bitcoin was reached by maximum $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later to $2 before returning to $10 (bitcoincharts.com) today.
Nothing specially compared to the global exchange of real money or financial products.
However, in its report on the virtual currency published in October, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in this system.
He describes a bitch as the "slightly successful virtual currency", "competiting with the dollar or the euro" and "the normal currency".
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies, as "creats" used to move in video games, which are employed in the game process or which can be purchased (which and exchanged).
The Facebook social network has also developed a similar system.
But exchange operations are always controlled and processed by any central body.
In Bitchen, all the networks are the mainteneurs of the Buhgalter Books, the audiences, the monetary emitants, the buyers and the sellers.
How does this network function?
Each transaction between two users is actually among two electronic addresses, such as e-mail.
Only for every new payment, the user may choose another address by ensuring an anonymousness.
The collection of information related to this contract is signed electronically using a double key encryption system.
The network may also be able to check the reality of the contracts.
With the content of the file, it may be possible to verify that the bits used in the box are actually available in the public account covered by the entire network.
The key stage is the registration of the new transaction in this book.
It is through the decision of a mathematical task dissolved to computers decided, as a timely central bank, to add the new line.
This is the fax of the file chasing, the conversion of a large file to a digital, short and unique signing.
Computers will take a new transaction and add her number before he's going to do it together.
The objective is to find the number that will give a unique numeric signature (should nulls at the beginning).
Once this number has been found, the other sites are easy to verify that it is right.
Transaction is thus nervously associated with the cemetery of all other transactions; any modification changes the digital signature.
If the user would like to pay two times one and the same money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network, and the other would remain uncertain because they have different electronic signatures.
The computer that decides to get 50 bits.
In order to avoid inflation, the reward may be regularly shared until the end of 2012.
The number of bits in treatment is limited to 21 million, but they're delimited to one stemilion, which leaves more reservations...
The task also increases the calculating power.
The life of the network has already survived the flights and the falls.
Bitcoin services have been attacked, and the bathrooms were stolen from reserves.
"Usered defect does not concern the protocol itself," says Peter Nuas, who recently started Paymium, a company of real money using Bitcoin networks.
The ESCB also informed the possibility of eliminating money through this anonymous service.
But the money is also inadequate.
Strong games, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept such donations.
Others, such as WordPress platform blog, are authorized.
Addy Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Waitman Institute in Israel have recently analyzed the account book and found that nearly 80 per cent of the bathrooms were not trafficking.
"Gigant sales" were announced in November.
"Third thousand dollars have been exchanged", agrees Jon Holmkwist, who works in Conabul, employed by the golden bathrooms.
Peter Nuas, another author of this currency, is strongly believed in the capacity of this technology as an operational network.
His system, Palestinian, is an equivalent credit card (in the present money) or a mobile phone payment, but uses Bitcoin to check transactions, which is thus deficit.
The driver better controls its personal data and may thus be anonymized.
The simple system is for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
Only reporting the address that can "foot and recognise" by phone, Peter Nuas states that there are thousands of users already.
There is a general trend of revision of the ironic systems for more horizontal use.
"Before Bitcoin is approved, it will take some time, but 2013 may be a turning moment," he states.
In its report, the ESCB proposes to review the diversity of risks considered to be higher today in the case of success of the system.
We're out of Afghanistan.
What's going on?
The French troops abandoned their responsibilities in Afghanistan (Cappis and Sudoku).
NATO and the Americans should follow them at the end of 2014.
For the Afghan army, it was time to return to control on its territory, but to choose their future, not only for us.
We suffered in the main part of the Afghan crossings, which we considered as terrorists.
And we're, with 88 murdered soldiers, blessed and punished.
Taliban is from foreign extremists, former commanders who are hiding in Pakistan, but often from the crystals who reject the presence of the foreign army as it was in the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaetic, to even join the Jehoadians, Pakistanians, arabs, tooths, and tamans.
They are suffering, sometimes helping local forces, but they will no longer be as far as the West will be more detailed.
The French troops from the Nijrala base, which I watched from the heights of the mining trees through the French credits, were good.
The shipping ships and the helicopters have reached Kabul, not attacked.
Since the end of 2014, the tsunami will not be at Kabul.
The circumstances have changed from 1994 to 1996 since their unexpected progress.
At that time, Kabul was empty, the country was in fire and blood because of the fight between different groups.
The recovery of them under the control of the country was then recognised as its type of freedom to return to security.
The Afghan Women paid for the mastership of these baptists, in which Al-Qaida was overlooked, but their situation has not been improved in our day.
The former moderates, the Afghan Government and the present talents are in their desire to maintain women in a substantive situation.
The main personalities of the antisotic war returned to the authority in 2001.
They have converted to swings of public land to sell them under the installation of repatrians returned from Iran and Pakistan, using large American sub-agency contracts.
They were dismissed, most of them, but they did not even fight themselves.
People, as I heard in a rural location, wish to be a government that would not be out of the land.
Many young people want to go to the way they are going away from the American blessed ones: Capital Population is meaningful.
Young people slaughtered from war and their ideology.
They lived in the modern world during the expulsion of Iran or Pakistan, and they appreciated the advantage of it.
About 65 per cent of the population is under the age of 25; in Kabul there are now 5 million people, one of the fifth overall populations.
State schools in towns are filled as boys and girls.
The workplaces of these young people who do not want to return to an old party or to the corruption of some leaders should be provided.
All, including armed bombs, love mobile phones, television, and Turkish milk operations representing the modern world and look at all.
The army is at the moment.
Will the authorities who will command it be considered legitimate?
Older commanders in the anti-sociotic fight have already taken measures to restore provincial women who would not be undertaken by the central authority.
Afghanistan, a mountain country with strong local differences, must be decentralized in a certain sense of decentralization in the picture of the Western countries, but the United States wanted to convert it into a centralized State with a strong presidential authority, eliminating the post of the Prime Minister, which was held in 1964 during the Constitution.
The President of Carzai does not want foreign control, particularly before the elections referred to in April 2014.
But his country, starting from the 50s, depends on foreign assistance.
Industry has not been placed on the feet, no flesh functions, no irrigation system has been reorganized.
Everyone is imported; nothing is produced except fruit and fruit.
Priority is given to a private initiative.
In the country destroyed by the thirty-years of war, the infrastructure control would be necessary.
They heard that Afghanistan had great mineral riches.
This has only increased the sense that western countries were present there only to possess them.
Without energy to retain the heat or mediums on the place, without transportation to export them through the mountains, without obtaining useful escapes.
The Chineses were almost abandoned by Mes Ainak, left by the international architects (financed by the World Bank) to discovered a large buddhistic complex and remain the largest employees of the province.
It should also be necessary to restore normal relations at one wonderful day in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
The final conclusion of the French combat units has been concluded on 20 November.
The New Cooperation Treaty provides for the maintenance of traditional assistance: persons for girls, boys, French Language Faculty at the university, the French Institute, the cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural areas, support of the Archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, with the efforts to “reason the heart and desires” and to achieve the impossible task of co-operating assistance with subsequent operations, the "free-government activities" service at the Ministry of Defence" (Cimic), who was married in 2012, together with a small French public organization, has contributed to a number of public works and activities aimed at reconstruction of rural housing in decades of mountain villages.
These works, with the intensive involvement of local work force, have helped to maintain upstanding: goodness, colds, drinking water, reconstruction of forests, fruit trees, food protection and increased land areas.
What do we have to remember about ourselves, losing two billion euros in military expenditure?
The much more modest budget would promote the improvement of the living conditions of the local population, which are very ridicule in these regions, often located at more than 20,000 meters above the sea level.
The Ambassador has received decades of written requests for the implementation of small agricultural work from local communities in Capis province.
To be removed from the resurrections of foreign groups that desire farmers as they said to me, there is a small inevitable support to them that would be well controlled and directed.
Extreme species of the Constitution of Egypt
This is a new risked step by President Mursy.
While Egypt is separated more than ever, on the question of the Constitutional Declaration, which is providing an emergency authority to him, he decided to play a va-bank.
Instead, he announced in the medium that the Chartership would vote on the final text on the next day.
A week ago, the head of the State provided the congregation two additional months to end the work.
Shortly two years ago, as Egypt is opposed to a preliminary text in which a number of amendments have been amended, deficit institutional stability and led to legal oppositions.
This new initiative has only increased the separation of the country.
His opposers believe that the President is in its "autocratic sweet" by continuing "reducing this word" and "astray the right".
His followers are convinced that this is the way to end the institutional and political crisis by accelerating the transition process.
The referendum should be held within 15 days.
It is a very short time that lets the brothers refuse to explain to the Egyptians the text in the article.
For the President, this is also the way to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while infringement is over the whole country.
Mohammed Morsey seems to be convinced that the Egyptians are proclaiming positively as he stated in one interview of the American weekend of Time.
Moreover, the call for a rapid vote is the switch of the Egyptian people: “If you vote for my text, or I have an emergency power”, which, as it is supposed, must be completed after the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Governing Assembly, most of the Islamics, have been declared last night by text.
Most Liberals did not respond to calls.
In the midst of November, soon before the constitutional declaration, they took the door, feeling that they could not reach their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society have done the same.
To achieve the necessary quorum, 11 persons of the participants were successfully added last morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brothers.
It is unexpected that in most cases, the articles have been declared unilaterally.
On the other hand, the comments made the fact that one of the few differences of the day had been around... a time for prayer, since some members of the Committee read that the time of the Charter was wrong.
The text on which the vote was still voted last night consists of article 234.
The general attention of article 2 finally remained an identical article from the Constitution of 1971 that "the principles of the chariot are the main source of law".
The Palestinian parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law was one of the main requirements, were expected to replace the "principes" to "just", which would give them a more strict application.
For Islamics the fact that this article has not been changed is the testimony of their good will and respect for the other parties of the Egyptian society.
The "license" answers the liberals that are only a pilar.
Because, as they believe, the exclusion of the Constitution occurs through other articles.
They focus on article 220, which gives an advisory role in Al-Azhar University, in particular with regard to checking the correspondance of the chariot law.
According to the specialist of the Egyptian Sofi Pomaye, this is anxious, namely, "persons intended to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy".
We can look at the birth of the theocracy."
Many Liberals, moreover, are expressed by the fact that the next doctor of the university seems to be less dead than now.
" At this time there is no specific religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of civil law.
Most lawyers who worked on this text are not vulnerable, but people with university education, some have been trained in the French system," said Alex Bloe, who will prepare the dissession on Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that " around article 220 may occur in an independence, as the terms used in it are immigrated from religious physicians.
This applies in particular to the "phics" [Islamic law, accepting r].
And in the future, the question of how powerful civil judges are to make decisions on this."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is criticized because it provides a wide authority to the President of the Republic.
Muslim brothers claim that they have significantly reduced in comparison with the old regime.
Another opposite point: Army power.
In accordance with military wishes, the consideration of the defence budget will be not in the Parliament, but in the National Defence Board.
The court shall also not be prohibited by civilians in military courts, despite requests of human rights associations.
Recently, it was also concerned about the text that they are considered a minor for freedom.
Reserved responsibility for godly devotion, and it is now prohibited by distressing that may have serious consequences for the freedom of words, and especially for the freedom of pressure.
Nevertheless, no article refers to the protection of women, Heba Moraefe, from Human Ryan's Tache.
It says that the only positive moment is the prohibition of torture in article 36.
The word not appeared in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian Chairman had to speak last night on television, the mandate was planned today on the second half of the day.
Headquarters of the State heads will, in their own way, go to the street on Saturday.

The "great and powerful" to Moscow says that migrants will copy money in language
As long as the Deputy and Rights Defenders claim that the law on binding language tests will be granted, the country has already come to the "little" marketing of certificates.
Any year, 13 million guests arrived in Moscow, Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of these citizens in Middle Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkey.
Their only goal is to pay money for the family remaining.
From 1 December, it entered into force of the law, in accordance with which every working immigrant will be able to review Russian language knowledge.
As long as this rule operates only for those intended to work in the field of services, housing and communication, fat and degrading trade.
However, with time, - they promised to the FMI, the tests will be binding for all arrivals.
Then it is not just the language but also the Russian history and the basis of legislation.
The knowledge of the language should also be confirmed for receipt and for the proliferation of work permits.
The exclusion is only for citizens of the countries where Russia is a public language.
The law and persons who have been able to obtain attestations and educational diplomas before the SSSC decline in 1991.
Use, decrease and protection of rights
The network of exams will work under the Russian language Institute of Pushin, the University of People's friends, the GMI, the SIPG and other Russian hosts.
Migrant tests will be enabled in all cities; more than 160 of these centres are now opened in Russia.
The initiative of testing was supported and the Chairpersons of the Gospel and the FMI.
And so, before the law entered into force, the human rights defenders have been able to ask the press a lot of times, and what would it be ownership?
What changes the obligation of knowledge of language and for Russians, and for the most residents?
First of all, the representatives of the migration service are enabled to reduce the number of people suffering from “the dead slavery”.
Many speak now about the protection of the rights of labour migrants, explains the leadership of the Russian FBI representatives in Tajikistan, Victor Sebel.
Protection of their rights must be started before their departure.
Only the organized system allows for 90 per cent to address foreign workers problems.
Problems occur in migrants without professionals, inconsistent languages that have no medical observance.
Without understanding of the language, Sebel, the future migrant has decided to face inevitable people who will be able to cut the "travel" into a tighten swimming bark where he and his decades will be covered without food and documents, including 12 to 14 hours in the ground.
We receive a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"In the family they promise each other, and at their arrival they lie, they choose passports and do not pay the promised payment," reaffirms the head of the Tajikistan Tolib Shariple.
Don't worry, shooter!
However, while many people in the Mediterranean Republic, which are assembled for work in Russia, are acknowledged that they do not only know the language of the country in which they are trying, but also write with their own work.
It is certain that it is not their wine as bad as it is: few tuckmans, tooths, and smokes can allow themselves to even obtain an explicit primary education.
Because their families have nothing even to use their children, not to be able to cut them up, training and training at school.
In the first place, such men are sent to the jobs before younger age.
It's difficult if it's wrong with the language, they're recognised.
"You're low and unprecedented."
True, the Law on the Rights Protectionists notes an important point.
Testing will be carried out only for migrants who have legal status.
However, if the status is no examination or a subsequent official work.
However, the large part of the gustarbiters remains illegally living in Russia.
"Good welcome, or the bilateral entry is banned."
Many of the residents say that obtaining official status in our country is not so simple.
The responsibilities are in the bureaucratic preferences and the same language difficulties.
Moreover, the legalization is money: from 12 to 16.000 rubbers.
The false registration can be made fast and over half thousands.
The Russian police officers know that we have in the main case of false documents, no registration, here and cases of demand.
"There are a hundred, two to smoke, a tea," was shared with the journalists of Tajikistan Umed Hushadham.
"Don't buy, buy a book."
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law, the false persons were not only migratory instruments.
A number of "long" language test certificates have already been issued by FMS staff.
Detailed papers are printed on a normal colour printer.
It is certain that they have been sufficient to new owners: each of the migrants expected to facilitate the task of testing has paid for seven thousand rubbers.
This is two times the road of official testing procedure: it will be covered by the workmigration in three thousands.
The main task for the next time is to protect the corruption system so that the " shorts " could not be able to purchase, connect, and the representatives of the authorities and the rights defenders.
As long as the authorities may promise the guests who have not been successfully tested from the first time, time to study the basic language course.
Furthermore, there will be a proposal for work in areas that do not promote active communication with people.
IDP does not take an illicit weapons market in the trade
Crimes with legal weapons are extremely small
The Russian SME proposes to renew the law on civil weapons owners.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: To shoot fires on marriages when there was no victims, and the battle built by the Moscow judiciary Dmitrim Vinograd, resulting in the death of seven people.
The police wants to prohibit the pressing of traumas in public places and to increase the age of which the arms license can be obtained from 18 to 21 years of age.
The idea supported the head of the thinking Committee on Security and Competition of Irina Yaroa and promised that the amendments of the weapons law would be introduced in the future.
It is not all pleased that Russian authorities are trying to fight the problem by the "hake cutting".
There was an open letter that the authors, representatives of various small public organizations, required to reject the "being existence".
The percentage of assaults with registered weapons was minimumized, and the Russian By-bi-s-criminalist Vatilia Lasker declared.
According to the IMD statistics, 142 crimes have been made in 2012 with the use of fire weapons registered in internal cases, while the whole period has been fixed by 1168.000 crimes.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the restructuring of the legislation in the field of civil weapons does not place a crime to go to the black market.
Now, according to their words, we can find any weapons in Moscow as a low price.
At that time, IUD claims that the situation is controlled by the dissemination of illegal weapons.
Travellers: from officers to officers
The "warm" weapons market is filled with several channels.
The main channels of these five are reported by the embassy of Victor Balanz, who has been employed in the Ministry of Education and Henstave for ten years.
A website that accepts a weapon order
The first is the Army or Military Supply, which was slaughtered during the Battle Action in Kavopah.
"The weapons of Russian officers and the cowboys themselves," says the Barranja.
The next kind of " black weapons" is a slaughtered crime in the representatives of the forces structure.
The board explains that the police officers are insepared and routed directly to law enforcement officers.
The illegal creatures are in the sales of military equipment.
Many of the military units have often occurred explosions.
"There are the evidenced versions that a part of the fire was made specially - to cover the shortcomings," said the former military.
Their lips, according to the Barranty, producers of weapons.
“Actually, private weapons are fruited which do not sustain international competitiveness and elect weapons from the field under the black market, including Moscow,” said the experts.
Another source of black market is the contraband.
In particular, weapons and cars from poor countries, such as Kyrgy.
"There is its production, sometimes a sculpture, and the mafia that organized the river," explains the former military.
Where's the weapon?
Experts learned how close every source of illegal weapons delivery on black market.
The report on this in 2011 prepared the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Management Projecting.
Specialists analyzed the reporting of IUD and Rossstat, criminal literature and the open data on weapons topics.
A part of the illicit weapons, writes researchers, comes from the army and force states.
The half of the weapons on the black market were “for the fault of officials who worked with the weapon” states in the report.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of the armed conflict cases, 14 per cent of the weapon production stages, 5 per cent of the black archaeology.
The advisor of one of the weapons shops that requests not to call his name believes that weapons found by black copers have already been purchased too long.
It's just as he says, the soldier's coming to the war.
A man is buying a unit, such as a TT gun.
He's writing it, they're transferring it through the slaughter.
"He'll transport her to the city and sell it up to 900 euros for two shops," he says.
"Both, the police in the course of all cases, therefore, when the crime opens periodically, is under control purchase for illegal weapons", adds the advisor.
"What's in the growing shop."
The buyer and buyer often find each other through the acquaintances.
I looked at the websites, in the blog until the friends were called to come to the Godwai platform where the man will take me to the "hook" where we're going to trade.
I learned the price only there.
Military investigator Victor Balanz
I need a acquaintance with a shooter that's going out, tells me the shopping advisor.
The sales are on the market, but there is also need to come, likely, "Ivan Ivanovic, who asked to send the daughters to dent out."
I'm even getting a couple of castes through a man who's sure.
He's just putting them to me because he knows I'm not gonna give him.
News search for weapons in different ways.
The former military Victor Balanz was the role of the buyer of illegal weapons in the middle of the 1990s when he prepared for the publication of this article.
His words did not change.
He gave the album with the photos where he was "too good."
"I felt like in a sweet shop," remembers the military.
The purchaser, according to Barranty, doesn't propose a cup in the kitchen - it's possible to try.
I'm the potential customer, not just buying - we're going to go with a soldier in the boss, we're making a mouse.
"I have the opportunity to shoot, and when I convince that weapons are good, we start to trade", describes the expert procedure.
Managers in the Wonder
The Internet searchers are outlined on websites and groups in the Computer, where they propose to purchase the weapons for different purposes.
There are no documents and meetings for that purpose.
"Thank a certain amount of money", they are written in an advertising chat on the website "Copting a weapons or an automated weapons."
The users leave their complaints and ask questions.
What about the juvenile sale?
"The license of the license, of course," asked the user "Ivan" (orphography remained).
"T. Moscow Count" - Laconally formulates the "Fedrenk" request.
The Federal Security Service has now dismissed a large network of substantive sites and those wishing to buy a war weapons stroke.
People go as a hungry fish on a snake, and then get in Siberia angle
Military suspect and former military Victor Balanzer
I heard about such schemes: normally the website is registered under Russian laws.
People take orders.
The purchaser is making payment.
"The answers are sent photos and instructions where the weapon was hidden," says the public secretariat Dmitri Kiслов.
Victor Barransky claims that the request was left on the site can be stayed without weapons and spend for a decision.
The Federal Security Service has now dismissed a large network of substantive sites and those wishing to buy a war weapons stroke.
"There are going to come as a hungry fish on a floor, and then they get to Siberia angle," he says.
Makros for $100
In purchase of illegal small weapons, expert estimates, the amount of $100 to $900 can be paid.
According to Dmitri Kivro, the Macarv ' s weapons arms arms can be purchased for $100,300.
It's gonna be waiting for a month post.
He downloads from the long-standing components of these medium-related components.
Official statistics, compared to January-October 2011, the number of such crimes in the whole Russia had reduced by 7 per cent and 22.9.000, and the number of losses and demands of weapons, bombs, explosive materials and explosive devices reduced 7.8 per cent.
In the United States, fastfound workers and supermarket workers
Through work at the McDonalds, all American adolescents are working to the fourth.
In the past few days, the protestist shares in the Walmart Corporation and the restaurants of the popular fast food networks such as McDonalds, "Burger King", "Yaho Bel", "Wandis" and "Canticky Fried".
As long as no one should predict whether the carriage is converted into the nineth currency, or it is condemned to wake up at early stages.
Action supports professionals and several left public organizations.
In addition to the improvement of moderate wages received by the Walmart and the fast food system, the establishment of professional organizations is the aim of prosecutors.
As long as the economic sector is almost not in the professional movement.
46 cents per year?
The actions started last week, after the Thanksgiving Day, as the Black Friday called, when in America the orthodox of refrigerators was disrupted, the earliest millions of swimming swimming ones, and sometimes the swimming pools.
In that day, some workers of the Walmart corporation, in which 2,2 million people have worked around the world, left their workplaces and paid together with professionals and the left shopholders, whose goods were equipped with modest and medium-sized people.
Walmart spends all on the light, from the skin, shooting weapons and car batteries to piles, ices and milk.
Products in its shops in average from 8 to 27 per cent decks than in large supermarkets.
Thus, many low-employed workers in Walmart are only in their own work.
The accessibility and assortment of goods made Walmart one of the largest American corporations.
According to the critics, Walmart may allow himself to sell the goods of shipping because it is little to pay for his employees.
Recently, the lack of car loaders or manual scanners are also complained of the difficulty of work.
Their shareholders required to increase payment and deteriorate that the cost of the company's medical insurance was upgraded from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
The typical worker Walmart, receiving $9.5 per hour, said they.
Scientists from the Kalifornia University in Berlin prove that if Walmart increases the average payment up to $12 per hour, the corporation of $3.2 billion.
It's about 1,1% more than it's paying for now.
If Walmart's entirely moves the payment of buyers, every visit to the shop will be over to 46 fees of the road.
For a year, they will cost $12,39 more than now.
The Walmart Participants noted that the Protest Action was only in nine states and did not cause corporations or small damage.
"First Friday" continued in her shops from 8 hours to midday afternoon, and Walmart sold about 5000 goods in seconds.
In the total complexity of her cash devices, almost 100 million transactions were carried out in the Green Friday.
The representative of the company, Dan Fogelman, said on the left website of Huffington Post, that the workplaces have left the total complexity of the Walmart staff, and that the protest was the total "normal piratery trick" organized by her prosecution.
"Free Cassa."
Protests continued this week in New York, where their object was not the Walmart University (which do not betray them in this progressive city, and therefore they are not here), and McDonalds and other quiet restaurants.
McDonalds says he's sell billions of portions, and then he doesn't even give you sicks and doesn't pay you for honest work!
Julian Williams, New York Hungariat member
The minimum payment, in accordance with the Federal and New York legislation, is at this time $7.25 per hour.
The restaurants have increased rapidly, but less than they are, and the average number of workers have $8.90 per hour received in New York.
They are less in this road, no one will pay.
How to exist in New York for such money, I'm unreasonable.
Once through McDonalds, there were four American adolescents who worked for their appendix after school, who lived in their parents.
A little person saw this main source of survey or planned to stay there for a long time.
But now I continue to stand on the interview with the McDonalds workers who regret that they should live on the payment, and sometimes even the children.
On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal forum deals with comments that the author notes that the child is insufficient if you don't know what you're going to use them.
Protest actions started on Friday 6,30 on the 40th Street and in Madison Avenue, were required to be paid as at least 15 dollars per hour as a minimum of the current minimum wage.
They also requested the establishment of professional organizations in the field of rapid food.
The American law prohibits the administration of this to prevent and punish actors of the professional movement by driving and freezes.
On the other hand, the Administration has rarely facilitated their lives.
But to cover rapid food by professionals, it is complex and Objective.
One of the main ones is an unexpected substance.
Inconvenience
Sound protesters were held on that day and have several other refrigerators of Manhattan.
In the middle of the mixday, the action appeared in the McDonalds, close to the Times-Cover, where a number of local democratic politicians, in particular, the member of the Gulf of Junion Williams, who said, "Makdonalds" said that he sells billions of ports, and then he does not even give you males and does not pay you for the honourful work!".
Demonstrates supported and other visible New York Democratic Democracy, such as candidates at the post of Mrs. Bill De Blasio, who stated that " we should be friendly to support fast food workers to achieve just payments and economic well-being for each New Yorker".
As the New York Times observed, this was the greatest action in the history of the American rapid food area.
However, only hundreds of people were involved in it, but not all of them were fast-building employees in New York, where tens of thousands were employed.
Until it is unexpected whether this screen of mass movement will generate.
"When the brain lies, it's a medium."
The popularity of modern technologies has recently been adopted through special points.
The first summer at its annual conference, Google showed the active model, and then was known in November that the application for the relevant patent was given and Microsoft.
However, from the discussion with the leader of the 3D Interactive Technology Group at the Cambridge Lab, Microsoft Sharam Isladi should be that for the scientists of the cluster company is a past stage.
They have the prospect of manipulation of virtual objects in black hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Tell me, please, what's going on your research group?
- We are employing human interaction with machines, but we try to divide the borders of this interaction.
As the humanity was shocked in the mass, the work with pickets on a pool screen, sometimes the twins are thicking in them.
We want to look at 5 to 10 years ago and warn the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox and the Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold without Kinect, because it's interestingly cruel management.
- What's going on?
Despite Kinect's interaction to physical levels, many are still on a pool screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input has been improved (the system has more data), and the conclusion is not too much.
We're trying to change this, working on the truly three-measuring systems on the basis of different technologies, including projects.
We need to get out of computer peace in our physical, to make it more vulnerable.
However, for this, we need to recognise not only the user but also the space around it.
Then we can add the real world by virtual objects in a very much better form.
And in the first way, these stupid shoes of virtual reality!
- What do you think about the voice management?
The polar shoes, but don't they reassess it?
- It is certainly unable to call panacea - a question of privacy, because it is not always desired to publish the surrounders about their actions and purposes.
In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but everyone is in their own.
For example, we had a project that we thought about kitchens, but not over swimming, but on such shopping, short.
The shoes were taken not the camera of the device, but a handle browser that fixed the skin and mouse movement.
As long as it is big, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of the hand hours.
But the future is for a common type of management, for example, jist+ голос.
- How is that?
- For example, how do you ask me to give you this gas bank?
You'll tell you, and you'll show it simultaneously.
- I'm usually just talking.
- Oh, it'll be very hard to recognise.
- Do you mean, you want to make users adapted to what may or can't at the time of the car?
- It's not necessary, but it's a closer approach.
I think, in the nearest time, we should mainly work on the development of new sensors that will enable us to determine the human reactions.
This may be, for example, the laser sensors, they give a bad deep permission, which is very important.
- If you talk about your work with Senators Xbox Kinect, what claims to modern cameras?
There is no permission, depth or anything else?
- In principle, the present generation is what can be affected in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get megapixel 8 with a speed of 1000 a/s.
But the case is not in the most megapictics, but as matrix and deep.
From the last point of view, all the current technologies are inadequate, which adds work to the designers of algorithms.
I mean, we should remember not only the permission of X and Y, but also Z.
It is also very important, the number of carriages in seconds.
Human movement is very dynamic, and the current 30 k/s is clearly few, especially for shoes.
Steven Betiches from our Radmond Lab has made a sensor with a regulated delay of 1 to 100 ms, with modern serial sensors near the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone understands how this affects human and machine interaction.
I would like to be very grateful to the equivalent of this device, not just the necessary relationships to be worse in seconds.
- And the number of cameras will not need to increase?
- Kinect now has three boxes, one of which actually is a infrared extractor, and the second is the acceptor of a reflected signal.
And here's the third camera, that's the common senator of the visible diameter.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
The potentially greater number of cameras could solve the problem...
Or to destroy it, increased the number of calculations required.
It would be difficult to create a flexible Kinect analysis, play with a crystal situation, and see how this helps in the three-dimensional definition of the situation.
- As I remember, Microsoft, in different ways from Google, did not present the public of his eyes.
Do you not think that daily use of supplementary technologies is one of the most prospective platforms?
- Of course, it's always time to switch, holding Smartphone in the hands, not very good, but this is what I think is: the most wonderful option would be the additional reality, when you could switch through the area platform with the spot, the projection screen, and further.
The eye is a very personal device, which is their power (private things you can see) and the weakness is an additional reality on the basis of the views does not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- We're presenting a minute that the manipulation of virtual golf objects in the air is not only available for Tony Stark from the Heavy Man, but also the simple death.
There is a problem that often indicates the criticism of this idea: no tactic call!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers will your group prepare for this call?
- In my doctors, I often say that supplementary reality is the seventh interaction between human and machines.
I think the eighth could be an appendix of tactic feelings.
Together, one of the interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a shape of images.
She's registering the test!
But there are also technologies that are really directed to the assembly of these "cartinas in the air" -- for example, the interference of a number of extractional pieces in a certain point where the ball is, it makes feeling, but until it's very weak - like you're slow.
There are brasslets that affect nervous finances in the fingers, also a prospective direction.
- You tried to lie the brain?
Let him think he's feeling that like it should feel at the time he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We're not sorry to do that.
There is another task that is to fight for a long time - as to put a person who is physically in a very limited space, to believe that it is on an open, practically unnecessary - work and on the concepts of flight routes (not such as clubs), moved platforms and large shapes.
As long as the brain lies is medium, work is still a lot of years.
That's what works on the virtual reality of such an appeal for the researcher - a lot of things in a completely initial state.
Training instead of culture is Rosbalt.
The "Rosbalt" project continues to be the Peterburg Avangard, dedicated to the mountains that are forwarded in the avangard of culture and art.
In this spot, there have already been a clear number of workers in Peterburg, whose achievement is out of the cities framework, often acknowledged in Europe, in the past of Russian knowledge.
The New Rosbalt Hero is the epata artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kiril Miller as a strike man who is covered in the whole red, in the Russian Museum, in the Latvia garden, on the modern shoes and shoes.
Kartina, Kiril Miller, always collect snakes where they wouldn't be.
Kiril Miller is one of Peterburgian social and Philosophic speakers who created new microologys.
Kiril Miller is the chicken man of Peterburgian Avangard at the end of the 80s, the beginning of the 1990s.
He also was a cityman who appears on the streets that causes a smile in the mountain, which is upsetting all the dimensions.
He recently took a sharman in his hand and became a Peterburgian sharmaner, since he was aware of all his divine existence, philosophy and minge.
- Kryril, why are you going to the city in the whole red, not in the iron or blue, for example?
- I chose a red color as a model that works with the kind and mingers.
The red color in this world is a compromise between artist, immigrator and society.
Although everything that is not serious in society is caused by aggression and recovery of unclean qualities.
But my invasions are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my invasion action is an invitation to the debate.
- When do you understand that you should be an artist?
- To the exhibition in the New York City, where my work was put.
I realized that it's my way.
Then the care of old non-official artists came, and new, free I was not understood.
I started friending with the artists of the new wave, with a post-shore that brought to the Pushine-10, and there was no more waves.
I'm cut into the theatre, clothes, music, all the gyms, except words.
And all this has been connected to your Art Clinic... - I was important to wait in Peterburg's culture centre, where we should collect all the best creative forces.
In 1995, I took the territory to the Puskish 10, and there was a musical and artistic club, a godly club, the house of the Peterburgian gods.
Many of them were born: NOMs, Tequila-Jaz, I remember Snara's project with the Who Van Gog.
Snow and his friends were sing under the fanner of light songs, they were in a swimming trick, among them were the modern player of Ygor Wodovin.
When the group played alive, she became Lininggrad.
Trucktenberg was the leading of many programs to the calify times.
We gave them Trucktenberg, and he went to the big carriage, and the basic education and education he received us.
"D 137" gallery "Griboed" is a resignation from Art Clinics.
Our workers are out of there forever.
I'm the hero of the last century when the culture means something.
In 2000, it was a press, the prize was the "Food of our city".
In the name of the Year of the Year I was called, my culmination ended.
In the new times of old rules, I am a man of truth, honestity and culture of the past century.
In our years, it is easy to become popular, but cultural and popularity can be popular but not very cultural.
- You're in charge of the manner that you know.
- Many of my pictures are the chicks, they're expressed a very glass and athletes.
I'll have a program exhibition, the Russian Museum in Klones.
Clones are an interim category.
I was so social, now being so painful and horrible.
But the clons are all dismayed, the tragism is cut off.
I love the smell, I've got a lot of ideas.
For example, the salvation of peace by the equal relief in order.
Now, on the clothing, they meet the outer machine, not the internal man.
Well, maybe he couldn't give him a hand and he's got to smell in the skin.
And the lie will be cut off with the relief.
And recently we saw you in the role of a city sharmaner.
Whoever isn't me, they're.
- Maybe the commercial art can be beautiful?
- The commercial art must now be accumulated, tactical, sweet.
It's the declination of culture.
People were slaughtered in a snake, the god loved one, the rest of the other.
But now the micro-economics are ongoing, and it's hard to do all.
I don't have a 100-year-old paper that everyone likes.
Now we need to think who you're gonna like.
Now, every cultural hero is about 100 worshippers.
- And the Michalova Stace comes a few thousands!
- He's got brochures. There's a sex-social area.
And 300 people will come to the culture, and 100,000 willn't come, and at the end, less mining, money, all shock.
I have worshipers, mostly not to lie, not to export the benefits.
I wrote these pictures in the youth that they have one collectioner on the wall with Falk and Larryon.
I started from the pictures that are usually finished.
Now it is often the idea.
They say, culture of spiritual and consumption.
There is no culture in consumption, it is from another operation.
I am a people of culture last day, growing up on examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, rejected money for drawing images.
I'm about this culture.
- Kill, what's wrong with Peterburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is an idea: a cultural responsibilities.
But not everyone can do culturally.
In the right kings, the kings may not be very understanding in culture, but they understood that they had to keep the right experts.
Here are good advisors in Moscow now.
We have people in Petersburg that could be experts, but they're accused, as they need higher experts that will evaluate these experts correctly and give them the way.
Now it's sweet.
And Heratt, but they're different because they're honestly saying that not all the modern art we're taking, there are artists that have to find themselves other museums.
- What is Peterburg for you?
Petersburg isn't a cultural capital in Moscow, there's a lot of flights.
And on our stones, the art of growth is difficult.
We need cultural advertising, and we have writers now more than readers, that's wrong.
There are very many people in Europe who are experienced, who are on exhibition, concerts.
We've got this blue.
We need to do a modest art as it was in the beginning of the last century.

Number in Space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or combination with asteroid murderer.
The Caribbeans of Space ships are seen for the search of a safe planet.
In order to maintain humanity, is the main question of how to continue its nature in situations of weakness or in the same dangerous planet?
I think a small choice.
Factually, the present planet is only two that can be seen, even if hypothetical.
"He is Vener and Mars," is the senior scientist of the State Astronomy Institute of P.C. Starnberg (GAIS) Vladimir Surdin.
But if Marse conditions are more worthy for life, the surface of Venice is 500 degrees of temperature.
You can live only on a large height or on the Vienna orbit... in the space.
Reproduction issues have started from the fleet.
Another half years ago, there were experiments on plants.
The four generations of the horbide generations were not different from their earthly shoes.
Then, the exhibition of insufficient, slightly fruit-drizofild mushrooms.
In 1979, an egg was sent to the space to check how the embryon was developed in the conditions of pregnancy.
We're getting an absolutely normal pending out.
And here it's still starting a problem.
"The fact that the pentle must find the opposition, he must stand on his feet and start moving", explains the leading laboratorium of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP) RAN Vladimir Shinchev.
I don't find the opposite, the peppers were shocked in a shock.
10 hours later, the full astrophy of instincts occurred.
The penns did not react to light and sound.
And there was a disappointment that they just died through the fourth shoes.
"And two times we smell the birds, after that they refused, because they couldn't work with them," constantly missed the experiment with the birds in the Vladimir Szschev space.
With the last time of the biological "middle" flighted to the orbit 16 years ago.
Experiences continued in the course of 2013.
However, Bion's biosport will be only one-complete persons.
There was an experiment of crystals that were sent to the space with fruit.
In principle, there was nothing outstanding.
"It's been on biostellics, but again, it's a unique experiment, and such studies must be conducted," said Vladimir Szschev.
After the landscape, the seeds appeared.
But the problem of multiplication is directly in space until it is not obtained.
It's a simple task.
Life, loss of a environmental environment simply cannot implement its geographical instinct.
A man, in contrast with a beast, may, in principle, be.
Homo sapiens has an abstract idea and can create a similar emotional background.
Such experiences are not subject to the ethical views.
But women have been flying in space for 50 years.
The largest risk was in the Teresk.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is a woman's body.
Our Chake Vultel, and nobody on the earth could say, whether he'd be keeping after the flight in the space.
Does she have a child after that fleet?
"Nobody answered this question," said Veteran, the Vachtang Vachnadze Radio.
In June 1964, only a year after the fleet in the space, the first woman of the cosmonaut Valentín Teresa was born with her daughter.
The father of the Andrian Nicolav was also a span.
In 1988, the second Svetlana Svetlana Sweden, two times in the orbit and even working in the open space, was born son.
However, the risk remains.
We have little units that are counting spaces that have all been swimming after long flights and growing up a healthy generation.
"If more, it is dangerous even at the orthodox flights, " . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
However, humanity needs to search for some new ways in biotechnology, protecting from radiation, creating art degradation.
CCC hidrolaboratory is a binding stage of fleet preparation.
Here, in the conditions of the nucleus slope of the space, the ability to work in an open space.
Water is injury.
If you are adults, you should be comfortable, but it's all foreigner, it's a natural nature for grain children.
Small neutralians seem to be confirmed - life on the skin out of the ocean.
There is a connection between the baby’s about nine months in the mother’s swimming iron, and it is easier to switch up to the water.
In principle, this is logical because since the birthday, from the first purchase, is only two weeks.
"It's very little to forget something," says the María Axnova's swimming instructor.
The words, if the child is more natural for the child, the need for women, the force of gravity.
Very fast in the weakness, the muscles of the animals, the taze, are able to evacuate the fruit.
All right, let's go, trusting the promotors of the family.
Of course, you can go to a special camera, to cut it out.
"And what further?" brings untruthful questions to the Valerie of Pole.
On the other hand, the child also needs art degradation.
Without the earthly delay, the body does not form a skelet and a muscle system.
New birth in orbit is not possible as an adult to take a special load cost for training.
He'll just be blessed because he'll be living.
"And this experiment we're going to go with you, allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment, brings us to the Earth of Disabilities, a completely disadvantaged person," is the director of the IMP RAN Pest's bioethics committee.
To the birth of children in the space is the question of the theory.
However, this will be the reality when the earthquake is on its ships to a remote planet that will become a house for their descendants born in space.
Head of the Head of Audit Control: the Swatch System's Check has been slaughtered by policy officers.
The Czech State purchase sectors have good control bodies and, despite the existing quality legislation, it remains in its application.
This is a statement by Miroslave Cal, Vice-President of the Supreme Review Control, from the interview for the website Update.cz.
"Zakon will never be perfect, but he must apply what, in my view, is not enough," commented the current situation of Cal.
Such conclusions provide joint inspection of the Chech and German control bodies.
As an example of wrong practice, Peter's approach is soon to the so-called sharp system.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that the GDP (Charlie Democratic Party) would not be concerned about the investigators of check-up - is that prohibited or permitted?
"Sakon must be established in any way, and if he forbids anything, the Prime Minister cannot oppose the work of the institutions under the obligation to check and carry out the obligations", states Cala.
At the meeting of the Advisory Committee at the House of Deputy, you have spoken about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, which was composed of the legislation on public purchase of both countries.
What's the case?
It's a parallel check that we've already started two years ago.
On the other hand, the fact that the European legislation claims how public purchase should be made, national legislation should be further implemented and then apply to practices.
All the information was gathered and, even when an unlawful verification has been found, the interesting differences - more simplely, legislation may be " accurate and incorrect", but in practice, we will have some parameters of Germany.
It should therefore be focused on the application of its own law in order to create more detailed rules.
And how can this project help you to do what he means for you?
This joint monitoring could contribute to the efforts to determine legislation, reduce and improve limitations, since this does not lead to a positive result.
Economic means receiving relevant things for a reasonable (not always low) price to avoid advertising and, perhaps, criminal behavior.
But it is not the fact that we reach it, decreasing the limitations of orders.
Maybe this system will be completed by the "bogs" so that those who want to find the laxes in this system will find them much easier than if the limitations are not lowed.
You are talking about internal issues of the practical application of public purchase legislation.
How does the monitoring system function in Germany?
Is there an organization such as our CDC (Control-Revisional Office) or does it work otherwise?
With regard to institutions, there is also a colleague that works a little different, but both mainly functions similarly as our CCR.
Furthermore, the authority to a certain scale is similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, there is a auditory unit and a federal land level -- in that system, there are several differences between our systems.
BRH can be managed only by federal money, we have public resources.
The general funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the federal account rooms.
What about local law, there is more than we have?
In fact, I wouldn't like to compare without specific data, but some of the Germans can be taken for the image, but I can't certainly say that it's better in all.
That's that, because they're better controlling them?
Of course not, but I repeat, I don't like such comparisons.
However, it should be said that even sculpture countries are faced with many problems.
In the other case, they would not receive any advantage from cooperation with our office, right?
If you speak of internal law, how did your establishment amendment to the State Procurement Act show effects?
Bearing in mind that the legal force of these amendments is very short, it has not yet proved in our control work.
As we control the facts, we need to take into account some delays.
We take this into account only in the preparation of future checks - we have started using our new "detection of the risk of non-economic risk" through which we have spent about 14000 State contracts, and we have analyzed them, and of course these changes will be shown because the limitations are changed, some standard trends have changed.
How do you think that the approval of this law will benefit or additional burden to the bureaucracy system?
I think that this law, of course, is a step in the right direction, and I hope that it will be confirmed.
The problem that may happen is that the rules are "fair" and they will not be respected.
In the functioning of the previous rules, controlled enterprises are linked to the supplier (e.g., regional operational programmes, with the Regional Council), that any non-compliance with the State purchase law means a violation of the budgetary discipline.
Should the law be in such a way to resolve?
I think it's not like that.
The system should exclude those who want to shut up and abuse, but not punish those who do a formal error that does not affect the decision.
This system will only create more pressure on the bureaucracy.
And how do you get out of this situation?
Let's realize that this way will not bring anywhere.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the GDP would not worry the undertakings of the so-called sharp system.
The "Sworst System" is prohibited or authorized?
The law should be established in any way, and, if it is prohibited, the Prime Minister cannot oppose the work of the bodies to verify and comply with the obligations.
We can say, "We are changing this law and resolving this," but we cannot say that we're going to be done like nothing happens.
The State Procurement Act contains a very strict rules as to which it is to be undertaken, and it is right, which protects public purchase.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic when candidates with the best proposal are disabled only because of formal deficiencies.
The Law will never be perfect, but he must do what, my opinion is not enough.
The roads are sweet, but they're mainly walking.
In some places of Czech Republic, the roads are more slowly and disappointed.
They're mainly going, but somewhere with more care.
Caribbean
Tonight, the roads were passed in the Caribbean area, but some of them were sweet and disappointed.
Temperatural slowed from five to ten degrees below zero, but the temperature must be heat during the day.
The sunfall in the region has stopped only in the bottoms.
However, there are about 30 centimeters of snow on the Road Mountains.
From the information received from the areas of road workers, it was known that places were less visibility because of the tsunami.
The R6-Shoes and the roads of the first class in the region are now unlimited.
However, attentiveness is needed, for example, on the bridges where the surface can be slightly and skilled.
Moreover, all roads relating to the second and third class, including mountain traces, are passed.
But on some of them, there are still remains of the remains of the swimming and the places of the swimming snow.
Specially careful is to be on higher roads.
Paradubic and Crowley Graduate
Czech's road and car managers on their websites are informed that some roads in Eastern Czechy are threatening Holocaust, and on mountain roads and roads situated on higher levels may be a dangerous snow snake.
Railway workers warn the golf drivers, which can be particularly trained at the Paradubic land heights.
Holocaust may be around the Lanskrowun, West-Nad-Orlici, Policky, Svizzera or Highk Mito, particularly on the roads of the second and third class.
Rounds I/43 and I/34 situated in Sweden are processed by chemicals.
The snow is especially on the streets of the Cronous and Orchisk mountains.
The swimming snake is on the roads located on higher levels in the Rinou-Knutnow and Trutnow regions.
Today, in the East Czechy, there is a change in the area without shipping.
Temperature usually varies in the limits of mines three to a degree of Cellshia, a light wind.
Persian area
The roads in the Persian area are passing this morning, but the places need to be careful and attracted to the weather.
The temperature is covered by three to nine degrees below zero.
After the sunset and the after-seven in some places, it may be sweet.
Drivers can be covered with the skin, but the visibility will be slowly improved.
Information has provided areas of road work.
The D5 chase is now practically without limitations, but it recommends that road management be careful between 80 and 131 km.
The majority of the roads of the first class has a soft and measuring surface.
In the south of Pulney and Tahove, there can be shocked parts.
The roads of the second and third class are authorized and, in this case, warnings are also in relation to the possibility of the event of squadling.
Vedies should be careful, especially on poor roads in the school area.
Olymouth
The bottles in the Olymouth area have to be taken into account today's sweet cows on the road.
It remained after the use of chemicals in the Black Sea and on the road to the direction of the Videl Sea.
The night in the snowfall was swimming out on the street of road workers, according to the information from the road management, in Shumperk was shocked about three centimeters of snow.
In other areas, roads are normally unlimited.
"But the highlights of Shumperka are the rest of the snow.
The CAN (Chash News Agency) manager of the Shumperk Management should be able to take place in the Red Seed.
Tonight, the roads were sent and their colleagues from Ecenica, they believed that the roads on higher levels after the processing of chemicals remained black and mocks.
The roads in Olomous are walking without limitations, but the drivers must be careful in the forest areas where the power still remains.
Structure, Liberia
Tonight, road works from North Bohemiah have been reported that a few difficult places have remained.
According to the police database, more than a few places with Holocaust or sneeper, a mountain road is closed from the Telnik in the Clinic in the Uceland.
The temperature also remains negative in lows, so it remains snow and lady on the road, and in minority, especially to the south-east of the Czech Mediterranean, against no problem, the roads are mainly swimming.
We have not been reported about the complications on the road.
Travel workers report on the appearance of golf in Stetie's neighborhood.
According to meteorologists, for his education, perfect conditions were established - the whole day the rain went and rained, the night was cleared and began to swim.
It is reported about the unpleasant conditions on the main shoes and trace I/13 on the border of the Ocean and Liberian area.
Because of the snake of wood woods with respect to the path, the road was closed in Telnik at the Book.
Shin Ornest: We want to cope positive energy at the concerts
What do you think that less than a month later the end of the light should come?
It's just one of the many worried news that we, people, are so easy to happen.
Instead, with the Tap Tap Group, we continue to urge this topic and say that we are the only world group that can collect enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the light.
Furthermore, in December, you will make a totally unique three concerts against the end of the light.
Could you tell the readers more about it?
It is about the national collection of resources that we have already planned for for two years.
We decided to use the marketing capacity belonging to the May calendar, which was declared on the end of December 21, on 11 December.
For the day before that event, the 20th December at 21:00 is parallelly launched three concerts in Prague, Bruno and Austral.
They end up, unfortunately, at the time when Kiribati Island in the Pacific Ocean, a time-by-cale that will be completed at 12 hours before we have.
Who did this idea come into the head?
This was my idea, and we were all thinking together with our artist of Hong Kong.
Besides we want to cope sufficiently positive energy and prevent the end of the light, we also want to think about the situation of this world once we transfer to our children.
In the case of the Middle Calendar, we have created a unique collection of objects from shoes, footballs, tubes and original keys against the end of the light, which can be purchased on the website www.e-tap.cz and thus provide support to us.
The Tap Tap Group, together with other musicians, also performed a giant against the end of the light, called "The King of Light"
Does YouTube's loved listeners have a gymn on these banal concerts?
Of course, in the end, if everything will end up and the end of the light will not come.
He's assigned to all executions at all gates at the same time.
The chineses are also invoked in the direct edition of the Chesk TV at the same time.
Words to this song wrote and played Jesus' role in the clip of Tomas Ghanak, also participating in Xindl X...
How did you start to cooperate with them?
We are also cooperating with other individuals of the Czech cultural life, since we are conducting a lot of well-being events and concerts.
We are trying to connect them actively to these projects.
Many loved to work with us, they were interesting.
What will the end of the light come from the concert?
In order to purchase a equipment for an unlimited STUDO educational centre, we have been working so with the civilian association of Tap to the Edleki Institute.
The publishers regularly visit students from the Edleki Institute and have joyful and interesting events with them.
The students have no means to be sent to the employees, and we are trying to give them this opportunity so.
In the context of the project of the Additional Institute, there will be a building in the future in which we will move with this project.
A number of musical groups and artists will be held on each concert.
What were the choice criteria?
We have tried to make a programme that is interested in all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Lesbian support, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marien Bango and Irraje Suki.
You can see all the details at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any kind of "participation" in the future?
In May, we will first speak to the "Plural spring" festival and, of course, prepare a interesting programme with interesting guests.
In the next year, we would welcome the presentation of a Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we are in the United States, would like to speak to Washington and Chicago.
You have severe plans, and you've already spoken in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap Group is a group of people with limited opportunities.
How do you go on the road from the view of organization and logistics?
It's not so scary that looks like the first view.
We have five electric disabled shoes, their skins have to be traveled to the bathroom, and there is a large number of shoes and shoes with instruments.
However, the Chechén airlines and the British Airways have always been overwhelming for us as a lot of surprises.
Even in Moscow, where we returned recently, everything happened without problems.
You can compare different countries with accessibility, public relations with disabilities and so further.
From what have you been at the present moment?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries, where everyone works better than we have, we became witnesses in Russia that still remains at the base level.
A lot of barriers compared to Prago in Moscow, and there is still a single movement of humans to an electrical disabled cluster in the centre of the city.
There's no bad things in the way to get disabled in the lift.
Happily, and there are public organizations that are trying to focus people on the problems of people with limited opportunities.
What, on the contrary, should we continue to prepare the previous countries?
There are very many things, which are the levels of execution that are far behind.
However, it is important to clarify that improvement and improvement of the situation are always dependent on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is normal that people who have a hard form of disabilities move themselves on the streets can go to the toilet, to the museum where they want to...
The Tap Tap and the Tap Tap are not very wise that a large number of people with limited opportunities have been actively participating in public life.
The respect of publicity or unlimitedness is one thing, but at the time we have known sports, artists, actors, policies, or lawyers, it will actually begin to change.
Even if these are the unique cases, people with strong will.
The Tap Tap Group is currently very popular, but should we return to two years ago that you had put it to organize it in 1998?
I did the Edlean Institute as a teacher, and there were many young people around me who wanted to take something.
And because I am a musical and player, including at the socket, I organized a interesting music circle together with my colleague.
Well, with the time, as our leader Lady Angelovic says, it's just a little out of control.
The popularity has come over the past few years, or I'm going to travel?
That is true, we have been able to join the famous snares and actively work on the propaganda group.
We concluded that the work that no one could evaluate is like no one.
Thanks to the European Union, we can allow qualified suppliers, equipment and so further.
Did the Tap Tap stand before you so well?
Since the beginning, I felt their ability to make something unsubscribed.
In the show-binding, it's a whole thing that reflects one another.
This is logically, it's all new to be careful, and it's long.
There's a little rare things, but I'm going to say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a man who's seeing us, of course, pity is naturally...
But this painfulness is perfectly bad because people with limited opportunities are not any of the painful and all we have to regret.
They are people who can live in full value and, of course, developing only in the condition that they have the necessary resources.
I say, if people with disabilities get something, it's not only for them but also for the whole society.
Have you made sure that you are a strict leader, how many of you think?
If we want to do a quality work, we must be in many cases uncommunity and maintain a certain discipline.
But I think it's okay.
Some people come to us with romantic presentation and flights in areas, and when they know that two times a week, they have to go to the recycling, visit preparatory courses and carry out a lot of time on the road, they are very quickly losing enthusiasm.
But this happens in any group that wants to work and reach something.
Currently, the Tap Tap Tap group is twenty.
How many have they been started in 1998?
Only one lady Angelovic.
We're a open group, people come and get out, that's impossible to prevent.
For those who have desires and powers of will, our doors are always open.
It will be held on the day before the end of the light, on Friday 20.12.2012, at 21.00 p.m.
The Concept will take place in Prague at the Incheba Stadium, in Brone, in the Fleda Club and Osstrave, in the centre of Plynojem, with the 12th group and other Czech musicians.
At the end of the gate, all three cities are connected to the smile at the time of the sing of the Tap Tap Tap Group "The King of Light is cancelled".
The purpose of this project is to collect financial resources of 25 million channels for the purchase of multi-functional non-functional equipment for the SтуDEO educational centre at the Edlean Institute in Prague.
The ticket is 400 krones for children to 12 years of age, and the tickets can be purchased in Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
The last week, at the ministers of the European Space Agency, the 20th European Space Agency was adopted as a second country from the former Eastern Bank (after Checa, which became a full member of the ECA 12 September 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with the ECA in 1994 and actively participated in a number of agencies projects during the following years.
But the way to the space of Poland began a long time ago.
Another time before the Second World War, the Polish enthusiastes were in space, but it was not always understood.
I remember, for example, of the A. Sternfeld lessons represented in the Varshaw Astronomy Observatory of the ideas of its innovative "Introduction in Space".
The ideas of young engineer (1905 G.r.) have left the audition of equal air, after a few years, Starnfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadmski was interested in his work.
In 1934, France Sternfeld wins the prize Robert Esno-Peltri and Andre Louis Hirsch for the "Introduction in Space".
Dr. Yan Gadmoux (1899 - 1966), speaking above, later became the great propaganda of astronomy and space.
He published hundreds of articles in the Polish magazines and wrote a number of books dedicated to these scientific disciplines.
The Gadham became a known world propagandist of space and its contribution was assessed, including that one of the rotors on the back of the Lune was called in his honor.
In 1925, it has been built in Poland with a swimming trail driver.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown as well as the details of the project.
Not clearly, even for the distortion or for the driving of the telephone, a missile should have been used.
Information on this line is known only from the press of that era.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery began to think about missile shoes.
A study was implemented by the Arms Technology Section in cooperation with Professionals Mechidolaw Wolfk and Gustavo Moguizk.
Reserved materials show that studies have been reached to the stage of practical tests.
However, with the arrival of the German army, they were interrupted.
In 1937, the idea of a photo-detector-auditor's photo-auditor switch proposed an engineer Rhozinski, and in the next year, Levely-Killbowl-Aviation Racket and Aviation Rakette.
Both projects have been developed for military use of missile engines.
Before the war, the Interim Scientific and Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Committeet Doradczo-Naukowy), coordinated the whole work.
The Committee was established in 1937, but two years after its work was completed since the beginning of the war.
The next scientific work, dedicated to space, appeared in the Poland press after war, thanks to the work of the Polish Astronaut Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first part of the society is mentioned in the November 1954 magazine of the Problemes, which is published by four astronomic articles.
One of them suggested that the society would be organized by space.
At that time, projects of artistic satellites have already been traced, and it was clear that space studies were a prospective area.
Since 1956, the Polish Astronaut Society (POA) has tried to enter the international astronomic Federation (based in 1951) and the POA was already an effective member.
And in the next year, the first Chairman of the POA, Kazimej Zarankevid (1902 - 1959) became Vice-President of the International astronomic Federation.
He left his death in 1959.
Since 1956, POA has contributed to the development of a very successful meteorological rat of RM (Rakieta Meteorologicalczna), which has become the first Poland Raket, which has performed a scientific study.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first start was 10 October 1958.
The racket, which was able to overcome the distance of 1800 meters, was about 80 cm, and its weight was less than 5 km.
The RM-1A version was then improved, and in 1959, 12-year-old RM-2 was tested.
The missile was about 1,4 meters long, and its weight was about 11,5 km.
The next version of the missile had already been able to perform this scientific work, the RM-34 missile could exceed 14.5 km, and its task was monitoring the high wind.
But in 1962, further development was suspended.
The primitive RM type was the Meteor-1 missile developed between 1962 and 1965.
The raket was considered as a twenty-five, its total length of 510 cm, and the initial weight was 32.5 km.
Three types (named Meteor-1A, -1V and -1C), which were different from the size of the scientist equipment.
The raket meteor-1A was 0.4 l, Meteor-1V to 0.34 l, and meteor-1C to 0.62 l.
The maximum length of the flight in all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1965, the Abiation Institute has developed the development of the Meteor-2 missiles, and its first annual tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 raket was able to make a useful load of 10 km (60 km) higher.
The versions of Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 were then built.
It should also mention the entry into the CCSPAR (Spacial Research Committee) in 1960 and the establishment of the National Committee of the CCSPAR for two years later.
Furthermore, in the Interscopes programme, Poland participated in the research of the space at the Soviet Art Satellites, and in 1978, the Poland pilot Miroslav Hermashevsky became a second interscope after the Wormira Remecca.
The cancellation of the public work law is not a problem.
Last week, the Constitutional Court abolished the law of public work.
The establishment was called for a substantive discussion in the society.
Indeed, it will be interested in considering this problem with a broader view.
Liberal and orientated economic systems in the EU, as well as globalized world, are based on the principle of multilateral, non-regulated economic competition.
In fact, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are constantly conflicted.
This is related to the principle of free trade and free, and there is no limited private capital movement along with unreasoned financial sphere.
As a result of a significant difference in the value of the workforce (employed payment), price pressures have occurred.
In this sense, it is necessary to understand the situation when the manufacturer is trying to exert the economic competitiveness of the competitive value in order to take himself a large part of the market and thus increase its own income.
This means for most employees, or the transfer of routines, or the low purchase for routine or disappearance, and results in increased unemployment in countries where the value of the workforce is higher than other and high.
As the private capital does not have a social responsibility, including for their unemployment, it increases the unevitable costs of States to social needs.
In general, the situation increases the desire of the employees to pay taxes and thus compensate the public economic and social damage that they have income.
The situation is so well known that specific statistics should not be brought.
The private capital methods are set up at the economic level of individual states when the Governments are forced to enter competitiveness with one another in order to decrease the social level of their population in order to join the foreign capital country.
In other words, Governments give up their own population to private capital, despite social accidents.
This reflects mostly the changes in the legislation.
The economic goal is to put their people undertaken the dictatate of private capital, especially in the field of payment.
This works as an economic obligation system in the long-term unemployment and also serves as a tool to resolve the rights of workers in the field of labour law.
As a result, poverty is increased and the difference between the poor and the rich.
A few years ago, there is a public division of poor products that could not be able to make up their own work.
The number of those people are already near to a million.
In enhancing the competitiveness of the German economy, cases are constantly occurd when employees receive such payment that the State should pay for a minimum of sustainability.
This scandal became known to publicity and in the case of additional workers of Bundestaga.
Economic measures in all the Southern States of the EU, indefinitely, have the same state in which people under pressure of the catastrophic social status have been required to emigrate, such as in the 19th century, or to exist in a distortion payment for society in hope that a private investment capital will ever come in the country.
But it's wondering where he is taking?
If the capital comes from other EU countries, the poverty to move from one country to another, or it will not be, as Chinese, India, Brazilians, Turo, Egyptians, and Africans are still working for the part of the European salary payment.
This concerns the whole Latin America.
The Liberal Information Theory and the Measuring Measures claim that the State cannot participate in the capital of its own property that the management of the economy leads to economic disaster.
The private capital urges that the State should not be dominated in the economy.
Should a further response to the question whether the private capital is not operating, now practically managing policies and the State itself, in its own egoistic purposes?
A unique answer is yes.
The proof is the existence of almost powerful and enormous lobbys in all States.
As a result, we have an unexpected situation in corruption and mutual benefits in legislation where almost all punishment is a crime, but it is not a crime.
The GFF is the situation that public ministries are able to develop law projects of private legal undertakings, which are substantially related to industry.
Then, these legislative projects support Bundastag.
The entire authority is not from the people, as the Constitution of Western Type calls, but from the financial and potential groups that prefer their own interests.
Obviously, Liberal-Oriented Democracy is now quick in the situation, as the African describes in the "Crise of the Roman Empire in the days of César and Pompei," "the Government has already disappeared, and the states are being engaged by violence.
Welcome, unlawful gain of mercy with stones and swords.
The reliance and corruption continued without any bans, and the people went to the elections of the previously produced voice "... ordered persons had not yet been shocked to the government post, at the end of the end of the eight months, a State remained without console.". " Everything people began to say that the only salvation in this terrible situation was self-deserved and the need for the choice of an energetic man " .. Apisan thinks that this would be the Pompet, but they became Cezarea that finally changed the democracy to self-defence.
Like in ancient times, the modern society has its own unfair interests without taking into account public interests.
The private capital is no longer intended for public purposes.
The present result is not different from the past: an unexpected incident of elite without any effort to reform more deeply.
This means the cause of the phasist and communist regimes, we must search for an unfair liberalization of the 19 and 20th-century economic systems.
Today, the absence of these regimes and the existence of liberal democracy can be taken as a certain pass, after which the next tour is expected.
Previously, the present Elite fully ignores the consequences of hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, humanitarian and social disasters that we have already observed, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.
The cancellation of the public works law is not a decision or at least forever.
Under the pressure of competitive and international and European competitiveness, the Government of the Czech Republic will continue to search for a further reduction in the social population.
This trend is therefore a systemic nature.
The decisions are the objectives of political and social reforms that will enhance the economic participation of States, increase the role of the citizens in the government of the State and reduce the monopolitical situation of private capital in society for State.
Israel: Haos Lab.
"The violence does not go, and we can't ever leave," - Sting, the "Cruchy" song, where the main scripts are words, "we can't forget what we're crazy."
"If my sons don't want to war, they wouldn't have been."
The last concern between Israel and the Gaza sector has always argued many of the calls.
Some speak for Israel, arguing his position of self-defence, and Palestinians play in the role of terrorists, others support Palestinians, arguing that racism by the Israeli State, the genocide made over Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel is the role of the terrorism State.
I don't want to think about whom in these periodically repeated murders is a criminal, but whose victim, at the end of the time, was born at the time of the current political situation and had not been witnesses of violence.
My goal is to propose readers to look at whom, first of all, serves tension for 95 years (lettered from signing the Balfu Declaration in November 1917) in a small part of the Middle East.
Some of my opinions are supported by historic facts, some of them are based on my own understanding of whom or what group of people are the main engine of events of modern history.
Humanity history is mostly the history of war against power.
We can find the same Alexandre of the Great or Napoleon in each era.
What isn't so clear - whether these people have always taken their steps in full, or was a person who has sent them to the most pre-marked goals.
It should be permitted that we live in the period when the world's riches are concentrated in the hands of several people, and that this concentration of money and prominent authority could not occur for the life of one generation.
Among the astronomically rich families, one who could consider the head of a strot (I don't know if someone is over them, but it is not excluded) is Rothild.
It's not a lot about them.
Sure.
The First News Agency (Rathers) has already purchased in the 19th century to stop listening to their name with criminal action in the darkness of which they had been, and who have always enhanced their authority, the multiplication of riches or the same time and the other.
They have large action packages in almost all central world banks, and against countries whose central banks do not pay their shares, they lead or prepare war (only seven countries were in Afghan, after the invasion in Iraq, the Russian government had remained only four, but at the same time has taken the central bank in its own hands).
Everyone who tried to oppose this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to maintain the status of the Central Bank for the Rothildow Bank of America, and during civil war, he began to launch his own money (including government) and was killed in the theatre in 1865.
John F. Kennedy began to evacuate his own money and wanted to abolish the FED (FED Federal Reserve System) was killed in 1963.
Their desires of the world power in the period 1859-1871 had been made to the development of a plan of three world wars created by the Great Massone of the 33th century.
The first war was the destruction of monarchy States in Europe, the second was to destroy the colonial rule, especially the United Kingdom, and the third should lead to the reduction of the world population nearly 0.5-1 billion. (The number of slaves will be enough to ensure their comfort and growth, and they will not need many resources), the establishment of a unique universal religion (exomenism can not be any other than the preference for such project) and the final protection of absolute power.
The method that works with the group of the most rich families in the head of Rothshilds is the calls of the crisis and the follow-up of decisions (order ab chao order from the chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to the deterioration of the situation (see the foundation of the EDF, which should prevent the recurrence of the crisis in 1907).
Thus, after they were able to defeat the First World War through the murder of the astro-venger throne of Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the king Russia, starting a majorist revolution.
The first world war ended an unfair, injustified in military and economic capital against Germany (which was no need for wars to destroy the Kingdom Russia) and, as a result, the development of the Central and European State, Austria and Hungary.
In order to facilitate the development of the Second World War, the banker and the policies have established a hidden conflict situation in Germany a great military reparation that had made a preference for the radicalization of the dinner mass, then only to strike the Germans a sufficiently strong, tangible and proposed simple solutions, and also to establish a multinational Czech Republic with a strong German minority that had to play, and to truly swallow the five columns with the shooting of war.
At the end of the 19th century, Rotshilda has proclaimed the foundation of the sionist movement, one of which had tried to create a Jewish State, desirablely in the historical area of Judah with Jerusalem as his capital (returning to Zion).
The above Declaration of Balfu created a proposal for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, which began to be the first association with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks were both out of the side.
The Second World War, difficult to assess whether Hitler had been out of the chairs where he was fully maintained by bankers, or everything he did, was planned, in any case the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps had made proposals for recognition of the Jewish world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, as Germany had been promulgated by military repairs at the 2nd World War, Israel ' s State was proclaimed to create a third war.
If international bankers have been able to interconnect it, the Jewish people, as in the second world war, will be victims of warfare on the front, now together with the Arab or, simply, the Islamic population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a guiant lab, a source of divorce and haos, not only within the country, but also at the international level (only a close separation of people on parties and opposers of Israel).
Who's guilty, and who is the victim of the Palestinian-Israel conflict, where both deeds a dinner in an unconciliable cemetery of violence, if everything started with the desire of individuals and their efforts toward the world's power?
There is a need to distinguish the common people of Israel from their leaders, since, as we have, international bankers will join people to vote on the elections of only their candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, Nyanjahu, the neighbourhood, is a typical example of the political, loyal international bankers who do everything to start a war with Iran, which, through the membership of Iran in the Shanchai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...) will threaten to translating into a world conflict and taking into account the control of Iran on the Ormosan oil, containing 20 per cent of all global oil stocks (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, ...), also leads to the destruction of the world economy.
In the light of what is now shown by David Rockfeller in 1994: "We need to be a general crisis, and people will take a new world order."
The new world order in their presentation is the peace of masters and slaves.
The world where the remaining part of human population is a huge financial aristocracy that enjoys a comfort.
The world where each born body implantizes the chip to which it becomes substantially controlled.
"And puts all the small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves to the right hand or to the leg of clamp, so that the man who is not marked by the name of the beast or the number of his name could not purchase nor sell.
This is what the wisdom is: Each who has a mind may calculate the number of beasts.
Because it corresponds to the human name, and that number is sixty-6.
Argo Operation: When there is nothing worse, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, the Islamic Demonstrators trooped the United States community in Teheran and took 52 diplomates.
They should be released in exchange of the discharge of Mohammad Res Resus Pehelai, flying after the revolution in the United States, which were the director of his regime for decades.
The United States Administration did not have a positive outcome - it could not allow himself to evacuate the ships, because that could cause the confidence in other countries.
However, to reach the release of delegates in Iran where the revolution has brought to establish a theocratic regime, it was not able.
It was a shock of the United States, which later has been strengthened by an unsuccessful attempt to free the forces.
Closed diplomates were finally released after 444 days after negotiations by the Algerian Government.
Their judges called the house of solidarity and anti-Iran.
The opinion in Iran was significantly encouraged by Jimmy Carter's infringement to the presidential elections of the 1980 ' s election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, actor Ben Affel Operation, describes one of the episodes of the history that brings America to small wins.
Shortly before the occupation, six employees were able to escape.
After the complicated peripherences, they ended their way to the Resistance of the Office of Canada.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, could take them from Iran and helped the extravagant clamp legend to which they went to Canada's pass as members of the common group in the country for the swimming era.
Combination of genders
The plan, designed by Tony Mendez Evacuation expert, required cooperation in Hollywood.
To ensure that the legend was reliable, the film project was written in the specialized magazines, and the press conference was affected, the industrial company had a real office.
The details of the operations have been held in secret, films, based on the memories of Tony Mendes.
Aphlec's film is a special combination of several gentlemen.
From one part, a real political trillion named "film-kinopous", the history of a lucky destiny, the face may be a number of films on the Owshan friends.
The film is constantly changed - from one part, documentally designed scenes from Teheran (in weeks the historic pictures of events were shown and the same situation has been shown in the film - great differences).
On the other hand, the facilitated Hollywood retreats switched with irony and the dead overflow.
And then, scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in the cost are discussing the situation in the negotiations tables, on the boards, on the phone...
Ben Africa was able to make a carriage restaurant.
From the exemplary actor became a respectful register, and his game stopped to be an object of smiling.
"Argo" Operation is a third complete film, after the dark detection of "Shees, babys, forgiveness" (2007) and "Good" trills (2010).
At the same time, this is the first film of Aphlek, which does not take place in the town of the resident of Boston.
The atmosphere of the place is about qualitys that have increased the early film of the Hollywood standard.
And Aphlex shows this in Argo where Teheran plays Canada.
The best scenes in the film are on the streets, when real events are reconstrued, the income scenes of the U.S. are impressed by their clearness, which also transmits the emotions of travel and inevitableness that happen when the history is soon changed.
It seems to be the effect of Aphlex and his colleagues reach in the scenes of the plants (specific headquarters on the Teheran base).
There are too many processes in too many places.
The register had to have a case with the fact that the notification was not a majority of the cinematographic value scenes.
He works very successfully with that little, sometimes thinking something -- it is not so elegant (the scene in which the phone call in America prevents the driving crisis in Teheran Airport, and the flight at the aircraft field seems quite sweet).
Argo's inadequacy is the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Gudman are really very grateful in the role of the Hollywood colleagues, but their personals would benefit from more space, and they were not the only ones in the film.
Aphlek's film is not enough for a little dramatic, which is a film that can be considered with the dead interest by assessing the decree and the retro-style of seventy-first trills.
But it's sweet with work.
However, this is enough to remind one, still known in the sense of living history, as well as proof of the presentation of all powerful and well-known specialists.
Rules of advertising aircraft, bananas and circles
www.bankovnipoplatky.com, a yearly investigation on the most absurd banking collections, now decided to announce the competitor on "the same absorption or project from the EU master."
"We have met to this last event, in which the EU plans to take 40 per cent cube for women in the administration of large European companies", said the questionnaire Patrick Nager.
The recent decision of the European Court on the combination of the insurance rates for men and women is among the abuses already issued.
Women have still had money for life insurance, because they are Objectively less compromising risks for insurance companies.
"Another incredible ideas from the master EU may move to competition until the end of this year.
The vote will take place until the end of February 2013," said Nager.
The EU is, for example, with a binding addiction of biopounds, which results in harmony by nature, and also prohibited the use of reliable tort grades only because they contain relatively small number of dangerous substances, or the largest directive for smoke cells, which resulted in significant traveling of eggs in this year.
The actual ban on the use of the term "bottle oil" or out of the sale of classic lamps.
Quality bananas must be 14 centimeters long.
The Common European device often decides on the pressure of a trade or industrial lobby which is generally protected by one State or group of States (for example, Czech even now remains under the threat of the winds of its banks).
Lobby interests were such: For example, the bananas of high quality in Europe had to reach the length of 14 cm and not the pleasant to express “annual Crisis”.
The European Commission had thus justified that only harmonization of existing discreet national rules that have complicated trade.
The EU, despite the resistance of some States, raised standards regarding fruit and vegetables, referring to that existing directives would lead to the planting of products.
The applicant can also become the last year ' s decision of the EU, according to which the sales of aircraft must be warned that the children of eight years older may not be able to overcome them without engaged in adults.
The EU requested American research, in accordance with which aircrafts at play were potentially caused to death of children through a pain.
Such limitations are now distributed to children by 14 years of age, which are prohibited to enter into junctions.
Nice ideas are born and home
It is sufficiently absurd that the rules concerning the most European officials: everyone who has any official position in the EU may not, given the specificity of the topic for Greece, use the name of Macedonia and should be said instead of "BURM " (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
Bankovnipoplatky.com, in collaboration with the association of Liberal Economicists (Laissez Faire), proposed to vote, in addition to a number of above absorptions regulations, for example, the EU Rule on the amount of food stocks in the territory of the Member State.
The EU has set up the maximum quantity of food stocks that may be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its entry into Europe.
In addition, Czech exceeded, for example, the quantities set for conservated balls, for which it threatened.
The questionnaire organizations also interested and ideas to pay some countries because they had no sea and the idea of providing subsidies to a claim for granting subsidies.
But these ideas occurred in Prague, not in Brussels.
"We're in an unexpected situation because we don't have a sea.
As requested by the European Union for Compensation, the Minister of Agricultural Affairs of Yaroslav Pallas (CPC) declared on August 2004.
He stated that the country had a high grain of seed and, as a result of such interventional purchases, the State had full stocks to be delivered.
Because Czechia is far from the ports, the EU, according to Pallas, must have been paid to us hundreds of millions of euros.
Finally, the European Commission came to the meeting of the Czech Republic, organizing a tender to purchase a grain from countries that have not been out of the sea.
Subsidies suggested to the villages of the Ministry of Regional Development, the Director of Minister Paul Germany (US-DEU), in particular such subsidies, should be made a statement from Brussels.
EU: Incredible allocations are excluded
Although decisions in the Member States are easily critical, the EU ' s management efforts as well as the more effective functionality and development of Europe, in view of many experts, will be a better recognition.
A serious problem, in the view of experts, is the clarification of the EU ' s allocations to projects that have not even noted a common note of Europe ' s integration but which Member States have been achieved at the budget debate.
The emotions between Chechs and that, as well as in other countries of the European Union, the Czech Republic should fight in Brussels for the right to specifically identify its traditional products, which is not always winning in this convergence.
While Chachs after six years of struggle with Germans and Austrians have maintained the name "Olomous shoes", but "Turkey Rom" tradition that in our country were roots in the 19th century, our manufacturers had to be renamed to Turk.
The name of the Roman can only be products from the twin distillate, not of the sahar sweat.
In the official list of EU registered products, along with the worldwidely known "feta" and "Gorgonzole", a marcipan from German Lakeka or Parmain winter, there have already been, for example, carloval sugars, sweat and sweet bones.
The EU’s commercial channel can also be proud of a swimming pearl and a swimming snack.
People want me to care for the Republic, but I'm loved, it's Ocamura.
Mr. Senator, how's the man coming to ball the president?
I don't think to be a senator or a President.
If we had all worked in the country, I wouldn't be balled anywhere.
But I can't see how in the past 20 years the country is developed, as there are volunteers, people increase taxes and pension age.
I didn't have an ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I'm trying to find a decision how to change it.
And since I have already been completed for forty years and I am an independent person that does not belong to any party, I have no other possibility to affect things except to be balloted by the senator or the President.
You got to Senate, but soon they're sent to the presidential store.
Are you not so angry to those whom you have chosen?
I always said that I am involved in the fight against the Presidential Charter, depending on the results of the elections in Senate.
Afterwards, I stated that if I was elected by Senator, I'll be balled in the Presidents.
My goal is not position, it is a tool that I can do my views.
I therefore need the most influential and widely powerfulness.
But the difficulty is not only that we're as a nation in the bar or on the television, but we're ready to shoot everyone who trys to change.
It is added to people's media and who are free of words with lie.
For instance, I have said that I'm giving the journalists to, or that I am the adviser of Irgie Paraboutica.
Let's go to your views.
Combating the Presidential Charter, you have started with the thesiss on material and criminal responsibility of politicians and on treaty property statements over twenty-five million.
In order to implement this, the law must be amended.
You have no authority as President, and the whole senate may propose laws.
How do you want to solve this task?
When I was a citizen, to make an excursion free business, that could be extended.
The problem is in policy - when someone comes with a good proposal to the left or right, it is wisely hindered, and it holds citizens.
As an independent person, I have a greatest capacity to receive support from all Parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I have no partial partial planning, without dogmatic consideration, I can take every party the best for our country and apply it.
Do you think you are a person more related to the right or the left?
I think with a chess-based view that my people are pretty closer to the left.
It's not important for me - a little left or a little right.
For me, it's important that we go forward.
It's not what someone's about the right, but someone to the left, I want to join people.
I will always support any good decision for the society, whether it will propose the CFD or the GDP, and I will also be against a bad idea.
You're angry when someone tells you're pushing.
But do you not prove that what you said?
When you create business plans for the company, you also have some perfect goals and views.
And you're trying to get closer.
It can be called a polumism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already functioning in the world, or you're talking about the visible experts.
But without the support of the Parliament, you'll only have a lozing.
And that's what you'll do. You're not gonna keep it long.
Or do you think that when you go to people and talk to them, you will be able to implement criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have any other possibility.
Only avoiding politicians, journalists and publicity, and trying to move them to get our own side.
If I had been elected by the President, it would not be a problem to organize a direct television transmission in which I wish to the Chairman of the parliamentary Party, with a call to legalize material and criminal responsibility for government officials, judges and prosecutors.
And they should, in the case of refusal, report why they do not want it.
If it is a strong person who feels abused, it is possible to make pressure on a political scene.
Take the direct elections of the President was the duty of pressure from the public.
I'm right to say I'm loved, not genius and intellectual.
I'm trying to find unions to resolve my confidence and views.
I'm just the starting policy, and I'm trying to get support for my program.
I'm trying to move myself; if that is not possible, I'll end six years later and return to the private sector.
This feels like Ocamura must save Checa.
I'm no salvator.
I know that one I'm not gonna do anything, so I got a few known people with a proposal to ball the Senate.
I went to Raim Yancher, and he rejected a lot of work.
I also, at least, supported the leading investigation of Yan Laurenzlov’s journalist, who has discovered a fracture with light fuel oil products.
I've shown my candidate because people are really not satisfied, but now I feel on the weight.
Sixty per cent of people did not go to the election, but most of those who were elected by the literature.
Our independents in Senate are only two.
People chose Senate to make changes to work.
Despite that, I will fight for my views, for example, for the direct elections of ladies and gouvernants.
Do you think about the basis of your own party?
I didn't think about that, because I don't have time to check the cleanness of the past, and I don't have this money.
No money and the presidential campaign, just twenty thousand chrones in my transaction.
You don't have money?
You talk about the property declarations, and how will your own case be able to do so?
Personal property is estimated in about 60 million.
I have some 25 million in Prague, a apartment for 10 million, another apartment for 8 million, a collection of arts for about 10 million, Aston Marine for 3,5 million, and Scoda Superb for million, and more than a few million.
Even though Aston-Martin came to me, because it was my boyfriend dream, I always liked Jaymes Bond, who moved on the car, was galant with women, and at the same time fighting against submissions and illicitness.
You're traveling to Aston-Martin, possessing 60 million ownership and you don't have money for a campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but your money are specially not income.
It's not very convinced.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I get in the debt?
I've already put 2,5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have a sponsor is that my program's not so interesting.
And I don't have to pay for a predicted campaign from my carman.
The expenditure to the campaign will actually cover the senator payment.
But I wouldn't have lived for these money, for example, couldn't pay a son for an English school that is 300,000 monthly.
If I just wanted to pay money, there wouldn't be any ball.
So, will you continue to work in order to live?
Didn't you tell me that you would reduce this activity?
But this does not depend on the payment size.
As I promised, I was decreased in part.
For example, the director of the Tourist Agency will be my Vice-President.
People would like to want me to be an unarmed man who will save the Republic.
But I also need to live in something.
How much, as an entrepreneur, have you been able to receive monthly?
From twenty to four hundred thousand, I'm getting further.
And if I'd be a president, my business would end up.
You will find a full interview in the Saturday Sunday.
The MVRDV architectes prove that this appendix is not only in the image, for example, by the Spain and its recently built Book Mountain - 2 photos
"I think this building seems joyful, it looks faculty, finally we can see something interesting again," says Lizate Verchag, walking on the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an ICT specialist nearby a large company, believes, "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I ask myself, why do we have another library today?
All have Internet, iPad and electronic books.
Nobody is now voluntary to such old libraries, right?
Speekenniss, a few remarkable bedrooms under Rotterdam, belongs to an unnecessary recursion.
His population of 80,000 people is the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
A few years ago, for the fight against the situation, it was decided to contribute to the general education and to build seven industrial bridges pictured on the euro banknotes, as well as a helibyte miniature.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the fathers of the city found that they had the only opportunity to get the statistics: to build the library here!
The MVRDV Architective Office of Mauterdam, the master of sweet table diagrams and the author of strokes, sometimes even cynical buildings, has taken the task of its ordinary non-proliferation and appeared in competitive hearing in 2003 with five books under the mouse and shock.
And while the jury members were carefully watched and smiled by shoes, the sweeper Maas put out of its original pyramid gift of the size and ended the talk in protecting his project as follows: “Honoured horrors!”
This is my proposal, "The Big Mountain" in Spain, so called Buckenberg!
Over nine years, this mountain has grown 30 million euros.
It is part of the auditing project, which includes sub-term gate, supermarket, email, and several reliable housing houses and tankhouses in the total complexity of 50 apartment.
At the beginning of November, the Kingdom Mountain was noted the second competitive prize of the Netherlands's 2012 Library.
The project also participates in the National Holland Concurrent in 2012.
Thus, the unprecedented reward that was not previously proposed, except the postmodernist peak zone and a surprising white ratch, which is the view of the milk-based milk, became richer for a modern architecture.
But the mainst in Spain was the first in the history of the city's public building of cultural appointment.
A long way towards the book
First impression: Eldorado's book under a snake.
There is only one lift in the center of the mountain mass, since the true architecture and readers prefer to investigate this place in the pest.
The skilled and elliptical snacks of all parts of the location are slightly slight and slightly shocked.
The urban environment is perfectly restored.
It seems unnecessary to find shoes, dogs and kids in the football.
And all of them is books, books, books.
"The book flights stand around the fassads, and the middle is a large dark room, as a rule of unclean and unclean," says Viney Maas.
We put a classical slippering space on the head and shoot the area to read out of the outside.
The internal area of the book mountain has been used: offices, websites, chat clubs, environmental centres and technical locations in the center.
They are particularly pleased with black books that serve the Steen Division, the paraptics, the legs of sweet tissue.
They're incomparable, texture and sweet.
Even tried architects and engineers are lost in records, but this is for unknown material.
"We have tried to work with secondary materials", explains Jep Traubourst, the leader of the project represented by the Spain communities, in accordance with the standard requirements.
And once at a agricultural company in France, we met the suitable agricultural product.
For many years, in the hot and fields in the Netherlands as a root subscription is used by the artistic millimetre of millimeters of millimeters.
It's quiet and economic.
The thin textile serves for a two-year session, and then you can select it.
For library, this was the first part of such quantities, a total of four sanitators had been printed in the panel.
The so-called landscape (KLP) is converted into a dark, unique, simple material, with a little remindering new car and a little bit of sweet.
There are 105 steps on the top.
Those who are over the road of about 500 meters will be rewarded in literature, not only by fantastic species in the city, but also by the Dutch steps and by grains in the hills.
They are concerned about the atmosphere, and first of all, the right power of the air on the literature mountain.
The costs for a new soul
"It's hard to believe, but this building, despite many steel surfaces, represents an illustrative project in environmental plans", says Trouborst.
The warming of the earth is used for heat and heating.
Although the Book Mountain is under a strike strike, even in the light days the sun is only in a short time.
The frozen farms from the slippery grain situated perpendicularly on the steel fascination give shadows and take themselves a large part of the sun.
The climate is very nice.
The remaining protection provides fully automatic rolling shoes.
Stefan Spermon, mentioned above a skeptic from the IT area, has already visited a new library.
Lizate Verchag was already here.
Also, a traditional Chinese medical of Sintia Godd, who was called Buckenberg, "The Dude of Spain, which hasn't been missing."
Figure: Over a few weeks before the opening of each residence received a invitation to provide a book from its own congregation.
These books should have taken empty places on the fields yet not fully integrated library, at that time there were 70,000 books.
The idea worked.
Fields are placed up.
"It's nothing worse than half a library," said Architecter Vinnie Maas.
"I think that through our invitation, every resident in some way is associated with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if she serves only to steal.
Thus, MDRDV was able to solve the king's task, which is called for the creation of identity.
Species wrote his literature history.
And let them be very young and unformed.
It's just the first point to build identity.
Sabo: "Naimians must play a more important role."
Germany was suspended by the vote on the recognition of Palestinian.
According to Stefan Sabo, an expert on relations between the United States and Europe, Berlin is slightly balanced with a diplomatic road.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany understood that it voted against the complaints of Palestinians to obtain the status of observer to the United Nations.
But then Berlin stopped with the vote.
Why?
Stefan Sabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.
Germany now needs to be careful in connection with its special relations with Israel.
But at the same time, I think that it does not support the American position too.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - in this way it was not too critical to Israel.
During the resurrection in Libya, Germany was also endorsed when voted on the introduction of a banned field zone in March 2011.
The NATO concluded that proposal.
Germany is difficult to make a clear position on complex international affairs?
Yeah, that's it.
The fact is that it is in the process of converting its external policy, namely, from the policy, which, so the United States managed to the own German external policy.
There is a further difficult situation that Europeans have no agreed single policy.
Thus, the Germans are rearing between two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not attracted.
I think that until they are only playing their role, but they are on the way to the 'normal' foreign policy.
External policy, which is carried out by France or Britain.
What specifically means the "normal" external policy with the German view?
This is the willingness to take place in their national interests, not indeed from the United States or the European partners.
I believe that the German external policy depends on economic policies, namely on export and connections with certain regions such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The economic interests of Germany are significantly different from the interests of other major States, and Germany should therefore protect their interests.
Have these economic interests affected the position in the Middle East and the vote in the United Nations?
First, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, in particular in the Persian Hall States.
It is therefore necessary to be careful to prevent publicity and elites in the Arab countries.
In any case, this plays its role.
But I wouldn't give this too much, it's not a completely unilateral connection.
But in any case, it plays an important role in the calculation of Germans.
Did Germany affect its relationship with the United States by taking important decisions, such as the vote on Palestinian?
I am sure that in Europe and even in the United States the understanding of the German position.
So I don't think that it was the same dramatic strike as the liquid matter.
Germany may even have a certain respect.
This signals that it should be taken as a player for an international arenar and that it should be considered with its interests.
There are various views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
Instead, the U.S. was clearly cast out by the wind.
Is it possible to divide opinions between the United States and many European States?
Such differences were always existing under the American internal policy.
I believe that the Government of Obama is in the deep sense of the European position.
However, as regards the local political situation, the Government could, of course, not openly take such position.
I believe that significant disappearances in the views are not very significant as always represented.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Neanjahu, note that Obama is not totally delayed from the policy of Neanjahu.
Should Germany combine their close relationship with Israel and the United States with one side and the situation of the most important partner in the EU with another?
I think this makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, the Germans would be a few more simpler if there would be a single non-profit European policy, but now it is not true.
Therefore, they can't speak within a broader approach and have been able to act instead, just by the vision of the situation.
That's how they do with the euro.
I think that in the future, Germany is a leading role in developing a common European position.
It is understood that Germany is not easy, although it would be because of Israel's connection.
This theme was always smooth.
But I think the Germans clearly have to play an independent role.
If Germany himself is a role of an international player, does it really take the main role?
Or is the leading role still in Germany hard?
Germany has not yet engaged in this, and it is still unfortunate, and, for obvious reasons, it is still hard to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis - every time Germany has an important role, the most different anti-German sentiments are shown.
The Germans are not just doing so.
Indeed, this is an old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by enemy countries.
In this regard, Germany is a significantly more serious situation than the United States.
It should take into account the most different neighbors and views, and that is not easy.
So the impact of the United States in Europe policy is constantly weak, but now the EU does not fill this vacuum, who then remains?
The Germans should just play a more significant role.
Even if you do not like that, unpleasantly, or enhance a loneliness to you, such a life!

"Protection Safety" in China: When Puma and Armania will soon become Chinese
Armania is a worldly known trademark, Polo Ralph Lauren, also.
But what's Armani Polo?
This is completely officially registered in China, which has nothing to do with the companies whose name was educational.
However, it will be safeguarded until the owners of the origin shall not proclaim the search.
But it is unexpected that they may be able to defeat their rights.
"Foreigners are still more difficult to protect their market marks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer of Taylor Wessing, who specializes the rights of the market marks in the Dark East.
Every week on my table appears in the new case of this kind.
The subsidiaries are sufficient to add a couple of letters to the right to register their trade signs.
So from Gucci, Lu-Gucci, you can register Prada-Kny instead of Prada.
The same way is legally copied by German companies, such as the producer of sports products Puma.
Patterns opens a folder with the registering state in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, the Chinese company registered the trade sign of Zegna DF Puma, a artistic name which also used the name of a model house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that Chineses are a champion of the world's copy and violation of the rights of intellectual property is known.
There are numerous universities in large cities that are sold almost exclusively.
However, the case is not the case of Patlok, but he claims to his trusters that Chinese enterprises are officially obtained from the State of Registration of Marks of the Right to use the name already protected anywhere else.
The Chineses call it a mine bath, a passenger mark.
This word is associated with the "bag-bag".
This is called women who are fighting for rich men.
Chinese authorities do not recognize their own guilt
"That hurts business, it's necessary to fight", believes Patloch.
"Turgood brand is shocked, the unique situation is lost, the gang is very much suffering."
Financial losses and processing costs are calculated by millions, especially in cases of cost-copyed products.
According to the CLSA market research company, China, with the amount of EUR15 billion per year, is the third to the size and the fastest increased growth in the growing market.
However, the removal of suspicious records in the trade signs is difficult, and it is costly.
The process may extend until nine years, with an uncertain exit.
Patloch speaks of the cases in which the court rejected the court, since the anti-protectional name was the real market.
If the truth does not bring, he should even pay the payer, as he has damaged his trade mark in China, says Patloch.
Sometimes, the Jungle's law is ruling here.
There are also famous cases on graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler has played a judicial gap with the Sany manufacturer, a company that had been acquired by Bentononassos Putzmeister.
So the Chineses still have the right to use a emblem like Mercedes star.
The Coupe Volvo Company Geely was originally using a blue-white logotype that reminded the BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
The producer of the model products Lacoste played in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, where the famous Steadhol looked at the other side.
Chinese authorities do not consider themselves guilty.
The registration of CTMO trade signs in Beijing confirms that there was a place of discharge in 2010 because of the lack of staff and equipment.
However, in the past year, "returns from an emergency situation in the work process to the standard".
Similarly, the number of non-employed cases has reduced by 22 per cent.
About 57.000 such cases were closed, over 75 per cent of which was last year.
However, 81.500 claims are still expected to produce in the State.
The struggle of this cost must be.
As often in China, digits are impressed.
In the past year, more than 1,4 million complaints on trade marks were made to the CTMO, almost three more than 2010.
It means that China has issued a list of new registrations throughout the world ten times.
Similarly, the overall number of commercial signs, only 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1,8 billion yuan collections were paid.
If simplified, it means that each registration is average of EUR1280 or EUR 160.
Protection of it is much more than the case of German family company Freudenberg.
For over seven years, the conflict is struggling against the Chinese slaughter.
The Germans were able to realize that the illegal production of their specific car details was eliminated.
However, the imitator strengthened China's rights on the trade mark of Freudenberg.
This was the own shift, as the names in Germany were not protected, said Hanno Wentzler, President of the Fryenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the State of the registration of trade signs of CTMO rejected the claim of municipalities.
Indeed, in the two next instances, Freudenberg wins, but the opposite side continues to fight until now.
We need to be a moment
The issue is now being considered at the Supreme Court.
Wentsler hopes that the case is good to be completed and that the professionalism of the courts is practitional.
But he also says, "The procese is an emergency way and takes many time, money and nerves to us."
The internal expenditure was noted that the company's archives had to even seek acts of centuries of long terms to prove evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg proposed the opposite "the large sixth amount of euro" for a solution.
"It's clear how much we need it," says Wintersler.
The dangers of the Dark East are threatened to move in Europe even.
It is, in the case of imits register there, unprotected trade signs.
Yes, one Chinese producer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for skins and skins.
The Concern has long stopped production in these areas, but, despite this, it has been possible to prevent the registration.
"We need to be a shock," says Wentzler.
Like he and the lawyers Patrick recommended the German companies to be very careful with China.
Insufficiently, the international provisions on the protection of goods should be confidence, and foreigners should "all which should be protected, registered in China as well," says Wintersler.
Otherwise, this may be a long road than the registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg plays in the last act of its trade sign, it should be paid to the other side of the licence collections for his own name, Wintersler explains.
Otherwise, we're out of the market in the back segment.
World Day of AIDS: to cut, sing, help

And Fight Hopff, a 29-year-old driver, does not get out of his mother's smooth tube when they lead them to smooth and expressive snakes.
The Monday night, a musical Institut for Medical Psychology in Haidelberg, Imbongy, produces a new song.
Fifty-five chrone participants were from human genetic specialists to the park of 23 to 69 years of age.
The "Obani" is an unfair thing, which every crowd has its text, also in a completely strange language: the Zulus, which says 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, and in some parts of Swaziland.
Help for self - help
According to the UNHCR assessment, the United Nations HIV-being programme is around 34 million in the world.
23.5 million live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, 245,000 AIDS serials are lived.
There is more than 40 per cent of the population of HIV.
For 180 AIDS serials in the island of Estonia, the Voices for Africa found heads in Germany.
70 of them visit the school prepared for further education.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, the headship can be taken.
It guarantees a child ' s money for school, school form and daily dinner in Gog Center.
Involuntary in the Zulus language means speaker or praise.
This room hasn't said to fly on the bathroom, so they can't be able to sing.
Only ten years of chrone is sing in this foreign milk language, and from time to time it will even bring them back to where they have appeared first: to South Africa.
By the distance of 8733 km from Haidelberg, northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village of Esitjan, which depends on the voices of the German Horo.
Inhibited 40 per cent
There lived about 2000 people, some still in simple grains of grain and sweat, among many inhabited children.
More than 300 of them remained without parents who died from HIV virus.
In the Miniature, Esithuania reflects all Swaziland diseases: the higher level of HIV identification, the lowest life expected in the world for UNICEF data.
The decrease of the extreme flesh of a man that is evidencely decreased in the risk of infringement of half of the population is almost not adopted.
More than 40 per cent of the population of Swaziland has an immunodeficiency virus, death in the middle of the fourteenth is not rational.
Hor opened the village in a joint journey to Africa in spring 2005, but before the participants, Immovni had seen many children on the streets that were not only parental concern but also all: food, clothing, education.
Without school education in a poor country, there is no opportunity.
First, this was the private commitment of individual participants - for several euros a year to send a child to school and to give him a chance to receive a hot food day.
However, a year later, the horse was based on the Voices for Africa, which has been almost professionally concerned with AIDS syrhosis in Estonia.
Infections transferred by sex
What are the important diseases transmitted by sex?
Bacterial IDPs relate to cyphilis, chlorides, and tripers (Gonore).
A number of Virus AIDS are HIV, human pavilion, genetic herpes and hepatitis.
Lobicular pedicles and capsules relate to the parazitary IPSP.
What are the main groups inflicted?
Syfilis and gonorrs are meeting in the main man who are in sex with men.
The Robert Coha Institute is due to the fact that at least four of each five cases of the syfilise registered in Germany is transferred by sexual contacts between men.
In adults of gender-related diseases, there are chlamide infections, trichomonias, candydozos (glybch), gonorrus and human tumor virus.
The dissemination of HIV between gender-sexual adults is relatively low, but about 20 per cent of the new infections of HIV is to the group.
Among youths of chloride infections are significantly more than other groups of people.
The European data shows that three four of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years of age.
We also have a human pavilion of virus among young people.
How is the number of cases of infection changed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases shall be obliged to register.
The disease of cyphilis, according to the Robert Coha Institute, has doubled more than 1697 cases in 2001 to 3698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections is reduced since 2007.
It was about 2700 cases in 2011.
It is about one ten less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate venerical diseases?
Infectional diseases may result in illnesses, complaints in the driving, cutting, cutting down animals, and injury or invasion.
However, it is often not associated with pain and other symptoms and remains unremarked.
How can we protect?
The conservation is able to reduce the risk of infection, but does not give 100 per cent protection.
As partly rebuilding sexually transmissible diseases may also be distributed through contact infection and with close physical contact.
As a result, experts recommend regular survey, especially when sexual partners change.
During the early diagnostic, the majority of CIPs can be healed and avoided from distant consequences.
Heads, donations, and not in the last time, donors for the chronic exhibition in all Germany have enabled to gather something.
“We have sent to Esithuania some 2000,000 euros,” says Anna Lennartz, President of the Union.
In the village of Germany, there is a skilled and active woman in Côdova Dlamín.
She also cares for the well-building of the shoes, such as one of the grandfathers.
Gouss, as they call for old women of Zulus, is a shock of villages.
Some of them took themselves up to 14 syrtoms, give them a shirt over the head and care for children in the form of each day at the time.
Those who haven't remained parents are coming to Hanovirus, a single woman who receives the payment of the association, as well as two trails that are preparing for more than 200 hungry children every day.
Furthermore, the Voices for Africa has organized a Swiss school, built two smokers, together with the American Health Organization of PSI, organized HIV analysis for many villages.
It is difficult to imagine, but about the disease that is so obvious in the whole country, they prefer to pray deeply.
King with 14 women
"AIDS is a absolute table," says Anna Lennartz, "for he's related to sexuality."
It is essential for the country in which the king has 14 women officially.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mustai III, was known by his love to exil.
Poligamia instead of democracy.
In particular, such an authorized State also has a vine because of the HIV virus has been soon distributed in the past years.
However, it is also abroad of workers that divide the virus in the country.
The reserves are literally on each edge, says Anna Lennartz, "but they are almost not used.
Another culture is the flesh to the flesh."
In order to support the cultural exchange, Mr. Ibmbony travels to South Africa every two-third years and produces songs, full strikes, war spirit, confidence and black self-conscience, which many in the south of the black continent are still known since the time of the apartheid.
Autobus, full of white songs in black tongue, is not only a good way and joy, but, even, has caused lips in the eye of the dark borders.
The journey is always coming to Esithuania where the slaughter visits sub-shaped children.
Despite a small village with work can be found on a map, it is more known than it is.
"It's going to Ethidia, there's light," the sweet people say.
After a 8733-kilometer ship back to Haidelberg, when the swimming snakes return to the reception hall on the Berlin Street, you can see that the light also be sweet here.
Messenger: NASA opens the lady to Mercury
The Messenger's Zone found evidence that Mercury is a lady on the planet.
The leafy can have a thickness up to 20 meters.
The United States Cosmic State of the NASA has proved to existing ice on the Marcus planet.
Although it is close to the sun, there is also more water, as appears from three research published in the Special Science magazine on Thursday.
The Messenger's zone found evidence that the planet's darkness of the region was shocked with ice.
It must be at least 30 centimeters and may even 20 meters.
The water is likely from comits or may be a steroid covered with Mercurius.
No one is connecting the opening of iron with the existence of life on the planet, said the scientific leader of the Solomon Zone.
The temperature at Mercurie can reach 426 degrees of Cellsia.
However, these openings could help explain how water and other life-building elements have fallen in other places of the Solar system.
Unlikely for the people of the Earth, the telescopes and the small jobs, such as Phenics, are investigating the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to the Earth: small clouds in unconciliation.
Image is from the cameras developed by German researchers from the Max Plank Institute.
Eight planets of our Solar system, as well as the Cérér's karl planet.
Like Pluton, who is around the sun for Nepal, Cerera, as a new definition of the International Astronomic Union since 2006, is not a "pilot".
This fraction of the inflated telescope "Speaker" is a seed portrait of star generations: the oldest stars in the form of blue points, which are harder to identify racial "nowed" stars.
The region of the star formation - scientists, not Romantically, called the W5, opened the "Spicer" telescope in Cassiopea, at the distance of 6500 light-year years.
This shocked shock of the mortal star photod the NASA Telescope "Speaker".
It seems to be the beginning of a ring of the material that the star has cast out in the death process.
There are new stars from the Earth and the planet in the giant thickness of Trifid, which is removed by 5400 light years.
Telescope NASA "Special" made this photo of the galaxy family room.
The Star Collection of Plyada, also called "Seven sisters", can be seen by night unarmed eye.
Of course, it's better from the telescope.
As the red eye is undermined by the humble observer on this infrared picture.
It is located at the distance of 700 light years in the Air Star.
The counterpart of the Earth Continent has brought this twenty named "South America".
Combination of normal and inflated photos provides expressive warning.
This new star in the whole beauty was able to picture only through the infrared telescope "Speaker" telescope.
Saturn and his corners: how they occurred is one of the great astronomies.
It's probably the saturne moon, which has disappeared 4,5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and most clear pictures of the "Habble" telescope: Air gallery
Depending on the colors of the spy galaxy pictures, the art is transformed.
The picture published by the Southern European observer shows that the Trifid is several thousands of light years in the star of the Star.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifius (threkhdolene, tripartite) because the dark pools are separated in three parts of the discovered heart of the star.
In the star of the Zemenois, the astronomy photod the predictor of the space assembly: 400 million light years from the Earth, two switch galactics are close to each other and are inevitablely covered.
That's the birth of Habbl's telescope's sliding in the M83 special galaxy.
Those who do not like technical reduction may be called " South Coast".
The photo of the Space Telescope Habble shows the flow of Iris's tsunami in Césphea's constellation.
The tumor of the 1400 light years consists of the pig parts of which are 10 to 100 times less than in the normal house pool.
This image was composed of the optical and ringgenic pictures of different telescopes.
It shows a number of black darks removed to 430 million light years from the Earth.
This group of galactics called Arp 273 photod for the NASA Space Telescope Habble.
The largest spiral galaxy of scientists is called UGC 1810.
In this star darkness there is the most brilliant group of new stars of our Middle path.
The star jungle constantly creates new stars.
This is a star area, which is connected to the darkness of the Rose, also constantly creates new stars - at the distance of 5000 light years from Earth.
In this lighting galactic, with a small black dark, there is no pigs, only gas.
The researchers suggest that it had been soon before the Great Explosion when the universe was mainly a hydrogen.
Our views in the universe: most important telescopes
The telescope was probably discovered in 1608 by Hans Lippersheem - even before Galileo Galilee later began to observe the stars.
Since then, the optical television mirror has become increasing, and their space views are increasingly deeply available.
During the 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Haley Telescope in the Palomar Observatory in San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The scene of here had a diameter of 5 meters.
In Arizona, the U.S., sets the Good Binoculture Telescope.
It allows to look in space with two diameters, each diameter 8,4 m.
The "Gran Telescopio Canary" has a giant internal device, a diameter of only 10,4 meters of a mirror.
The Great South African Telescope Segmented Segmentated, because of a decreasing cost.
However, in diameters it reaches about 11 meters.
Inadequate constructive execution: the telescope is slightly strengthened under the vertical edge, which limits its movement.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope also has a fixed vertical angle.
His particularity: high lighting capacity.
It reaches, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, the parameters of the greatest world television.
Researchers have been listening to external signals in the space with radio telescopes in Arizbo (Pourto Rico).
Radiotelescope has a diameter 305 meters.
Participating in the "Search for Foreign Intelligence" project (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing its calculative power.
View of the European Astronomy Service (ESO) in the Chile Andeans.
There's a very big telescope that's the full corresponding name.
His four mirrors are enabled to see the medium spectrum in the brain.
ESO also plans the establishment of the European 'Every Great Telescope' in the Chile Observatory.
His main mirror must be covered at the total of 42 meters, and will be composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, photos should not be expected before 2018.
By 2007, both the "keek" telescopes in the Guyana Vulcan Muna Kea were considered the world's largest.
They have two diameters per ten meters.
The Keek telescopes include the Mauna-Kea guard, which looks close to them in heaven by using the Subaro TV and IRTTF.
Furthermore, there must be a new guiant telescope in Mauna-Kea, with a diameter of 30 meters.
Here they can love the illustration.
However, the most important species of space have a spatial telescope "Habbl".
From 24 April 1990 he sets pictures of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, a space telescope of Capler is looking for planets outside the Solar System, especially for those who can live.
On 2 February 2011, the NASA reported that 1235 planets have been discovered from the beginning of the mission.
The last preparation of the "Cepler" space telescope is printed on the photo.
The cosmic telescope James Webba (JWST) will be sent to the space before 2018 on a Ragate Raket "Arian 5".
The main mirror of the spacious telescope has 6.5 meters of diameter.
One of the tasks of the television: he must be on the light of the first stars and the galaxy looking for the Great Explosion.
Scientists suggest that Marcuria has a lady in the south.
However, there is no reliable data about this, as the Messenger is closer to the northern planet.
Radio-measures for decades indicated that Mercury had a lady.
Thanks to the Messenger Zone in 2004, the first, which turns around Mercury, is now scientists.
Eat oil every day - and live up to 168 years
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people have reached the age of e-mail in the Bible.
There's even a long-term museum here.
Search for census in the country where the 97-year-old elders are still relatively young.

Search for census in the country where the 97-year-old elders are still relatively young.
The travel through the Talish mountains can be called a swimming and romantic.
The microautobus with a swimming swimming road is cut by the growing smell forests, the swimming ribbons and the simple crystal houses.
Everyone around it is green and sweet that you can think like you're in Swartzwald.
But this is the southern area of Azerbaijan, the Iran border is just a few miles away.
Here, there is one of the peoples of Caucashu who know a little, but only what they say well about the Fars and the Azerbaijan and is different for a long time.
The final point is Leric.
The small town is tough a soviet architecture, which is not exactly in harmony with the vibrant landscape.
Tourists from Europe are almost not coming here, the road from the Azerbaijan capital of Baku is too humble.
323 miles (323 km) is eight hours away, since the road has only one pool.
The Legendary Re riches of which the country has to be able to the Caspian ocean is here in the province until it arrived.
Pilata Fatulaev (48), however, is convinced that Lerique is only interested in tourists.
"In May Baku has been glorified by the Eurovising Festival, and in the next year we will be the festival of older people of the world," says Fatulaev.
She's the director of a long-term museum, probably the only part of the world.
There are some eight dinners from these places for more than 100 years, and the fatulaev shows a black and white photo.
It's my grandfather, he's 120 years old here.
136 years old, he was born another child.
But a shock star of the museum is the Sherali Muslumes, whose shoes have been executed 168 years.
Birth witnesses, however, not.
In view of the fact that the elderly whose age is understood by documents, 122 years of age Muslim is extremely doubtful.
"He was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973," explains Fatulaev.
She was married three times, and he had 23 children, 136 years old, and she was born her daughter.
Did this add a musulman to his age a couple of decades?
Even Rembrandt Schultz, a age researcher from the Max Plank Institute in Rostok, heard about long-term in Middle Asia.
"In some areas of China, Japan, or Hungary Valley in Pakistan, we can also meet a lot of people of perpetrated age," said Scheltz, "in Sardinia, there are also very many very old people. "
However, because of the absence of documents, age age validity is impossible because it has not been recorded by civil status.
Each day, the steel of fuel oil
However, there is a fact that people in Leric are often reaching Bible age.
Now 20 people are over 100 years of age.
Why, in the south, so many long-terms here?
The Azerbaijan Exploration Farid Musimzade explains this special gene of the sounded.
The director of the Fatulaev Museum, on the contrary, believes that the food matter.
Thus, the meat, bread, and more milk products, many of them are drinking every day on the steel of fuel oil, but unlike such high-ocular dial may be healthy with the environmental point of view.
Or in the first form of life that keeps young people? in Chenghemiran, a small village near Lerick, lives Rubbab Mirzoev.
In 97 years, she is still relatively young for these dimensions.
Mirzaev, who claims that 143 births live in a simple village house, typical for the whole Caucasian region.
She's sit on a floor with a sleeve side of the oil that can't catch out there.
There are eight men, including one of the sons and the daughter of the Mirzaev, who have already had their grandsons.
And the nearby will shoot two little ones.
The kitchens prepare a tea that comes in the typical pound stacks of the army.
With the world's perfectly weak and strong white dents, she hides long dark and Russian bones that her son, with pride to us.
I always have my hair with milk, so they've never gone and saved the colour.
"And I never used the shampoo," says Mirzaev.
Monthly pension is lacking for life
She's always eating only what growed in his own room, powders, cards, goods.
I never bought any products in the store for my whole life.
Then she tells her husband who served in the army.
It was the worst after the Second World War.
But it's better when Gadar Aliev's loved father gets in the route.
Propaganda does not often feel like a old woman.
However, the culture built around the face of the father of the nation, which rules of the country as a dictator, is almost not known to the borders in Azerbaijan.
He was in authority until 2003, and then his son, Ilham, had accepted his government.
However, there is no poverty among the azerbaijan elderly.
Mirzaev receives the same amount of euro monthly as pension, for local conditions, the amount for which it can be used to live.
And maybe a long-year-old son of Peacea also has the right: "The stars in our culture use deep respect".
They live in a great family, loved, environmental and happiness.
There is no reason to stay in the lives as possible
The word " Human Rights" is not in the Constitution
The Revolution returned to Kair.
Cairo's confronting demonstrations have proved to be a deep part of the country.
The constitution based on the chariot met a wreckful resistance.
The Egyptian President did not purchase a pafos.
We have to make a transition.
"And his success is on my responsibility before the people and before the god," he said to the public television.
His words were treated to all the people, but first of all, Christian copts, Liberal, Muslims and nonreligious Egyptians.
Because all of them, even uncertainly dismissed in the dispersive opposition, have experienced fear.
The fear of the religious state in Nile for the mercy of the powerful "British Muslims".
Mohammed Murcy, who had not been sorry, said he had temporaryly cut the competence of the Constitutional Court and enhanced his competence "to save the revolution".
However, the real desire to save 61-year-old engineer with a doctor of South America's University, not clearly to Egyptians and all the world.
Does the power of justice be free?
In fact, article 234 was able to shut up a 15-hour night box with the obstacles to the Islamic Constitutional Meeting of 100 participants, which is partly threatening.
Like in the previous constitutions, the project states that the provision of the court is opposed to "the principles of Islamic law".
But what's the princess?
This was and remains the case of interpretation, and it can be afraid that the Islamics will use a dissemination formula and a legal leaflet for more strict interpretation of the sheriff.
At least one new article has been amended: in all cases relating to the chariot, Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution of the country, which is the larger authority in all the Sunnith Islam.
This should not, but it may mean that the clergy supervises legislation that de facto would have been the result of the limitation of the judicial authority.
In the Constitution project, there are many objects of interpretation
Another problem: The judicial of civilians of the military court should be maintained.
These courts were servicing for the advertising of oppositioners during the Mubarak period.
After the dictator in military prison, there were up to 11.000 civilians.
As states are said in the project, “the true society of the Egyptian family” and“success moral and values” should be protected by the State.
It was legally so clear that public institutions will be able to control even film and literature.
The opening text does not mean anything else as a rhetorium.
Indeed, no article does not set directly the equality of men and women.
And the other bans to strive and create the prophet of Mohammed and his Messengers.
But what such tribulation and how it should be punished, it remains unexpected.
It is also the form that is prohibited by the "distortion of people".
Is it sufficient for carriages to the President or shooting about justice?
The question of interpretation, as well as many in this project, which Murcy proposes to sign, and which, in his words, "too fast" will be submitted to the Egyptians to a referendum.
"Revolution returned."
A few weeks ago, the opposition of the Islamic superiority was formed.
Decades of thousands were gathered in an unfortunate unity on Friday night at the Tahrir area in Cairo, and they pleaded to destroy the document before he could enter into force.
"Revolution returned, and we will win," said Hamdin Sabaki, who took the third place at the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize and the former leader of the International Atomic Energy State of Mohammed El-Baradei stated that a "constitution project" was a place in the history.
Through the service of short news on Twitter, he accused the Mursy's envoy to call "shoot against democracy".
"If he's pushing a referendum, we'll go to his door and to his tab," said the opposer, Jaser Said.
"We haven't been shocked, the blood of our brothers is still not discarded," quoted Egyptian media of the opposition policy of Khaled Ali.
Many judges also reported that they did not want to observe a referendum that would have done it indeed.
"Corran is our Constitution."
Good organized "Brathia Muslim" in his own way called against the demonstration, but, from precaution, not in the Tahrir area, and after the mass prayer at the other Nila Beach before the University of Kalifornia.
It has participated in a large number of women under the clamps and salphites who cried: "The nation requires the application of God's law."
They needed from Murcy, "Corran is our Constitution."
For the struggle of authority on a symbolic area on which everything began, the state of civil war was pronounced.
Murcy followers, obviously, did not want to go to that risk.
The Muslim Brothers stated that both the opposers and the partners of the Constitution's project were very clear and clear.
It has now been time to give the people to decide in the election urine where the country should go.
The majority of Islamic projects is considered a decisive case.
"The concept of human rights isn't mentioned once."
Hafiz Abu Saeda was angry from this consolidated constitutional process, which, in fact, had to extend to February with all public forces.
48-year-old human rights lawyer and the President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (OECD) defended the "Brativ-Musulman" when they were sent in prison or submitted before the court.
It is not because he divided their world resurrection, but because human rights are not for him.
He was killed, sentenced, arrested.
And now the word "Human Rights" has never seen in a new Constitution, and he regrets the World am Sunday.
The enlargement of Murcy's influence on all three powers in the State is devastated by the lawyer.
These measures represent clear attacks on the democratic rules of the game and bring Egyptians to a new dictature.
"Instead of enhancing the civil State, President de facto rejected it," Saeda regrets.
Without civil organizations, democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels that everyone has left it, even the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle on the Nile with the smell of love and tension.
This may start the payment.
The demonstrant on the Tahrir area warns, "You're creating a monster that you can't control."
Norwegian ракfish: Is the most crazy fish in the world?
The five-millional population of Norwegia is one of the highest life levels in Europe, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Maybe the secret success of this country is a local invasion to one extremely gender fishermen?
Take a few cuts of skin.
Place them in a lot of clean and swimming clothes.
Leave them there for a week.
You'll have a misleading smell of missiles, one of the most famous Norwegian divisions.
I'm in a small town named Fahernes, three hours from Oslo.
It is very nice, but it differs in the air an insufficient snake.
Rakhsk is a slippered floor in water for a year, depending on what the soul needs to be achieved.
As soft and cold, the Norwegians gather to the festival in Fahernes, dedicated to the same, will say so to the shocked.
"It eats the skin and snakes the snake of the local thin water," explains Havard Halvarsen, the local fire fire on professionals and the joint "Rackfisk General", which leads to the festivals.
All around us eat small fish cubes and smell it with a small portion of spurt.
"It's someone more like aquatic than racics," says Havard.
This drink can survive.
I'm trying a couple of pieces.
If you can spend a shoe under the nap, it's not so bad and bad - it's not different from the portion that you have sent to the bus for a long time.
Rakhsk is a Norwegian product from all other times, and poverty during the time when heavy fish was covered in a genetically closed strike with salt water.
Then the deep winter, when the fish was already well and basically broken, it was extracted, and, shocking with alcohol, they used food.
Moreover, the fact that thousands of Norwegians had been forced to leave their country in search for work and immigration in the United States.
But now the population is increasing - more than 13 per cent of immigrants are involved in workplaces, high payments and social security systems.
Sweden’s people (the former conspirator, and not so long and much more useful neighbors) have come to work here.
Rakhsk is an unprecedented, unprecedented sign and a few bad elements of the past Norway.
It's one of the most beautiful local bags.
On the other hand, a small swimming blue or sandwich will take you to 9 feet sterlings (14 dollars).
Norwegia appears rarely in world news, and most of the people of the country seems to be affected.
People here are still desirable to mention the name Anders Bravik, racist and extremist of the right touch, who was shot and killed by 77 men, women and children last year.
Not mentioned his name, the terrorist is called "the event of 22 July".
Norwegians were very difficult to believe that one of them had been condemned to such beliefs and murders in their peace.
According to the today ' s welfare, Norwegian growth (from the beginning of seventy) is one of the largest oil sectors in the world.
"One oil is not the only reason for our prosperity", says Anna, our officer, with a variety of contributions to the deserved missile, women with long light hair and very blue eyes, the involvement of the Northern well-being.
We are such a people, as you call it, a reasonable.
Like most Norwegians, she's nice to say English.
We don't like to show up, we're not satisfied.
Norwegia is very seriously engaged in its oil - a large part of the oil income is invested in a special fund created for future generations.
In the years before the world's financial crisis, when all of them had the money that they had not had, Norway has seriously estimated all costs.
"When you can cast on winter legs and walk in the summer, that's enough for happiness," says Anna.
And there's a ramfish, and she adds with an unfortunate smell.
I'm standing in the sneeze for some food -- a missile with me.
This is a hamburger with a loose meat. It's precisely ecologic, sophisticated meat.
But the evening is waiting for more than the same fish with the forgotten sweet.
My guests have a special dinner dedicated to a missile, during which the visitors define the best or possibly the most aromatic fish.
It's a direct television that shows the leader in a swimming pool with a missile.
It looks like a song competitor.
"So, Thor-Urgen, what evaluation have you set for the best fish there in the mountains?"
"Yes, Haward, this is our appreciation."
Everyone laughs and applauses.
Someone's falling from the store, maybe he's switching up the shoes.
Or maybe just breathing this fish.
The President of Mexico Enrique Pink Nito is an unfair start of carriage.
As long as the new President of Mexico Enrique Pink Neoth is ready to take place, the representative of BBC Will Grant invites us to consider the difficulties that he has to face and expect the people of his country.
The road movement in Mexico is now in particular in pleasant state.
The city was loaded by transport and at the best time, and from the lunch there were strict salaries that slowed several key magistrates to the capital and shocked on the road.
However, this was not to give people to work from rewards, but to prevent the protest participants to bring the parliament.
On Saturday, the new chapter of Mexico Anika Pinechi will take the Presidential transition and take a brochure of the country's government.
It's a simple task before him.
Mexico has reached good economic indicators at the Administration of Felipe Calderon, which is now its powers, but the country has polluted in the war with drugs that has been ordered by 60,000 lives for six years.
"My Government claims to the people of Mexico that he is willing to fight violence, " reported previously by Mr. Peña Néto, President of the United States Barak Obama, in the White House office.
I'm going to propose a new security strategy that allows us to achieve this goal.
To such statements with the President of the United States, Mrs. Pineya Neto has developed a position of the Governor of his family state in Mexico.
In his family, in a smooth and wide state of the capital of the country, the opinions of the new leader were separated.
Primical person
The Vale-de-Bravo, for example, remembered with heat.
The people are able to live in tourism, to develop smoking and to create infrastructure.
The city can be reached by one of the new shows built by Mrs. Peña Nito, which are different from the roads with the smuggles and the smells that were previously on this place.
The tables with his name are the modern building of the sports centre and the impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We are connected to him with the hope of real and serious changes," said his friend and the political associator Gabriel Olver Ernandes, the State Congress of the United States for the institutional and revolutionary party (PRI).
We are expecting to change these and decisive changes, which are so necessary to our country, first in the area of security and economic development.
After 81 years of unexpected residence, the Prime Party was issued in 2000 by Vicenne Fox.
The Congress of Olver acknowledges that after his 12-year-old absence, the party has given great hopes to Enrique Piney Nino after his presidency.
He also checks the accused of inconsistence that the new President has issued the opposition.
It is very direct and very dedicated to the implication of his future country's vision.
This is a supervised public person and, above all, a person able to listen.
However, in the other part of the state, many people had another presentation of the former Governor.
The municipality of Nesaulkootl, also known as Susan Ness, is the most discreet contrast with the powerful Vale-de-Browo streets.
He was hidden under the east of the automobile, and in many senses, he is the reward of Mexico itself.
And the problems in the municipality also have a serious nature of this megapolis.
The previous year, for the elimination of the bands of drugs in these regions, were engaged in the army, and violence against women is a particular nature.
In the desert only in the past two years, several decades of bodies killed by women were found.
More thousands of women were killed in Mexico during the governance of Mr. Peña Nito, which is significantly exceeding such a pestilence in the proudly glorified city of Susan Huarez, whose name was narrow when the murder of innocent women.
According to the opposites, Mr. Peña Neto, in the best case, it was possible to say that during his residence on the governance, he did not have a duty to address women's murder problem.
In the worst case, his administration is accused of fully ignoring this problem.
A beton house like most of the houses in this area, Irina Bundy, who works with smile, shows me the picture of her dead daughter Marianna Luna.
Marian's official version of the 2010 suicide.
However, her family believes that she killed her owner.
"When I arrived to her house, it seemed to be her body before it," remembered Mrs. Bundy.
It was signed that it had been killed, and the body has already been shocked.
The mother of Maryna tells this story, and the portraits of daughters look at us from the wall where he spends close to the snake, which is a whole word: justice.
That is, according to their words, that family was rejected.
"Only, the state's persons treated me as an old shock, unwanted tranquillity offender.
They want people to simply accept everything they're saying, and they're disappointed.
But it's wrong, that's not possible, especially when there is so many violations and injuries around", she says.
On the hope of the President-in-Office on Saturday, President Pink Néto, together with her, would take the difficult responsibility.
In the past six years, ten thousands of families in Mexico have affected violence crimes, and the new President had promised to solve this problem as a priority during its rule.
"I hope he will be exactly the same President as the Governor", said Olver, the Vale de Brego Congress from the PRI party.
However, this is most dangerous for the family of victims in Susan Nes.
Bradley Manning did not complain for bad treatment, claims the accused.
The accused are trying to check the statement of Bradley Manning about the bad conditions of detention.
In listening, Mannig remained in military prison in Quentico, Virginia.
Defence requires to close the case on the basis of the conditions of Mannig's arrest was cruel.
A number of United States armies are accused of appealing to thousands of secret documents.
In Friday, the accused tried to prove that a series of Bradley Manning accused of the largest loss of detention materials in the United States history did not use the numerous possibilities to complain to a bad treatment, which, as he said, had to be transferred to military prison.
During the recruitment request in Fort-Mede, the State of Maryland, the military adviser, Ashden Fein, stated that the annual visits of Manniega's representatives of the prison office for nine months of his content in the United States of Virginia had no complaints for bad treatment.
The recruitment request for the protection of Manning's case on the basis of the conditions of his arrest were cruel and in itself sufficient punishment, was carried out on the next day after Manning claimed that he was under detention, and he was able to conduct self-assault.
The military analysis specialist arrested in June 2010 was accused of investigating several thousand secret documents during the Iraqi service.
These materials were then published on the WikiLeaks website.
The WikiLeaks resurse did not confirm that the source of information was Manning.
During the hearing in Friday, the Prosecutor Fein, together with Manning, reviewed the reports filled after the visits of Manniega's representatives during his stay in the Kvantico prison, where he was at the strict condition of the arrest system from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, the officers asked Mannighu questions and recorded the answers.
When Prosecutor Fein asked the reports on Thursday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment of the prison administration was a "preventional" and the general terms of detention as a "professionally organized".
The reviewed reports do not contain complaints for bad treatment, despite the demand of Manniga directly on the conditions of his content, said Fein.
Manning answered that he had expressed a sincere concern about these problems and that his visiting representatives had discussed these issues with him and said that they would be taken, but did not fix it in writing.
"They were recording the challenges that they don't have," says Manring.
The Military judge, captain Dennis Lind, also asked Mannig why he was not complained of his injury in January 2011 during the meeting of the Commission to consider the sociaal purposes he had expressed in writing for a few months before it.
Manning said that during the meeting he wanted to be held to remove the "prevention of the trauma" and to reduce the constraint conditions.
The military leaders explained that a restricted order of conclusion was at the level below than the supervisory regime for the prevention of self-smoking was introduced for the protection of prison and for the security of others.
"I wanted to know the Administration that it's all right with me that they can delete the precaution regime... to improve my level of life, from my view," she explained.
The fourth Monning witnessed his arrest in Iraq and the translation in Kuwait, where it was contained nearly two months before he was transferred to the Military Base in Kwantico, Virginia, July 2010.
He reported that the thoughts of self-suicide appeared to him in Kuwait, and that once he lost her conscience because of a strong smile.
He explained that psychology is very hard when you don't know how your participation is, and what happens in the outside world.
"My peace welcomed Camp-Arifjan's base, to the size of my prison, said Manling on Friday.
- I thought I would die in this cell."
In Quentico, Manning, in his words, conducted a large part of a small camera, at least 21 hours, and often more than 23 hours in the slope - in full unity.
Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only maths, sleeves, sleeves, several clothes and shoes.
He said he tried to move because he was sleeping or even just sleeping in a daily time forbidden the rules.
According to Mannig, at his sleep, the light was constantly burned outside the cameras.
If the guards didn't see his face when he turned into bed at night, then, as he said, they built him and put him back to the shore.
The lawyer Manning gave official comments on the injury to Maning in January 2011.
In April 2011, Mannig moved to military prison in Fort Livenworth, Canada.
Furthermore, on Friday, the judge asked Mannig about the statement he made during the date of the statements on Friday, that after the night he was put to sleep in his camera in Kvantico, he was forced to stand low before the guards and other prisoners at the morning check.
Maning said that it was not possible to shut up during the check.
In response to the judges on Friday, Manning said that he understood the guard's command that he had to leave the shooting that could be closed, but acknowledged that no one had directly commanded him to leave him.
On Friday, Maning said that his last night had been able to sleep low because of his attempt to show the officer that he was not dangerous for himself.
Manning told the officer that he could use the skin of skin or sleepers to smile himself, but he did not.
On that night, by the witness of Mannig, his low white, sleeves and shoes took out of the camera.
His lawyers hope that, at least, the judge teaches what he had to survive during the sentence, and that it would significantly reduce the duration of the sentence if Maning is recognised by a military court that should start to consider his case at the beginning of the next year.
The defence claimed that it was planning to propose Manning to acknowledge the guilt for less serious crimes and other accusations to oppose as excessive.
The revision of the hearing planned for these weeks is expected that the accused party would expect that the terms of detention were justified.
Pentagon claims that Manning was in Quentico in accordance with the rules regulated by arrested with a maximum strict regime.
Among the accused of Manningh include the unlawful promotion of the data generation into the Internet, the transfer of information on national defence, and the defence of public property or documents.
If he is sentenced to all items of the accused act, he may threaten the life prison.
My crisis of national self-determination is the statement of the American origin of Mexico.
The author believed that many mexicans had been obliged to leave Mexico because of the absence of the possibility of implementing themselves.
Mexicans are forced to blame those who have gone because they remember the people of the country about the difficult times.
Ruben Navarette believes that the Mexicans of American origin are disrupted between two cultures.
During the recent journey in Mexico, I passed to the coastal to arrive, approached the border control zone and slowed at the location.
The signs were indicated in two directions: one for Mexico (Mexicans), second for Extranjeros (Foreigners).
I stood a few seconds before them, I don't know where to go.
I grew up in central California, and my whole life was called Mexico.
It's just a conditional name, as my friends in Boston call themselves Irlands, and friends from New York consider themselves Italians.
Then I stopped the complex construction of "Americans of Mexico."
But I was here in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather's family, there was no need for conditional names or complex constructions.
I was just a American.
I'm talking about Spanish enough to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary stock is poor than the porters of the language, and I can't get out of the American accent.
Because I got my American passport, and I was on the way to extraordinary.
I recalled this story a few days ago when the newly elected President of Mexico Enrique Peña Nito visited the White House and met President Obama.
The agenda was suitable for the meeting of the chairmans of these countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
The President of the Nieto wished to speak about the slowed Mexico economy, by which the Mexicans now, with success, will be able to stay in Mexico instead of moveing to the United States.
He wants to establish an agreement on partnership with the United States and Canada and to establish a single North American trade block for Europe.
Furthermore, President Puña Néto promised to continue the war against drug carriage in Mexico, but no specific proposals had been made.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is a heavy and old issue.
Most Americans never thought that in 1848, the United States had entered Mexico, and in the duty of expenditure, its leaders rejected the half of their territory.
But the Mexicans think about centuries, not in minutes, and see the memories of those events all over.
Thus only one of the US State acts should be called on a word of criticism to the side of Mexico, in press and among the elites of the Mexican society there is a complaint that the Americans are on the sovereignty of neighbourhood.
The Montesum posts are inherited by militaryity.
The most complex of the relationships in Mexico with more than 35 million Americans in the United States.
Do you want to talk about both?
They're enough.
There are winners and losses in Mexico, people who find themselves in this country, and those who do not have such opportunities.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Fenicos, Denver or San Antonio, there were so many people in Mexico for just one reason: at any time, their family history, a father or a grandfather, had not been able to realize themselves in Mexico and was sent to the north.
It was more than the Mexicans of a certain type of sweet, low-formed, from poor creature families.
We're their descendants, and we remember this.
It's not otherwise in Mexico.
Today our life is the involvement of the American dream, we learned in good schools and made good work, but we don't forget that even this dream is American, not Mexico.
Our national self-determination is unexpected, but we know what country to consider.
United States.
We also know that most of the representatives of Mexico ' s Elite and the rule of the class do not love us.
We answer them the same thing.
They see in us the reminder of low-related struggles and relate to us as people in the second shore, as the hate Mexicans.
We are inadequate well speaking in Spain, and our relationship with Mexico is not sufficiently strong.
Our own existence is explained by the failures.
If our priests were successful in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
We wouldn’t have been for a strict weakness, found in the United States, but lost spiritual links.
My wife was born to Guadalahara and was legally moved to the United States in a child, and this reminds me that between the actual Mexicoians and the Americans of Mexico's origin there are some trains - the Mexicoans clearly understand their national identity, and the Americans of Mexico's origin are both different.
It is the United States citizen and believes that it belongs to these two countries.
At the same time, many of my known Americans in Mexico do not feel belonging to any of them.
We listen to the Mexican group of Los Tigres del Nord, but we love Bruce Springstin.
If you're better in two worlds, you're going to lose the roots inevitablely.
We are Americans in Mexico.
And in the United States, we're called mexicans.
Now, as I explained during my travel, as if our relationship is uncomfortable, some Mexico leaders and intellectors want to restore the relationship with the diaspor.
They want the Americans to work with their type of mexican senders and to represent the interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends what this beautiful country is and how well it is to visit, and we could convince political leaders to strengthen the connection with Mexico.
Yeah, of course.
Nothing's going out.
A lot of dinners in the past.
And taking into account the disruption between the rich and the poor, corruption and drug trafficking, many of us have not seen that country as such.
I'm sorry, but let's go with this, Mr. Migos.
And it's just.
If a part of the Mexicans is still not to forgive the United States as they have done with Mexico a half-century century ago, they must also take the fact that some mexican Americans still have been dinnerly as they have recently met with their parents in Mexico.
Yeah.
I think we've got more common than I thought.
Old battles in the New East
The agreement on the end of the fire between Israel and the group of Hamas may be a smooth foundation for a further world
Is a long-term peace between the Arabs and the Israelites in the Middle East?
The ordinary round of bloodproliferation underlines the conclusion of such hopes.
It seems that the first one who begins; the many buildings are ruined; more than 140 Palestinian murders, most of which were civilians, and six Israelites; in the first place of the conflict from the Gaza Sector, the Rakettes slaughtered in the neighbors of the capital of Tel Aviv and the sacred city of Jerusalem.
However, although the Israelites and Palestinians were uncertainly linked to their eternal conflict, changes came to the Middle East.
This could be a rare, but the events of " Arab early" have been loaded in a swimming snack of many realities, and the Palestinians with the Israelites were not able to remain in the side of the swimming region.
They may be more bloodproliferated than previously.
However, there are reasons that give hope to get out of this mortal tube.
War without winners
First of all, the situation is not a way for optimism.
Even if the stopping of the fire, which was signed on 21 November, will be implemented, which only strengthened the positions of both sides.
The leaders of the Islamic movement of Hamas, who had arrived to the Gaza sector in 2007, claim that they were forced to abandon Israel, despite their losses.
Despite some group leaders have been destroyed, and 1.7 million people were blocked in one of the most ruined and problems of our planet, Israel could not destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas encourages its popularity in the western Jordan River to be another Palestinian territories controlled today by Fatch’s more dead movement.
Furthermore, the leaders of Hamas may find that time is working for them.
The influence of Islamic movements in the Arab world in Hamas is newly influenced and rich friends.
The resurrected regional leader of Turkey, who had ever been the closer partner of Israel among the musulman countries, has supported Hamas; the example of Catar, one of the most rich and dynamicly developing States of the Persia.
The traders of Hamas will declare the establishment of a Islamic Mediterranean around Israel from Lebanon to the north in which the armed group of Hezborla ruled to Syria, where the more Islamic forces there are going to revoke the power of Bashar Asad, and further to Jordan, where the king's authorities are threatening Hamas' Unions.
The worst change of the balance of forces in the region has occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most gorgeous and important Arab country, in Egypt, where President Mohammed Mursey has strengthened the influence of the movement of Brotheria-Musulman.
Hosni Mubarak, who was the Egyptian rule for 30 years and was rejected in 2011, was a light dictator who had not given special attention to Hamas' support.
Instead, there are many organizations like Hamas, and their leaders are more strict to popolism.
The future diplomatic distances of Hamas may be a significant player whose voice will not be able to silence even Israel and America.
At the same time, the "floor" lines in Israel will come to contradictional conclusions.
Hamas was returned in military terms.
The Israeli anti-food system justified the costs of its creation and successfully destroyed many of the Hamas Raket.
The people of Israel may sleep peacefully at least some time.
With regard to the diplomacy, the United States remained faithful to their non-smooth position; many European countries also have condemned the last round of violence in Hamas.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, especially in the Government of Benjim Nayanjahu, which significantly ignored the peace process.
Despite about 30 Israelites died from the missiles issued from the Gaza Sector since 2004, Israel was able to address the minimum problem of the mortal terrorists, in part by the wall that is in the western Jordan River, a significant part of the unaccepted Palestinian State, and to protect the Jewish populations that continue to expand unless such acts are unlawful with international legislation.
The position of Prime Minister Neanjahu, whose party Liquod, in the preparation for the elections on 22 January, has joined with more aggressively established conservators under the direction of Abigail Liberman.
What is the purpose of creating Palestinians and giving them a own State?
If they give all authority to the Western coast, will they start start starting the missiles from the side of Israel, as they do their meetings in the Gaza sector?
It's better to keep them behind the wall and to make any attempt to get up the heads.
The "low" lines may be winned, but their calculations may be checked in the Arab Breakfast.
While the Islamics who are at the power of Egypt and other countries experience the warmest feelings of Israel, their priority will become internal problems.
The protective part of the Israeli budget is more than all its Arab neighbors, together.
The linking of war with the regional superdefence does not help the Governments of the Arab countries to strengthen their economy.
The Pragmaticism of the President of Egypt, Murcy, who worked together with Barack Obama on the stopping of the fire, is a well-known knowledge and may be marked at the beginning of the change.
Israel must take into account the long-term consequences of its policy.
During the invasion of democratic changes in the Arab countries, the extinction of Palestinian rights to self-determination is a bomb of breathing action that is soon or later on the occupied Israeli territories, such as a bus in the Tel Aviv on that week.
Representations are already undermined by the basis of democratic order in the Jewish State, and the demographic aspect of the growth of the Arab population is only to affect these problems.
Blood operations carried out every few years in the Gaza Sector for Hamas movement should be paid to the growing deficiency of the international community.
Both parties need an external impulse
The only decision to which healthy representatives from both sides and the large part of the rest of the world and our newspapers remains: education of two States and income of the Israeli territory in exchange of security.
The hope remains not too short-term perspective - hope that the stopping of fire allows other countries to influence conflict sides more effectively.
Egypt, which has long decided to reverse the disposal of weapons in the Gaza sector, and Turkey and Qatar, as ever a positive position to convince Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish State adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of the Territories and the joint use of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile the movements of Hamas and Fatch.
This would be more to create a Palestinian State than the next vote in the United Nations, which could result in the recognition of the virtual state of Palestinian.
It is a role that Israel should play in the negotiations table, as well as President Obama.
During his first time, he did not present his own plan of peace-resolution.
After returning to the White House, he continues to demonstrate the desire to join this problem.
This is a disastrous position.
The United States are vitally interested in stability in the Middle East.
This may only be possible in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians.
In Australia, the Cigarette pack has entered into force.
The warnings of smoking and images of infected parts of the body are contracted to the unique green boxes that are equal to all smokemarks.
The First World Practices of the Australian Republic of Sigara and Tahiti has entered into force by replaceing logotypes and the color of the different color marks of the same olive tree with the shocked paintings of the body and images of children whose health has been smokeed by their parents.
Besides different pictures and descriptions that warn to smoke, the only difference between the packages that are obliged to do with this Sabbath is the name of the brand printed by a single small font.
These are the most disgusting conditions in the world to make the packaging of tasting items.
The Federal Government states that the aim of this action is to keep young ones from smoking, with the lack of the harmful attraction of moderate status.
In the light of this decision, the results of research shown that people who have not been smoking up to 26 years have never been in 99 cases of 100 and never become smokers.
" Of course, even in the age of the young, children understand the meaning that are trying to bring card companies through the packaging", explains the Minister for Health of Tana Plyberseth, referring to the studies that show that, for example, the root in the lóotipe associates children with the ideas of the princess.
Australia is one of the least world-level countries, so that these changes are not particularly indicated for the arrival of transnational corporations, but the possibilities of such measures are already considered.
Tahiti industry representatives have intensified the adoption of this law.
Taxi companies claim that it will only increase the share of the black market, which will be sold for sweet and available cigarettes.
“This law will lead to serious consequences that are different from those who have been planned by his initiativers,” says Scott Macintoir, representative of the British American Tobacco company in Australia.
Detailed product producers from China and Indonesia will provide much more goods for sales on the streets of Australia.
Instead, new laws contribute to the growth of business.
Sandra Ha from the small family company of Zico Import Pty Ltd states that the demand for ports and silicon flights that cover packed paintings, which have grown intensely (praktically from zero) since two months ago, since the company such as British American Tobacco, the British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan, were trying to condemn the case in the high court of Australia, where they tried to condemn the law.
According to Sandra Ha, the company of Zico has already performed the order of six thousand businesses and expected a new party.
It's a good business for us.
The potential position for the effectiveness of such measures is, in the view of experts, the population of social networks among the part of the population to which these measures are aimed.
After the adoption of a number of laws made by the illicit television advertising and supporting the sports events in Australia, as well as for prohibited sellers to put cigarettes on a visible place, the Twitter advertising moved to the Internet.
The Australian Government has prohibited local companies and websites to place an advertising in the network, but it could not be limited to the local sites.
"If you're buying taxi items and you have only this small lace, the idea of moving your products in the Internet is shown to you very strictly", explains Becky Flickman, who investigates public health issues at the University of Sidney.
The French notes the increase in commercial reviews written by people as normal users, in social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
Is this really the case of a band citizen who loves Marlboro's smokes that did not have the strength and time and made a video, or the public company?
The Australian Office of British American Tobacco claims that there is more adjustment in the area than the advertising.
The Tavian Industry representatives have even taken measures such as the shocking of Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to observe new rules: these States provide claims within the framework of the World Trade Organization, claiming that trade has been unfair, despite the trade relations with all these countries with Australia are very poor.
WTO decision is expected to be midnight of 2013.
According to Tany Plyberseth, the Government has discussed the possibility of adopting similar packaging laws with other countries.
In 2001, Canada introduced the first binding of photos that warned the damage of smoke.
This has now been adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of renovation of laws is considered in Britain, New Zealand, Southern and India.
Many smokers in Australia have not been demonstrated by new information.
These paintings aren't me.
I just don't care.
"Increasing smoke and hiding a cup in the carman," explains Victor El Haeg, who buys smokes with the photos of the swimming pocket.
Really, the only thing I can let me leave is my little daughter.
James You, who purchases the Royal of the Pack in the city of Sidney, argued that the same package has complicated the task of a range of field goods
"I've got the time to download the new party, and now four hours," he regrets.
"The relationship was to take and prohibite the smoke, then we would say, "Oke, all over, we'll close the shop," he says, shooting up the hands up.
Disabled electronic networks and permanent connections in the world is not so bad.
On that day of gratitude, I was unexpectedly to take five hours to the airport, because our aircraft has found mechanics and replaced it by another flight we were expected.
So, I had enough time to think about the nature of the shock.
I'm not gonna lie you.
The half day in the race airport is really sweet, and there is no great help to help any books, magazines, iPhones, or even the shopping of free trade.
However, recently, more scientists and child development experts have been expressed in use of shock.
They say that in some situations, we and our children are not too bad.
This requires the brain to react to the interesting rare topics that may contribute to creature.
And because we are all constantly present in the modern world before some screen, the advantages of the shoes are on us.
Maybe we need to try a shock?
Yeah.
Not at the same time.
We'll be back to that.
Before I, as many, thought that a shock is a discovery of recent times when people were more free.
That's not true, Peter Tui, Professor of Greek and Roman History of the Canada University, author of the book "Scake History" (Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011).
"Indeed, the sweet can be very excited, " says he.
In Pompei’s walls, the Latin subscriptions on the shoes were found in the first century.
This remains an open question of how we understand the shock.
The problem is, says John D. Yud, the advocate of the University of New York in Ontario, Canada, that the understanding and vision of the crowd has often changed.
He studied research materials on this topic and asked the target group of 100 people, Professor Yeed and his colleagues came to the following definition: "The crazy is when people want, but they can't care for what would be satisfied."
The difference between smells and pharmacies, he says, is that a laughing person does not do anything that he wants to do.
I don't want to do anything in the aptee.
The main thing in the shock, he says, is "the breach of attention and related to the deterioration of the attitude and feeling that time is slowly."
The description of the skin may be very similar to the depression.
However, Professor Edad claims that, despite the possible relationship between these situations, people suffering the cause of problems in the environment and circumstances, and people who are depressing have a problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're weak when we really are simply focused on something.
In its study “Inconsistent thought: the definition of skins with regard to attention” published in the September magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, professor of Geographic and colleagues refer to the previous experiment that the participants listened to the record of the magazine.
One party also heard the sounds not related to the case of the television program in the neighbourhood, others heard the same sounds in low volume, so that the third group had been identified, and the third group was only listening to the record of the voice without a multilateral sound route.
The participants who heard television at a low-level level noted that they were sweet, most of them were difficult to concentrate, but they did not know the reasons of it and recorded this shock.
When we are trying to focus on the difficult or encouraging challenges, the stopping of the attention may cause a shock, Marc J. Fenske, the non-professor adviser at the University of Guelf, Ontario, and one of the authors of this study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteressant, "for example, in the flow of shipping shops in the search of marriage, the slightest music can help to avoid shocks."
It seems that, when people start to break on the table or draw a carcasse on a paper, they do it from a shoe, but now we know that these actions are actually helping not to slow up physically.
"The survey showed that children who do not prohibit to strike and return are learning better and forgetting more information than children from whom they need to sit silently," says Professor Fensk.
At some time, we all experience a shock: at the delay of the race (such as in my case), listening to the monotone speech, sharing an uninterested movie.
However, different people demonstrate a variety of tendency to shock.
In the 1980s, researchers have developed a special "scale-scale" measurement for such individual characteristics.
To determine such assessment, the questions and approximation are used, for example, "My of the things I have to do in a similar and monotony" or "I'm too interested, so there is no time to do."
For such investigators, they determined that the boys are more lacking of girls, says Steven Wondanov, psychiatologist at the University of Western Florida, especially in the existence of different external destructors.
However, in general, adolescents are very often missing.
In 1991, Mr. Rid Larson, professeur of personal and public development at the University of Illinois, performed an experiencing in which he had linked with the peer almost 400 adolescents and their parents 7-8 times a day.
He received the following results: 32 per cent of adolescents claimed that they were missing at school and during the home task, and 23 per cent claimed that they were missing beyond schools.
Only 3 per cent of the parents noted that they were disappointed.
Professor Larson notes that he has no data on the same data on shock now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that “the age of adolescents is the skin of shocking, ” mainly because children and adolescents do not allow to decide what to be taken.
Let's go back to my original question: is it useful?
Sometimes, because in extreme evidence, such as research shows, it may entail people to absorptive and dangerous physical action, risk-free games, or misuse of certain substances in trying to be eliminated from shock.
On the other hand, many philosophs and writers thought about the relationship between the stomach and the creature, says Professor Vadanov, who has dedicated the study of this problem over two decades.
"That our brain shows us that we should take something else; that's a shock," says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But this brain is not always aware of what is better to take.
If you'll be sweet and you'll send this energy to a guest game or a culinary experience, you'll make yourself better.
But if you're going to look at the television, you'll be better at some time, and soon.
So if your child laughs and you give him iPad, he stops missing, but he won't learn to fight with a smooth selfish or any other way to manage his time and employment, says Professor Finnske.
"And such abilities are undergoing in the most different situations, " he said.
Your child learns not only to do something, but he also learns self-control.
I don't think a shooting needs to be shipped.
However, it is not necessary to consider her something bad.
It should be learned to feel comfortable even without an unprecedented flow of action and technologies.
Professor Yud agrees with this.
"We see this, that we need to try more, while the shock is a very unpleasant, unautomated desire to take something out of mind," he says.
In fact, people are trying to dismiss from permanent concerns and simply relax.
"In the modern world, we're attracted to the excessive stimulation of the feelings, "and when it comes to calm, we're losing and don't know what to do."
Even unreasonable how the new marihuana legalization law will be applied in the State of Kolorado
Antony Orosco, the nine-year-old football team game and the student of the public college in the South-East of Colombia, are accused of promoting a criminal crime that will soon be enforced on the entire territory of the State: the storage of a small portion of marihuana and piles in which he smokeed it.
Mr. Orosco said that one day in September he was with friends in Lamare and went to a car near the border with Kansas when the police stopped.
After the police has found in the marihuana car, Mr. Orosco came to the court for the safeguard of drugs and possession of drugs, a small criminal offence for each of which the cost of $100 and the date of the judiciary was set.
"We're going to be like criminals," says Mr. Osco.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of non-determination that has been continued a few weeks after the State of Kolorado proclaimed for the legitimation of the use of marihuana in small quantities to dilute, the decision of hundreds of small judicial cases depends on the law of the place of review.
Infringements in small crimes related to marihuana have already been taken in hundreds of cases here and in Washington State, which has taken similar measures.
Police officers have already stopped embarrassing people under the age of 21 and older than the slaughter, which would be considered legally only after a couple of weeks.
However, in more conservative circles, the accusers decided to consider the existing matters related to marihuana and continue to be responsible for the safeguard of the drug.
At the same time, in some cities from Denver's rewards to the Western mountains, they vote to not allow new marketing in their places, authorized by the state of marihuana.
"I don't even know what to wait for further," says Daniel J. Outs, the police chief in the city of Aurora, on the east of Denver.
Representatives of the supervisory bodies in Washington, Washington, are also grateful to the heads.
It should be set up a rules to determine the licences for enhancement, processing, dissemination and sale of marihuana, and it must be done until 1 December 2013.
They say that Colombia, well or badly, is a majority of other states in solving marihuana matters, first in medical purposes and now to disfellowship.
"In the Colombian market, therefore they are a good example," explains Brian I. Smith, representative of the Production Board and Success of Alcohol Production in Washington State.
But now nobody can do more, recognize Mr. Smith than making any proposal and hope that it works.
"We don't have the actual precedence to which we could go," he says.
The Washington State Project, called I-502, shall enter into force on 6 December and the whole year of the state of incertitude when there is no public licensing system and the right to rule of marijuana is already legal.
There are still insufficient technical aspects that must be determined in this period, such as the equality between the allocation of the state of "adequate access" to the authorized marihuana with prohibition to trade in it at 1000 feet from school, parks, game gardens and children's gardens.
" It will be very difficult to place licences for marihuana trade undertakings in the city in particular in Seattle and its rewards," explains Ben Livingstone, representative of the recently established research group " Centre for Marihuana's Legalization".
On November 21, Outs police chief from Aurora dismissed his sub-e-mail message that the city's prosecutor will no longer be affected by the age of 21, to the ownership of the small number of marihuanas, and that the police stops to eliminate people in violations of the "prior to that time".
The Police Officer Ottos reported that the police would monitor the compliance with the cities of the rules regulating the activities of marihuana for medical purposes, and would follow illicit traffickers and drug distributors.
The Prosecutor of Wald, northern Collardo, Ken Back, represents a more strict approach to this issue.
After the vote on the draft legislation, he stated that the prosecution would continue to be responsible for the possession of the marihuana, mainly to encourage its users to visit the treatment course.
At this time, 119 persons have been accused of guarding two and less marihuana units, although many of them are accused of other violations.
"The obligation of our institutions to follow the acts that are considered criminals at the time of their accomplishment," said Mr. Buck in his statement.
The reaction was noted even in places such as the rural district of Mes, where the voters rejected the proposal for the legitimation of the marihuana.
The police of Gran Janckhn, the largest city in the neighbourhood, no longer affects the responsibilities for the possession of a small number of drugs.
The surrounding Prosecutor Pit Haatzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to take up the accused of the open cases related to the marijuana conservation.
"I think that to ensure the compliance of the law until it changes is our direct responsibility," he said.
Despite the 55 per cent of the people of the Colombian State who participated in the vote, this decision supported, the use of marihuana to dismiss the public and legal system will not be simple.
The anti-oriented reaction of the people in different states has resulted in the uncertainty of the relationship between local authorities to the experience of the state of marijuana.
"In the environmental prosecutors there is a cultural barrier in this issue," explains Shaw McAllister, a Dunkel attorney who represents the interests of the judges for the storage of marihuana and the local representative of the National Organization for the reform of marihuana laws.
"They have persecuted people so long for it, that now they can't be dealt with the fact that it is no longer a crime," he says.
Colombia and Washington are the first states in which the small number of marihuanas relate to alcohol are convicted to be an experimental field in the country's levels to check the ideas of drug legialization.
Participants of the State ' s legitimacy and officials plan to expand the territory of the legitimated trade, but at the same time they are waiting for indications from the federal authorities that are still planned to consider the sale and enhancement of marihuana as federal crimes.
Participants are hoped that marihuana legalization should be addressed to this issue.
Despite a number of numerous detention arrests of trade and patients using marihuana for medical indications, the Federal Government, mostly granted goods to trade marijuana for medical purposes in Colombia, Washington and 16 other states.
The Officers of the Drug Control Office would not be in the home to conflict a small marihuana package, but they would have to close their eyes to the regulated authorities of the State of the Registration Margin, which were authorized under the new law, believe Kevin A. Savat, former drug advisor in the Administration of Obama.
Some towns in Colombia have not been expected to be taken by federal authorities.
Before the presidential elections, some local administrations approved moratories for opening new marihuana sales, which could not be opened before a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the west of the state, has issued six-month ban on trade in marijuana, which will be approved by the next week.
"We don't want to make such a condition that we give a license and then solve serious problems at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our city was proclaimed against this amendment.
And now we have an opposition between the results of the local vote and what the State has declared.
There are still many indecisive issues.
Peter Wyatt: I survived from Oxford because I was a conservator.
The persecution of university students for their views has not been today.
As far as I remember, I was always dreaming to do at the Oxford University.
My father and the older brothers studied in Oxford and described it as the best in the world, the modern analysis of anti-sympos, which set two basiss of civilization, the freedom of thinking and patience.
However, two weeks later, I gathered the university of the Western University University at the end of the eighteenth, and I went out of the chain, and I went out of the first real scanner in my life.
My dad didn't smell and smell.
The friends were shocked from the point.
The Evening Standard stated that I left a college because I didn't like my colleagues in their neighborhood.
The writer E. Norman Wilson shouted that I was gone because I had to drink out of the shoes.
It wasn't really nice.
I'm gone.
Yeah, I ran because I was systematically hurted and threatened.
It's not because of my very innocent name or what I've learned at a private school.
I was blessed only because of one reason, and in this glorified colleague of education this seemed to be a real barbar and a blind fanaticm: my father, who is now dead, was known as the Margaret Tatcher, and I was the partner of the conservators.
You're wondering why you can remember this now?
According to the latest data, the new generation of students with the right-century views is the same trauma.
This institutional and continuously growing hate to conserve students in Oxford was so strong that in the past week, such students needed the same protection of their rights as those of persons with disabilities, sexual and ethnic minorities.
College Conservators in Cambridge, Scientific College of Corpus Christy, stated that they "will be actively disfellowshipped, make personal attacks and make feeling unexpected guests" because of their political views.
They wish to introduce the Committee on Equal Rights of the Additional Representative in order to ensure the freedom of expression of their view.
Their situation was only injured recently at BBC 2 by a documentary film on the Strange: Youth, Intelligence and Rights, which presented experts and non-onicists.
The film showed Joe Cook, former President of the Oxford University Conservator Association, which is traveling to Rolls Royce, has a golden skin and three with a golden snare.
In other universities, conservator students are regretting that they do "cockles of displacement because of increased educational payments".
Luke Blake, a 20-year-old Vice-President of the Association of the Conservators of the University of Nottingham, said in an interview that "the university environment increases the transaction of the left views.
Those who don't even know us, they've previously considered us naked and unbelievable children of rich parents."
Samuel Roberts, 21-year-old student of the historical College of Corpous Christi, in which a request for protection has been made, calls for such an "natural" atmosphere, and Stephen Cheryl, 19-year-old, the new President of the Oxford University Consistent Association, said that the relationship of members of the student club to the mediators of the orthotoxic views was significantly worried.
"This represents a threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual discussion and just for the normal life of club members," says she.
The first few weeks in Oxford I wasn't just a minority, I was alone.
I did there in September 1986, a work and an intimate 18 - year - old girl.
Oxford was disappointed from hate to the conservative party.
For the year before that, the university left a former student, Margaret Tatcher, as a result of the reduction of budget allocations for higher education.
In that atmosphere it would be uncomfortable even graduates.
In the first week of the first week, when the students met each other and the publishers, I first felt what I was waiting for.
I didn't even know that the suppliers were not only looking at the threshold of the containers, but also joyfully participated in it.
Political matters — the exquisite of shatters, privacy and inconvenience of Governments to approve sanctions against the Government of the Apartheid in South Africa — have been circled by wooden walls of auditors.
At my first seminar, I had to transfer the French text to English on the eighth century, and I was not ready to follow it.
"Ms. Waitt, I said the speaker, right now, Harry Petet, - please move the first paragraph."
The text made me work, I saw it.
Harry Pete was a very weird man with a face like a ball.
"Technicists do not teach French or just lack of brain?" asked he.
Other students were protected.
I have laughed at my eyes.
"I call you to take a few of the main lessons of French in a free time if you're not very busy, turning into society," said Peter.
I returned to my room very unfortunately.
On that night in the college, I sit for one dinner, and then somebody shocked me on my shoulder.
This was James, a second student from the English School, represented as a member of the university Conservator Association.
"I know who you are," he said friendly.
- Unfortunately, the case will be as follows:
Each person who suspects in the symptoms will be disappointed.
It's hard to me, and in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Tatcher, because you're gonna be more difficult.
The majority of the Conservators' primary works that they are labourists."
Afterward, I tried to hide.
I insisted that it was not agreed to all that Margaret Tatcher says.
He's not able to get a smooth.
The first one of the Philosophics, policies and economics, who had learned in Ethan, said, "You're the daughter of a fasist pork.
You're ridiculous."
Other students had his words.
I was sweet, sweet.
I asked one of them.
- They're collecting one another, right?
I felt like the homosexuality should have felt before the abolishment of criminal persecution in the sixty-year years.
Will I ever have a normal life in Oxford?
Or am I supposed to meet the one-industry only under the shoe of the night?
Would I have to be a library and to hide my real beliefs?
The next three years of my life began to appear to be a damn, a full torment and a singleness.
The only provider in my colleague, who didn't hide its conservative views, was Norman Stone, Professor of modern history.
He was hated not only for the conservators but also because he was a Tetcher for Foreign Policy and one of her specialists.
He did not appear in the college.
He expressed it for the provinceality, vulnerability and commitment to the history of Marxists and Determinists.
In 1997, he adopted a professional position at the University of Billkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not gonna be happy," he said to me.
I started traveling to Oxford from London’s parent house, trying to find a refugee among my parents and unprecedented capital friends.
I told her that I hate Oxford and explained why.
He didn't believe me.
There were any political views during his education in 40 years.
"But it's the best university in the world," he said condemnably.
- It's not possible, not only in the city of a long-term...
Even my Communist friends always turned themselves unfortunately."
His powerful eyes were remembered.
"Do not take slow decisions.
I'm sure it's just a bitch.
You will make me a heart if you leave the university."
I was dismissed permanent travels in London and my emotional protection was weak.
My friend, also the conservator, did not hold pressures and rejected his confidence.
The next week, during the seminar, when the ordinary history predictor was very seriously called me “the enemy of the people”, I decided to do the same.
In the heart of the wound, I acknowledged that the brain of the parents was cut into, and called them "the old fools."
It's been a long breakfast.
The last shooting in my carrière in Oxford was condemned to forget my father.
At that time, he wrote every week on two columns for the publications belonging to Rupert Merdoku.
My door was locked.
I didn't get out, and five minutes later, my persecutors have come.
When they went out, I gathered the chain and village on the first train to London.
I haven't come back.
You can call me a plax and a pocket.
However, in the 18 years, no one should be an object of such abuse and threatening in training.
It was more painful that it was Oxford, not only the fourteen Prime Ministers of Tori, but it is also hidden for the unfair reputation of the university, in which it apprecies the equality and freedom of mind.
"Valentely prefers the elegance of glory."
On the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Shie" opened this week in London, ABC contacts Nata Abaskal, Fiona Tissen-Bornemia and other famous Italian designer
Somerset-Haus, the former Representative of the British Queen of Elizabeth I, the only place in the British capital, has the right to take a statement on Valentino Haravani.
The designer acknowledged that during the opening of the Valentino: Master of Shia, a triumphal retrospective exhibition, which combines more than 130 plates of high mode created by his "home" over the last 50 years.
"I am afraid of this walve," he says with his incredible Italian actor.
This exhibition is a final part of the history, which is the only person of Haravany, but it could not be written without his named customers.
Valentino has always felt a slight and far-reaching world of knowledge.
In the first room of this exhibition, open to 3 March, the personal letters and photos for the signature of the most famous aristocratics, from the princess of Salma Ya-Haan to Lord Snowson, including Mari-Santal, Prince of Greece, and Margaret, the prince of Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as a trofey of their social submission: from a modest port from the city of Volgar to the north of Italy to the shore of the international "Elite".
If you're loved in the king's garden, it's nothing bad.
"They wouldn't have the sigarettes on your magnificent copper like it makes some beautiful pop stars," says Phioon Tissen-Bornemia.
In the 1960s and 70s we lived both in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an unpleasant guest and takes guests with generosity and eligibility.
"We all liked to come to his chalet in Gustaveda," explains the former wife of Hanny, Tissen, close to a friend of forgotten beauty like Maryla Anselly or Eugenda Nicarhos.
Valentino always prefered the glory.
In spite of this, he's a star.
Valleria Mazza, represented by Valentino
The Argentinian Valeria Machz model remembers the charistical model.
One time we went to dinner with him home, that was after the showing of the Spain area in Rome, many years ago.
Among the twenty-five guests were Sheron Stone and John Kenndy the young one.
The Valentino style showed in all details of his apartment, its burning, food, music.
"Anyone of the Valentino guests gave himself an important and loved one," recalls the "pot model", which was working with the model that began in 1995 during the week of the high-modern in Paris.
"He never goes out of the mode, because his excavations are the real arts."
Parents
The life of Haravani is not the story of receiving, but of love with full mutuality.
He loves people with good education and high titles, and they love him.
One of the Somerseet-haus gallery was converted into a glumir subside of sixty meters long that offers a change of role: a visitor has a model place and must be defiled by the shoes of the "shirt" from the shoes of the Valentino, such as the material chosen by Jacklin Kennedy for his marriage with Aristour Elassis, a cocktail used by the Monicat in New York, or a shirt of the shoes and shoes that belonged to the Fabra.
These are names such as Sybilla Luxemburg, the Gloria von Turn umund Taxis, Mete-Marrit from Norwegia, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofia Gabsburg.
Nata Abascar and Model, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is as the first love, "not possible to forget."
I remember it's beautiful.
These were shoes, shoes, eyelets and shoes from the colleagues of August 1971-1972.
"It was a gift he made me," says Nati Abascar, one of the designer museum.
"I want to read him for his wife, for his great love to women, because he emphasizes our beauty," adds the former hero de Feriah.
I like the color he uses: there's a lot of light and they're going to his face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and Patricia's Model Law of Jovampaol d'Arenberg can also forget the first time to get in Valentino.
When I was adolescent and lived in Italy, I dreamed that I would have a age and a behaviour for one of his evening toilets...
Finally, that time came at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first bathroom from Valentino to get him to the feast in my cousin, Prince Eduard de Line.
It was a red kitchen with a swimming swimming pool, a shock in the kitchen, and a shock without a bracelet.
"It was a dream that makes an appearance," says the widow Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentely equal to mode, his suffering is immediate," explains this Italian aristocratic, who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Island.
Princess D. Allenberg keeps his holiday payments from the model with the "maximal care... because it's not just a loan, and it's also a counterparty of the rememorations with him."
"Roll" Model
The large finance of the exhibition in Somerseet-Haus is a married marital Mari-Santal Miller for her marriage with Paul from Greece in 1995.
There were four months of work, and 25 "fidders" (which calls their swimming model) to prepare this swimming corner with the integration of a swimming snake, twelve species of different rounds and slayf in four to half meters.
According to the journalist Susan Menquez, the largest authority of the specialized press, the payment represents a high mode of the end of the XX century, “Return of customers from highlight”.
The many years of the "life style" of elite, and now Valentino is its best representative.
Cavaler of the Great Crist (the difference of the highest morning in Italy), Cavaler of the work, Ordered Arts and Wordness commanded by the Order of the Covenant Legion, Haravani collected the same respect as any of his customers.
"All my attention has touched him, his calmness, his attractive and unforeseen external kind," reminds D. Arenberg.
The last time I saw him a month ago at the Traditional dinner at the Museo Orce.
He sit on the table with my big friend Jacklin de Ribe graph.
"He was unconscious, time is not for him."
If that's the princess...
The worst professional in the world: Kawah Yyena chatters
For four euros, the Indonesian shatters risk life and health by slowing 70 kilograms of snakes on the top of the volcano by the great stone traces
There are people for whom their work is a god, and others are literally working in the idols.
Among them, Anto Vijaya, one of the 400 shatters who are acquired for the lives of the rebuilding snake in the Kawa-Idjan volcano, situated in the east of the Indonesian island of Yava.
Each day, Anto spends on the slowest day, where the greenhouse gas that is slow from the depth of the Earth is late in contact with the air.
He puts the large pieces of seals, which can be reached by 70 kilograms, in two bamboog corners, slows the corners on the shoe and puts them up on the shooting stone road.
To the top of the volcan, which is 2,386 metres, only 250 metres, but the shipping loaders need more than 40 minutes to get up to a stronger step, to keep equality and carefully shocked the road, so that they are not shocked or shocked.
They know that one invalid step could stand on them, as happened by one of the tourists from France, who had shooted a few years ago from the Kavah-Yegin skale.
Cavah-Yegin Shatters pay five euros for every kilogram of the series
On the top, they take the road between tourists that they are pictured as if they were sicks from the circle and swimming hard corners, stepped up three kilometers up to weight that the swimming company has put up at a height of 1,850 meters above.
It is about PT Candy Ngrimby, an undertaking which has been exploited by this volcan since 1960, and is better and not to say that its employees pay 662 Indonesian rupes (5 euros) for each kilogram.
Then it is sold for 10,000 rubbers (83 euros) to the non-technological production, since it is used to distribute a daily life and to produce spheres, feverages, spaces, dinamits, and even to coal.
" As the standard is 70 kilograms, we pay around 46.000 rubbers (3.8 euros) for each shop", explains Anto, which usually performs three daily transfers.
He costs three hours for each of them and finally feels disappeared, but allows it to cover 138.000 rubbers (11.5 euros) to the end of the day.
Although this seems to be an inhuman effort, it is three more than he would pay.
" The daily payment to shatters is very high in local measures where the coffee collects $1,2 million per day and average is equal to two million roofs (167 euro) " , explains the loader who had previously worked as a stone in the Tourist Island of Bali.
There was 75,000 rules (6,2 euros) in the day and in the area, but Anto returned with his family in Baniwanga, a town near the volcano, because of the wine reason that Indonesia was the same destructive as a series: "I married a girl with Bali, where ones of the Indians, and brought her to Yavu to accept the Islam."
In Anto Asthma, he's breathing with work, constantly smells, and he's shocking the eyes because of toxic gases.
In its 27 years, Anto carried out three years of risk in Cavah Yyene, whose series had already started to refer to it, despite the existing mass and special views.
He's got a asthma, he's breathing with work, constantly smells, and he's shocking out the eyes because of the toxic gas that produces vulcanic.
This is the price he must pay for the achievement of his dreams.
"I'm working for more than two years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises for more than accepted English.
A life-in-law that young man could be a turist guide, officer or portal in the hotel, but instead of doing the mura work.
For a sweet tree hair with other transporters, he stands up every day at two hours at night, because the snake is not stopping out at night when its natural sweet color becomes blue and listy among the smells.
The swimming calls to the tens, Anto goes into the board, spending on the road of a small background bound to his castle, which he himself purchased for his money.
About 400 portraits snake a snake on their skins with the skin of volcan
In spite of high arrives, the shipholder did not mechanize the serial for the cost of the economy and does not provide any equipment for transporters working on their own account and with such punishment.
In fact, they do not even receive parts of the $30,000 rule (2.5 euros) of a photo collection that, along with the incoming ticket (1.2 euros), the guards of the commander have been taken from tourists who are coming to photograph Vulcan and its men.
"This work is for the crops, not for the people," says Badrusin, a 42-year-old portal, who has been conducted in Kavah Yyene for three decades since he left the college.
It is possible to up to 110 kilograms, and he believes that it will suffer the work " so much as possible " because he needs money to educate his three children from 18 to 10 years of age.
I'm not going to the pension, I'll die here, because the vulcan is my whole life.
While the snake smells and eats the eye when the wind switchs immediately and shoots in the fleshly pillars of the houses that come out of the volcano, they were so exacerbated that no one was complained of their heavy diseases... more seriously, obviously, more seriously than their adverse problems with breathing, arthrosis, pain in collines and skins on the skins that were deformed under the gravity of the corn.
The balance of the skin corn, the Olympic can only take up 50 kilograms in its 53 years.
Each day, he and his friends have 15 tons of vulkanic seals, which are transported by three carriages to Tamansara, a predominant distance of 18 miles (18 km) from the troop among the adults.
"I'm not going to the pension, I'm going to die here, because the vulcan is my whole life," says the Ulynic, opening a mouth that doesn't miss a few teeths.
From his five children, elders, 30 years old, also worked as a serial translator.
It takes time, but poverty is a generation to generate one of the most difficult jobs in the world: what human murders are doing from Kawah-Yegin.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporees accused career, stress and prices for housing and education in the absence of children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I'm a patriotic husband, you're my pair's wife, make our civil debt and make a life!
It may be unreasonable that these lines are part of the advertisements of sweet lights, but, despite this - or maybe, this video became a YouTube chief at Singapore at the beginning of this year.
These phrases are part of the laptop, which uses local talks like "Dave put a bao (bola) in the beach" in order to meet the birth level in Singapore.
The advertising Agency, which was made by the BBH, hopes that, using the advertising, they will be able to focus on this problem in the form of development.
His creative director, Dugle Gamilton, said that he wanted to use the music force so that people do their national debt.
This thing is only for the Internet, so we had to do it awesome and pleasant.
This is the main problem in the country.
We were worse in the world's reproduction of ourselves, so we felt that this is the theme that we had to touch.
We knew that the Government had tried to do many, such as the launch of spirits with pharmaceuticals, or to organize a fast-speak knowledge feasts (seekings).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they did not have to work.
So we thought we wouldn't do the most creative thing from the possible to solve this problem, namely, to resolve the rlip?
1.2 Child
That is the Singapore Government.
It costs $1,300 a year for policy to encourage citizens to generate a higher number of children.
The State package for marriage couples and parents provides up to $15,000 for children, extends pregnancies and parents and provides tax prices.
But all this has a low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and high-technological reward State in South-East Asia, also known by its leadership and strict public control.
The birth level in Singapore, according to its national population management, is currently at the level 1,2 of a child in women.
Last time he was below 2 - which is known as a percentage of replacement - in 1976.
So why do Singapore have no number of children?
Tan Way Min, director of the Office of Marriage Politicals and the Family of the National Population Management, said that the cause of a better education and the "wide range of carriage opportunities".
" This allows people to have a more wide range of options in terms of living goals and priorities, except marriage and family creation", explains.
These social standards contribute to the growth of colleagues and marriage and birth of children, resulting in declining birth rates in Singapore.
The immigration policy, which is aimed at significantly increased immigration to combat the reduction of the population, is a detriment among local populations.
In Singapore, there are websites where the eve hidden xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, which criticize the maintenance of low-level payments and the desire to integrate.
The growth of immigration is also considered to be one of the reasons that the Singapore government party has received the worst results of elections from the time of independence in the past year.
After elections, it was tried to solve the problem, using the cube and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While birth rates have been known to affect the economic growth of the nation, taxes, medical costs and immigration policy, the example of the Singapore also began to have some unexpected consequences.
The Government has efforts to not build such a small housing.
For example, this began to affect the sector of non-motiveness.
The City Development Guide has been controlled by the number of small apartments known as a " cocktail " which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments are very well sold at 46 square meters.
However, there is the view that they can contribute to the heavy life and remain the stimulation of manufacturers who want to build a large family housing.
But Lim Yu Suney, Director-General of the El Development Company, says that their "building boxes" are sell so faster than more space adventures.
They are more popular, meaning that these apartments are purchased for a few days, even a week, faster than the larger rooms.
As a result, our money income is increased.
However, he acknowledges that the new standards give more clear orientations to manufacturers that have previously been prepared if they wanted to propose too many smaller apartments in the project.
Too overloaded
Singapore is the State city.
Although these new rules may be a step to increase national birth rate, after conversation with synagoguers working in the centre's financial quarre, they seem to have no special effect.
"Their lives are very overcome, and they are very care, as well as education, and because of this, many people are dismissing it," says the young manager.
Others may have children.
"But for me, it is important to pay your own money and time," says another young man 20 years old.
Women and women mention their career, stress and prices for housing and education as a reason for preventing children.
So, as the Government had no effort to encourage their citizens to birth children, as regards detriment, the last word remains in the Singapore.
Privacy in the area - personal online
Privacy.
According to the Kingdom Academy of Spain, it is the property of a private or "personal life area that has the right to protect from any involvement".
What is personal for an incomprehensive 16-year-old age?
How does it apply this definition in its daily life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers at the internet discussions that would not be shared outside the Internet?
The period has been interviewed in five people from 10 to 15 years of age, private network users.
In four cases, they associated the terms "also very much with me" in a personal spot, and "nome and user" when they applied it to social networks.
"My largest secrets I wouldn't have downloaded at post," says the decades of Horchee, when it is trying to explain the importance of personally on websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has two years old.
"It's very secret, my mother can know them, but not all the world," he says.
I'm loading beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also spend with my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that's not my, or someone who is stupid," he says.
The child is aware that it is unfair to publish unfair pictures of persons who are inquired, crimes, or to write disappointed or disgraceful comments.
Horchee believes that you know 35 friends that he's in the FB, and nine of his phones on Twitter.
Most of them are parents.
The mother has a password to one of the accounting records.
I commanded Twitter to express myself and write interesting Twitters.
"I don't know if they answer me, I'm just downloading them," he adds.
"Social networks - discrepancy, I can talk to further relatives or with my baptized friends," he says.
Without reason, it answers that it would never be requested by an unknowledged person.
It wouldn't be considered to someone who recommended him to be an inconsistent.
The 14-year-old Hose is different.
The adolescent has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and recently recognizes that 20 persons are not known to be added in his list of friends.
"This doesn't scare me, because we have something common, music, for example," he says.
According to the boy, no one was in confidence with him and asked his home address or phone number.
"If I would give or require, I just remove them from his account," he admits.
José became the follower of Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
The child is not a strange experience of what he knows today as a cyberbombing.
One of my friends was loaded into a social network.
He was threatened and demanded money.
"He didn't know who it was," he assures.
The victim, according to José, did not remove the account.
"That includes confidentiality."
Then he explains the follow-up of steps to set up a account safely.
Unlike Horchee, the boy would load photos of the acquaintances in unpleasant or confusion situations.
Yeah, I would do this if a man doesn't like me or if I want it.
"I know that it's a cyberbombing," he confirms.
Key Questions
Marilos Porras, an English and education specialist for education and education, believes that to send children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"Web appeared as a means to search for information, but with the appearance of these websites, the rules of the game changed."
Paula indicates that the academics of Mark Prensky, the master of the Pedagogy from the University of Elle and the author of the Digital Aurigins and Immigrants, have developed these terms to explain this phenomenon.
Digital aurigenics are they, children and young people who were born in the era of technologie.
"Our digital immigrants are to teach them, while we are still learning," she says.
It explains that this theme is complicated, "for we ask them to have a certain criteria of what we can or can't distribute, publish or speak, in age when the skin is not enough for this."
"To be elected, while the most important thing for them is to be popular, having thousands of friends, not thinking of the consequences," she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to demonstrate that it is the confidentiality of children and adolescents to ask questions to think about them.
"To rule them that they don't do this, it's not useful," she adds.
Then, Paula counts some options: there are things that you wouldn't tell a acquaintance, so why are you doing this on the Internet?
Or would you like to publish your photo like that that you published about your friend?
Do you know that others publish you?
When you sign photos of a party, you're asking a call to others to notice them?
And another thing, do we all need to know what you're doing at all times?
Another paragraph is to give them understanding that they should be online as they do this offline.
It's the same rule to each other.
"In the Internet, a person has respect, responsibility and other principles, the same should be in social networks", says it.
Responsibility
Estuardo Guardiy, university teacher, professor of primary education and education adviser, explains the need to read the family heads well-being social networks.
In understanding each item, they have a good basis for conversation with children on the proposals for opening the accounting in the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to distribute or publish it," he said.
According to Gauderya, the key question is to remember the lesson to the children 'not speaking with the unconscious people'.
UNUSURA Summit ended without the publication of the Lima Declaration
The Vice-President Summit of the South American Nations (UNSUR) has concluded today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration stated previously and theoretically signed family members.
Ephe has often tried to get access to the document signed at the VI regular meeting of the heads of States and Governments of UNSUR, but the sources from the Office and the Administration of the President indicated that it would be transferred after the closure, but then confirmed that it would be published on the Peruan Government website.
As regards the text, they pointed out that the content was presented by President Peru, Olante Umala, during short press statements.
The access to journalists on the Samite was still limited.
During the day there was only translated, in the press hall, a video of the President's video without a sound message with the "Closed Meeting, sound prohibited".
A few information circled among the reporters was transmitted by some U.N.U.S.U.U.S.U.U.A. to meet, but not the Peruian secretariat.
The unique document, distributed during the day, was a list of participating Chairmans, which made it unpleasant to hundreds of journalists from different national and international media, who requested more information.
The President of the Peru Administration sent electronic media with the "final declaration" of the Samaritan, but it was the statement of UMA, not the official document that the summit ended.
In October, Peru adopted the III Samit of South American and Arab countries (ASPA) and, despite the continuous demand of press, the Lima Declaration was also not distributed as previously declared.
On the official website of the ACPA, you can verify that the document was published in the last morning.
At the two international meetings, the Peruvian authorities were attempted to ensure the transmission of systems for all journalists, but were limited to the receipt of information.
The Summit also concluded the joint decision of Chile and Peru to adopt the Hague Court's verifix, which regulates the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Olante Umala, and Chile, Sebastian Piñar, gathered at the regional meeting and ratified that they would comply with the decision of the International Court, which begins the Monday in Hague to hear the statements of both parties, in the context of the accused that Lima had issued against Santiago.
"We will observe and implement the decision which will explain the differences we are presently represented in this international court," said Umala, close to his Chile colleague.
"It was, there was a country that respected international law, peaceful permission of conflicts, packages and international tribunals," added Pineker, and welcomed Umalu's fleet hands on the background of the flags of these two countries.
Reaffirming both Presidents that they were subjected to the International Court, it happened immediately after Colombia protested this week of the Godoth Covenant, which she acknowledged the submission of the international court ' s credibility after decided on the marine borders of Nicaragua that she had considered wrong.
The Samit was in the absence of the Presidents of Brazil, Djima Ruseff; Venezuela, Ugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirshner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNSUR was suspended since 2011 after his former President Fernando Lugo was not involved in the meeting.
The acceptant President, Oljathan Umala, was responsible for opening the discussions of morning and for the closure of the summit later on the Lime time.
The head of the State reads the resulting document that reported that 16 agreements were adopted and adopted on 31 project action among South American countries, the amount of investments proposed was $17 billion.
Among the agreements he recalled that UNUSUR countries would undertake “the important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we extend the residence agreement”.
He reported that efforts were taken to enhance the "cooperation against the insecurity of citizens and against the organized transnational crime, to increase access to drugs, to disadvantage the Internet in all parts of South America and to take into account jointly and effectively the risks of natural disasters".
As Europe is in crisis, "Economy Association (Latin America) should not have a triumphatoral basis, but should serve to expand our productive basis and to predict the best future for our cities", he added.
"We have decided to provide the privileges of a group of 31 sign projects that will improve the relationship with South America, particularly in village and border areas, together with our countries and forming new economic schemes", said the Peruian President in the read communication.
Among these projects he mentioned that five were related to Peru, and the restrictions were limited to the weights on its territory, from the beach to Brazil, and two of the larger links with Equador, but he did not provide more details.
The final document also affected the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the election process in this country will serve its re-association to the South American Union," which is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of well-being and peace would be combined, and a good relationship between neighbours was another theme stressed on its own.
In this sense, President of Colombia, Huan Manuel Santos, said, before taking part in the regional meeting, that hopes to meet his colleagues from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortegoy, in Saturday in Mexico, in a respectable form of negotiations on marine controversial resulting from the credibility of God ' s international court.
"I may meet President Daniel Ortegoy," said Santos.
"We can overlook all these ways, and they are not unlikely, including Nicaragua's covenant, and we need a debate with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"I hope I can tell him that we do with this maximum possible civilization and respectfully", added Santos.
Santos and Ortega are meeting at Saturday in Mexico, where they are expected to be attended by the new President of the country, Enrique Peña Nito.
In the framework of the Block Defence Ministers, the 2013 Action Plan was also awaiting the 2013 Action Plan, aimed at strengthening the dialogue and unity on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Haiana, Suriname and Paraguay are UNASUR, although the latest part of the countries was suspended.
Peru has an temporary presidency in the regional block.
"South America should be trained in Europe in the integration of citizens": Rafael Correa
The President of Equador, Rafael Correa, reaffirmed today that the creation of a general citizenship was a goal in which South America, in this case, should be taught in Europe.
Correa, who participated in the VI presidential Union of South America (UNSUR), held in Lima, declared the public television of Peru that the Europeans " killed each other during the Second World War" and in other convergences, "we have now been almost one one."
He protected, in this context, the draft establishment of South American citizenship that approve the countries of UNSUR.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country must be achieved, as it is already happening to the Andian community members, but there are still reaction sectors that want to return to us in the past, " he warned.
In addition, the Ecuador President has demonstrated himself a renewing partner under the preference of reducing the impact of the angloson States and the adoption of those signed by the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who read lessons never take any commitments to themselves, but we, the South Americans, are signing everything instead.
"Not we explain that the Inter-American Human Rights Commission is in Washington and financed by the United States," he stated, instead of a political assurance given by the Ecuador, the WikiLeaks Julian Assanju Foundation.
Correa assured that it was not complaining of this decision because he did not bring his principles to him, but comply with its “the deep value of democracy and human rights”.
He added that in his time " some suspects were being extracted in the third country and will not comply with the process " .
He also disclosed the Swedish justice for a request to come to his territory to investigate the prescribed sexual offence, while "the Swedish legislation considered possible to implement it through a videoconference that could be made from the Ecuador Embassy in London".
Correa confirmed that there was a risk of deterioration of the physical and mental health of Asanja.
"I haven't spoken with him since he arrived in our administration, but the policeman told me that he had a small light problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuador Head of the State.
What really is, that is the danger of deterioration of his physical and mental health because of small-scale air education without possible.
"This affects any person's health," he added.
Correa stated that the solution to the refugee problem provided from June to the Ecuador Association in London was addressed by providing an inadequacy guarantee that allows him to go to Ecuador is in the hands of the Great Britain, Sweden and the European Judiciary and stressed the negotiations in London on the search for a solution to the WikiLeaks founder.
We do not hold negotiations on human rights, that is the word we do not use in this case, but have been constantly discussed.
"The resolve of this problem is in the hands of the Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial bodies, since the lawyer of Assanja, Baltasar Harson, has conducted a number of processes in various European institutions", said he.
And he said that "if the United Kingdom would provide the guarantee of inadequacy tomorrow, it would be concluded."
And if Sweden, how beautifully she allows her legislation and how she has already done in other cases, would ask Mrs Asanja in the Ecuador Embassy in London or ask him about Skype, this problem will be overlooked tomorrow.
Correa used the case to demonstrate himself as a protector of the freedom of print and emphasize that it would not suffer “indirectness, inconsciousness and lies that make the freedom of expression”.
"The major enemy of the freedom of print is not the corrupt-politicals, but the bad journalists supporting the food, load and demand," he said.
In this regard, he remained satisfied that any of these journalists, " neither bankers nor Burundian countries have dominated in Ecuador", and added that, as a re-elected, "a uglubit of revolution to continue development into a faithful direction".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the wind of Paraguay at least until the following elections, arguing that the organization should "decide to be strong and not to sustain the deportation and support of the migration under the macedonian legislation", because "he actually destroyed the law of the Paraguay democracy".
In addition, the Ecuador President said that his Columbia College, Juan Manuel Santos, had now been on negotiations with Nicaragua on marine borders between two countries after the decision of the International Court of Justice of Gaagu, which was used for the Nicaragua Sea Sovereignty.
This decision is not respected at this time.
This is a problem between South America and Central America.
The conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome the desire to go together.
We need to process their message to overcome them and continue forward.
He also expressed the hope of a good conclusion of the controversy on the marine borders that leads to the same court of Peru and Chile, and said that "right for Latin America to be in an international instance if two countries were obliged to decide how difficult it would have been".
It would be possible to be a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador to be balleted at the third time of the post, he pointed out that the opportunity was to be considered "a great optimism and joy, although sometimes it was very difficult."
Correa assured that if it was playing for elections in February 2013, it would go out of public life.
Personally, I was never interested in authority, but in injustices such as Ecuador, social and economic poverty can only be corrected by political authorities.
"My political movement felt that I guaranteed this reliable victory, so it must be recognized," said he.
In the case of the victory, this would be my last time in the position of the President and then we go out of the public life.
If we lose the same thing.
"This is a decision," he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned the new currency of the Venezuelan President Ugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just talked to the Venezuelan Vice-President Nicholas Maduro, who told me that he was sent to the treatment that was already planned and that he expects to lose the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean the deterioration of the health status of President Chavez," he explained.
Head of the Ecuador State has participated in Lima in the VIth Heads of States and Governments of the South American Nations (UNSUR), which has concluded with the calls for greater regional integration to maintain progress, equality and security.
The death of AIDS today is the late diagnostic results
Fabricio was 21-year when he announced that his analysis on AIDS was positive.
"My looks like it," he remembers that difficult, despite the whole physician tac, moment.
Youths hid this from their family.
When he decided to do with a single disease, he wanted to know about it as far as possible, and his efforts were justified - he has already noted his 43th birthday.
Fabricio is one of the "ancient" patients in the hospital of the Civil Hospital de Guadalajara (HCG), where he was in 1994, had little obstacles.
He lives with the "Human Immunodeficient virus" (HIV) for 22 years. At the beginning of the 90s, it would be difficult to believe that there was too little treatment options, too little known about sickness, too predominantly related to sick.
Yes, even the director of the Clinics of the Institute of Social Protection did not want to interfere with him "for the fact that he had a smooth."
In other words, there was a condemnation of AIDS at that time.
Now you can survive and do this, not the worst quality of life.
However, not known about her disease, many people still come when the virus has been damaged, "stood" their immune system and suffers from reporting infections.
By 31 years after the world’s emergency of AIDS, at least after the first declared cases, "the greatest achievement at this time is that the survival of a patient that begins timely treatment and the survival of the population in the exactity of the same person," stated the head of HCG, Haime Andrew Viljanaev, referring to that information was confirmed in April of that year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectionists and experts on HIV/AIDS, Andréda Villinaev explained that since 2008, the scientists concluded that AIDS is not a conspiracy, but the duration and quality of life depended on the incidence of the immune system in patients at the beginning of the diagnosis, with the best expected life of life in those who do not use drugs: to 30 years of age of 200 CDs, and to 50 years when reported about 5004 CDs.
However, it means that the person who receives HIV-positive diagnosis in the age of 25 years, according to these terms, " keeping control can live without a problem of 75 years of age," he explained.
To assess this progress, it should be reminded that the life of the Mexicans today is a average of 76 years.
Although mortality has been significantly decreased in the past few years, in Mexico, the number of people died from AIDS, from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAYS annual report) also has also been true that 60 per cent of patients died from the time of AIDS in the national database.
Only 255 people died in Kalifornia in 2011, and 187 deaths have already been registered before that year; however, there is a total access to antiretroviral prepatriation since 2005.
- Why are there any year's exits yet?
- Personally, I think that the problem is not in the access to treatment.
So I represent it, so that's what's going on in our hospital.
As at least the last 12 years we did not have enough medications, the problem is that the patients are very late because they don't know about their infected status, i.e. in the later stages of disease.
He reported that "the two of the ten patients are coming when they have some reporting infection; what they need to do to make a greater impact on the general mortality, so that the diagnose should be carried out in the early stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide losses to discover mass-scale, for all people that ask it."
In its proposals, specialists and officials of the State of the AIDS Protection Council in Khalisco (COESIDA), as well as patients, such as Fabricio, who had been asked to check in a private lab, which was just the case of his friend and, despite his young age, he had already been at the stadium of AIDS and even suffered from the slaughter of Kaposhi, the cancer surgery, which is one of the distributed complications.
Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.
Some think they're gonna die, and they don't want to know.
"I'm still going to die, I'm better driving three times a week," they say, but not in my case.
There are positive changes, I'm good to demand, to train, to take medicine.
To this day, his parents only know that he's transferred to cancer.
I live in a normal life like any other.
"I'm working, I have a lot of jobs, I'm traveling, conducting an active sex life, but with a widespread responsibility, worried about myself and another person," said Fabricio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO, to submit his statement to those who now, in the context of the World Day of AIDS, are afraid.
Please verify if there is a risk of infringement, let as soon as possible to know whether they are HIV positive, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live as any other person who is responsible.
This report resumes the topic of combating AIDS in 2012.
Conserves for Application
Great losses between health programmes and simple citizens, Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, has been addressed to the problem related to HIV.
And this is the biggest prophylactics.
In the places dedicated to this task, "the reserves have actually increased, have given us one or two, now they give us a hundred packages, and that's very good, but it shows that there are still no one who has yet access to preserve," he said.
Adolescents are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"Why are you?" This is a popular question, with awareness and conviction, of social workers, school advisers, appeal staff and health workers who don't want to hear youths, firmed propaganists.
I propose to change this inefficient distribution, not only for instruments, but also for hundreds of them in the public toilets that are often visiting young people.
This is not promoting disappointment.
This is not a drink payment and a motor, and he answered the Governor Emilio Gonzalez when he asked whether a reserve could be paid in his leadership.
" This is not sexuality, better to preserve available for those already practiced sexual activity," he noted.
Key data in Khalisco
13.435 summary cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
The United States takes the fourth place in the national rating on the new and summary cases of AIDS and the 13th HIV.
92 per cent of the infections relate to sex, 6 per cent through blood and 2 per cent to the primary road.
Assessed that 500,000 people may live with HIV, as one registered case has 4 to 5 persons that do not know about it.
Bearing in mind the ratification of the appeal Court of the United States, which denied the restructuring of the Vitro Panel ' s debt through competitive production in Mexico, the scenarios establish a yearly precedent for any national company with the branches in the neighbouring country, which has problems with payability.
It seems that procedures in support of the survival of companies authorised by Mexico are not effective in the country of sex and stars, in contrast with international agreements.
In the practical area, the decision made by the judge Harlin Hayle on 15 June in the court of the Northern Texas Banks remains unprotected by the Mexican companies before the possibility of arresting their property on the side of Rio Grand.
However, the decision opens the doors of the leading producer in Mexico to treat the Supreme Court of the United States by proving three incompliances.
As an entry, while the court notes that creditors should be regulated by the United States Banking Code, the Appeal Court of the Fifth District in New Orlean states that the main proceedings relate to the competitive production considered in Mexico.
The first paragraph underlines the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of transnational profile incapacity.
In fact, the United Nations Standard Act on the Integration of International Trade Law, defined as the arbitrator of the United States Law Institute.
Secondly, the verdict states that without interferenced vote acknowledged in the critical mass of competitive debt production that had been before the maternal branch of Vitro, there would be no majority necessary for the restructuring.
However, this possibility is recognised by Mexico laws.
In fact, Vitro was not the first case when this scheme was taken.
There are twenty-four examples of Agremex and Commercial Mexico, whose inter-first debts guaranteed the Federal Competitive Institute.
It is also true that the voice of the branches, as well as other creditors of Vitro, who were fighting against him in the courts of the United States, namely, the funds of " observers " like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited would have not achieved most.
It would be 45 per cent against 37.
The appeal Court shall delay these data.
On the other hand, he accused Vitro in a complicated situation with which since 2008, a serious economic crisis affected by the United States, has been attacked by the country.
As long as the family company of Gonzalez Sad regrets the decision in the appeal court to reach the vote to its plenary, it is, five judges, because only three were declared.
In the case of failure, a certification request is required to be reviewed by the court of the Supreme Instance, in this case by the High Court of the United States.
It is all that the Court rejected the document sent by the Government of Mexico in the role of amicus curiae ("a second court"), which describes the process that Vitro should be under the Competitive Production Act, signing that he is free of compliance with the agreements signed by both countries to link it with article 15 of the US Banking Act.
It also notes that the country has been subject to the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules laid down in the case of intergovernmental incapacity, which guarantee equality for debts and creditors.
Carmbol from two ships: They fight in Vitro and shoot in the country.
General balance
Bearing in mind the complaints held in a few months on the table by Mexico de Aviation Professionals against the former company, Gaston Ascarraga Andrade, who is accused of the Moshnic Office, has already found a butiful car pilot association.
The Instance, envoyed by Carlos Dias Chavez Morino, just submitted a criminal case against the National Bank Commission and valuable Bugs, which is accused to prevent justice.
Accordingly, the Supervisory Authority systematically refused to provide reports to the General Prosecutor of the Republic on operations carried out by the entrepreneur for the extradition of the trust fund F/589 of IXE 198 million peso, on behalf of Mexico Airlines.
Resources would be aimed at purchase shares of the Professional Directory Companion.
Askharraga Andrade is the main shareholder of Posdas hotels.
Surrounding Dragon Mart
Meaning on weekly forums at the Caribbean University, a group of local and immigrant ecologists, scientists, business members and general civil society has approved the establishment of a broad front to oppose the opening of Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We tell you, as you know, about the Gigant Seal and Distribution Centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean products of the isolated country, with a neighbouring area for 150 company staff.
Anciently, Canacintra has been able to associate South-East Governants to oppose monetary forces that have compared with the land of the protected territories and posed serious threats to the industry.
ACTA death
The Government ' s denied demand to explain the conditions and circumstances of the Mexican Ambassador in Japan signed the Trade Agreement on Contractualization, known as an Aboriginal to the English ACTA, in accordance with the Mexican Industry Institute, this case has already been archiving.
As you know, the action was made, despite the dismissing opportunity to consider it as a violation of the freedom of expression in social networks.
Homex in a long-term perspective
In order to reduce long-term debts, unlike short-term, the Homex residential is located on the market of the Birjava 500 million weight.
The expenditure is the first of four identical, with a proposal for payment for every 28 days.
Competitiveness appears on the light
NYCE, E-Quality and Kernet, Information Technology Leaders, Competition Consortium on Trade Name only appeared on the light, which aims to be in the programme-classing market in Central and South America.
Investment in this area exceeds $1.5 billion.
Hector Reese: "Basketball was my life."
Hector Hetin Reez, a swimming basketball traveller, was more than 60 years old with the sport, and, thanks to it, traveled around the world.
A little man in Puerto Rico is keeping in the memory of so many battery stories as Hector Haytin Reese.
Before the blood in the brain was covered in 2008, Reyes was shocked in sport for over 60 years as a player of small categories, the High Backetball Leg, the full and leading BSN with the Coboy Bajona and the President of the Backetbola Federation.
"I have played a lot of roles in the basketball for my life, including several times as I was President of the BSN, the Director-General of the National Team and the President of the Federation in the 1990s," reminds Reyes during the first hour visit to her home to Baamon, where he lives with Isaac, his faithful husband for over 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reese does not exceed the approval.
His houses, almost all the photos shooted and memories gathered for his long-term way, prove to this.
Bymon in the Heart
With the most emotions, he keeps those who remember his way through Cuba, starting from the mid-50s, as a player until 1982, when his 15-year-old statements were performed in a co-agent or contract agent.
"These were my best years that I enjoyed mostly because I could be part of the eight Cuban Championships since 1967, as a agent, co-agent or leader.
There were many years of joy, including five championers from 1971 to 1975.
And then, I was condemned with one in 1981, in the year of Jerome Minesy in BSN.
Since that time, he continued to lead as "Coco" Ortis, who was the great Administrator," stated Reyes.
I remember that Jean Barts, who was sent here and was in the Alabama University of Birming, said to me, "I have a very strong player for you, growing 6'7."
"Do you think?"
And it was the beginning of Mins, one of the best players that were in Puerta Rico.
Bars then recommended the Ramond Gauss snake, who received citizenship and became one of our best bombs.
I remember what I said if Minsy would bring the Baymon Championship, Gauss would help get one more.
The Championship of Kubov and Gauss, but at the distance I was already, because in 1988, the Federation Chief had already been a leader.
At that time, I would like to enjoy his achievements and achievements in the national collection.
I remember how we won first in the United States during the Olympic Qualification Tour in Mexico in 1989.
Then Championite of the World in 1990, where we received the fourth place, and that should be a bronze, if not the Canadian court who made us to play the final game, said Reyes.
And the World Champion team in 1990 is the best collection that you ever saw?
She won at the Dream Team in the Olympic Games in 2004.
But my loved, and that with the Pana-American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we wined gold and shooted the U.S. collection, which was very similar to the one we wined for the champion of the world.
The team was not only playing in Mins, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Phyco Lopes and Peculina (Origin), but also young people (Tonyto) Colon and James Carter, Leon's brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Khiote' Morales, who couldn't participate in 90-year-olds.
The team, which might not be the best in personal composition but brought us gold meal and great joy, was the Olympic Qualification Touring team of 1995 in Neuken (Argentina).
With the role players like Cannito Nievesa, Pablo Alisa and the young Rolando Hurruitner, we wined gold instead of all prognosis.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without any doubt, it was Picolen Ortis.
His indicators on international tourists are impressed.
Nobody in Puerta Rico did this level as Picolen did.
And that's without his carriage in the various ligaments he played.
Who was the best puertorist?
That's a very complex question.
We had a very good young man, including Julio Thoro, Flora Melandes, Carlos Morales, Raymond Darmau, Armendito Torres.
From young people, I like Leo Arilla's work.
What do you consider your main achievement in the Federation?
Participation in the most glorious time of the national collection between 1988 and 1995, and that at the beginning of the 1990s, the OSN had reached 17 teams in the sezon.
What'd you do?
There were things that I wanted to implement, for example, the regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, to play the ponce boys only in their area and only against the team of other parts of the island in the Ocean National.
Now, the people are traveling and playing too much, and it's very bad.
At least, I see the fruits of the compulsory certification and course for managers, officers and judges.
This makes me happy.
What are you doing now?
More I'm listening to music, looking at the music videos of my epoch at YouTube, enjoying my birds and developing a basketball mask.
And of course, I enjoy my wife's society, Ihabelle, who was always with me.

Larry Hagman, born 21 September 1931 in Fort-Werte, Texas, was worldwide known as John Ross Yuning, who was known as "J.R.", in the Dallas television, in which he engaged businessmen without principles, evil and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role of a pet magnetic, Jay Ar Yuning, in the Dallas Telescope, was a symbol of harassment in the 1980s.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new Darlas Session, died on Friday night because of the complications of cancer, according to the statement of the family provided for for the Associated Press Company of Warner Bros.
"Larry again returned to his loved town, Dallas, playing a marking role that was more liked to him," said his family.
The Larry's family and the closest friends were with him in Darlas on the earmark for the Thanksgiving Day.
Linda Gray, who played his role in the original series and sykwell, was close to Hagman, when he died in the hospital of Darlas, said her representative Jeffrey Lane.
He offered the joy of all those who knew him.
He was creative, loving, pleasant, and talentous, and I'm going to miss him very much.
"He was original and lived in full life," reaffirmed Gray in the statement.
Hagman had been diagnosed in 1992 and admitted that he had drinked for many years.
In 1995, he has found a malnutritional snake in the snake and transferred transplantation.
For a long time before "Dream of Jeannie" Hagman received television information through the role of the orthodox "I Dream of Jeannie", translated by the NBC channel from 1965 to 1970.
He played the Captain Tony Nelson, astronaut whose life changes when he meets a nice Jenna girl playing Barbara Indian, and begins to live with her under a shirt.
He was also the main two compositions that were rarely appearing in the eternal, The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the film included the roles that were well adopted by the "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But his master interpretation, J.R., has brought Hagman to the top of the glory.
The graphic CBS channel series on the Yunting cluster and other persons in its environment went from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan "Who shot J.R.?", designed for the creation of a shock around the episode, a full emotion in which the Hagman's personality has not killed, generated international discussions and millions of dollars that were risked in the Buckmecker Contracts.
This also helped to join the recursion audio series in that age.
When the response was given to the episode of November 1980, the average of 41 million tighters were watched and converted to "Dalles" in the second exhibition of the history program, after the end of the "MASH" in 1983, with 50 million slaughterers.
It was a master J.R., Christine, who shooted him.
J.R. interrupted her and then threatened her that she would be accused of prostitution if she didn't leave from the city, but others also had reasons to attack it.
Hagman played the Young as an unfair corruptioner with a physical smile: an unhonorable entrepreneur and an infidel man who wanted to have his wife, Sue Ellen (Lind Gray) to be treated.
"I know that J.R's got to be on the throat." "There's gotta be in 1988.
It should be said, "I'll be a honourable citizen J.R. Ying."
It's the only thing he lost.
Victoria Prinsipal, also the hero of the original series, recalled Hagman as some of the "fright and out of the screen".
He forgot millions of readers throughout the world, and in the hearts of each of us who have learned and loved him.
Decades of new "Dallas" episodes were shown several months ago with great success in the TNT channel.
The record of five episodes of the second and sixth season has already been produced, reported to the channel.
Warner or TNT did not make a statement that will be with Hagman's serial.
Fort Wart, Tehas, was a son of actors and animals, Mary Martin, who was close to classic events such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still adolescent when he was born in 1931 during her marriage with a lawyer Ben Hagman.
He experienced happiness at New York theatrical scenes in the beginning of the 1950s and then served in the United States from 1952 to 1956.
When he came there, he met a young Sweden artist May Axelson and married her.
A couple of children lived in the Kalifornian city of Malibu, where many famousities live.
In 2001 he called his Memories "Hello Darlin": Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life."
"I did not include anything that would seem to be able to cause anybody or to affect them anyway," he said the Asociation press at that time.
After the surgery, he began to promote the donation of organs and worked as a volunteer in the hospital to help patients experienced fear.
"I give them advice, I give them to be baptized, meeting them when they go to the operation, and afterwards," he stated in 1996.
I'm trying to propose some comfort, like: "Don't be afraid, it's gonna be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but you're gonna be fine."
He was also actively opposed to smoke and participated in several campaigns.
The course starts to investigate the King of Light
Each week, students have been investigating apathical явs such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and bacteria and global warming.
In this seminar, when Professor Stuart Charme decided to read about the end of the light, he knew that the end of the "good back report" calendar of May, 21 December, for which many people were shocked as evidence of the end of the light.
However, Sharme did not realize that he was expected in the nearest couple of months: a catastrophic uragan Sandy, a financial crisis that some called “dogharmeddon” and a growing conflict in Israel, where Christian theories of the end in time believe that Apocalypse begins.
"I did not realize that this would be the most apolyptical seminar of all," said Sharme this week to the University of Rutgers-Kamden (New York).
If analyzing what happens in the world today, as if we had only 30 days, it was really a good time.
And remember that it's good for those who have an apolyptical image of thinking.
And he is not the only professor who offers courses to the "the end of light" in this seminar, theoretically last in history.
In the Timple University of the Advocate Professional Barry Water reads the course “Autority of Mass Information, Cultural and Light End”.
Each week, students study the subjects of nuclear war, zombies, virus and bacteria, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas are being distributed in time," he said, "and how to propose hypothetical scenarios that cause certain human effects.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, such as war could be disappeared.
In this month, students analyzed the films on pharmaceutical topics and studied how they focused on examples of real life.
"I've tried to tell students what maybe it may be impossible," said Vaker.
In the main campaign of the University of Pennsylvania, the history professor Matthew Restall and his colleagues Ammar Solari, a professor of art and antropology, were joined to read the course just called "Light King".
"We don't add '2012' to always have a chance to read the course again, if the end of the light doesn't come", said Restall.
Despite the "minimous destruction" students should learn, prepare projects and provide resultal reviews.
In the Penn State, the final examination will be taken in the Apocalypse Canon, which does not leave students to a different choice, except to work " until the night in which the end of the light will be expected, " said Restarl.
Kurses were very popular.
"The Mesta has been finished for two hours," said Restall about his course for students with a high medium bal at which 35 students were recorded.
We received email message for many weeks before the seminar of people asked whether there was any other place.
Students, in their own way, assured that this course is one of the most interesting ones.
"I like to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridge Robinson, 23-year-old student of the Division of Religious and Sociology of Haddonfield, New York, in Rutgers-Camden.
And a philosophy of thinking, light or religious, is only a question of comfort or absence.
Will Wekes, a 25-year-old student of psychology and sister affairs, said that it had regarded all pharmaceutical films.
"I never heard about the course that would teach this," he noted.
I like him.
But no one of the students asked - no longer say about the professor - said he believed in the date of the end of December 21.
"Our first project affected Maya's prophecy, and some kind we dismissed it," said Julia Zeglen, a 21-year-old student at the Timple University of West Chester.
Maya never predicted the end of the light; it is just a key moment in the calendar, said Restall.
However, he noted that there is an apolyptical concern in the Western culture, which has a number of centuries, where people respond to changes around themselves, predicting the end of the light.
The Internet has called for increased the speculations.
"In other places people don't think about it," he said.
Previous in the English world.
Joseph Daghetti, Professor of the University of La Sal, who offers courses to the Philippins this year, quickly answered to the question whether he knows whether he was a course of "the end of the light" there.
"The Philippians do not participate at the end of the light," he wrote, as a result of the disposal of the above.
We've got a mistake from Dad.
Restalle noted that during a long time the last court had been spoken about many days, and said that if nothing happens 21 December, "the people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophy that 21 December was the beginning of the seventh year, after which the world ends.
Students and providers are safely related to that date.
Some say they're gonna go to the "the end of the light".
"I may be calling someone from friends to meet together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student of the Connection School.
