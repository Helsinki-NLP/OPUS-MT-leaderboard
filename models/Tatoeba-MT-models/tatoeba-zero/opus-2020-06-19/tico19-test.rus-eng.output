How long are these symptoms present?
and all the pains in the breast cell should be treated so, especially in the light of your age
and with high temperature
and it is also necessary to check the levels of your colesterine and artificial pressure
And do you have high temperatures now?
And do you now experience this pain in a crude cell?
And if it is hard to breathe you.
And can you tell me what other symptoms you have instead of these?
And how high your temperature was
And I've got a cash.
And I've got a little slight with a box.
And I've really got a strong pain today in a breast cell.
and whether this is the time for the proof of the calamity which you are understood
and pain in the breast cell.
And I think I've got a little high temperature.
And I want you to describe where the beast cell you experience pain.
and they also have a little higher temperature
and with your diabetes history
And do you know it feels like my smell will be disappointed?
And you know, people's always caught on me.
And you're suffering pain in the breast cell.
And you said it's the pressure in the breed cell.
Some in the family have problems with heart, heart deal, micro-inflation, high level of colesterin, high artificial pressure
Any other symptoms or problems that you notice and related to museum pain?
Do you have other sicks with the same symptoms at home?
Do you have any other symptoms?
Are you experiencing a breath?
Do you still pain in a brown cell?
'Cause it's the Greep Session.
But we should not remain without attention because of the existence of a crude cell that has a cardiac nature
But now the more important problem is that pain in the 1991 cell
But I'm hard to breathe.
But I know that a lot of people smell me.
But we have to go to the treatment of any pain in the crude cell with the maximum seriousness.
But you're breathing good now, right?
Because I'm not remembering this pain in December cell.
It looks like somebody's a shirt cell.
You're still feeling sweet.
Do they regret the symptoms of wrong selfishness?
Do you have any other chronic diseases, such as high arterial pressure or something like that?
Do you have any other chronic disease or medical problems, such as diabetes?
Do you experience this pain in a crude cell?
Do you have high artificial pressure?
Do you have this breath?
Do you know what the symptoms she had?
Do you see that picture?
Drink a lot of sweet today
But I'm looking for a diabetes test.
But she had symptoms in exactity as I have.
How high you have temperatures?
What artificial pressure do you have?
If you still have high temperature
if you have the temperature of 30 and nine or above
If you think your symptoms or problems guarantee the improvement of the external type
I got the temperature yesterday.
I've also got a little high temperature last night.
I had a temperature yesterday.
I'm experienced here in a grain cell of pain.
I've also got a little hard breathing.
I'll send you a picture.
I'm trying some pain tonight.
I've got a little worse of my head tonight and the temperature is up.
I think it's a grip.
I think it's a simple shape.
Does that remember that like a very hard man sit in your shirt?
all of this began almost simultaneously with the main pain and higher temperature
I'm having a pain in the center of the roof.
It's like it's a pain in a sweet cell.
I'm in the sweet.
It's in the center of my breath cell.
It's in the center of the green cell.
I've got a pain in the smell.
I'm very worried about this pain in the wound.
I want you to describe this pain in the sweet.
as high artificial pressure or diabetes
As exactly in the center of the crude cell
From high temperature you can now take a tashipirin in the form of the ladys
Now, Mary, tell me, how many days have you shown these symptoms.
Now you said you're feeling pain in the sweet.
From time to time, I feel a little pain in the wound
Well, if you have some other symptoms along with that, except pain.
Or is someone sit on your feet?
The same high temperature and cash, the main and muscle pain.
Stress directly in the center of my breast
Show me this image where you feel pain.
Because you have high temperatures
So do you think some of these symptoms could be related to pregnancy?
So your children have some of the same symptoms?
Tell me about your pain in the brain cell.
Temperature increases the night
The temperature that I had in the last two days.
Temperatural began to increase last night
It's Dr. Porter in a quiet point of assistance accepted.
All right, can you tell me a little more about your pain in the wound?
Well, I feel pain in the front of my body here, in the wound.
Well, I'm feeling a strong pain in the smell.
So when I feel pain in the smell
What kind of thing do you feel in the smell?
When did you begin to feel that pain in the sweet?
Where are you feeling pain in the grain?
Whereever you feel that pain in the wound?
You're experiencing something like a smile in your snake.
You know, I have a diabetes and that's all.
You said that you're experienced this pain in the crude cell.
Currently increased coronavir infection (COVID-19) in the European Union and Britain during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
Commutative infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in Europe/European Economic Zone and Britain, as a result of the various stages of its development in different countries, and the Pandemia of COVID-19 has severely increased in all countries.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and offices, it is necessary to increase the level of preparation to the pressure of patients with COVID-19, which are needed to be treated, and in particular intensive therapy.
On December 31, 2019, Mr. Huhahn of the Chinese province of Hubay had been fixed in a number of cases of pneumonia of unknown ethiology.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Control and Prevention Centre reported that the infection reconstructor was a new species of coronavirus, currently known as a coronavir of the second-third severe respirator syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since this time, SARS-CoV-2 disease was called the coronviral infection (COVID-19).
According to the data available today, about 80 per cent of COVID-19 diseases are easy, i.e., in the form of respiratory ways with pneumonia or without it, most of the diseases are infected.
About 14 per cent of COVID-19 cases have been developed in the disease of more severe forms of hospitalization, and 6 per cent is critical when intensive therapy is required.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is around 4 per cent.
This study is analyzed by the trend of commutative COVID-19 in each country of the European Economic Area (ECE) and the European Economic Area (ECE) and the United Kingdom and their comparisons to trends in the Chinese province of Hubay.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/ECE and in Britain with Italian data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 disease in the EU/ECE and Britain
After the expansion in China, COVID-19 was distributed to other countries, and currently in the rest of the world, COVID-19 is developed according to the same dynamic as China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the Pandemic of COVID-19.
In the magazine number of Eurosurveillance, dated 5 March 2020, Mr. Smither (Spiter) and his colleagues reported about the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe, which responded to the criteria defined by WHO's existence of disease.
The three first confirmed cases in the EU/ECE were registered in France on 24 January 2020, and the three of the diseases returned from Mr. Huhah of the Chinese province of Hubay.
As at 15 March 2020, the cases of COVID-19 were identified in all 30 EU/ECE countries and in Britain, from 31 December 2019 to the date given, 39 768 cases of infection and 1 727 deaths, including 1 441 deaths, have been fixed only to Italy.
Determination of commutative numbers and CVID 19
The European Centre for Control and Prevention of Diseases (ECDC) has updated daily at 8:00 data on the number of registered cases of COVID-19 in each world countries receiving official sources such as the Ministry of Health of these countries, national and regional health and WHO bodies.
These data are used to analyze COVID-19 trends in the EU/ECE and Britain and compare Italian data.
As a level of dissemination of the active cases of COVID-19 was estimated for 14 days, taking into account the normal COVID-19 level in each EU/ECE and in Britain from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented a commutative number of cases contained in each country at 8:00 15 March 2020, compared to Italy's data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 in the EU/ECE countries and in Britain
The trends of COVID-19 in the EU/ECE countries and in Britain were generally relevant to trends observed in the Chinese province of Hubei (ris. 1).
Communitional COVID-19 in the EU/ECE and in the whole beginning of the growth of about 21 February, and on 28 February 2020 a rare scale of the indicator (complementary material).
This was mainly a huge growth in Italy's registered diseases, but in all other countries, the EU/ECE and Britain had noted similar trends to increase the cultureal disease of COVID-19 (complementary material).
2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/ECE countries and in Britain compared to the Italian similar indicator for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to that data, the overall number of cases already registered at 8:00 15 March in 15 other EU/ECE countries and Britain compared to the number fixed in Italy for about 3 weeks ago.
Our results demonstrate the rapid increase in the number of registered cases of COVID-19 in the EU/ECE and in Britain.
CVID-19 observed trends make it possible to suggest that pandemia is developed with compared speed in all countries.
This is unlike different stages in different countries, with different reactions taken by the national public health bodies, and, perhaps, different criteria for recognition of diseases and different rules for the selection of patients for the analysis of COVID-19, including “reverse” testing.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors reported that nearly 10 per cent of the COVID-19 patients needed intensive treatment, and IME noted that hospitals and hospitals have already been completed in these regions.
At the current time, data on the income of COVID-19 in the hospital and (or) the EU/ECE intensive therapy offices are available only for 6 per cent and 1 per cent of the cases respectively (not submitted).
However, a systematic collection of information should be made to complement the current monitoring data which are the number of registered cases and the number of deaths.
According to the results of the 2010-2011 study, there is a significant number of cocks in the centres of intensive therapie and the hospital intensive offices: from 29.2 to 4.2 in Germany for 1000,000 in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 cookies in intensive therapy offices and intensive income offices per 1000,000 people in 2010-2011).
In the sixth updated report of the ECDC on the results of COVID risk assessments, the modelling of health resource loading systems with evaluated COVID-19 data in each EU/ECE countries and in Britain, when the risk of the lack of cocks available in intensive therapy offices exceeds 90 per cent.
As at this time the case is grouped in certain regions of the EU/ECE and of the United Kingdom, hospitals and intensive therapy are generally providing the population of a certain territorial group, information on the cases of intelligence and the number of cocks in the units of intensive therapy is recommended to provide the Territory Nomenclature for Statistics (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and the current trends in other countries show that the EU/ECE and the Great Britain's pandemic COVID-19 are deeply developed.
Thus, countries, hospitals and hospitals should be prepared to the contact scenario of SARS-CoV-2 insufficient in the long-term period, and to increase the number of patients needing in medical assistance and, in particular, intensive treatment, for example, in the suffering regions of Italy.
As reported in the last report of the ECDC on the risk assessment results, it is important to maintain the dissemination of SARS-COV-2 operational, preventive and comprehensive approach with the follow-up to minimum impact, since, taking into account the expected number of diseases that have taken decisions and hospitals, it may be not only enough to understand, take and correct their response measures if such measures are not taken before.
The report on the risk evaluation results also listed public health measures to reduce the impact of pandemia.
The countries have only a small period of time in which they can intensify their control efforts to delay the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the loading of their health systems.
If not, the next days or weeks of health systems in other EU/ECE countries are covered with the pressure of patients that will be required for intensive treatment.
The result of the 2019 coronavir infection (COVID-19), the second type (SARS) of the respirator syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), was a tragedy for humanity: at this time in China and in other countries, more than 30,000 people had been ended, and the number of infected over 800,000.
Similar to the homological SARS-CoV virus that caused the development of a severe replicator syndrome in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transferred from the flight museum and produce East Symptoms using the same mechanism.
However, COVID-19 is different from the lower degree of disease and lower mortality than SARS, but it is much more aggressive and struck by older persons than youth, and men more than women.
In response to the deep growth of new disease publications in this article, an active and comprehensive review of the rapidly developed research object is proposed.
We are considering the basic aspects of epidemiology, ethiology, virus, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis of further therapy and prevention of this disease.
Although the answers to many questions are only found, we hope that this review helps us understand and eliminate dangerous diseases.
The pregnant (China New Year), who took place on 25 January 2020, became an unprecedented and forgotten event for all Chinese people who were urged to stay home for the whole feast and for many weeks after it.
Bearing in mind the high level of similarity to the coronavir (CoV), which was derived from a severe respirator syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) called the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the co-conciliation of the coronvirus infection 19 (COVID-19).
Epidemia began in the Chinese city of Uhana and quickly spread around the country, and then almost 50 other countries of the world.
According to 2 March 2020, more than 80 000 COVID 19 cases have been identified, and more than 40,000 patients have been rescued.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is a “food number one for society” and potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), less than 200 publications on COVID-19 have occurred over two months, including articles on his virus, epidemiology, ethiology, diagnose and treatment, starting from the first report of 7 January 2020, which has been determined as a result of the virus issued from a number of patients.
This review is an attempt to overcome the results of research in a new and fast development area.
As we can try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other predominant coronavirus, the coronavir of the South-East Respirator syndrome (MERS), which occurred in 2012.
We also discuss the facts of prevention and prevention of diseases, and some other less angry issues at this time.
The colonials were traditionally treated with the number of pathogens that are not mortally dangerous for humans and primarily caused up to 15 per cent of general respirator diseases 4.
However, in this centuries, we had two times faced high-patogenic human coronavirs, namely the coronavir of the heavy reservoir syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and the coronvirus of the South-East Repirator syndrome (MERS-COV), which had produced the success of diseases in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively and rapidly distributed to many other States at the terrible level of disease and mortality.
As a result, the current COVID-19 is the third infection of the coronavir in the history of humanity.
As indicated in Ris. 1.1, the report on classs in cases of unknown origin was first conducted to the National Commission for Health of the CNC from Mr. Huha on 31 December 2019.
After seven days, the genital responsibilities of the virus were issued.
On 15 January 2020, the first death case was registered in M. Whanya.
The epidemic was soon distributed in the neighbourhood of the city, of the provinces and of the country.
On January 20, it was known about the infection of nurses that made it possible to transfer human virus.
23 January, Mr. Whahn was introduced and stopped the work of urban public transport.
24 January, on the basis of the first clinical study of this disease, it was noted that 21 of 41 patients with the confirmed coronavir infection had direct contacts with the market of marine products in M. Whanya, which was considered to be sent to the point of dissemination of infection from unknown animal.
30 January, WHO declared that the delay of the coronavir is a global emergency situation in the field of public health.
At the time of the preparation of this report, the disease has been distributed throughout China and has already occurred in about 50 other countries around the world (ris.2).
In view of the intense development of situations, end-scale and risk of improvement, it is still to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, the following updated epidemia development picture (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_HX_HX1QA) was presented by 8 866 patients, including 4 021 patients.
SARS-CoV-2 was supported by all age groups, but in mainly 30-65-year-old persons were diseased.
Another half (47.7 per cent) of the infected persons had been over 50 years, very little than 20, and only 14 infected persons have not been fulfilled for 10 years.
SARS-CoV-2 inhibitment among men above (0.31/100 000), than among women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was distributed primarily in the province of Hubay and nearby regions.
In the meantime, the COVID symptoms were 5 (2 to 9) days before the diagnosis was decided.
The inquiry period was averagely 4.8 (3.0-7.2) day.
From the time of the symptoms before the death in the meantime, the day was 9.5 (4.8 to 13).
The basic reproduction indicator (R0) was 3.77 (95 per cent of CI: 3.51 to 4.05) and the corrected R0 was 2.23 to 4.82.
By 23 January 2020, an explanatory increase in the number of infected, assembled with large transports of China ' s New Year celebration.
Death among patients with confirmed diagnosis was 1,44 per cent (95 per cent of CI: 1,10 to 1,86 per cent), and the adjusted mortality rate among patients was 3,06 per cent (95 per cent of CI: 2,02 to 4,59 per cent).
The third main factors of risk in the case of COVID-19 were: gender (mother), age (≥60) and grave cases of pneumonia.
The colonavirs represent the subsequence of large defensive viruses contained in a meaningful RNA.
They can be divided into four types, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha and beta coronavirs are known.
In the case of the vulnerators of SARS and MERS glucoprotein depotry (S) are connected to cell receptors of the 2nd pharmaceutical pharmaceutical type (ACE2) and dipipipiptydazis-4 (DPP4) accordingly, following the member synthesis.
The cytopolam is released by the gene of viral RNA; after replication of viral genes, the NCN will be generated with glucoproteines and nucleocapsis proteins, which will then be removed by the membrane cell.
The first reports of SARS-CoV-2 were held on 10 January 2020.
It is established that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavir, which is 99.98% of the subsequent figures collected in the first grain of disease, on the market of Huanung Sea producers in M. Uhanya.
Genetically SARS-CoV-2 closer to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
With the educational electronic microscopic, the SARS-CoV-2 parts have been found in the ultra-atlantic sequences of human respiratory episode.
The ACE2 human farming has been a SARS-CoV-2-receptor, as well as SARS-CoV.
However, S-Protein SARS-CoV-2 is connected to ACE2 human farmment weaker than in the case of SARS-CoV, explaining the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less gravity disease than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 may also generate an unknown short-consumed white coded orf3b and a secreted white encoded orf8.
Orf3b virus bracky can play a certain role in the view of the virus pathogenity and give IFN expression; but orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motive.
On 18 February 2020, the collection of authors in Chapter with Choo (Zhou) submitted reports on the chroniclonic thematic structure of the full-mentioned ACE2 farm, with permission of 2.9 m, in the composite of B0AT1 aminoxissul.
They found that the complex in which open and close conformation was collected as a dime and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can link two S-protein, which serves by evidence when recognizing the coronavirus and infection of them.
B0AT1 may be a terapeutic medication in the medication of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Source and interim household
It is known that the source and SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV were the flights from which the virus has been transferred to a person through cyber and herbs respectively.
Through the philogenetic comparation of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronavirs, the first partners of SARS-CoV-2 have been a museum flight because 96% of new virus is identified as two similar to the SARS coronavirs, namely the SL-CoVZ45 and SL-CoVX21 coronavirs.
However, it remains unknown with what kind of interim household has become, by which the virus has been able to overcome the spectacular barrier and to cut the person; the way to transfer is still to find out.
Mr. Zzi (Ji) with colleagues suggested that virus transferers from flight mouse to man became a sweet in the process of geo-combination in S-Protein.
As a result of its study, Chinese scientists from Guangchou suggested that pangoline is a long-term mammal, which often uses the traditional Chinese medicine, is the potential interim partners of SARS-CoV-2, which are based on a 99 per cent genetic dimension between the panoline coronavir and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the difference between both genes is very large, so it is considered that the final results with specific evidence are not yet obtained (rise 33).
Physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2, most of them are still unknown.
In laboratory conditions, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may survive for 48 hours in the midst and up to 5 days at temperature below 20 °C and 40 to 50 per cent of power.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It is known that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to  ultraviolet and to 56 °C within 30 minutes; the effective blocking of the activeness of the virus may be efil, 75 per cent of the ethics, chloride deficiency, perus oxygen, chloroform and other growing manufacturers, but not clorgoxyne.
Human population generally does not have an immunity to SARS-CoV-2, so people are admissible to a new virus.
There is no current data on detailed immune reactions to SARS-CoV-2.
So we can only refer to the early study of other coronavirs, first part of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (res. 4.4).
According to the generally, the virus-receptors in the body of the virus will first recognise the immune system by means of the recognising images (ORD), including the P-type receptors, the Toll Receptors, the NOD receptors and the RIG-I receptors.
Through different virus mechanisms, the expression of deterioration factors, dendric cells and interferonal synthesis of type I, which maintain the dissemination of the virus and accelerate macropharmaceutical factors with regard to viral antigens.
However, through the N-Black SARS-CoV, immunal reaction may be avoided.
Soon in the fight with the virus, an adaptive immune reaction is included.
T-lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in the protection of the body.
CD4+ cells stimulate generation of virus-specific anti-virus in B cells, and CD8+ T cells immediately kill inflicted cell viruses.
T-Helpers produce anti-apopulative cytokine that helps protective cells.
However, the coronavir may inhibit functions of T cells, resulting in their programed hypothesis.
Guerreal immunity, including components such as C3a and C5a, and antikörper, also plays an important role in combating viral infection.
For example, the anticorps chosen from a resolved patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, immun system hyperreaction is a local education of a large number of free radios, which may be a cause of serious leakage and other organs, and in the worst scenario towards polio-related inadequacy and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is a classic proof, is more likely to affect older people with co-conciliant pathology and pregnant women.
The possibility of over-intelligence for persons who have a large number of viruses or have infringements in the immune system.
According to the results of investigating data on the first 425 cases of infection in Mr. Whahn, the average incubative period of SARS-CoV-2 is from 1 to 14 days, mainly 3 to 7 days.
However, the study of 1 099 cases showed that the incubative period in the average of 3 days was cut from 0 to 24 days.
The latter described above survey based on the demonography of 8 866 cases showed that the incubative period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) day.
It is very important to adjust the deadlines introduced in the currencies, taking into account the most accurate calculations of the incubation period, which allows to prevent the dissemination of the virus of the infected topics in which diseases are unhypothetic.
The general practice was a 14-day candidate for persons contacting virus or infiltred virus.
Should the cartinine be extended until 24 days?
The main and first symptom of COVID-19 often is a high temperature that can be the only demonstration of other symptoms, such as sophisticated cows, pain in the mouse, headwork, main pain, bearing in the mountain, sickness, pain in breast, diarrey, soft bone and red.
Some patients have noted the skin and (or) hypothesis a week after the start of the disease.
In difficult cases, diseases have been rapidly progressed, and patients have developed the island of reservoir disease, septic shock, metabolic acids and coaguopathy.
Patients with high temperatures and (or) symptoms of respirator disease and hepatic disorder should be checked for the initial diagnosis of diagnosis, even if no bread cell images are missed.
Demographic study, carried out at the end of December 2019, identified the following symptoms dissemination indicators: 98 per cent — high temperature, 76 per cent — sugar heat, 55 per cent — heat and 3 per cent; 8 per cent of the patients needed the art ventilation of light.
Similar results were received in two recent cases of family invasion and transfer of virus from unsympathized.
The compared results were received in 2012 in studies with MERS-CoV patients, with the main symptoms of high temperature (98 per cent), sugar (47 per cent) and refrigerator (55 per cent).
However, 80 per cent of them needed the art ventilation of lights, which is much higher than the patients with COVID-19, and corresponds to a higher percentage of MRS ' s mortality than COVID-19.
The diagnose (26 per cent) and torment was also observed in MRS patients (21 per cent).
The main symptoms of SARS patients are high temperatures (99-100%), sugar bottle (29-75 per cent), oxy (40-42 per cent), diarea (20-25 per cent) and heat pain (13-25 per cent), and light art ventilation requires 14-20 per cent of patients.
On February 14, COVID-19 was 2 per cent, and the overall number of confirmed cases in the world reached 66.576.
In comparison with this SARS mortality rate, 10 per cent of 8 096 cases were confirmed.
In the case of the demographic study carried out in June 2012, 37 per cent of 2 494 cases were confirmed.
According to the early study, the basic reproduction indicator (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was defined at the level 6,47 to 95 per cent of the reliable interval (CI) within 5,71 to 7,23, while R0 for SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
The comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV to identify symptoms, mortality level and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The higher capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to disseminate MRS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the mortality level in the case of the new virus below compared to two lasts.
Thus, maintaining SARS-CoV-2 epidemics will be much harder than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV episode.
There is often a place in the circle of one family or group of persons who are assembled together for any reason or who have been assembled together at any transport, such as the rail rail.
Patients often moved to M. Huhahn or in other regions suffering, lived there or contacted the infirmed or infected in the past two weeks before the start of the disease.
However, according to the data reports, people may be a portator of virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and the issued patients from the hospital may again be the portators of the virus, and this is an alarmed signal for the prolongation of the career.
In the early stage, the normal or decreased number of lecocytes (especially limfocides) in Perifer blood is normal or decreased.
For example, 1 099 patients with COVID-19 have been placed limfopens with 4x109/L levels, including 1x109/L, as well as higher aspargain aminotrasphesis and virus.
Some patients have been detected higher levels of peen, muscle grains and migolobine, and most patients observed the increased levels of C-reactive shell and the seat of erythrocytes in blood.
Patients with a degree of D-D-dimer disease, the blood-residue of fibrin was increased, and the number of limfocytes was constantly reduced.
In most patients with COVID-19, random cells have been detected with pathologies that characterize inequalities from both sides or inhibits in light.
Patients are often developed in typical pneumonia, injury to light and respiratory disease.
In the development of non-controlled reparation, copy of iron and progressing fibres, the ONG has caused significant gas violations.
The disfunction of pneumonics type I and II decreases the level of surface-active connections and increases the surface pressure, thus decreasing the ability to light decrease and increase the risk of decline.
Thus, the worst results of rentgenographic studies often correspond to the worst cases of disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the elimination of pneumonics, the formation of gluical membranes and interim limpocytic filters, and multi-year synchronisms in lyric patients died from diseases, corresponding to pathologies of virus infection and ORS and similarly found in patients with SARS and MERS.
The principal criteria for COVID-19 has been used to detect the method of SARS-CoV-2 by means of polymeric cep reaction with retrocryption (CCPs with rear transcryptase).
However, taking into account the high levels of false notoric results that can accelerate the epidemia development rate, from 13 February 2020 in China began to make a diagnose based on clinical identifications (which isn't more likely to believe in the GDP with the rear transcryption).
Similar situation with SARS diagnosis.
Thus, for effective diagnosis, the data of disease, clinical evidence, laboratory tests and results of rentgenographic studies is critically important and necessary.
Mr. Fenig Zhang (Feng Zhang) describes the application of the SERLOCK methodology based on CRISPR to discover SARS-CoV-2; this method allows to identify synthetic fractions of RNK SARS-CoV-2, with a quality of 20 × 10-18 millimeters/l to 200 × 10-18 millimeters/l (10-100 cops of the source micrometers) with the help of the individual polymers as well as without the complex equipment.
This new method, if it has been successfully checked on clinical prepatries, may significantly improve the sensitivity of tests and their performance.
Because of the absence of anti-related anti-conscious coronavirus experience, doctors may mainly provide to patients with COVID-19 only supporting therapy, while trying to use some therapeutic methods that have been used or proposed in the treatment of other coronavirs, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other virus diseases (Table 2).
These therapeutic methods include the current or potential use of antibodies, immunity administers, steroids, plasmas of lost patients, traditional Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It was proposed to use even the plasma of renal patients.
The pharmaceutical companies aim to develop anticorps and vaccines to combat virus.
At the first stages, SARS-CoV-2 attacks the main light, and may, at least, affect other ACE2-exposing bodies, such as a wild-case tract and skin.
However, violations of work and disadvantages of respiratory bodies are the main threat and cause of death of patients.
Thus, in order to facilitate symptoms and life saving, it is critically important to support the respiratory function, including the general oxygen therapy, high concentration of oxygen, non-invasive art ventilation and the invasive mechanical ventilation of milk, which are depending on the deterioration of disease.
Patients with heavy respirator symptoms need support in the form of an extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), modifyed method of extrapolmone blood selection used for the treatment of a threat to life of heart or respiratory inadequacy.
Furthermore, the main importance for patients with SARS-CoV-2 is to maintain water-solar balance, prevent and treatment of second infections and septic shock, and to protect the functions of vital organs.
It is known that cytokine stroke is the result of hyperreactions of the immune system of patients identified by SARS and MERS virus.
The cytokine storm represents the form of a system-sharing process developed in response to the cytokine series, including TNFal, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IFNAL, IFN _BAR_ and MCP-1.
These cytokines lead to immunities to large numbers of free radio chains, which are the main cause of UNO development and polyorganic deficiency.
In the treatment of quotine storm, especially in patients in a serious state, the importance of immunity is important.
For the treatment of cytokine stomach, corticosteroides and tocilizums were used, monoculent anti-corticol serving as an interlayin-6 inhibitor.
The number of other methods of cytokine treatment based on immunity is the modulation of immune reaction to control T cells; the IFN- Gamma, IL-1 and TNF processing cytokines; the channel of cytokine; the use of cytokine, the cytocin-signators of 4 and the hyytodetalastic inhibitors.
In order to reduce the degree of breathing processes, SARS viruses are widely used as immunity administers.
Nevertheless, steroids in large surveys have no use in the treatment of heavy leakages in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, they may cause serious adverse effects, especially avashal osteonics that have significantly caused prognosis.
However, short corticosteroid rates are recommended in small and medium-sized surveys when treatment with COVID-19 patients are critical.
At the time of the preparation of this document, there is no confirmed effective anti-virus therapy.
However, the internal remdecivir, nanleoid analysis, was effectively treated by the American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is recently developed by a antiviral preparatory, originally developed by Gilead company for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and the Marburgian virus.
Afterwards, the rhedesivir also demonstrated the possibility of other viruses with single-centured RNAs, including MERS and SARS virus.
In addition to these data, the Gilead company provided the data of the medication composition of China to investigate partner research on patients identified by SARS-CoV-2, and the results of these research are not tolerated.
Furthermore, balicitinib, alpha interferon, lopenar/ritonavir and fisheries were proposed as possible therapy options for patients with close respirator symptoms.
Combined treatment with the use of ritonavir/ritonavir may be associated with diarrees, tosnotes, routines, breasts and other godly acts.
It should be careful to monitor the interaction of these preparations with other drugs designated to patients.
Plasm of rebuilding patients and anticorps
Blood clothing in patients with current disease has been used for the treatment of other patients suffering from the same disease, or for healthy populations.
Indeed, the blood of lost patients often contain relatively high amounts of anticorps to combat pathogènes.
The antiquity is in immunoglobuline designed by B-lymfocytes to combat pathogens and other foreign objects; they identify individual pathogen molecules and are directly neutralizing them.
On the basis of this preference, the blood plasma was set out from the group of patients resulting from COVID-19, which then induced 10 degrees of ill-patients.
During 24 hours, their symptoms have increased, reduced the rescue and the virus burden, and increased oxygen saturation.
However, to propose a massive application of this method before the specific therapy, it is required until the verification and non-disciplinary explications are not made.
In addition, in view of the therapeutic effect, some deficiencies related to the application of the plasma should be carefully studied.
For example, antikörpers may exceed the immune system and cause the symptoms of cytokine emissions that, taking into account the toxicity, are potentially threatened to life.
The concentration of anti-carbons in blood is normally insufficient, and the plasmas for the treatment of patients in critical states are needed.
It is not easy to develop and make specific anticorps enough to combat global epidemic.
Thus, more important and practically to determine the B- cells of resolved patients and to determine the genetic code of effective anti-corns or scraning to find effective anti-virus flows critically important.
So we can move immediately to the mass production of anticorps.
Chineses used traditional medicines to treat different diseases.
However, its effectiveness depends significantly on the combination of many form components which are different from the diagnosis of disease based on Chinese traditional medical theories.
Most effective components still are unknown or have an indefinite action because they are difficult to determine and check these components or their optimistic combination.
Today, because of the lack of effective specific therapie of COVID-19, traditional Chinese medicine was one of the main alternative methods of treatment of patients with a easy and medium-sized symptoms gravity or for patients that were coherent after the heavy stage of disease.
For example, capsules Shu Fan Zze Du (Shu Feng Jie Du) and Len Hua Zin Van (Lian Hua Qing Wen) were effectively recognized in the treatment of COVID-19.
The largest part of COVID-related patients in various provinces, in which the Chinese traditional medicine was used in treatment with 87 per cent of patients, including Ghanas (63.7 per cent), Ninicio (50 per cent) and Hungary (50 per cent), while in the Province of Hubaya, where the Chinese traditional medicine was used only to treat only 30 per cent of the COVID-19 patients, was fixed as the lowest until the survivors (13 per cent).
However, this is sufficiently severe comparison, since the evaluation should be taken into account by the number of other factors of impact, such as the number of patients and the level of their diseases.
18 February 2020, Mr. Bolly Chun (Boli Zhang) and his colleagues published research materials, which were performed in comparison with the treatment of the treatment of Western Medicine and combinated treatment in Western Medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that the periods of normalization of the body temperature, elimination of symptoms and medical assistance in the stations were less than in patients who used the combination of the methodology of Western and Chinese traditional medicine, except in patients with only western methods.
It is more surprised that the percentage of patients who began to deteriorate symptoms (from a heavy state) was noted below in the group that had been treated through the combination of Western and Chinese traditional medical methods than in the group only treated by western methods (7.4 per cent compared to 46.2 per cent) and the mortality level in the first group was below (8.8 per cent compared to 39 per cent).
However, the effectiveness and safety of the Chinese traditional medicine still requires more closely controlled research carried out in more and more regions.
The specific interest also represents the possibility of describing the action mechanism and explaining the aspects of the effectiveness of the components used in the Chinese traditional medical methods or their combinations.
Patients suspected or confirmed the existing COVID-19 are primarily experienced with strong fear of abuse and even mortal diseases, and people who are closed at the carrantin also experienced a smoke, unity, and more deformation.
Moreover, the symptoms of infection, such as livery, hypoxia, and cashel, as well as disordering treatments, such as corticosteroids, may cause even more anxiety and psychological stress.
In the early stages of SARS’s illness was reported about several psychiatric diseases, including chronic depression, increased concerns, illness, psychototic abuse, symptoms, divisions, and even sozial conduct.
The obligation to monitor contacts and cancers in the number of measures undertaken by the health bodies for COVID-19 may increase the concern and feeling of guilty related to the dissemination of infections, carrants and social climate in their families and friends.
Consequently, psychological and psychological assistance should be provided to patients with COVID-19, persons under suspicion and contact with them, as well as all the other people that it requires.
In psychological support, multi-profile posts of psychiatric assistance should be formed, clearly updated with regular and accurate information on SARS-CoV-2 epidemics and treatment plans and use of professional electronic devices and applications in avoiding close personal contact.
Effective vaccine plays an important role to overcome the infected animals and infected persons to infectious guests, and are often used in addition to antivirus therapy used to maintain episodes caused by new viruses.
Vacuum-based S-protein work was carried out to develop long-term and high-active neutralism antibodies and (or) protected immunity to SARS-CoV.
In animal studies, living weak vaccines from SARS virus have been developed.
However, before the start of clinical studies, the effectiveness of these possible vaccine in natural conditions should be determined when they are used in the age of patients, the model of the mortal forests and the protection of zone viruses.
It may be reason for the fact that SARS's virus is gone 17 years ago, and since then no new case has been reported.
At the same time, constraint cases and classs of diseases identified by MERS, which are born in the Middle East and distributed in other regions through the conservation of zone sources in the arcades of the edenics.
For combating MRS, vaccination strategies have been developed with the use of inactived virus, DNA plasmas, viral vectors, novels, virus parts and recombinant white elements, and some of these strategies have been evaluated on animals.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunity persons is an urgent and critical task that requires a decision to maintain the epidemia.
There are, however, serious difficulties to delay (in the average of 18 months) to develop vaccine and dynamic renamement of coronavirs.
As previously unknown disease, COVID-19 only begins to show a full picture of the clinical tissue by thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients have been slowly relief without complications.
However, COVID-19, similarly SARS and MERS, also related to high-frequencies and high mortality among patients with heavy disease.
In this regard, health bodies are critically important to form a prognosis model to determine the priority of their measures, especially in areas where the lack of resources is observed.
Based on the current clinical studies, the following factors may affect the prognosis of COVID-19 patients or related (Table 33):
Aging was the most important factor in prognosing the disease of SARS virus, which also corresponds to the truth in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 is mainly affected by patients from 30 to 65 years of age, 47.7 per cent of whom over 50 years, according to the above study of 8 866 cases.
Patients who needed intensive therapy were more likely to have source diseases and complications and were significantly higher than patients who were not required (in average 66 years against 51), which shows that age is a pregnancy factor for patients with COVI-19.
Paul: SARS-CoV-2 infiltration among men above than women (0.31/100 000 against 0.27/100 000), as mentioned above.
Disorder and complication: in patients with COVID-19 who are required to intensive treatment, above the possibility of degree of microarm damage and arithmics.
Cardiological явs were also the principal cause of the death of patients with SARS.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 could also be linked to the ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which could cause a violation of the breach in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and original diseases are closely linked and can find results.
Defects identified in the laboratory studies: the level of the blood-reactive shell reflects the degree of the heavyness of the skin or damage, and it is proposed to be considered as a potential preventive factor for disease, therapy reactions and the final recovery.
It was also proposed to take into account the relationship between the P-reactive white level, the degree of disease and the COVID-prognosis.
Furthermore, the results may also increase the level of lactodehydrogenasis, asparagine-aminotranfesis, alanin-aminotranphesis and creatinics.
These farms are allocated by various bodies, especially by hearts and peninsula, and they are delayed by the tissues.
Therefore, they are traditionally markers of heart-sharing or pending disfunction.
The basic clinical symptoms: to predict results and complications in the treatment of COVID-19 should be taken into account with other factors for the rentgenographic study of the raw cell and the development of the clinical symptoms for a period.
The use of steroids: as already described above, steroids are immune advertising that are widely used for infectional diseases as an additional therapy to reduce the deterioration of the deterioration process.
Because in the treatment of patients with serious forms of SARS, corticosteroids were widely used, many of the survivors have developed avashal osteonics that became a cause of vital disability and low quality of life.
Thus, in the case of the use of steroids for the treatment of COVID-19 patients, these preparations should therefore be designated in small and short courses.
Psychological stress: As already described above, many patients suffer from an unexpected strong stress because they are often to survive long-term career periods, to deal with high uncertainty and to observe the death of their parents and other patients.
In order to eliminate stress in such patients and help them to return to normal life, psychological consultations must be conducted and long-term supported.
According to the demographic studies at this time, COVID-19 epidemia seems to be different from SARS epidemia.
In addition to replications in lower respiratory ways, SARS-CoV-2 virus, such as other coronavirs that cause ordinary illnesses, can successfully grow in high respiratory ways and cause weak symptoms or no symptoms at the early stage of infection.
For this reason, patients in which the previous stage of disease or not yet ended in the incubative period may, by conducting their ordinary life, distribute virus in significant scales, which significantly cause epidemic control.
However, the transmission of SARS-CoV virus was considered when patients were harder, in most cases in the early stage of infection.
Thus, today's COVID epidemia is a larger SARS epidemia, and it is harder to control.
Currently, there is a great work in China that has been declared the general career in Ms. Uhahn and neighbouring cities, as well as the predecessor regime for the population to stop the scope of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Although these measures cause great damage to the economy and other fields of life in the country, the number of new patients identified is reduced, and it is said that epidemia is breathed.
In the same optimistic accounts, the disease ends to March, and the intake phase has been extended from 3 to 4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hutter (Paul Hunter) with colleagues pointed out that the COVID-19 summary, which seems to be much higher than SARS, would not be ended in 2020.
Researchers from the group called Irra Longini (Ira Longini) have made a model to predict episode end and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 virus could be struck to two thirds of the world's population.
The Canadian Specialists Group reported that SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected in skins and skins that were taken from patients who were shocked and discovered from the hospital two weeks ago, as indicated that new virus may become cyclic disease with similar grips.
However, the reduction in the new cases in China is concerned, pointing out that the current strategy could have affected effects.
According to the original prognosis, Ebola was to be shocked up to a million people and to be a cause of pollululion.
But by a strict carantin and the exclusion of diseases at the end of the end, it has been able to control.
There is a probability that, like SARS-CoV virus, the infectious capacity of SARS-CoV-2 virus can be decreased, and it is going to disappear or convert in less pathogical virus that is associated with humans.
The following is compared with COVID-19 epidemies with SARS and MERS (ris. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by high speed of transmission through box or injury, as well as by direct contact with the polluted virus.
The virus was also discovered in the chale, which means that it is also possible to transfer oral-fective ways.
According to one of the last studies, 41 per cent of the 138 studies may have been the result of hospital infection, including 17 patients with other previously identified diseases and 40 nurses.
Consequently, serious precautions should be taken to protect the people, particularly health workers, social workers, their parents, colleagues, and even bilateral, contacting with patients or infected.
The first line of defence against the risk of infection is a mask for persons; and the surgical masks, and the N95 (Series No. 1860s) replicators are helping to control the dissemination of viruses.
Surgical masks do not allow microcaps from potentially infected flows into the air and sit on the surfaces they can be transferred to the surrounders.
However, only the N95 massages (Series No. 1860s) can be protected from the respiration of viron from 10 to 80 mm, they have only 5 per cent of virus; the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the same size as SARS-CoV, and both of them is a large amount of 85 nm.
As parts may even pass over five surgical masks together, medical workers directly contacted with patients must take the N95 class (series No. 1860s), not surgical masks.
In addition to mass, medical employees should be funded on the figure of the protected shell to further reduce contact with the virus.
Virus can also fall in the body through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, the doctor was inflicted by SARS-CoV-2, despite his massage of N95, and the virus may have been in his body.
The medical employees should therefore also take transparent shoes or protected closure of the type.
All populations in the suffering or potentially substantive threats of the regions are often recommended to switch the hands of the deficit funds, attempting to not go out of the house, respecting self-resolution, and to limit contacts with potentially infected persons.
The acceptable distance to the patient is considered a distance around a meter.
These measures reduce the risk of infection and prevent the dissemination of virus.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus was not previously known, the high-scale of humanity with SARS-CoV reported on 7 January 2020 should be a alarmed signal for China, taking into account the experience of SARS in 2003.
However, only after 19 January 2020, the Director of the Headquarters of the Control of Diseases in Mr. Huhan has supported the citizens, reporting that the new virus has a low contagious and limited reproductiveness in the transfer of humans to humans and that prevention of dissemination and control of diseases is not a problem.
This statement was significantly reduced the social tension, especially during the time that the country was prepared to celebrate the New Year of China and was critically critical when diseases could be held in the borders of Mr. Huhanh with minimum losses.
Chinese health organizations can improve this serious lesson and in the future significant improvements.
For example, health bodies should: (1) make more care of public statements, since each word takes into account the citizens and may affect their relationship and decisions; (2) monitor and react to the non-disciplinary information from the clinic, but not expect official reports from the doctors and officials; (3) to take more decisive measures to maintain the potential epidemie at the previous stages of its development, but not to prevent publicity; and (4) to enhance the institutional and effective teachings to enhance the information of the population of the epidemic diseases and the regular improvement of the system.
COVID-19, previously referred to as an unexpected coronavirus by a severe replicator syndrome of second type (SARS-CoV-2), began at the end of December 2019.
Within more than two months of disease, the whole China has been covered and the document was distributed in 50 countries in the world.
Because virus is very similar to the coronavir of a heavy respirator syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to the symptoms of a heavy respirator syndrome (SARS), the COVID-19 reaction has resulted.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are significant in the context of epidemia and treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people, and men more than women; the percentage of serious cases and mortality among older people is also higher than among youths.
Mortality in the result of SARS above than in the case of COVID-19,91 per cent compared to 1.44 per cent).
Patients with COVID-19 distribute the virus even in symptoms of disease, while HIV patients and SARS are usually affected only in serious diseases, so that the distribution of COVID-19 is more difficult than SARS.
This is partly explaining why SARS-CoV-2 is much faster and larger than SARS-CoV.
Some patients with COVID-19 may have a negative common switch on the existing SARS-CoV-2.
On the other hand, the treatment of patients can redistribute the positive virus tests.
All of this increases the risk of dissemination of virus.
In such a rapid progress, the COVID-19 research remains until some important issues have been resolved, namely:
What is the origin of SARS-CoV-2 virus?
Despite the discovery of 96 per cent between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-profit coronavirs, we cannot still say that SARS-CoV-2 was infected from the flight mouse.
What kind of animal became a interim type of virus transferred from the original heritage, such as a flight mouse, to a man?
No answers to the first and second questions, we can not be sure that we can stop the path of transfer, and the epidemic circumstances may at any time be disappointed.
Moderation at the molecular level and biochemistry demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 was linked to ACE2, but what is the fact that virus is involved in the respiratory cells and the following pathological changes?
Is the virus also linked to the manufacturers of ACE2 cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we can not ensure a straight and accurate determination of diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long is epidemia?
How is genetic evolution in the process of transmission of man to man?
Is he a cause of world pandemia, will he also disappear as SARS or will it periodically reciprocate such a grip?
These aspects have a primary importance, but to search for answers to these and many other questions, it requires time.
However, we don't have any other choice, except what it was necessary, to stop epidemia as soon as possible and return to normal life.
Zonic origin of human coronavirus
Mutuation and adjustment have stimulated the coevolution of coronavirs (CoV) and their portraits, including people, over the millenniums.
Before 2003, two human coronavirs (HCOV) were known to make easy diseases, such as normally simplicity.
We have changed our opinion of the catastrophic and dangerous syndrome for life as well as of the Middle East Respirator syndrome (MERS).
The demonstration of a severe severe replicator syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) in Central China at the end of 2019 has reiterately focused on the coronvirs and surprised us with high transmission, but weaker patogenity of this virus compared to the parental SARS-CoV virus.
The coronaviral infection of humans represents zones, and the understanding of its zone origin will be very useful.
Most human coronavirs originate from the flight museums which are not pathogenic.
It is also known by the interim mediators of some human coronavirs.
Determination of animals directly affects prevention of human diseases.
A study of the interactions of coronavirus animals may also be lighted on the pathogenesis of the coronavir in people.
In this review, we provide existing data on the seven human coronavirus, focusing on the history of their discovery, as well as their zone origin and ways of intervision.
It is important to note that we have a comparation and comparison of different human coronavirs with regard to viral evolution and genetic recombination.
In this context, it is also considered by the current epidemic of the disease of coronavir found in 2019 (COVID-19).
Furthermore, the conditions required to change the media and the impact of the evolution of the virus to the heavyness of disease are noted.
The coronavirs relate to the family of Coronaviridae, which represents a group of defensive viruses with one positive and pollutant RNA ring.
These viruses, with the most largest part of the GNC-containing virus, which consists from 26 to 32.000 nucleotics, have been called through their form, which reminds the coron when considering electronic microscope.
In view of the structure, the coronavirs contained non-segmentated genes with the identical organization.
About two thirds of the gene contained two large openly open counting frameworks (ORF1a and ORF1b) translated into the protection of the pp1a and pp1ab platforms.
These proteins are further transformed to generate 16 non-structured sheets marked in nSP1~16.
The last part of the genome contains the open counting frameworks for structed whites, including the switch (S), the switch (E), the membrane white (M) and the nucleoprotein (N).
In other lines, the coron-virus also encoded a number of line-specific acessor whites.
Based on the differences in the white sides\ coronavirs are divided into four species (alpha, beta, hamma and delta coronavirus), the beta coronavirs includes the majority of human coronavirs and shares four lines (A, B, C and D).
There are phylogenic evidence that the genetic source of most alpha and beta coronavirs is the flight and griss, while birds are the main reserve for gamma and delta coronavirs.
Thousands of coronavirs continued to overcome intervision barriers, and some of them evolutionated to the dangerous humans of pathogens.
To this day, seven human coronavirus are known.
The human alphacoronavir HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63.
The latest five betacoronavirs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, coronavirus of a severe respirator syndrome (SARS-CoV), the coronavirus of the southern Eastern Respirator Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and the coronavirus of the second SARS-CoV-2 severe respirator syndrome.
Human coronavirs HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63 are generally calling symptoms of easy shape, such as simply and (or) diar.
Unlike them, SARS-CoV virus, MERS-CoV and recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 patients, there are severe infection diseases of lower respiratory ways in comparedly more than the number of patients with the higher possibility of developing close respirator disease (ORS) and detection of internal symptoms.
The first part of the human coronavirus HCOV-229E, B814, was obtained from the sampling of patients ill in the 1960s.
Since then, comprehensive studies have been collected more detailed knowledge of HCoV-229E and HCOV-OC43 viruses that cause local infection symptoms.
Indeed, there was an overall acceptance of the concept that the imposing of human coronavirus was considered in general unfortunate.
SARS was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in the current history in 2003; over 80,000 people had been dispersed and the overall mortality rate was about 10 per cent.
Decades later, the Middle East Respirator syndrome (MERS) has led to long-term epidemie in the Arab semi-orienter, and the disease has been gradually distributed in the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus (2019-nCOV), which was then transferred to SARS-CoV-2, is the rebuilding of the current coronavir infection of 2019 (COVID-19), which led to more than 3 120 lives on 3 March 2020, and the number of 910,000 infected.
The emergency signal is obtained and the peace must be prepared to the dominant SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronavirs have zone origin, their sources are a flight mouse, museum or domestic animals.
Many data collections have shown in the benefit of the evolutional nature of all human coronavirs from the flight museums, with which viruses have been well adapted and which are not patogical, but demonstrated a wide genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemia left China and all the world a serious call for medical, scientific, social and moral view.
A study of the zone mechanism of human coronavirs can understand their natural history that moves to their evolution and factors that limit intervisional transactions.
It may also raise or accelerate the search for a reserve, a intermediate and amplified SARS-CoV-2 portator, which is very important to prevent re-distribution of disease in the future.
This review contains general information on the origin, intervisional transmission and the pathogenesis of human coronavirs.
In particular, we are marking and considering the following general feature: the original viruses from which human coronavirs have occurred, mostly not pathogenic for their reserve media, but have a patogenic nature after the intervisious transfer of a new media.
We also analyze the trend of evolution of human coronavirs, according to which transmission is often associated with the deficiency of pathogical properties.
In the same context, the outcome of the current SARS-CoV-2 results is considered.
The colony of animals has been known since the end of the 1930s.
Before HCOV-229E virus was initially obtained from the sample of the poultry of patients with illness, different coronavirs were in different infected animals, including index, museum, cows, sweats, cooks and dogs.
The past decades have been identified by seven human coronavirs.
Table 1 provides a short history of the discovery of human coronavirs in chronological terms.
The first stage of HCOV-229E virus was obtained from patients’ respiratory ways with the infection of high respiratory routes in 1966; the virus was further adapted to the increase in lymph cells of WI-38.
Patients, infected by HCOV-229E virus, showed fair symptoms, including the main pain, depression, general injury and torment, while high temperatures and cash were observed in 10 to 20 percent.
In 1967, HCOV-OC43 virus was deleted from the organic culture and the sequence of a series of muscles in the brain.
The clinical signs of HCOV-OC43 infection are similar to the infection of the virus of HCOV-229E, with the symptoms of which are not excluded from the incidence of other pathogenes, such as glup type A and ritovirus.
And HCOV-229E virus, and HCOV-OC43 virus have global dissemination in the world and normally transferred in winters.
The main incubation period of these two viruses is less than weeks and the disease should be over two weeks.
According to the results of volunteer research, healthy people in the virus of HCoV-229E have developed a common simple shape.
Only in few patients with weak immunity had a serious infection of low respiratory ways.
SARS, also known as typical pneumonia, became the first for the history of humanity a well-documented pandemia identified by the human coronavir and the manufacturer of the disease was the third of the human coronal virus identified.
The first case of SARS disease was identified at the end of 2002 in the Chinese province of Guandon.
During the SARS epidemic, 8 096 cases of disease and 774 death were documented and diseases were distributed in many countries and various continents.
Unlike superactive distributors, each diseaser was able to blew nearly two persons; the incubative period was 4 to 7 days and the skin of the viral burden was at the 10th end of the disease.
Patients infected by SARS-CoV have markedly occurred pain in muscles, main pain, high temperature, general disappearance and awareness, and among the more later symptoms were the shock, the shock and the respiratory insufficiency.
Distributed laboratory indicators from standards at SARS are limfopulation, pending tests and higher creaticity levels.
Patients with SARS also observe diffused alveolar damage, epidemic cell proliferation and increased macrophage levels.
About 20 to 30 per cent of patients are required in intensive treatment and mechanical ventilation of light.
In such difficult cases, unlike lower respiratory ways, other bodies may also be infected, including the organs of heavy and smooth traction, pending and skin, which are generally associated with cytokine shore, which can be placed an annually, especially for patients with weak immunity.
The first virus was issued from the open biops of the sick parent who came to Hong Kong from Guango.
Since then, huge efforts have been aimed at studying human coronavirs.
In the end of 2004, HCOV-NL63 was elected in a 7-month child from the Netherlands.
First, it was established that it was mainly affected by children of older age, older people and patients with weak immunity and repirate diseases.
For HCOV-NL63 diseases, such as smokes, conjunctits, high temperatures and bronchiolits are characterized.
Another independent study describes the same virus from the national material taken in the 8-month boy of the Netherlands who suffers the pneumonia.
The virus was discovered in the Netherlands, but in fact it is totally distributed.
According to reports, HCOV-NL63 is a cause of nearly 4,7 per cent of largely distributed reservoir diseases, and the diseases caused to be the beginning of summer, spring and winter.
HCOV-NL63 is linked to a constructive laring, which also calls a crop.
HCOV-HU1 was elected in Hong Kong in the same year by a 71-year-old man who has been hosted with pneumonia and bronzeoly.
Besides the nervous pneumonia and bronchiolite, HCOV-HKU1 connects to aesthetic disease.
Like HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 virus, which causes a simple shape, have been identified throughout the world.
All of these four human coronavirs that caused infections were well adapted to people, and their mutations, involved by high-pathological diseases, normally were poor, although the incidents were and their causes were not known, as in a rather example of HCOV-NL63, which, according to recent reports, caused a serious infection of lower diet roads in China.
Normally, obtaining the efficiency of transmission and maintenance of human body, these human coronavirs are less vulnerable or pathogenic.
The Coronavirus of the Middle East Respirator syndrome (MERS-CoV) was first chosen in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from the light of 60-year-old patient with the isolement of pneumonia and generic inadequacy.
Most laboratoryly confirmed cases had been placed in the Middle East, but in the various European countries and Tunisia, transport cases have been registered and distributed through epidemic second cases of invasion in close contacts.
Another secondary deal of 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
Clinical symptoms of the south-East respirator syndrome (MERS) remind the symptoms of a severe respirator syndrome (SARS) for both infections that have been progressed in pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also disadvantaged sexual inadequacy that MRS is still different from the other diseases caused by coronavirs that were transferred to the person.
More than 30 per cent of patients have been observed with iron-case symptoms, such as diarea and rabbit.
As at 14 February 2020, more than 2 500 laboratoryly confirmed cases in the Middle East Respirator syndrome with high mortality levels (34.4 per cent), MERS-CoV is therefore considered one of the most known mortal viruses.
During the midst until the end of December 2019, Mr. Huhahn of the Chinese province of Hubei has been identified with pneumonia, which is now linked to the infection caused by the coronavirus of the 2nd respirator syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The World Health Organization announced that the continued infection of lower respiratory ways called SARS-CoV-2 was a global emergency situation in the field of public health, and the disease has been called Coronavir 19 (COVID-19).
At 3 March 2020, 90 053 cases have been registered in the world, with about 3,4 per cent of death.
It should be noted that mortality in the Chinese province of Jubai is 4.2 per cent, and under its limits is 1,2 per cent.
SARS-CoV-2, such as SARS and MERS coronavirs, causes a heavy respiratory infection characterized by increased temperature, cash and heat.
Some patients also observe diarrey.
The pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and is able to quickly move into the syndrome of respiratory inadequacy.
Despite the similarity of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, taking into account the high geometry of nucleoid results (82%), these viruses, however, form different winds of philosogenic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogical but has more ability to transfer with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
The cases of unsymmetric SARS-CoV-2 infiltration are registered, which indicates the ability to breathe rapidly around the world.
As a result of the comparation and comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other six human coronavirs, there are important aspects and differences.
First, coronavirs have similar incubation periods and the duration of their diseases.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates the same trend as the remaining six human coronavirs.
Second, the symptoms of COVID-19 are between SARS-CoV and four human coronavirs caused infections (e.g. HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, infections of SARS-CoV-2 are similar that are mostly observed in the infection of human coronavirs caused infections, including non-specific, light symptoms or even lack of symptoms.
On the other hand, as in the SARS-CoV infection, a small subgroup of COVID-19 cases can be set, although the proportion is a little lower.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also notes interesting legislation, characterized as for human coronavirs caused infections, as well as for SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is, as at least, the same higher than human coronavires that cause infections.
On the other hand, it should still be checked whether SARS-CoV-2 transmission is decreased with each successive transition of the virus (e.g. by the identification of each next person), such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CV.
Finally, like other human coronavirs caused infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in the images of cala.
We still need to answer whether the path to SARS-CoV-2 is the same significant (also in some circumstances), as in the case of SARS-CoV.
Special interest is also the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 period, characterized for human coronavirs caused infections.
However, the future development of COVID-19 will depend on the features of SARS-CoV-2, including transmission, pathogensity and sustainable dissemination after the transition of people.
All four human coronavirs that caused nervous infections with simple form symptoms were well adapted to people.
On the other hand, these people may have been well adapted to these four human coronavirs.
Other words, and those and others could be called only after the pandemics of human coronavirs in the past.
Human coronavirs that cause serious diseases in people, and people in whom human coronavirs cause serious diseases have not just survived.
In order to do so, human coronavirs should be replacing in human body sufficiently, so that additive mutations have been collected against the density factors.
In this sense, the SARS-CoV-2 switch is further extended and more people will be infected, so that virus is fully adapted to humans.
If it is correctly adapted, his transfer between people will be difficult to stop through the career or other activities of control of infectional diseases.
For many years, the population circle four external coronavirs, which make a common circle in people with healthy immunity.
These viruses do not require animal reserve.
High-coated SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV coronarians did not adapt enoughly to the human, and their transmission could not be supported.
They must be kept and multiplied in their zone reserves and search for cases of accident in human admissible mixes, perhaps through one or more interim or enhanced mediators.
SARS-CoV-2 has a similar features, as well as SARS-CoV/MERS-CV, and four outdoor HCV viruses.
It is quite easy to be delivered as an emergency HCV, at least at the time.
But he's more pathogenic than involuntary HCV, and less patogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It is still seeing whether it is fully adapted to humans and whether it will circle in the human environment without the reserve or the interim animal mediator.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCV virus, we will be able to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, interim, stimulating and reserving virus portators.
Life Evolutional Nocide of HCOV if it has a close-general preconceiving with the same high-level homology with nucleotics.
Previous virus is usually well adjusted and non-patogenic in this portal.
Similarly, the reserve portator has been continuously transferred to HCV for a long time.
In both cases, nuts are naturally infected and are natural HCV or their parent virus.
Unlike that, if only HCOV was put into a interim portrait directly before or around the time when he was brought to man, he was not well adapted to the new media and often patogenic.
This interim mediator can be a zone source of human infection and play the role of the reinforcement of the median virus, and then delivered people to increase the infection of people.
HCOV may be transferred to a tube infection if it is not possible to keep the transfer inside a interim portrait.
Instead, HCV viruses can also adapt to the interim mediator and even establish long-term edenity.
In that case, a interim driver is a natural reserve puzzle.
Epidemiological data retrospectively showed that the SARS paciente had an anonymous contact with wild-protection animals (children).
For further security studies, trademarks showed that the anti-IgG anti-filtre to the SARS-CoV virus was compared to the population in general.
The Ghima larvata (Paguma larvata) and the logo-of-old animal dog on the markets of the living animals have become the first established virus portators such as and almost identical SARS-COVs.
It was fully confirmed that after the destruction of all civilians on the market, SARS cases were no longer reported.
At the same time, SARS-CoV did not determine, in most cases, that it would make the conclusion that gimalian citrus could only be used as a interim relief rather than a natural SARS-CoV reserve.
It is noted that, since 80 per cent of the different animals in the Guanchhoo market have an anticorps to SARS-CoV, it could be possible to exclude the possibility that interim pollutants can also serve a number of small types of muscles.
All of them say that the SARS-CoV virus is smooth.
The following search for a natural SARS-CoV-cov detected a close-general CoV flight museum, which was called by a typical coronavir of HKU3 subconquent aircraft museum (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HUU3) and presented in Chinese subcontinent flight museums.
These positive museums to SARS-CoV and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genetic follow-up.
These and other flights coronavirs are 88 to 92 per cent of the same homology as the SARS CoV.
These studies set the basis of the new concept that the flight museum became a porteur of new human pathogens.
A number of SARS-profit coronavirs (SL-CoV) were also identified in the flight mouse, but no of them, except one of which designates WIV1, could not be excluded as a living virus.
It is known that the SARS-CoV receptor is a human converging angiotensin 2 (ACE2) farming.
It was shown that WIV1, obtained from the delay of a flight museum, ACE2, cylinder and human receptor was used as a cell input receptive.
It is amazing that the reverse of HIV-related patients with SARS could neutralize WIV1.
Today WIV1 is the most closest parent of SARS-CoV in the flight museum, shared by 95 per cent of the nucleoid coefficients.
Despite the high geology between these two viruses, WIV1 is generally not the direct parent virus SARS-CoV, and the flight museum is not an immediate reserve of SARS-CoV.
The philosogenetic analysis relates to the same group as the CoV-HKU4-year museums, and the CV-HKU5-year museums.
CV-HKU4 years of age and MERS-CoV are using the same mediator, the dipipiptidazo-4 (DPP4) for virus detection.
Consequently, the depending RNK-RNA polymerators of MERS-CoV philosogeneticly closer to the compounds of the beta coronavirs identified in Europe and Africa.
We still have no living MERS-CoV virus in the wild flight museums.
The nucleoid hypothems of MERS-CoV and its closest parent of CV-HU25 are only 87 per cent.
The flight mouse couldn't be an immediate reserve loader of MERS-CoV virus.
On the other hand, research in the Middle East showed that the unions are serialized to neutralized antitels, specific for MERS-CoV, as well as those of the south-East in many African countries.
Life MERS-CoV, the identical virus identified in people, was removed from the narrow shoes of single snakes, which reaffirms the role of the slaughter as the real reserve portators of MERS-CoV.
It should also be noted that slights, experienced by MERS-CoV, have observed low symptoms but massive virus administeration.
It is not only that the infected viral has produced the virus in a respirator, but also the physical and oral way, which is also the principal way to identify the virus in the flight mouse.
However, there are still questions, since many confirmed cases of the Middle East Respirator syndrome did not have an anonymous contact with the observations before the symptoms and are rightly related to the transmission of humans or the transfer of unknown channels including uninstalled animal species, which are the transporters of MERS-COV.
SARS-CoV-2 geology corresponds to 96.2% of the RaTG 13-year museums set in the Asian subcontinent Rhinolophus afnis.
Like in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, diversity between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is too large to include their parents' relationships.
That is what the flight mouse could and not be an immediate reserve of SARS-CoV-2 if only in the future is not found the identical coronavirs of the flight museum.
Proposedly, direct animal mediators of SARS-CoV-2 should be among wild species who are sold and died on the oil market of marine products, which were associated with many main cases of COVID-19, which indicates that the possible case of transfer of animals is being transferred to animals.
A number of recent studies on the basis of the methane sequence found that a group under threat to the destruction of small muscles known as pangolines (Manis javanica) could also be transferred to the parent betacoronavir, the parent image of SARS-CoV-2.
The geophysics of these new genes of pangolane coronavir 85-92 per cent corresponds to SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are closely associated with RaTG13, with an identity at the nucleoid level, is about 90 per cent.
They are classified in two substances of virus differencies such as SARS-CoV-2, in philosogenetic trees, one of which is closer to SARS-CoV-2, with the identity of the micoxistic coefficient at level 97.4%.
Instead, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 shapes are more divergent, despite the higher geology in all genes.
The early study of sick pangolines also reported the definition of viral constitutes in light tests that were similarly parent with SARS-CoV-2.
In this study, other methods of collection and manual processing were applied to obtain genes, including about 86.3 per cent of the full-scale viral gene.
It is not possible to exclude the possibility that pangoline becomes one of the intermediate SARS-CoV-2 animals.
However, because of the diversity of coincidences between SARS-CoV-2 and Betacoronavirus, the parent of SARS-CoV-2, there is no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from Pangolina.
Furthermore, distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is still shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and betacoronavirus of pangoline related to SARS-CoV-2.
The SARS-CoV-2 Evolution is not yet established in flights, pangolines and other mushrooms.
While the highest geology was found in the SARS-CoV-2 and the beta coronavirus of Pangoline-CoV-2 family SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the same high genotype.
Very theoretically, high-scale comparisons between betacoronavirus, pangoline-coV-2 family SARS and SARS-CoV-2 are linked to parallel evolution through electricity.
The anti-protectional proposal is for a recombination between betacoronavirus pangolane, the family SARS-CoV-2, and NTG13 in the third way of wild animals.
As the movement force of evolution, the recombination is widely distributed among beta coronavirs.
The final decision on the direct zone origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still not.
In addition to high-pathological HCOV viruses, HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-HKU1 are also studied.
The philosogenetic evidence shows that HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-229E can occur from the flight coronavirs, while the parent viruss of HCOV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1 are discovered in gloves.
It was reported that the coronavirus of the flight muscle called ARCOV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) and the triangles of the North America triangles showed close birth with HCOV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E was genetically linked to the other coronavirs, named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, although there was a suspicious suspicion that his interim mediator could also be sweet.
In order to clearly clarify the modern knowledge of the animal origin of known coronavirs, the figure 1 and table 2.
The philosogenetic analysis provided evidence of HCOV intervisional transmission in anamnesia.
When HCOV-OC43 intervisious transfer of HCOV and people from home animals occurred in 1890, pandemia of respireator infection was registered.
The story of the intervisional transmission HCOV-229E is not so clear.
The alphacoronavirus of flight muscles, close-coated HCoV-229E were found.
The alphacoronavirus is among them.
Some data support the direct transmission of the virus from the flight museum to the human.
First, people, not alphabets, could contact the flight mouse in general environmental lowness.
At the same time, people are in close contact with the alphabets.
Second, the alphacoronavirus, the family HCoV-229E, in the flight museums, varied and non-patogenic, while the alphacoronavirus of the alphabonic respirator disease in infected animals.
Finally, alphacoronavir has not been found in wild animals.
Thus, it cannot be excluded by the possibility that the alphacoronavir, the parent HCOV-229E, has received from people.
In fact, the museum is a direct source of human pathogical virus, including a beating virus, Ebola virus, Nipah’s virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is unexpected that the flight mouse could directly transmit HCOV-229E people.
On the other hand, while the alphacoronavirus of the flight muscles could serve a hypothesis of HCV-229E virus, the alphabics and the cylinders could be the interim mediators transmitting people’s virus, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV virus.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of the intervisious transfer of the flight museum to the unions and to the one-by-floor beams of man.
Evolutional origin of MERS-CoV virus from the flight museum known as its original identification and then confirmed the follow-up studies.
Obviously, the flight museum gives a rich pole of virus diversity for intervisious exchange of genes and intervisional transmissions.
Thousands of years, inhabited colonies, close social interactions and ability to fly with the "ideal distributors" museums.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV virus was introduced to an unilateral observance for decades ago.
He was well adapted to these observations, which were converted from a interim portrait to a stabil and natural reserve portrait.
The MERS-CoV virus is a very easy disease and is characterized in relatively low-frequencies mutations.
His episode transmission to a man is an accident, and the person remains a stupid MERS-CoV, since its transferer is not supported.
Unlike the role of the cylinders in the transmission of MERS-CoV, pangolines, if there is, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In particular, the beta coronavirus of pangolines is high-pathogeneous in pangolines.
They may be sweet beta coronavirs, parent of SARS-CoV-2, as well as cylinders in SARS-CoV.
In future studies, we must confirm or exclude several possibilities for intervisious transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus from animals.
First, the flights may be a reserve-measurer for the virus parent of SARS-CoV-2, almost identical SARS-CoV-2.
People can share environmental lowness with aircraft mouses through carbon glucose or partition of the tissue of the animals.
Secondly, pangolines may be one of the interim increased portraits, in which the parent SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently occurred.
People are infected by the virus by the part of the tusk and the use of wild animals’ food.
The SARS-CoV-2 may be a lot of animals, including households.
The investigation of domestic and wild animals on anticorps is justified.
Third, as indicated above, the recombination and adjustment of SARS-CoV-2 could occur in the third way that had contacted both with flights and pangolines.
Search for animal origin is continued.
In addition to different types of animals, three main factors of virus have also contributed to the transition of intervisional barriers.
First, they are relatively high-speed mutations in replication of RNC.
In comparison with other single-sequent RNA viruses, the calculated frequencies of coronavirs can be considered as a mean replacement of nearly 10-4 replacement per year in one part 2, depending on the adaptation of the coronavir to the new guests.
Coronavirs have an adjusting extraction of imboneclase, which results in the extremely high frequency of mutation and deficiency or even inevitability.
It is interested that the nucleoid analysis of Remdesivir provides replication of coronavirs through the inhibition of this extractoryboneclasis and the independent RNC polymerazers.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising means against SARS-CoV-2, which should be checked during clinical studies.
However, the frequencies of coronavirus mutations are almost a million times above their portraits.
Furthermore, mutation frequency may often be above if coronavirs are inadequately adapted to the mediator.
Compared to SARS-CoV with high-frequencies mutations, SARS-CoV-2 mutations are shown below, showing the higher level of adaptation to people.
This virus is already adjusted to another mediator close to the human.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this is also related to MERS-CoV, well adapted to unicorbated observations.
Theoretically uncertain that vaccines and antiviral antibodies of SARS-CoV-2 quickly lose their efficiency as a result of the genetic raid.
Second, the biggest RNK gene in coronavirs has increased plasticity in genital modulation with regard to mutations and recombination, thus increased the possibility of intervisional coevolution used to create new coronavirs in the existence of relevant conditions.
This contributes to a number of unique accounting frameworks and functions encoded in the direction of the 3e end of the genome.
Third, through the unique matrix selection mechanism, coronavirs in case and often changing matrix during replication of CNC.
During the transcription of the DNA of coronavirus in the portable, which serves with a smooth composition, it is often the changing of the tissues.
High-columnological and sub-genetic RNBs can reassemble and create new coronavirs.
The philosogenetic evidence of natural recombination were found in HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43 as well as in animal coronavirs such as SL-COV and the barCoV-HKU9 summer museums.
Virus interaction with the reporter with regard to transfer
In addition to the three above-mentioned virus factors, another key factor important for intervisional transmission is the interaction of the virus with the mediar receptor.
This article as a typical example, which also shows evidence of positive selection in the events of intervisional transmission, is the recommendation of SARS-CoV.
Based on a comparative analysis between the SARS-Human CoV shapes and the civilians, SARS-CoV is considered to be adapted to different portraits, especially with regard to mutations of S.
In general, the S coronavirus white SD is working with the cell receptor and the anti-coroner response is slightly chosen.
SARS-CoV is the 318th to 510th mixture of S1, which is linked to the angiotensin transforming farmment of 2 (APF2), as well as its coreceptors.
SARS-CoV virus is enabled to detect ACF2 different animals receptors, including a flight museum, cybers, mushrooms and anotovirus dogs, making possible intervision of the virus.
Indeed, only 6 minocyclotic remains were found different from human and cybervirals, with 4 in the linked receptive for interaction with the APF2 receptor.
SARS-CoVs have mutations of K479N and S487T in the RD, which can increase the affectiveness of the switch switch interaction with human APF2 receptor.
In other words, these two mine-isolants may be particularly important to adapt the virus to the person.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same liquid receptor as SARS-CoV.
Different between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 white S segments makes it possible to change the linking S white affective to human APF2.
Indeed, a study using a chromost microscopic says that the abfinity of this connection is 10 to 20 times above than between ACP2 people and SARS-CoV virus.
It would also be interested to determine whether any other coreceptors are required to transfer SARS-CoV-2.
It is surprising that HCOV-NL63 is also linked to APF2, but other S.
There are many other HCOV receptors, such as HCOV-229E, and 9-O-acetilyl oxygen for HCOV-OC43.
They may also respond to the successful adaptation of these coronavirs to people after intervisional transmission from animals.
In addition to cell receptors, the intervisional HCOV transmission is also managed by other factors of dependence and the limitation of the portor.
The divergence of these portraits between humans and natural reserve portraits, such as a flight museum, a swimming museum and a swimming strip, may represent a barrier for intervisional transfer.
In order to successfully transmission to HCV viruss, the dependence factors should be shocked and swallowed.
In this regard, moleculal determination in this important area of interaction between virus and noise is still needed in definition and categoryation.
Good results may provide an impartial integral scope of dependence and redistribution for SARS-CoV-2 through the new CRISPR technology.
New HCOV recursion: back to the null point
The diversity of the flight museum coronavirs has a wide possibility for new HCV.
In this sense, the coronavirus of the flight muscles serves a genetic pillar for HCV.
Furthermore, the extreme mutation and genetic recombination are also the movement of HCV evolution and the two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new genes that encode whites has the ability to radically modify virus phenotypes.
Among the SARS-CoV access to people is considered to be adapted as ORF8, since the SARS-CoV family viruses were isolated, but they were established that they coded ORF8 divergent whites.
The 29-nucleoid delegation has been found in the images that were isolated at the beginning of human epidemia, characterized for SARS-CoV coronavirs.
This delegation deploys ORF8 to ORF8a and ORF8b, and it is considered a adaptive mutation that will accelerate the change of portraits.
In addition, SARS-CoV has the history of possible recombinations with the lines of alpha and gamma coronavirs, where the CNC-dependent RNK polymer has been defined in a larger number of smaller recombinatory parts.
Recombination was also defined in non-structural whites nsp9, most NSP10 and NSP14 parts.
Similarly, Epidemic MERS-CoV had been recombinative events between different lines that have occurred in the single observations in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinative events were also observed in other HCVs where HCV was re-combined with other animal coronavirs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that the artistic selection may contribute to insufficient changes in viral genes, which may probably result in the elimination of virus from selective pressures, such as the part of the immune mediator system.
The example of such effects is the loss of full size ORF4 in the prototypical HCOV-229E, because of a bilateral delegation.
While an interactive open ORF4 counting can be observed in flight and monitoring viruses, the alphacoronavirus of the Alpaca demonstrates a single-cleoid insertion that leads to the improvement of the frame.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCV has also been the pressure of selecting their reserve portraits.
In the infection of the flight museum, the symptoms or their absence have registered weakly, as it says on mutual adjustment between the coronavirus and the flights.
It was said that the flight museum was anatomically and physically adapted to the coronavirs.
For example, the deficiency of the prominent response in the flight museum reduces the pathology caused by coronavires.
Furthermore, the natural activity of the mortal cells in the flights has been made through the abbreviation of the NKG2/CD94 inhibitor receptor of natural killers and the low expression of the main cyclus of class I.
Furthermore, high levels of active oxygen, which provides high metallic activity in the flight mouse, may result in replication of the coronavirus, at the same time on the account of the extra-bonicleazi, thus establishing the selection of the virus images that are high-pathy with the new mediator.
More pathogens of the coronavirus can also evolve as a result of recombination, which results in the acquisition of new whites or white properties for the adaptation of the portator.
Thus, it was not unexpected that in the last twenty-years there were three new human coronavirus.
Coronavirs are non-patogenous or cause light symptoms in their reserve portraits, such as museums or snakes.
They are certainly replicated without caused a strong immune response to the portrait.
This is a secret why we see unsymptoms and that causes serious cases of human infection.
The intense symptoms are mainly related to the hyperactiveness of immune reaction and cytokine shock, which is more stronger than immune reaction, so that the light is more serious.
Instead, the immune reaction is not inclined to the replication of the coronavir.
Similarly, the strategy for impunity response may have a favourable effect on therapy against SARS-CoV-2.
A interferonal response is particularly strong in the flight mouse.
Thus, the interferon type I should, at least, have a favourable effect in the primary phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Furthermore, NLRP3-inflammasm activation is violated in the flight mouse.
Based on this inhibition, NLRP3-inflammasms with MCC950 may be useful with COVID-19 treatment.
SARS-CoV-2 recovery should be a general scheme with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While beta coronavirus of flight muscles, a nucleoid homology that corresponds to SARS-CoV, there is also a coronavirus of the flight museum, which corresponds to 96 per cent of SARS-CoV-2.
Although there was also found that cylinders and other animals on the market have been carried out viruss identical with SARS-CoV, interim mediators for SARS-CoV-2 have not been established.
Betacoronavirus of Pangolina, relatively homological SARS-CoV-2, has been found that pangolines could serve one of the interim mediators or that the fragments of the beta coronavirs can enter the final version of the SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining issues, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intended or created by a person.
The colonial viruss had a general attention to themselves because of the recent SARS-CoV-2 succeeding.
The study of coronavirs in flight museums and other animals has radically changed our importance of the zone origin and HCOV animals in human transmission.
Available evidence showed that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were originated from the flight mouse and were transferred to man through interim media.
If the SARS-CoV infection is from the contact between humans and cylinders on the market, the closure of the child and the destruction of the cyberground could have been effectively put the end of SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in the light of the opening of different lines of betacoronavirus of pangolines, close-coV-2, pangolines should be eliminated in order to prevent zono-infection transmission with product markets.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 persons are transferred to pangolines and other mulcopitals and how this may continue to be the tasks of future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV virus has been in a single skin.
They serve as a major vehicle, as well as the main source of meat, milk, skin and skin for local populations.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Thus, it is impossible to provide all spectrums for the control of MERS, as done on the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the distribution of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the periodic improvement of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be made to develop effective vaccine against MERS-CoV in combination with other infectious control measures.
Since we can't eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may appear to be caused by diseases.
The world circle a variety of zone coronary viruses.
In particular, the coronavirus of the flight museum is extremely different.
There is a great number of opportunities for evolution and recombination of these zone coronavirs that will lead to the future to new coronavirs that are easily transferred and (or) more deadly for humans.
In order to reduce the number of human and animal contacts, it should be rejected from the culture of use in wild animals in some areas of China.
After the emergency tests that have become SARS, MERS and COVID-19, the best preparation and plan of response to such situations is needed.
In fact, many viruses existed in the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reserves until there is no possibility of entering new territories.
Although many of the flights of the museum are proud to disseminate viruss when people learn to keep them away, they can minimise the possibility of contacting humans with flight mouses and other species of wild animals.
In order to understand better the environment of coronavirs and their natural portraits, the permanent epidemic supervisory of milk-coated persons will be needed to prevent coronavirs from animals and future diseases.
Finally, the most effective way to prevent virus zonoos is to keep people beyond the environmental weaknesses of zonovirus.
In the head of SARS-CoV-2, there are still few fractions.
First, if the flights have transmised the premature virus of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolines, it is interested to see where the mouse and pangolines divide the same environmental low.
Second, if the flight plays a more direct role in the transfer of man, it is necessary to determine how people have been connected with flight mouses.
Third, if the role of the true interim mediator plays a third multicopy, it is necessary to clarify how it works with various types, including people who fly and pangolines.
Finally, since many mammals, including home animals, may be admissible to SARS-CoV-2, epidemiological supervision and experimental intelligence should be carried out.
If that is the flight of the mouse, pangolin or another muscle, it is expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 or its pre-predictors will be defined in their natural mediators.
Further studies in this area have been lighted on the evolutional route of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have significant consequences for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in people.
Diagnostic criteria for "insurance suspicion" and "reliable cases" COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our group has published a short dealing guideline on diagnosis and treatment of the new coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-n CoV), which provides information on our experience and are given correct recommendations for combating this pandemic worldwide.
However, the 2019 coronavir infection (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have been gradually increased on the basis of the current results of research and clinical experience; the diagnostic strategy and the terapeutic practice have also been updated.
In this letter, we responded to one comment on our recommendations and to the new diagnostic criteria for “insurance suspicion” and “required cases” in accordance with the document “Therapy and Therapie for COVID-19” (Seventh Version), issued by the National Committee on Health of the CRC.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus in 2019 (2019-nCV), receiving the official name of the coronavir 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus disease was called “a severe reservoir syndrome 2” (SARS-CoV-2).
11 March 2020, WHO qualified COVID-19 as pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our group has developed a short dealing guide and published it on the website of Military Medical Research on 6 February 2020.
This publication was a great attention to herself.
Let us note that COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have been gradually increased on the basis of the current results of research and clinical experience; thus the diagnostic strategy and the therapeutic practice have also been updated.
For example, during the period 16 January to 3 March 2020, the National Committee on Health (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) issued seven publications of the “Therapeutics and Therapie Recommendation for COVID-19”, published by the National Committee on Health (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), which contained significantly some of its provisions.
Recently, in the work prepared by Choo (Zhou) with the co-auditors, comments on our recommendations have been made, with simple proposals on diagnosis based on already clinical experience.
The work was added to our recommendations of new practical witnesses, as well as to provide valuable details on this pandemia covering the world.
We reaffirm their work and express our appreciation.
However, in accordance with the latest issue of COVID and therapy, the Seventh Seventh Version and the results of the current research, and their work is needed to update.
In accordance with the seventh issue of the document (of 3 March 2020, g.) to conduct a comprehensive analysis when confirming the case of suspecting of disease, one element of epidemiological history with two clinical evidence:
Epidemiological history: (1) movement or location history in Mr. Whahn and its surroundings or other population points, where there were registered cases of COVID-19 in 14 days before symptoms; (2) contacts with sick, infected SARS-CoV-2 ( with positive tests based on nuclein cysts); (3) contact history with patients with high temperatures or spectacular symptoms from M. Uhn and his restaurants or other villages, where the diseases of COV were registered in the last 14 days before the age of 14 days.
Clinical detections: (1) high temperatures and/or brake symptoms; (2) external detection of COVID-19; (3) the total number of licocytes is normal or lower than the low number of limphocytes at the early stage of the symptoms.
The diagnosis for a confirmed case of disease should be based on the case of suspected disease with one of the following cases of pathogenic or serial evidence, i.e.: (1) PRC test in real time is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) full-sensitive virus sequence shows high homosexuality regarding new coronavirs; (3) positive results of serving for SARS-CoV-2 anti-technology for SARS-IgM and IG; or changes of the results of a positive incidence for the special SARS-CoV-2G anti-Ig, or the result of the results of a positive incidence for the special SARS-CoV-2G, or not at a rate of 4 °C.
It can also be noted that, in the second January (18, 2020 g.) and the third (22 January 2020). The test of the relevant document was added in real time for nuclein cyclings in diet or blood tests.
The pathogenic blood loss diagnosis was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and the fifth (8 February 2020) outlines, and the need for serial evidence was added in the seventh issue.
These changes are based on the results of the unprecedented work of researchers employed by a positive optimistic set for the detection of nuclein cycling in rapid diagnosis, as well as for analysis of the deep-related tests, including the selection of blood tests, which enhance the accessibility of different types and contributes to the integration of positive test results for special anti-types in the confirmation criteria.
However, there are more evidence regarding the need to demonstrate care when treating patients with typical symptoms and patients without expressed symptoms.
Thus, a routine map presented in the work of Cho (Zhou) and Dr. should be updated, since the person without clinical symptoms is classified as a group of low risks.
The evaluation system also requires a specification when further clinical practices and studies.
We will conclude that we hope to receive more direct evidence and call the readers to leave their comments.
As regards the diagnostics of “insurance suspicion” and “provided cases”, we propose readers to follow and strictly implement the last recommendations given in the countries where they live.
Our group will also update its recommendations in order to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh reports about five new death cases resulting from COVID-19 — day maximum
Last night Bangladesh confirmed five new death cases on the result of COVID-19 per day.
This is the largest number of deaths from virus per day.
During the last day, the Bangladesh Institute for Epidemiology, Control and Diseases (IEDCR) reported that in the number of registered cases of infirmation had occurred 114 cases, as well as 33 injuries in the home.
The total registered 17 deaths.
In the online-brifing, director of the IEDCR Dr. Medjaby Sabrina Flora said that the victims were four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Mildjaby, two of the age of 60, two of the age of 51 to 60, and one of the age 41 to 50.
She also reported that two of the dead were from Ducky.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the pandemic of COVID-19.
Clinic staff reported the local Anadu news agency that was one of the losers, Mr. Simon Simon Rahman, director of the Bengal Corruption Commission, which was the treatment of the Cuban Klinic Meitri.
On Saturday, the Minister of Car Cars and Bangladesh Obidual Queder stated that the public transport work would be stopped for more long than was planned until the next Saturday.
The public transport work was stopped from 26 March and was to be restored at Saturday, 4 April.
Transport of first-needed goods — medicines, fuel and food products — has still been authorized.
The first cases of COVID-19 were registered in Bangladesh, 8 March, in two persons returning from Italy, as well as in the wife of one of them.
At 19 March, those three people have already been rescued.
SARS-CoV-2 has overcome the millions of cases of infection throughout the world
According to the University of Johns Hopkins, in the general number of cases of the infection of the coronavir infection of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide exceeded 1 million.
From the COVID-19 colony, at least 52.000 people died.
The same day as the first case of infirmation was confirmed in Malawi, and Zambia was the first case of death from the coronavirus.
The North Korea stated that it was one of the least countries in which the infringement of the coronavir infection was not fixed.
During the last day, the World Health Organization reported about 1 051 635 cases confirmed infringements, including 79 332 cases during twenty-four hours before 10 a.m. for Central and Central Europe (0800 UTC) 4 April.
In the United States, over 244.000 cases were registered by the infringement of coronavirus, at least 5 900 years.
CBS News, with reference to the University of Johns Hopkins, reported that more than 1000 deaths in the United States were fixed in the United States.
The countries worldwide have announced that measures to prevent dissemination of diseases were resolved.
On Thursday, Mr. Moscow Sergey Soviet has extended the self-isolation of the cities until 1 May.
The previous President, Vladimir Putin, stated that Russian in the whole country, despite self-resolution, would receive payment to 30 April.
Portugal's Parliament voted for 15 days of emergency; the results of the votes: 215 votes, 10 abstentions and one "confront".
Saudi Arabia extended the comandant hour in the sacred towns of Mekka and Meit on the full day, while the previous time was only 3 hours to 6 morning.
Tayland planned to introduce a comandant hour from 10 to 4 a.m.
The Governor of the State of Ogayo, Mike Duyne, declared that the rule of home self-isolation in the State territory was extended by order until 1 May.
Magazine in Australia limits the number of toilet packs that can be obtained for one time
On Saturday and Saturday night, the Australian shops for Woolworths and Coles have reduced the number of toilet paper packs that can be acquired once in all shops of the country, to two and one packaging respectively.
The ALDI was also limited to one package in the Monday.
These restrictions were reported in cash statements, as well as on the Facebook website.
As stated, citizens began to make extreme reserves because of the insurance that COVID-19 may affect the introduction of a general self-isolation regime.
The Woolworths network also limited the number of tube papers purchased to one packet.
Previously, 4 and 5 March, Woolworths and Coles have already limited this number of 4 packages.
The Coles network in its press relicense of 8 March reported that, with the limitation of four packs, “the many shops of tuberculosis have still been purchased too fast — one delivery during the time”, and called the question “Bess Presidentious”, while ALDI was published on Tuesday's Facebook page, called such a tendency “unexpected”.
According to the representative of Woolworths, in the past week there was a rare growth in sales.
The Costco Magazine in Canberra was also limited by the number of two packages last week.
In order to fill the deficit, Coles became ordered to providers for more parties and increased the delivery frequencies, Woolworths ordered additional parties, while ALDI had made stocks for the early sale in the environment.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Rileye Association, reported that ritualists are trying to fill the stocks, but it is difficult for the limitations of local authorities regarding the schedule of shipping cars.
He expects the growth of the product, since the suppliers are trying to satisfy the request, but there is a less benefitable proposal available.
In Monday, ALDI announced that some shops could not be conducted in the environment because of the reserve of stocks.
In the report of News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a expert on the decreasing trade from the University of China, said that the purchase was completed every night.
He noted that the toilet paper is a sound product, so the number of stocks is small, and the whole number of goods remains empty, increased by lack of stocks.
“ Coles and Woolworths believe that if the legs could be filled, and goods such as the roofs of the tube paper and the deficiency funds for hand could be placed on these fields in large numbers, buyers probably wouldn’t have been so packed, ” says Russell Zimmerman.
In recently, the manufacturer of a residual tube paper Who Gives a Crap reported the end of the stocks.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, a toilet producer of Kleenex and Solaris Paper, which also produced Sorbent markets, reported that they work roundly to ensure sufficient number of goods.
Domain.com, the sales website for inmobility, reported that when the number of shops in Melbourne was decreased because of the lack of buyers on the weekly day of the work, some sellers began to propose a free toilet paper for the first party.
The fourth daily publication of NT News, printed in Darwin, included a page of eight pages designed to solve and use as a toilet paper.
According to the ABC of Australia report dated 3 March, the shops were unfortunately limited to the number of purchased products, claiming that they are not planned to do this.
Rassel Zimmerman added that other products are also used by higher demand, including medical masks defining materials for hands, galleries, hands and muscles.
Similarly, more than the events in Australia, on Sunday night, the British Supermarket Oka also limited the sale of the toilet paper of Andres two packs on 12 rules.
The World Health Organization declares the pandemic of COVID-19
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the pandemic of COVID-19, called coronavir SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the term “pandemia”, only the levels of disease and not the risk of specific cases, WHO notes that the Governments must take action:
“All country has not yet been able to affect pandemic development.”
This may be possible if countries are being identified, tested, treatment, excluding the diseases, monitoring cases of disease, and mobilization of their citizens,” explained the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adan Gabrous.
“We are deeply concerned at the level of dissemination and seriousness of disease and defect levels.”
According to Dr. Tom Friden, former director of the United States Control and Prevention Centre, this pandemia is a “precedent”.
He said in his interview, translating CNN in February, that "no other respirator virus, except grip, has not been monitored from the time of his occurrence to an unprecedented global dissemination".
Mr. Geberusus expressed the same view, said that “we have never observed the pandemic raised by coronavir.
We have never seen pandemia that can be controlled."
First, in January, the WHO announced that the emergency situation in the field of public health was internationally important, and then introduced the new status of pandemia.
The Director of the National Institute of Allergecy and Infectional Diseases, Dr. Antonio Fauchi, said that “It is just starting, it will be worse.”
According to the Associated Press Association in the world, at least 126.000 cases of COVID-19 were registered, and over 4 600 people have ended.
The pandemic of Coronvir 2019 to 2020 g. is the present time of the coronviral pandemic of 2019 (COVID-19), called the coronavir of a heavy respirator syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In Uhana, China, December 2019, and 30 January 2020, the emergency situation of international public health importance was declared, which was then recognized by Pandemia on 11 March 2020.
By 10 April 2020, some 1,61 million cases of COVID-19 were registered in 210 countries and regions, resulting in about 97,000 people.
About 364,000 people were rescued.
The mortality level in China is 4 per cent, while it is from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
The worst diversity of symptoms include heavyness, cash, and difficult breathing.
The possible complications relate to pneumonia and a strict syndrome distraction.
The time from the first symptoms to the pipe of disease is usually about five days, but may also vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no vaccine or specific treatment currently found.
The basic treatment is symptoms and supporting, and the recommended preventive measures include the brain, the closure of the rats, the compliance of the distance between humans, the identifying and self-isolation of people suspecting their identification.
The authorities have reacted to the situation by introducing travel limitations, carriage measures, commanding time, risk controls at workplaces and closing different objects.
Pandemia has led to serious global social and economic consequences, to transfer or to the elimination of sports, religious, political and cultural activities, as well as to a wide disappearance of goods affected by panic purchase.
Schools and universities were closed at the national or regional levels in 193 countries, which has affected about 99.4 per cent of all students in the world.
In the Internet, there were cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other citizens of Eastern and South Asia, or those who remember their external information, as well as other groups of people living in areas where significant cases of dissemination of virus are observed.
As a result of reducing the number of trains and closure of the severe industry, air pollution and carbon emissions were reduced.
On December 31, 2019, the Uhan City Health Authority (Chine of the Province of Jubai) reported the event of pneumonia with unknown cause, and the situation was started at the beginning of January 2020.
Infringements were mainly linked to the optical market of Huanney Sea producers, so the virus, as they believe, has zone origin.
The virus that has been injured by disease is known as SARS-CoV-2, which has recently been opened by a large part of the flight museum, pangolin coronavirs and SARS-CoV, and later found that the first case of disease occurred on 1 December 2019 and that it had not been visited on the market after that date.
Two thirds of the invasion registered in December 2019 had regard to the market.
On 13 March 2020, in the publication of the South China Journal, Morning Post, which was not checked, the first case of the infringement had been made with the 55-year-old resident of the Province of Jupiter on 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that the number of new cases of infringements in China had been decreased, but was unexpectedly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and the number of new cases of infringement in China at first increased the number of new cases of infringement in China itself.
The number of cases of disease may be significantly decreased, in particular because of low-expressed symptoms.
On 26 February, a relatively few cases of infringement among youths, including 19-year-old patients, was less than 2,4 per cent of the world; the main Scientific Council of the United Kingdom, Patrick Vallans, stated that 60 per cent of the British population will be informed before the preparation of an effective immunity group in the country.
Statistics include cases of infringement of people checked on COVID-19 and which test was positive in accordance with official protocols.
As on 23 March, no country has been able to check more than 3 per cent of its population, and in many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, has been adopted an official policy that prescribed not to test only in a few symptoms.
The survey published on 16 March showed that, until 23 January, 86 per cent of the cases of COVID-19 were not detected, and that such unregistered sicks became a source of 79 per cent of registered cases.
Statistical analysis published on 30 March showed that the number of cases of real invasion in Italy was significantly exceededed by the number of registered cases.
The initial evaluation of the basic reproductive number of infections (R0) of COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
In the study published by the United States Control and Prevention Centre, this indicator is expected to be 5.7.
Most of the patients with COVID-19 are well-being.
In other cases, the time from the start of symptoms to the death was between 6 and 41 days, the privatest time to 14 days.
At 10 April 2020, about 97,000 deaths were related to COVID-19.
China, on 5 February, some 80 per cent of the death cases were over 60 years, and 75 per cent of the victims died had co-conciliated diseases, including heart-conciliation diseases and diabetes. Official COVID-to-mortal data generally include information on the deaths of patients with a positive COVID test results carried out in the official protocols.
The factic number of COVID-19 deaths may be much above, since official numbers may not take account of the dead people not previously tested — for example, in the case of their homes, in the houses of older, etc.
Incomplete data on Italy shows that the actual number of deaths during pandemics exceeded the official COVID rates 4 to 5 times.
The United States Monitoring and Prevention Centre (CDC) press recognizes: “We know that [the number of losers died below],” his statements are confirmed by some single cases in the United States. The reports of non-complete data are often presented in pandemias such as Sweet Grip H1N1 2009. The first remarked death was registered in Uhan on 9 January 2020.
First death was registered under the borders of China in the Philippines on February 1 and in the borders of Asia, France on 14 February.
On 28 February, more than ten deaths were registered under the borders of China: Iran, South Korea and Italy.
On 13 March, more than 40 countries and regions in all continents, except Antarctics, have been reported about the death cases.
All indicators vary in depending on the region and the dissemination of diseases; they also affect the number of tests, the quality of health systems used by the treatment scheme, from the start of the decline of disease and population parameters such as age, gender and general health status.
According to the statistical data of the University of Johns Hopkins, the global number of deaths and infringement cases is 6,0% (97 039/1 617 204).
Data from different regions are different.
In China, mortality rate decreased from 17.3 per cent (for whose symptoms occurred from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7 per cent (for those who had occurred after 1 February 2020). Other methods include the determination of mortality rates resulting from disease (CFR) -- percentage of patients who died from diseases and the percentage of infected infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (disaggregated, and non-disaggregated) patients who die.
These statistics are not linked to a specific time and reflect the population indicators since the infringement of the disease has been completed.
Some scientists have tried to investigate these indicators on specific groups.
According to the evaluation of the Test Medicine Center of the University of Oxford, the mortality level of this pandemia in general is 0.1 to 0.39 per cent.
The top number of this diameter agrees with the outcomes of the first arbitrary COVID-19 test in Germany, as well as with the statistical study analyzing the impact of CFR testing.
WHO claims that the current pandemic can be controlled.
The precision and accurate duration of the spectrum are not subject to the definition and may be different from the location.
Macey Bony, a member of the University of Pennsylvania, states that “not-controlled infections are generally out of payment, and then, when the number of available nurses are finished, they are starting to abuse.
However, in the present situation, it is practically impossible to make any reasonable prognosis about when this happens."
The Old Medical Adviser of the Chinese Government, June Nanshanya, claims that “all can end in June” if all countries can mobilize and implement the recommendations of WHO for the end of the dissemination of virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski from London's giant school and tropical medical declared that SARS-CoV-2 “is circleable for a year or two”.
According to the investigation carried out by the Imperial College Nila Ferguson, “together until the vaccine is established (possibly 18 months or more) is necessary to comply with the physical distance and other measures.
William Shafner, whose officer of the Vanderbilt University, believes: “I don’t think that this coronavirus will ever lose, because it is so easy to be transferred, ” and that he “is able to become a seasonal disease that has been suffered every year.”
New success will depend on the collective immunity and the level of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively not specific, and some infected persons may overcome disease without symptoms.
Two most distributed symptoms are higher temperatures (88%) and sugar cables (68%).
A few broadly distributed symptoms include the strength, the education of molecules in diet roads (slide), the loss of depression, breath, pain in museums and substances, the pain in the garden, the main pain, the skin, the rape, the blood skin, the dialysis or cynose.
U.S. Control and Prevention Centres (CDC) contain unnecessary symptoms such as breast-feeding disorders or feelings of breast-feeding, immediate consciousness, difficulties with temptation and smelling of persons or smell. In the use of these symptoms, it should be immediately requested for medical assistance. The further development of diseases may lead to a serious pneumonia, a super-symphic diploma, sepsi, sects, and death.
Some infected persons may be insight without any clinical evidence, but the results of analysis confirm the facts of infringement, so the doctors recommend to place persons in close contact with patients with whom diagnosis is confirmed, under strict control and investigate for the purpose of infiltration.
According to the estimated number of Chinese scientists of the insynthme of disease, several units are collected to 44 per cent of all cases.
The general incubration period (time between the impression and the appearance of symptoms) is collected from one to 14 days; normally it consists of five days, until it has not been completely clear for the loss of the detection: for initial COVID-19 rates, which had developed the symptoms, was 30 per cent to 15 per cent, and then slowed up to 15 per cent.
Some details on how dissemination of diseases are still unknown.
The disease is mainly transferred during the close contact, as well as through small capsules that are covered in the air together with the castle, the swimming or during the conversation; closely contacts are underlined in the radio from 1 to 2 meters (from 3 to 6 feet).
According to some studies in the open box, the cover can be distributed at a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
There are preferences that the virus may also be transferred through the small cables chosen during the conversation, which can remain at the air over a longer period, and the respirators can also be formed at the air, including during the conversation, although the virus is not normally transferred to air.
The cups can smell in the mouth or the nausea of those who are close to the people, as well as in light.
Some medical procedures, such as intuination and heart-ly-life reaction (LLD), may lead to the distribution of extraction products and, therefore, to disseminate the virus in the air.
It may also be in the body if a person relates to the contaminant surface, including the skin that is following its eyes, feet or skin.
There are also fears that virus may be transferred through fecele, but the risk of transmission is considered low.
The Government of China rejects the possibility of physically-oriented transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is the first three days after the symptoms of symptoms, although it may happen both before the symptoms and the later stages of disease.
There were cases when the tests were positive in three days before the symptoms were tested, and it says that the virus could be transferred to the expression of symptoms.
There are only several reports on laboratoryly confirmed cases of illness, but in some countries, there were also cases of transmission of diseases from unsymphic portraits.
The European Centre of Prevention and Control of Diseases (ECDC) workers say that as far as the virus is easier, however, it is known that one patient usually affects 2 to 3 other persons, the virus can survive from a few hours to a few days.
In particular, it was found that on the plastic surface (polypropylen) and on the nervous (304) virus were able to live up to three days, on the surface of a day, and on the medium surfaces up to 4 hours.
However, these data vary in depending on the power and temperature, and there has been a positive result on the COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transfer the virus of people, although the British authorities recommend to switch their hands after contact with animals, exactly as after contacting other surfaces to which infections could be affected.
The intense repirator syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus that has been found in the first three pneumonia from a group of extreme replicator diseases registered in Uhan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the nature of the family coronavirs. Virus can be destroyed by means of a slaughtered milk that develops its protective tube. SARS-CoV-2 has a huge link with the original SARS-CoV virus.
It is supposed to have a zone origin.
Genetic analysis of the coronavirus showed that it is genetically classified with Betacoronavirus, a parent of Sarbecovirus (monthy B) in combination with two other forms of flight virus.
At the total genetic level, he is identified by other types of museum coronavir (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one difference in the minocyclopedia of certain parts of the gene of pangoline and human virus.
The total genetic comparison today showed that the largest percentage of comparisons (92 per cent) was between the pangolan coronavir and SARS-CoV-2, but it is not sufficient to prove that pangolines are interim guests of virus.
The virus depression may be immediately diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although, finally, it should be confirmed by the analysis of polymeric cep reaction with the re-encrypted secret or computer theography.
The results of the studies compared to the CPRC and the CTs used in Uhana showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than the CCT, although less specific, as many of its visa functions correspond to other pneumonies and disease testing processes.
Since March 2020, the American Radioology College published the recommendation “No use of CT to scratch or as a method of testing of the first COVID diagnosis”.
WHO published a number of RNA test protocols on SARS-CoV-2 and was published on 17 January.
The testing on a polymerical reaction in the real time mode (RT-PRC).
It may be carried out on respiratory tests and blood images.
The results are usually ready for a few hours to a few days.
Of course, the test is used by a snake, although it can also be used by a snake, and many laboratorys and companies develop serial tests that allow anticorps to detect.
As at 6 April 2020, no one of them had been sufficiently accurate to the approval of the full-speed application.
The cellological test developed in the United States was approved to apply in extreme cases only certificated laboratorys.
The specific features of visualization of ringgenographs and computer theography (CT) are the asymmetric peripheral memories of the mathematic type and the absence of triangles.
The Italian Radioological Society is established by the International Photos of Defence Cases.
Because of other infections, such as addenaviris, with the identification of COVID-19 pictures not confirmed by the CCP tests, there is a limited clinical specification.
A large study was conducted in China, compared with the results of the CCT of crude cells and testing, and was found that, although the pictures are less specific for infection, they can be decrypted quickly, and they are more sensitive, and therefore the diagnostic method can be considered as an instrument for infected areas.
In order to diagnose virus with ringgenographs and computer theography, overall neuron networks were developed on the basis of art intellect.
Prevention strategies include maintenance of common personal physicians, hands, evacuation of the eye, noise or smell, use in the box, or slaughtering of salt, which should be elected immediately after use.
Those who may already have been burned should be obtained in human places.
In order to prevent the transmission of diseases, many Governments are also recommended to stay away from any unexpected travel to countries and regions suffering and limit the movement of citizens.
However, virus can be distributed in most of the world regions.
This means that virus is distributed among the populations where some members do not know where and how they were infected. Medical workers who are able to be infected are recommended to use standard precautions and precautions in contact with other people and view protection means. The monitoring of contacts is also an important method used by healthcare bodies to determine the source of infection and prevent it from further dissemination.
The use of citizens data with their mobile phones was concerned about the compliance of confidentiality, and the organizations, such as Amnesty International (International Amnesty), and more than 100 other organizations, have expressed the statements required to limit this kind of monitoring.
A number of mobile applications for voluntary use were developed and proposed; over 7 April 2020, more than ten experts were working on the development of decisions that provide personal data confidentiality, such as the registration of the user close to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.
If the mobile phone user has been closely contacted with a person whose COVID test was positive, he receives the relevant notification.
There is no vaccine from COVID-19 at present, although many organizations are working on its establishment.
To prevent dissemination of disease, the brake is recommended.
CDC (Center of Control and Prevention of Diseases) also recommends that, at least 20 seconds, hands with milk and water begun, especially after visiting the toilet or in a strong pollution of hands, as well as in front of the food, after smiling, chat or wound.
This is necessary, since the virus is destroyed by a raw milk that covers his protective ball.
Furthermore, when milk and water are not available, CDC recommends to use deficiencies for the hand-based hand process with at least 60 per cent of the spray content.
The WHO recommends that people avoid shocking with the eyes, smells and smells.
Poorness may be dispersed by a number of disproportionates (in the surface of the nervous surface began to operate a minute later after the date) with the content of 62 to 71 per cent of the stain, 50 to 100 per cent of the disproportionate, 0.1 per cent of the hydrochloride, 0.5 per cent of the water transfers and 0.2 to 7.5 per cent of the visions of yoda.
Other components, such as benzolconic chloride and chloroxyna, are less effective.
CDC recommends that, in the event of suspecting of COVID or its confirmation, such as office or daily station, all spaces such as cabinets, toilets, general use, electronic equipment, such as scenarios, sensor screens, claviers, distance management and banks used by sick people.
Medical organizations are recommended to close the mouth and the smell side of the skin or slipper and immediately elect hygienic objects.
Those who may have been infected are recommended to use medical masks because the use of the mask can limit the quantity and the range of the dissemination of air dischargements in the conversation, detection and cash.
WHO made instructions on the use of mass mass.
According to Steven Griffin, a virusist from the University of Lids, “the use of medical mass can reduce the culmination of people with respect to their faces, and the accession to the persons of clean hands is the main way of infection”.
The WHO recommends that healthy people bring massage only if they are at high risk, for example, to persons who have COVID-19, although it also recognises that the use of the mask actually allows to reduce the number of associations to persons.
A number of countries began to call for the use of medical mass in public places.

At the end of March 2020, H.E. and other health bodies began to replace the use of the “social division” of the “division”, as a result of this action.

The Strategy for Diseasing Diseases, Diseases or Diseases.
The maintenance of diseases is held in early stages and aims at monitoring and excluding the infected people, and underlines other measures of infection control and vaccination in order to stop dissemination of diseases among the rest of the population.
When dissemination is already impossible, efforts are made to reduce the impacts: measures are taken to reduce dissemination and reduce epidemic effects on the health system and society.
Measures on detention and reducing the consequences of dissemination of diseases may be taken at the same time.
Infection administeration requires more extreme measures to recover pandemia, increase the base of cases of infectation at the level below 1. part of the efforts to management the infectious disease is intended to reduce epidemia pipe, known as the balance of epidemic crisis.
Such efforts are reduced by the risk of reducing health services and provide more time to develop vaccine and treatment methods.
Nepharmaceutical interventions that can help to be addressed include personal prevention measures, such as hygine hands, use of medical mass and self-reliance; public measures aimed at physical distance, such as the closure of schools and the elimination of masses; the participation of the community to assist in the implementation of such measures and participation in them; as well as measures for environmental protection, such as the cleaning of surroundings; and after the seriousness of China had been clearly undertaken, there were more decisive measures to maintain the sustainability of such measures, such as urban objectives and the construction of the buildings.
Other countries also adopted a number of measures aimed at limited dissemination of virus.
In South Korea, massive squirting and localized cartoons were introduced and organized the system of publication of the movement of persons infected.
In Singapore, the financial support was provided to individed persons who were on self-isolation and had granted great ransoms for those who did not.
In Taiwan, the production of medication mass and storms were increased in the recovery of losses of medicines, and the modelling in Britain and the United States showed that there are serious problems regarding the slowness (as the slowness, but not the stop of dissemination of epidemia) and epidemia (epidemia growth).
Optimum policy on dissemination effects may reduce the load of 2/3, and mortality is twice but brings to hundreds of thousands of deaths and collapses of health systems.
The injury may be a preferential method, but it is necessary to use until the virus is circled among the population (or until the vaccine is developed if it is previously), since, in other cases, the dissemination of diseases will be renewed when the measures are deficienciated.

14 February, WHO and China had been initiated to establish a joint group of international experts and WHO staff in China to provide assistance to the resolution of the situation in the country and the evaluation of the “seriality of disease and its inheritance”, organized seminars and meetings with the leading national institutions, as well as outdoors to evaluate “the effectiveness of the reaction at the level of provinces and districts, including the cities and rural areas”, stated that “more should be done more to prepare the Panel of Corovirus, as it was said to be a pregnancy of the country, but it should not be prepared for the country.”
On 28 February, the officials of the WHO said that the possibility of global dissemination of the coronavirus would be increased with the “alto” to the “alth” level of preparation and risk.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Programme on emergency health situations, warned in his statement: “This is the verification of each Government on the planet to prepare for the real situation: the time to act.
This virus may already be on the way to your country and you must be ready to be ready, and stressed that correct response measures could help the peace to avoid “the worst scenario of development of events”.
Ryan also stated that the current data would not be the basis for declaring the global pandemic by official public health representatives, and added that pandemic declaration would mean that “we recognize the fact that every person on the planet would cause the risk of being exposed to this virus”.
On 11 March, WHO declared the rule of the pandemia coronavir.
The Director-General of the WHO stated that “the WHO was deeply concerned as a high level of dissemination and serious disease, and at least an inadequate level of inadequacy towards this problem”. The WHO is a serious criticism for the inadequate approach to the concept of pandemia, including the later declaration of an emergency situation in the field of public health and classification of virus as pandemia.
As a respondent negative reaction to the situation in the address of the Director-General of the WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanoma, was given a request to make a departure signed by 733.000 persons on 6 April.
26 March 2020, United Nations human rights experts stressed the importance of respecting each human rights during the Pandemic of COVID-19.
The Expert Group stated that everyone had the right to apply to its measures to save life and the responsibility for the organization of such measures was to be taken by the Government.
The Panel emphasized that the absence of resources or medical insurance should not be justified for discrimination against any specific group of people.
Experts stressed that each person had the right to health protection, including persons with limited opportunities, minorities groups older citizens, internal displaced persons without home, citizens who live in extremely bad conditions, prisoners, and refugees and other non-specific groups needing public support.
International Government organizations consider the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development has established a platform designed to provide a timely and comprehensive information on relevant political measures in all countries, as well as for awareness of views and recommendations.
The digital area contains information on the political measures of different countries (Policy Tracker) to strengthen health and world economy systems, elimination of the cardinal impacts and travel limitations, in order to assist countries to learn to each other and to promote coordinated global response measures to combat the coronarus.
The Government of China was criticized by the United States, the Minister of Minister of the United States of the United States, Michael Howa and Eduardo Bolsonar, son of President of Brazil, Jairo Bolsonar, for the fight against pandemia, which began with the Chinese province of Hubuy.
Many leaders of the Chinese Communist Party (CCC) were authorized for the careful measures they were taken in the central part of China, and the voluntary demonstrated the lack of responsibilities to the political proliferation in these regions.
Some comments believe that this step had been aimed at protecting the Secretary-General of the Communist Party of China SZingpin from the angry of the public about the savings of the coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials, such as Choo Lizzine, expressed an inconvenience with the previous statement that the slowness of the coronavirus began in Uhana, but took part of the controversial theory of which COVID has occurred in the United States or Italy.
The Administration of the United States President Donald Trampa called "China Virus" or "Uhanya's Virus", stated that "the century in China is only to reduce the situation of the virus that has now become a global pandemic", and that expression was expressed in his mind by some comments that claim that this approach is racist and “except from the incapacity of the President ' s administration to continue to disseminate diseases”.
The Daily Beast received access to the United States government telegram, which contains a communication strategic strict, visiblely designed by the Council of National Security, and has the following mentions on the strategy: “All cases in China.
We are requested to distribute this information in any possible way, including press conferences and television statements.” such organizations, such as Political, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg, have stated that China's efforts to help countries suffering from virus, is part of the “Propaganist contribution” towards global impact.
The Head of the Foreign Political State EU Joseph Borrell warned the presence of a geopolitical component including the fight against the influence of pira and the so-called policy of generosity.
Borrell also stated that “China continues to go on the idea of his role of a responsible and reliable partner, in the difference between the United States”.
China also invited the United States to revoke sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, with some information to send assistance to the last two countries.
The donation of Jack M 100 000 Cuban medical mass was banned from the United States sanctions set out on 3 April.
The United States authorities are also accused that they have transferred assistance for other countries in their own country.
There were also disputes between other countries such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Czech and Italy.
Moreover, Turkey has brought hundreds of IDP devices for Spain.
At the beginning of March, the Italian Government discovered the lack of support by the European Union on the coverage of the Italian coronavirus.
Mauritius Masari, Italian employee in the EU, said that “China has reacted bilaterally.
This is not a sign of European solidarity”.
On 22 March, after telephone discussion with the Prime Minister of Italy, the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, sent a sentence to Italy of Russian military sanitaries, specialized on declination and other medical equipment.
Italian newspaper La Stampa quotes an anonymous “Political Source of High Level” which claims that 80 per cent of Russian assistance was “bespot or little useful for Italy”.
The Source accused Russia that it is trying to make a good impression on the world public at the geopolitical and diplomatic level.
The President of Lombardia Attilalio Fundain and the Minister for Foreign Affairs Italy, Louisi Di Mayo rejected the attacks of the media and expressed appreciation for the assistance provided.
Russia also sent a shipping aircraft to the United States.
The secretariat Krimla Dmitri Pesko said that “Assistance to American colleagues, [Putin] suggests that, when the American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials are able to produce the time of production, they will also be able to provide responsibilities in the case of need.”
NATO Military Teaching, planned in Germany, Poland and Baltic countries, will be carried out in a decreased format.
The Secretary-General for Nuclear Disarmament Chamber Kate Hudson launched the teachings of Defence 2020, “In the crisis situation, which has now been put in public health, these teachings are threatened to life not only in the United States and many European participatory countries, but also in the country where such events should be held”. The Government of Iran has been extremely affected by the virus. It is identified by some two decades of parliament and by the fifty other current or former political actors.
On 14 March 2020, President of Iran Husan Ruhani, in an open letter, requested the world leaders, reporting that his country has experienced difficulty in combating the epidemic because of the lack of access to international markets in relation to the United States sanctions against Iran. Epidemia has generated calls to the United States to adopt social policies distributed in other state countries, including the inclusion of a single health system and income of children payable for family conditions and the increased financing of public health.
Politologs expected that this could be negatively affected by Donald Trampa's possibilities for the re-election of the presidential elections in 2020, and that the pandemic relationships were worse between Japan and South Korea.
South Korea was opened “inconsistent and passive career measures” by Japan after announcing that any citizen who arrived from South Korea will be placed at a two-weekly candidate to the Government's specific posts.
The South Korean society has been originally separated by the response of President Mun Chyeina to the crisis.
Many of the Koreans signed the complaints that were encouraging the President ' s action, or called upon Mr. Munum to issue an implication for an inadequate reaction of the Government for Diseases. Pandemia urged the country to adopt laws on emergency situations as a response.
Some comments express concern that this step allows Governments to strengthen their power.
In Hungary, the Parliament has proclaimed the provision of the Prime Minister Victor Orban's immediate right to manage the work of the parliament, and to conduct elections and punish those who would be accused of disseminating factual information on virus and government measures to combat crisis.
A number of cases of delivery deficit in relation to the global increase of use of epidemia, purchase goods in the packaging conditions and shocks of production and logistic operations.
The Office of the United States for Food and Medical Quality Control Administration warned the lack of medicines and medical equipment that resulted in increased consumer demand and deficiencies in producers' work.
A number of people also had panic purchases; this resulted in the situation in which goods were lost from the store of the first need, such as food products, a toilet paper and a slaughtered water, which, in turn, led to the deficit of stocks.
In particular, the technologie industry warns delays in electronic products.
According to the Director-General of the WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanoma, the demand for individual protection is 100 times.
The scan has led to twenty-third price growth compared to the normal value, as well as the delay of the allocation of medical assignments for four-third months.
He also argued the lack of personal protection in the world, and WHO warned that health workers were attacked by this reason.
In Australia, there was a new opportunity to sell Australian goods in China with regard to the Pandemia of the Daigo system.
This was a lack of child food in some supermarkets and was then prohibited by the Government of Australia. Despite high dissemination of COVID-19 in North Italy and the Uhan region, both in both areas, were able to avoid the disadvantage of food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the stocking and illicit trade of substantive products that have succeeded have been allowed to avoid the shortage of food expected in Europe and North America.
North Italy, the agricultural production with small scales, has not proved significant falls, but, in view of the sector representatives, agricultural prices can grow.
Pools of food shops remained temporary, even in the city of Uhan, while Chinese government officials have ensured access to pork stocks to the full nutrition of the population.
Similar laws required by food manufacturers for food conservation for emergency conditions are also existing in Italy.
The damage of the world economy was reflected in China: According to the media data dated 16 March, China's economy suffered strongly in the first two months of 2020 because of the measures to combat the dissemination of virus adopted by the Government, resulting in which the volume of minor sales was decreased by 20.5 per cent.
The capital China is a large economic and productive centre, so the virus is considered to be a serious destabilized threat to the world economy.
According to Yamai, the Economist Intelligence Unit, the market guarantee will remain until the potential results are more clearly presented.
In January 2020, some analysts pointed out that the economic impact of the current epidemics in global growth could overcome the impact of the typical pneumonia of 2002-2004.
One of the assessments made by the University of St. Louis at St. Louis, the damage of the World Summit may exceed 300 billion dollars, and the negative impact may take up to two years.

On 27 February, the growing concerns for the injury of the coronavirus various United States fund indexes, including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500 and Dou-Jons-Index for Industrial Accounts, demonstrated the most severe fall since 2008, and the Dou Index declined at paragraph 1191 — the most single fall after the financial crisis 2007-2008.
At the end of the week, three indexes demonstrated more than 10 per cent decline.
On 28 February, the Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed the sovereign credit rating of China but maintained a negative prognosis.
Actions were again shocked by the fears of the dissemination of the coronavirus, and the largest fall occurred on March 16th.
Many believe that economic recession is possible.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian gave a high evaluation of the temporary emergency measures taken by central banks and States.
Central banks react faster than during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most afflicted sectors in respect of movement bans, public closure, including tourist adjustments, and Government recommendations are not taking any journey.
As a result of all of these measures, many aircrafts have deleted rails because of the raw reduction of aircraft, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, and the British regional aircraft Flybe has stopped existing.
The impairment of the crowd industry was as strong as ever.
A number of carriage stations and ports of tyre transmission have also been closed.
Epidemia was composed of June-Yun, the main tourist season of the Chinese new celebrations.
National and regional governments have been listed with a number of activities that participate in a large number of people, including annual new days, and private companies also closed their business and tourismal adventures, such as the Hong Kong and the Shanja Disease.
Many new events were cancelled, and the tourists were closed in order to prevent the mass collections of people, for example, in Beijing were closed and traditional temple halls were abolished.
In 24 of 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the new channel until 10 February, the majority of firms had not been opened before that date.
The regions were 80 per cent of the country GDP and 90 per cent of export.
Hong Kong authorities have highlighted the reaction levels to infection diseases to the very high and declared an emergency situation, closing schools to March and abolishing the New Year celebration, and the decrease sector suffered globally: the shopping time was decreased, and some stories were temporaryly closed.
Visiting points of small trade in Europe and Latin America has reduced 40 per cent.
In North America and the Middle East, sales were reduced by 50 to 60 per cent.
As a result of the visit in March, trade centres were 33 to 43 per cent compared to February.
Operators of the Trade Centres worldwide have introduced additional measures, such as improvement of sanitary conditions, the installation of the monitoring of the temperature of visitors and the decline of activities, as a result of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the reception of the Pandemia, may leave the wealth of 14 to 22 million more than the same situation, but without pandemics.
In January and February 2020, some 5 million people had lost the epidemic in Uhana.
Many of the 300 million Chinese immigrants have been home in the provinces of their country or in the province of Jubai, and more than 10 million Americans lost their workplaces in March 2020 and have been sent to the Government.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank, the Coronavirs has been able to lose 47 million workplaces in the United States, and the unemployment level may reach 32 per cent. In India, self-related measures remain without the work of ten million Indian migrant workers receiving daily payment; the study conducted by the Angusa Reida Institute showed that 44 per cent of Canadian households or that there were no work.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers made a statement on the temporary unemployment, and 1 million British workers were requested for a single social payment, and about a million companies in Germany moved their staff to the substantiated government to the decreased working schedule, a non-complete working day.
German payment scheme for a full working day was also introduced in France and England.
Art and cultural heritage were also strongly affected by pandemia that affected organizations and individuals, whether officially or independent, in the world.
Cultural organizations and arts have tried to support their (financed by the State) mission to ensure access to cultural heritage for society, to ensure the safety of their staff and publicity, as well as to support arts.
To March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions were closed to the world by an undetermined time, or access was differently limited, and exhibits, events and presentations were cancelled or transferred to other dates.
In addition, active efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms, and another recent and recent trafficking results of the dissemination of virus — the cancellation of religious services, large sports events and other public events such as musical festivals and concerts, technological conferences and modes.
In the film industry, Vatican announced the delete of the Treasury Week in Rome, which are conducted during the last week of the Christian repentant period — the Great Resurrection.

Pandemia has made the most significant change in the world sport events since the Second World War.
Most large sports events have been cancelled or transferred, including the WEFA 2019-20 Championship League, the Premier Line 2019-20, Euro-2020 WEFA, the NBA 2019-20 season and the NHL 2019-20 season.
The coronavir has also destroyed the plans of the Year Olympic Games of 2020, which were to begin at the end of July; on 24 March the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be “translated after 2020, but not later than 2021”.
This resulted in a significant increase in the number of players in the online network, and many websites dedicated to the azart games reported that the number of new signers also suffered because different music groups have been suspended or discarded.
Many major theaters, such as the Brodovians, also denied all their spectacles.
As a traditional alternative, some artists and musicians began to study the options to continue their activities and exchange their Internet results, organize direct transmissions of online concerts or web feasts; this helps people to continue carrying out, publish or publish their events.
The network has appeared many of the Internetmembers on the coronavirs, many of which are ambitious and are concerned about the periods of uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 show, it was noted that the pre-accession, xenophobia and racism of Chinese citizens and the people of East Asian origin, as well as the representatives of the population of the horrible points of Europe, the United States and other countries.
The occurrence of fear, suspicion and enemy occurred in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and Asia and the Pacific region.
In February (the majority of the infringements still have been limited by China) racist arrangements expressed in various groups worldwide against Chinese citizens, which were likely to benefit from the virus or have received a fair return for anything.
In some African countries the growth of anti-China is also observed.
Many Uhana and Jubai have reported about discrimination on the sign of their regional origin.
Chinese citizens, as well as its people who live in the infected virus, have been supported both in the Oflain and online rejime.
Epidemia began to be distributed in new countries, in particular in Italy, first in Europe, with a serious decline of COVID-19; in that regard, the citizens of such regions can also begin to feel the influence of suspicious and xenophobia; the citizens of such countries, such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea, have signed a petition in the early stage of prohibiting the invitation of Chinese citizens to their country to maintain episode.
In Japan, Chinese DontComeToJapan (#China Peace to Japan) has undertaken leadership positions in Twitter.
Chinese citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States, report on the growing level of racism and even attacks.
The President of the United States Donald Trump was criticized by the fact that he called "China Virus"; the critics consider this view of racist and anti-China.
In Ukraine, protesters were attacked by bus transported to the New Sander of Ukraine and foreign citizens evacuated from Uhana.
Students from the border with China of North-East India and training in large cities of India reported cases of the surgery of coronavirus.
Dilip Gosh, President of the State Unit of the Bharratia Janata Party, West Bengalia, said that the Chineses had destroyed the nature and “God has disbelieved them”.
Afterwards, these statements were condemned from the Chinese console in Calcutta, called their “false”; in China, the pandemics renewed xenophobia and racism on the people who were not Chinese citizens: foreigners were called the "foreign museum" and objects that were subject to "utilization".
Many newspapers have eliminated such limitations for some or all areas affected by the coronavir.
Many scientific publishers have made open access to their scientific articles dedicated to the coronavir.
Some scientists decided to provide short-term access to the results of their research on the publishing servers such as bioRxiv.

The laboratory testing of the 2019 coronavir (COVID-19) and related virus of SARS-CoV-2 includes methods to demonstrate the presence of the virus and anti-coronal discovery of the infection.
The presence of the virus in the images is confirmed by the OT-CPC which recognises the coronavir.
This test is specific and intended only for the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm sufficiently recent or active infections.
The discovery of anticorps (cyrology) may apply both for diagnosis and for population control.
The anticorps analysis shows the number of persons transferred to disease, including those who were too slightly insufficient to treat them in the hospital or were not insufficient.
The exact mortality level from this disease and the collective immunity level can be determined on the results of such test.
As at March 2020, there was no reliable evidence in any country on the dissemination of virus among the population.
On 23 March, no country had been able to check more than 3 per cent of its population, and the number of tests carried out in different countries is very contrary.
Such differences may have significantly affected the registered mortality rates that may be significantly overcome in some countries.
The test can be tested in tests of the respiratory ways obtained in different ways, including a shock or a microtype.
The results are generally available for a few hours to 2 days.
OT-CPR-test carried out on shocks, only during the first week of disease.
Afterwards virus can disappear from the wolf, however, continue to grow into light.
Patients tested for the second week of disease may be taken as an alternative from lower respiratory ways using the sequenced category, or can be used to use detection products (mocrote).
One of the early tests was developed in the Charite Clinic in Berlin, January 2020, using a polymeric census reaction with real time transcription (rRT-PCR) and read 2500,000 arrangements, which later distributed the World Health Organization (WHO).
On 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom has also developed its test. On 28 January 2020, the South Korean Company of Kogenbiotech has developed a set for the discovery of SARS-CoV-2 based on the CCR (PowerChek Coronavirus).
He identifies the "E" genius for all Beta Coronavirs, and the gen RdRp, special for SARS-CoV-2. Chinese company BGI Group was one of the first companies that have received authorisation by the National Medical Management of China for the extreme use of the SARS-CoV-CoV-2 sets on the basis of the PCC. In the United States, the Control and Protection Centres (CDC) distributes through the organization of the International Reagent Resources Resources for its effective RT-PRC Diagram for Real time (20-19-Novel Coronvir (20-20) ReV-CoV-Time Diagrams in the Panel.
One of the three genetic tests from the older versions of the test test has produced incomplete results due to marriage reagents and the large testing area carried out in Atlanta, resulting in the average period of February 2020, at least 100 samples per day have been processed.
Two components used were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and only after that date, public and local laboratorys were allowed to start testing.
Testing was approved by the Office for Food and Medicine Oversight within the extreme application permit. The United States Common Lab began testing early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorrp announced the possibility of testing COVID-19 based on RT-CPR throughout the country.
This diagnostics began testing on COVID-19 throughout the country since 9 March 2020.
No quantitative limitations were claimed, and the processing and processing of analysis should be implemented in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID 19 test was developed and developed by the State Science and Research Centre for Virus and Biotechnology.
On 11 February 2020, the Federal Health Oversight Service was registered and reported that Mayo had developed a test for the infection of COVID-19. On 13 March 2020 Roche Diagnostics received FDA's approval for use of tests, which could be carried out for 3,5 hours in a large amount of test, which allows a car to process about 4128 tests over 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, FDA issued an extreme permission to the Abbott laboratory for the testing system Abbott m2000; previously, FDA has issued similar permission to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepness also received from the USFDA for about 45 minutes of testing.
The FDA also approved the test instead of using the CCP technologies for isothermal nuclein cycling.
Since the test does not require a series of cycles of the heating temperatures, this method can detect the positive results in only five minutes, and the negative circles for 13 minutes.
Today, the United States is about 18.000 such cars, and Abbott plans to increase up to 50.000 tests per day, and in Taiwan it is currently designed to use a monoculture antibodies, which is specifically linked to a new coronary white (N-white) and has hope to get results within 15-20 minutes, such as glup-express.
In the review of the specialized literature of March 2020, the conclusion is that “rent genes of bread cells have a small diagnostic value at early stages, while the results of the [computer thematics] may have such value even before the symptoms are observed.”
Detect signs identified during the CT include bilateral multilateral sub-sub-parameters with peripheral, asymmetric and assterior distribution.
Sub-Pulderal domination, symptoms of boiling and consolidation are developed in the progress of disease.
The results of the studies compared to the methods of CPRC and CT used in Uhana at the time of the current pandemia showed that the CCT is significantly sensitive than the CCT, although less specific, since many of its visa functions correspond to other pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American Radioology College has published the recommendation “No use of CT to scratch or as a method of testing of the first COVID diagnosis”.
Specific immune response to the infection is expressed in the anticorps processing, including IgM and IgG.
These anticorps may be used to identify infections after the seventh day of existence of symptoms, for immunity and for population control. Analysis may be carried out in central laboratorys (CLT) or by local diagnosis (PoCT)
In many clinical laboratorys, these analysis will be able to perform high-productive automaticized systems, but their accessibility will depend on the speed of each system.
The CLT generally uses one image of peripheral blood, although immune responses may also be applied to serious figures.
In PoCT, one image of blood is generally obtained by the propulsion of each claw.
Unlike the CCP methods, the blood testing phase was not required. On 26 March 2020, FDA was called 29 organizations that interrupted all necessary registration procedures and now could distribute their anti-term tests.
As at 7 April 2020, FDA adopted only one test on extreme application. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorisations for use of its test collections that could be identified in the images of IgG and IgA blood in which the virus can be combated.
The productivity of testing is a number of hundreds of figures within a few hours and therefore this method works much faster than the normal CCP RNA analysis of viral RNA.
The antiquilla was generally identified after 14 days after infection, and in April, the United Kingdom realized that there was no satisfaction for the analysis of the anticorps.
In Hong Kong, a schedule was developed to allow patients to sustain the virus to remain home: “Officiators of the insufficient assistance are transferred to the patient to the image,” the patient returns to the test results. The British NHS reported that the pilot testing scheme was launched in home conditions that eliminates the risk of exposure by other clinical visitors, or the need to detect a rapid assistance machine if it was used to transfer the patient.
Centers of Express Testing helped South Korea to organize one of the fast and wide testing procedures than any other country. 2 March in Germany, the National Medical Association of Compulsory Medical Insurance stated that it was ready to conduct some 12 000 tests a day in an ambulatory conditions, and only 10 700 weeks later.
If a doctor is appointed, the costs of medical insurance are covered.
According to the President of the Institute Robert Coha, the general productivity of Germany in testing is 1600,000 tests a week.
On 19 March, a number of large cities was proposed to test exams.
As at 26 March 2020, the overall number of tests provided in Germany was unknown because only positive results were registered.
The first laboratory study showed that, at the calendar week 12/2020, at the SARS-CoV-2, at least 483 295 analysis, at the week 12/2020, and 33 491 images (6.9%) were positive. Israeli clinical Technion and Rambam Hospital have developed and tested the only timely testing methods of images taken in 64 patients, together with the images and guided further analysis in the case only if a combinated channel was a positive result.
The structure of this laboratory was organized by the BGI Van Zyanum founder and had been completed for only 5 days; the model showed that if the lab was not introduced in such an accelerated time, there would be more than 47 per cent of the disease in Jubai and, accordingly, the care rates were two times above.
The laboratory in Uhan was immediately opened by the Huo-Yung Labs in Shenjjen, Tunisia, Beijing and Shanhae, in the general complexity of 12 cities in China.
On 4 March 2020, the daily overall performance rates were 500,000 tests per day, and open multiplex schemes of Origami Assays, which can test up to 1 122 COVID analysis by using only 93 squads. These balanced constructions can work in small laboratorys, except the need for use of iron-based manipulators.
In March, as regards the lack and lack of reagents, the EU, Britain and the United States was a problem of mass testing.
As a result, some authors requested protocols to process tests, which prescribe the increment of figures at 98°C (208°F) in 5 minutes for the release of RNA genes for further testing. 31 March, it was announced that the number of coronavirus tests carried out by the Arab Emirates to the population today exceeded the rates of any other country, and the large population will soon be protested.
This was due to the possibilities of exam testing, along with the acquisition of the Group 42 and the BGI of the population mass testing lab (constituted on the basis of their laboratory for identifying emergency cases in Huo-Yung in China).
The lab, launched for 14 days, has been able to conduct tens of thousands of RT-CPR tests on day and is the first of the world's laboratory so large that works beyond China.
Differential test options aimed at different parts of the coronavir genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hungary, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German version of the production of test instruments that are sent to the country with low income, without resources to develop its own instruments.
The German option was published on 17 January 2020; the Protocol elaborated by the United States Health and Epidemiological Centres was not allowed until 28 January, which resulted in the lack of test collections in the United States. At the beginning, China and the United States had experienced problems with the safety of testing, and these countries and Australia had not been able to provide sufficient selections recommended by health experts.
In the South Korea, as experts say, the broad access to testing has helped reduce the dissemination of the new coronavirus.
In the course of a few years, the Government of South Korea has worked to provide testing opportunities, mainly in private laboratorys.
16 March, the World Health Organization encouraged the development of testing programmes as the best way to delay the dissemination of COVID-19, resulting in the growth of testing due to the rapid dissemination of virus, many United States private laboratories in which hundreds of thousands of analysis had been loaded, and the stocks of mass and chemical reagents were soon implemented.
In March 2020, China reported the problems with the accuracy of its test components.
The US Test Complex developed in CDC had “insufficients” and, as a result, the Government removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented private test developments. Spain acquired test collections from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the use of these instruments was unspectacular.
The company explained that the cause of uncertainty of results could be an inadequate changing or wrong use of instruments.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would be resigned to uncertain results and replaced by other sets, by the Shenzhen Bioeasy company. 80 per cent of the testing arrangements acquired in China, were also uncertain.
The Prime Minister Matovic invited them to leave in Dúnea. Athesh Kara, a member of the Ministry of Health of Turkey, claimed that the test collections acquired in China had had a high level of errors, and the Ministry “is not used”. The United Kingdom purchased 3,5 million test collections in China, but in April 2020, it was announced that these arrangements were unacceptable to use.
Caring measures for persons whose analysis had a positive result on SARS-CoV-2 and monitoring of patients contacted such patients had been positive.
Students working in the Italian city of V, where the first person died from COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two cycles of total population testing, with about 3400 people per 10 days.
About half of the people with positive results had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed diseases were placed in the career.
It was closed to the Territory of the People ' s Territories, and this measure was completely stopped the dissemination of infection.
In terms of intensive monitoring of contacts, income restrictions, testing and career measures in Singapore, the coron-virus pandemia in 2020 was much less pressed than in other developed countries, and there was no need to introduce extreme limitations such as the strict closure of restaurants and businesses.
Many of the events were cancelled there, and 28 March, Singapore began to advise the people to stay home, but schools, channels in which 23 March ended, were opened on calendar.
A number of other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also conducted pandemics through intensive monitoring of contacts, entry restrictions, testing and care measures, but the limitations were less aggressive.
Statistical study showed that, in countries where more tests were conducted in comparison with the number of deaths, mortality rates were much lower, probably because these countries were able to detect more patients with low-expressed symptoms or absence of symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no resources to mass test, as well as national laboratory with limited work with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first 10 negative results for COVID-19 into one of 16 WHO control laboratorys to confirm testing.
7 of these 16 control laboratorys are in Asia, 5 to Europe, 2 to Africa, 1 to North America and 1 in Australia.
The next graph of the “positive result” column depends on the testing policy adopted in a country.
The country that is tested only hosted patients will have a higher positive result in comparison with the country in which all citizens are tested independence on the existence of virus symptoms, with other equivalent conditions.
The brain, also known as “gigine hand”, is the process of purification of hands in order to eliminate contaminations, grass, micro-organism or other harmful substances.
The regular brain with milk in certain “critical times” during the day prevents the dissemination of many diseases, such as diarrees and collars, which are physically transmissible.
A man may also be exposed to respirator diseases such as glup or ordinary slight, for example, if it is touched to the eyes, feet or smells (again to the slicistic shoes) of the hands.
Five critical moments during the day after which the hands should be cut with milk: before and after defects, after the smell of the child or the change of the undergrounds, before the child’s skin, before the food, and before and after the preparation of food or processing of soft meat, fish and home birds.
If water and milk is not available, hands can be cleaned by zones. The World Health Organization recommends to cut hands:
Before, at the time and after the preparation of food.
Before and after the departure of a sick man.
After the changes of suburbs or the smell of a child in the toilet.
After the smiling, the box or the smell.
After the accession to animals, rame or waste of animal origin.
Medical hygiene hands relate to hygienical actions related to medical procedures.
The brake before receiving medicines or medical procedures allows to prevent or minimize dissemination of diseases.
The basic medical goal of the hand is in the purification of the hands of pathogens (batters, viruss or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemical substances that may be affected or caused by certain diseases.
This procedure is particularly important for people who are working for food or medical preparation, but it is also important for all others.
The hands are very useful for health: for example, it constitutes minimal dissemination of grip, coronavir and other infectious diseases, prevents infections of diarea, reduces the dissemination of respirator infections,
also reduces the rate of adolescent mortality in home species.
The 2013 study showed that a higher hand slight could lead to a small increase in the growth of children up to five years of age.
In developing countries, children ' s mortality rates related to respirators and diarrees may be reduced by reducing simplicity, such as brain hands.
This elementary procedure will be able to reduce mortality levels from these diseases by almost 50 per cent.
Regular memories on the use of hands may reduce the number of cases of diarrees around third, which compare with the use of regions with low water income.
Decreasing the number of cases of diarrees of 48 per cent may be related to the brain, which is the only effective and inconsistent way to prevent diarrees and severe respirator diseases (ORG) in order to deal with relevant responsibilities in each house, schools and other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the main complications of ORI, is the main cause of mortality among children up to five years of age, which brings about 1,8 million children a year.
A total of 3,5 million children die annually from diarrees and pneumonia.
The United Nations Child Fund reports that the hands of milk before the food and after the toilet, which has been strongly adherent, may save more life than any individually taken vaccine or medical intervention, and reducing the mortality of the diarrees almost two and the death of the severe respirator infections to four.
The hands are usually combined with other sanitary activities carried out under water supply, sanitary and hygiene (WASH).
The brain also prevents the emergency of the impetus – disease that is transmitted in direct physical contact.
A little negative consequence of a often skin is that it may lead to the skin and then to its damage.
In 2012, a data study showed that too often the brain can lead to skin and skin skin – to disease known as an extraterrence or the smell, which is particularly distributed among health workers.
The hands may also be considered as a symptom of the consumation and compulsive disorder (OECD).
There are five such “critical moments” during the day when the hands with milk are important to reduce the risk of physical and oral transmission of diseases: after empty (maxizing, defectation), after the smell of the child (subductors) before the child’s grain, before the feeding and/or the preparation of food, or the processing of severe meat, fish or birds.
Some other cases where hands should be taken to prevent the transmission of diseases: before or after treatment of skin or wounds, after slaughter, cathedral or smiling, after addiction to disappearance of animal origin or animal.
In many countries, the brain hands with milk have been very poor.
A study conducted in 2015 in 54 countries showed that the average of 38.7 per cent of the museums with the milk was a general practice. In 2014, the highest rate, 97 per cent, was fixed in Saudi Arabia; in this list, the United States is nearly at the average, 77 per cent; the lowest indicator was fixed in China – 23 per cent. Now there are several methods of change in behavior and declination in the critical situations. In the developing countries, we are working in schools at a time-state, one of the methods that helped children.
The “Inadequate Medical Assistance Programme” carried out by the Ministry of Education of Philippine, is an example of broad-scale activities to strengthen child health and children ' s education.
The national programme is a deregulation that is two times a year, as well as a daily cut with milk and daily dental cleaning.
The same programme is successfully carried out in Indonesia.
Deletion of microorganisms from each switch is more effective if the museum process adds milk or my means.
The main action of the milk and my resources is to eliminate barriers to decrease and improve its level.
Water itself is not considered an effective means for skin cleaning, since grains and skins, which are organic pollutant components, are badly developed in water.
A sufficient amount of water, however, contributes to the cleaning process.
The thirst nitrogen, due to multidimensional use, may also contain bacteria that can be covered in previous use.
A small number of studies dedicated to each bacteria with polluted steady mile has been said that such accident is little likely, since bacteria is cut off from pigs.
The CCC still states that “the frozen milk with a hand-over-up is a preferential option for the brain of the hand”.
The antibodiesal milk is actively advertised in communities careful for their health.
Today, there is no evidence that the use of recommended anti-septics or dismissing means affects the electional effects of organs that have sustainability to antibiotics in their nature.
However, the antibactrial milk contains distributed antibactrial agents, such as triclasin, which are sustained by a number of resistant organisms.
Thus, even if antibiotic shames are not elected in relation to antibactrial milk, their effectiveness may not correspond to the advertised.
In addition to the surface-active substance and other substances to protect the skin, complex combinations can contain oxygen (oxygen, astrabine, milk) as a regulator of RN and antimotive active banane oxygen and other dioxide (vale of faith, vitamin, tyminus, vegetable extracts). Complete analysis carried out by the University of the Public Health, shows that in the plan of prevention of diseases and elimination of bacteria with the hands, efficiency, and anti-balances.
The heat water for human hair is still not enough to kill bacteria.
Bakteries are widely multiplied at the temperature of the body 37°C.
However, for the removal of natural grains that keep polluting and bacteria, heat milk water is more effective than cold.
In contrast to the general view, scientific research showed that the use of warm water does not affect the reduction of micro-loading in the hands.
The deficiency of hands (synthesiser) or antisepts for hands is a means of glue of hand without water.
At the end of the 1990s and at the beginning of the 21th century, the popularity of the materials to smooth on the grounds of water (as well known as the deficiencies of the hands, anti-septics for the declination of hands or sanitarians).
Most of these instruments are made on the basis of isolated sphere or stain, with the addition of proteins, such as carbour (accrelose oxygen polymers) in the form of gym, or nuts, such as glucerine in a iron or drinking form, which ensure the use of these products and the reduced effects of sperm clothing.
The addition of the renewal of the hydrocarbon increases the antimotive activity, and the deficiency of the devices containing at least 60-95 per cent of the spray is effectively destroyed by micro.
Dismissing bacteria on a spurt basis kills bacteria, including bacteria with multimedial drug sustainability (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis ball, and some virus (including HIV, herpes, RSV, ritory, vaccine, glups and hepatitis).
Defects with 70 per cent of bacteria are killed by 99.97 per cent of bacteria (logic reduction of 3,5 decimal reductions in 35 decimals) in hands after 30 seconds after application and 99.99 per cent of bacteria (99.999 per cent of the bacteria reduced 4 to 5 per minute after application. The deficiencies are most effective against bacteria and less effectively against some virus.
Disabled drugs on a spurt are practically inefficace against the type of norrovirus (or Norwalk), most frequently caused by infection gastrointerates. It is necessary to use sufficient anti-septics or spy-containing drugs to carefully process and demand the bone from both sides.
The liquid and slide surface of both ladons, as well as the space between the fingers throughout the length, grows for about 30 seconds until the skin, skin or gallery is completely shocked.
The ends of both hands should also be carefully interrupted, and the United States Control and Prevention Centre recommends to make choices for the brain and not the use of deficiencies, especially if the hands are extremely contaminated.
The growing popularity of these deficiencious means is a simple use and rapid destruction of micro-organisms, but they should not be replaced to the full-valued mind if there is a possibility of using water and milk.
Specific use of dismissing materials on the spurt may cause skin skin sickness if it does not contain skins and (or) skin skins.
The effect of spuring skin skins can be reduced or eliminated by addiction of glucerine and (or) other additive substances in the composite.
In clinical tests, the deficiency of the hands on the spraying components were significantly less sweet and skin skin than milk or antimicrobic materials.
Alergic contact dematization, contact symptoms or hypersensitiveness to the sphere or additives present in deficiencies are almost not occurd.
The lower probability of the disadvantaged thermal was a factor in choosing milk and water deficiencies.
Despite their efficiency, the means that do not contain water are not cleaned from organic substances but simply decentralize them.
This is the reason for the deficiency of hands to prevent many pathogical microorganisms as normal milk and water, since the use of such pathogical microorganisms remains on the hand.
The effectiveness of the deficiency of the hand without a spray depends significantly on the components and components, and historically has been significantly lower than the spy or the spot-container.
Recently, there was a evidence that the preparations used by Benzalcony have a slight and commutative antimicrobic activity, as evidenced, loss the effectiveness of the sphere after multiple use, may be due to the progressing of every reaction.
Many people in the Communities with low income cannot allow the milk to replace it with oil or grain.
Zone or grain may be more effective than just water, but they will always be less effective than milk.
One of the problems with this means is that if grain or water polluted by microorganisms, it may, instead, increase the spread of diseases.
Like milk, the skin is a deficit, because water is a milk cutting.
If the milk is not available, WS recommends use of salt or sand as alternatives.
In order to prevent the infiltration of the United States Diseases Control Centre, they recommend the application of the brain technician, including the following stages:
Pull your hands under warm or cold water.
It is recommended that protocol water be polluted, and the temperature of water has no meaning once.
Help them with a large number of mile, including the thick side of the ladon, as well as the area between the fingers and under the legs.
The skin is removed from the skin, and the research shows that people are shocking for the use of milk (and not only one water) to smell their hands more carefully.
3 hands at least 20 seconds.
Traction is helping to remove the skin micros, and more than you have three hands, so more microbes will be removed.
Take care of the hands under the protocol water.
The pulling of the hands in the stainless water may defeat the shift.
Keep your hands out of a clean helmet, or let them swallow yourself.
Mocles and smell hands are easierly polluted, and often people remain without attention, such as a large swimming, smell, field between fingers and feet.
Artist legs and legs for feet can contain many microorganisms.
It is often recommended to use a skin loon to prevent the skin extinction that may cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If the water is not available and the milk is not available, there are numerous insecurity ways to cut the hands: the extraction of water from cancers or bottle cuts with manufactured opens and (or) the use of the zones, if necessary, for example, in developing countries; in the fields with limited water use (e.g., in schools or rural areas in developing countries) there are water-conservation decisions, such as clouds and other disorders.
The clan with a feet pipe is a simple building, which is covered by the emcost on the floor, and a footer market that should be pressed to swallow water on the hand; it should be used to use a piece of milk.
Effective hand sugar is an integral part of the hygiene process, but some disputes about the most effective shape of swimming in public toilets.
The increased number of research shows that the papers are largely hygienic than electrical hands set in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the Westminster University, which has become the European Union for the Production of Paper Safety and Flood; the study was compared to the hygieneity of paper pools, warm air swimming pools and more modern air flows for hands.
It was concluded that after the cut and shock of hands in a warm air, the total number of bacteria on the fingers in the average increased by 194 per cent and 254 per cent in the rays.
It has also been found that after the cut and shoes of the hands in a swimming air flow, the overall number of bacteria on the fingers increased to 42 per cent, and 15 per cent on the rays.
After the cutting and smell of the paper, the overall number of bacteria on the snakes in the midst is 76 per cent, and at the levels up to 77 per cent. The scientists also tested the possibility of switching up a number of toilet visitors and the average of the toilet at each type of sweet.
A frequency of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 km/h), a frequencies-frequencies, and a micro-organism of its own block, and potentially affect other tsunami users and sandwich in the radio to 2 m.
The use of warm air swimming powders distributes micro-organism in the radio up to 0.25 meters from the swimming air.
In the use of the papers, the microorganism has not been identified, and in 2005 the TUD product and the environment has conducted a study on the evaluation of different hands.
The following changes are observed in the number of bacteria dependent on the brain method:
There are many different manufacturers of swimming pool for their hands, and the shoes for the hand are compared to the sweet paper pools.
The cleaning of hands with dismissing salts may be an alternative decision in the absence of milk and water.
The deficiency of the brake should contain at least 60 per cent of the spurt.
The medical method of brain was obliged for a long time after the veneral doctor Ignaz Earthwellways found it a high efficiency (1846) in the prevention of diseases in statistical conditions.
There are electronic devices that remind the hospital staff that they need to spend their hands if they forgot.
According to a study, the use of such devices is actually helping to reduce the infection levels.
The medical brain has been extended at least 15 seconds, with a large number of milk, water or helicopters for each part of the hand.
The hands should be carefully losing each other by baptizing the fingers.
If there is a jacket under the feet, you can use a mask to remove it.
Since microbes can remain in the water that is present on their hands, it is important for them to spend well and to lose the skin of a clean skin.
After the shooting hand, closed the clan and, if necessary, close and opening any doors, the paper switch should be used.
This allows to avoid repeated contamination of hands from these surfaces.
The goal of hands in medical institutions is to remove pathogical microorganisms and to prevent their dissemination.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the brain order remains unacceptable in most medical institutions: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forgotten the hands before being approached to patients and thus distribute microorganisms.
As a result of a study, the right hand motion and other elementary procedures, the level of blood infections related to the category can be reduced by 66 per cent. The World Health Organization has published a letter with the image of the standard museum procedure and hand processing that should be applied in the health sector.
The WHO instructions on hands are also available on its website and open for public discussion.
The relevant review was carried out in Whitby.
If a confirmation is required to comply with the regulatory requirements, you can use the commercial device for measuring indicators and controls.
The World Health Organization defines “five moments” when needed:
After contact with blood or biological glucose,
Previous anti-septics and
The addition of anti-septic chemicals to milk with the hands of the “medicine” or “anthly” mile helps to destroy bacteria.
Such antibactrial properties may be necessary before operations or in a high content of organs to antibiotics. To ‘release’ the hand before the surgery, the corn, which can be included and excluded without its hands; it should also be used to use a little clorgyxine or water to swim hands, sterile hands for swimming hands after the smell, sterile slipper for the training and other slippering instruments for the cleaning of nuts.
All shootings must be deleted.
This procedure requires hands and cuts to the lotto in general for 2 to 6 minutes.
No need to lose your hand too long, for example, 10 minutes.
During the shock, the water from the shooting should not be cut back to the shooting of the hand.
After the finishing, the hands strike up a steril skin and spend surgery.
To reduce the dissemination of mikrocarbons, you better cut your hands or use anticeptics for hands before and after the cutting of a sick man.
In order to combat stabil infections in hospitals, the first 20 per cent of the brain was made, and there were very few additional advantages when the brain rate was increased by more than 35 per cent.
Compared to the motion of antibactrial milk, the hands of the ordinary milk lead to more than three-class ratio of bacterial infection diseases transferred through food. The comparison of the hands of the spy-container and the brain of the antibactrial milk, at average 30 seconds of each procedure, showed that the treatment of the brain-containing brain reduced bacterial pollution by 26% compared to the antibactrial mile.
However, milk and water are more effective than spurt disorders for hands, in the plan of decreasing the number of H1N viruss in the hands, and cloud difficylium. Hygiene development activities in medical institutions can include mental training, improvement of the access to spy-container disorders, as well as in writing and oral memories of personnel to disclosure their hands.
Additional studies are needed on the most effective way of measures in different medical institutions.
In developing countries, the brain hands have been acknowledged by an effective and important means for improvement of health and even food.
However, there is no stable water supply, milk or mediums in households, schools and workplaces to be able to swallow their hands regularly.
For example, most of the rural areas in Africa are not far in every private or public toilet, although there are very few ways to organize the brain in such places.
However, the insufficient hands may also be caused by cutting addictions, not by the absence of milk or water.
Promoting and stimulating milk hands may affect political decisions, enhance awareness of the use of the brain and bringing long-term changes in the conduct of the population.
In order to ensure the effectiveness of such measures, monitoring and evaluation of results must be carried out.
During the systematic analysis, 70 studies have found that, to improve the situation of hygiene hands in countries with a mean level of health-epidemic monitoring at the community level, as a public market campaign is less effective, one of the examples of promoting the minds in schools — the United Nations Child Fund Triree Star Approach: it promotes the implementation of regular economic measures, stimulating the use of students and the implementation of other geographical triangles.
With respect to minimum standards, schools can increase their levels from one to three stars.
Manufacturers are one of the possible measures under the information campaigns on hygiene to reduce disease and child mortality.
The World Day of Hand (Global Hand Wathing Day) is another example of information campaign aimed at changed behavior.
During some studies, the overall efficiency of hands in developing countries was considered in comparison with the DALYs indicator (conserved years of life without disability).
However, one study suggests that the stimulation of milk brain is a significantly more economic decision compared to other sanitary measures.
The importance of human health, especially for vulnerable groups such as young mothers or premature soldiers in hospitals, was first recognised in the midst of the 19th century by two guiding newspapers: the veneral doctor Ignaz Semmelweis (Ignaz Semmelweis), who worked in Vienna (Austria), and Florens Nightingale (Florence Nightingale), the English doctor and the “principate of the current invasion of hospitals”.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by lyrics called miasms.
In the 1980s, with regard to the abuse of food trafficking diseases and infections related to medical assistance, the United States Control and Prevention Centre has been more actively promoting hygiene as an important measure to prevent infection.
As a result of the increase in the sugar grip in 2009 and the COVID pandemia in 2020, people in many countries have been better understanding how important it was for the protection of the body from such infectional diseases.
For example, in Germany, there were awakees with the main shops in public toilets, as well as in office buildings and airports, with “right hand technicians”.
The word “more” means expressing its desire to take responsibility for anything or to be a party.
It happens from the Bible, Matteus’s Gospel: Pontius Pilatus had “the hands of the hands” when he decided to drink Jesus Christ, and then the phrase was more widely used in some English communities.
In the sweet McBeat's drink, Lady McBeet began to swallow hands in order to clean up from a imagined fire, symbolized by unclean conscience, due to crimes that she did itself and struggled to make her husband.
It was also stated that people who remembered or observed inethics are more strict to put their hands in comparison with others and have more importance for them.
Also, less likely that people who have the opportunity to swallow their hands after the view will participate in any other “purchasing” compensatory activities, such as voluntary activities.
In religions, the brain has both a geographical goal and a symbolic meaning, the symbolic mosquito of water, but without milk, is part of the ritual prescribed in many religions, including bahamism, hinduism, tevila and netilat, the Jewish Lavabo in the Christianity and Wudhu in Islam.
The Indianism, the Jewish and the Islams prescribe the forced brain after visiting the toilet.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, sychism and Islam, the need for hands before and after each receipt of food is considered.
Productive control of COVID-19
The control of productive factors related to COVID-19 underlines the use of the work and health methods for controlling the risk and combating coronavir 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriate risk control of the workplace depends on the location and tasks of work, based on risk assessments, serious epidemia situations in the community and risk factors for individual employees that may be vulnerable in relation to COVID-19.
The Office of the United States for Labour and Industrial Hygiene (OSHA) reported that workers with the smallest risk have minimum professional contacts with the public and colleagues, and in such cases, basic measures are required to combat infection, including the brain, the stimulation of workers to stay home at the signs of disease, compliance with the respirator and daily treatment and the declination of work.
The need for a medium-risk requires private or close contacts with people who have no confirmed or suspected COVID diagnosis, but are likely to be inflicted in connection with the current dissemination of disease in society or during international travels.
Such categories may relate to employees contacting the public, such as schools, high-quality workers and in some large smaller businesses.
Risk control measures for such a group, including basic infection prevention measures, include transportation using high-efficient air filters, protected screens and available personnel protection for contact with the infected COVID-19 person.
The OSHA believes that medical institutions and morgs contacted with a person with a confirmed diagnose or suspected COVID-19 are related to a high risk category; at this time, the risk increases to the higher levels of risk in the conduct of such procedures for aerosol education, or the collection/processing of trials of persons with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COV-19.
Risk control measures for such staff include the use of engineering and technical security equipment, such as ventilation rooms with negative pressures, as well as personnel protections that are adapted to the task.
The COVID-19 sums can cause various effects on the workplace.
Workers may not be in the workplace for their own diseases, the need for other persons or for the fear of possible infringement.
Common templates may be changed as regards the types of goods requested as well as the way to purchase such goods (e.g., purchase in short-cutting periods of delivery or service, not out of the machine).
Finally, goods from the geographical regions affected by COVID-19 are possible. In the protection, you can use the Epidemia Plan for Preparation and Successful Measures.
The issues of risk related to different workplaces and tasks, including the sources of infringement, the risk factors of home and communities, as well as the risk of individual workers, such as old age or chronic diseases.
The plans also indicate the means of monitoring to address such risks as well as the plans of extreme events to result in epidemia.
Plans for preparation for epidemia and responsible measures may be subject to the recommendations of the national level or state level.
Some of the goals for responding to epidemic measures: reduction in the dissemination of virus among staff, protection of people who have higher risks of serious health complications, business-operation maintenance and minimumization of negative consequences for other organizations in their supply targets.
Responsable measures affect the levels of serious diseases in the community where business is.
Risk controls are a structure that is widely used in the security and hygiene of work to group such resources in depending on the effectiveness.
In the absence of the risk of COVID-19, Engineering and technical security are the most effective ones, then administrative measures and, finally, personnel protection.
Ingenious and technical security means exclude staff from work-related risks and are not trusted in the conduct of workers, which may be the most benefits of the economic decision.
Administrative measures provide changes in working policies or procedures required by employee or staff.
Personal protection (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative measures, but may help to eliminate some risks.
All types of staff protection must be chosen from the threat for the employee, slowly (e.g., rescueers) to be used regularly and appropriately, to be regularly checked, supported and replaced as necessary, as well as to be taken right, cleaned and switched, or switched in avoiding infringement.
The Office of the United States on Labour and Industrial Hygiene (OSHA) believes that at least risk posts have minimum contact with the public and their colleagues.
Base measures to combat epidemia recommended for all workplaces include frequent and careful hands, recommendations for disabled workers to stay home, compliance with the rescue stakeholder, including closure of the hands in the box and labour, the slaughter and containers, the disposal of or changed workers, where necessary, recommendations for employees to avoid use of other instruments and equipment and, as well as the tenuge of daily closing and defects of work.
Quick identification and exclusion of persons potentially infiltrated is a critical step to protect employees, customers, visitors and other workers.
The United States centres for combating diseases and their prevention (CDC) recommended staff to remain home to the end of the garden, the lack of the body and many other symptoms during at least 24 hours without use of drought medications or other medications to eliminate symptoms, and also requires to ensure the heavyness of the card policy, to allow staff to stay home for a healthy member of the family and to make awareness of such policies.
According to the OSHA, a medium-level risk posts require private and close contacts in the distance is not more than six feet (1.8 m) with persons with no confirmed COVID or suspects, but are likely to have SARS-CoV-2 in respect of the dissemination of disease in the territory where business is or in connection with recent travels of such persons in the field of distribution of COV-19.
In these categories, employees, who are contacted with the public, such as in schools, the environment with high quality of the population and some large disastrous machines.A engineering-technological security for such groups and groups are the installation of high-efficient air filters, the intensity of ventilation, the installation of physical barriers, such as the provisional logistics protective monitors, and the tendency of the client service without the exit of the car. Administrative measures for such groups and higher risks increase the advertising of the advertising urgement of the emerging urges of the ageing ageing of the ageing ageing age of COW.
In several cases, employees from such a group may need a load of reservoirs.
If a person is sick in the flight, to ensure the safety of workers and other passengers, such as the isolation of a sick person from other persons at 6 feet distances, the appointment of an escape member for a nursing person, the provision of a sick mask, or the treatment of such a person, with a request to cover the smell and the mouth of slaughter at the box or injury.
Equipage members should bring single medical primates close to the sick traveller or in association with physics or potentially infected surfaces and may be additional personal protection, if sick, regular skin, or difficulty with breathing.
Used initials and other unilateral objects should be placed in a biological safe squirrel, and the infected surfaces should then be cleaned and decentralized. In cases of commercial shipping, including swimming vessels and other passenger carriages, the security measures for traveling in the case of sickness, self-related and immediate information of the physician centre on the boat or other symptoms.
In the idea, medical examination should be conducted in the isolated chain of such persons, and, in the case of schools and children care institutions, the CDC recommends short-term closure for cutting or disinfection if the person infiltred is in the school building, independently of the dissemination of disease in the community.
If there is a minimum or medium level of dissemination of infection in the community, a social distance strategy may be included, for example, the decline of journeys for private meetings, meetings and other mass events such as physical or cold use, food in cafeterias, increased distance between parties, time-building and entry, limitation of unnecessary visits, the use of individual health institutions for children's symptoms.
At significant levels of dissemination in the local community, including social distance strategies, it may be considered to be low for law enforcement officials every day and the direct risk for health is considered to be lower, according to CDC.
The law enforcement officials, who are responsible for contacting persons with a confirmed diagnosis or suspect of COVID-19, are recommended to follow the same indications as those prescribed by firms for rapid assistance, including the use of appropriate personnel protection.
When a close contact during delays, employees must purify and detect their forming rings and equipment to re-use by means of clean aeroplanes or by contrary, comply with standard operational procedures for preventing diseases and identification of personal protection, as well as the use and strike of clothing.
OSHA believes that some categories of health and morgue workers are subject to high or very high risks.
High risks are staff for medical assistance, support, laboratory personnel and medical transport contacted with patients with a confirmed diagnosis or predicted COVID invasion.
They have a very high risk of infringement by the aerosol education procedures or by the collection/processing of tests from persons with a confirmed diagnosis or prescribed by COVID-19.
The aerosol education procedures relate to the census, the boxes, the brochure, some statological procedures and investigations or the collection of invasive methods.
Morgs workers with high risks are staff who are working with the body of persons with confirmed diseases or suspects of COVID-19 at their death; if such staff are closed, they are a very high risk; additional engineering and technical security for such groups include the use of isolated places for patients with a reliable disease or suspicion of COVID-19, including the procedures for education.
In some health and morgue institutions, a special ventilation can be used with negative pressure.
The trials should be carried out in compliance with the precautions for biological security levels 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends to distribute patients in the limited expectation zones, depending on the suspicion of COVID-19. In addition to other personnel protection, the OSHA recommends to use employees who interfere to 6 feet with patients with confirmed diseases or suspicion for the SARS-CoV-2 arrest, as well as to persons who are conducting awareness.
In the United States, the authorized NIOSH receptors for persons with N95 filter or higher classes need to be used in a comprehensive written recording programme for guard protection, which indicates the requirements for individual medication collection and medical reviews.
Other types of monitoring may provide more effective protection and comfort for staff. The WHO does not recommend use of speciality because COVID-19 is a redistributing disease, not through physics.
WHO recommends to use only surgical masks for a personnel who acts on the receipt of patients.
Learns, who collect images of respiratory ways in patients with COVID-19 or translators of this disease without procedures for aerosol education, recommend the WHO to bring a surgical mask, protected shoes or protected screen for persons, heavy and primary.
In conducting aerosol education procedures, N95 or FFP2 should be placed instead of a surgical mask.
In view of the lack of personal protection in the world, the WHO recommends to minimise the needs in such means through the use of distance medicine, physical barriers, such provisional cranks, the access to the patient infected by COVID-19, only those who have direct treatment, only the personal protection means necessary for specific tasks, the continuous use of one and the same reservoir, not known, with a number of patients with a single diagnosis, monitoring and co-ordination of staff funds and recommendations.

ANNEX: CC0: Defended rights are not available
In this month, we live in uncertain circumstances.
COVID-19 episode is the revelation of the light between the world and our responsibility.
We did not have such problems, but we know that our effectiveness depends on the ability to conscious, cooperate and development of the communities throughout the world, which is based on such organization.
We have observed the partnership and careful relationships between all our colleagues, which reflected in electronic reception, telephones and chairs, - a wonderful confirmation of the fact that, happily, we work wonderful people with us.
I'm very grateful and honourable to speak about you as your colleagues.
Last week, I was informed about the high evaluation of our work.
I recalled how important it is for the world to call Wikipedia right now, and how useful it is for everyone to have online access to this key resources.
This may be due to your work, either to ensure the workability of the website, payments by our colleagues or the security of the community.
The world needs information submitted to Wikipedia, and today it is more important than ever before.
At that time, to achieve significant results for the world, it is not only what we do, but also how we do it.
With regard to the importance of this mission and your role in this process, we will make significant changes in our joint work by starting the next week.
Adjustment of the order of our work and graphics
As Robin had previously been said, the c-team team was gathered last night to discuss our approach and graphics on the next days and months.
We have considered our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and the best ways to ensure sustainable organizations in that period.
Most of us wanted to resolve the tension and support our long-term mission.
If you want to leave, it's like that.
For all staff, entrepreneurs and extraordinary staff:
On our expectations, it is necessary to work about 4 hours per day or 20 hours per week before the post-posting is income.
We do not declare the weekends: if you can normally work for more hours, this will be allowed for the purposes of our mission.
However, the world is unpredictable now; whatever your needs are, whether you care for the family, obtain food products, or if you get to the doctor, your welfare is our priority number one.
We don't follow your work time.
If you're sick, you should not work.
This is comprehensive and incomprehensive, but we're talking about it.
It is not necessary to form a hospital letter or reply: simply inform your leader and help the command to look at the calendar and graphics to cover key areas.
(If you have the confirmed COVID diagnosis, report Brian from the T&C Ops unit to ensure that T&C can support and take care of the guidance to your situation.)
The payment of temporary rates will be performed in full.
We have already declared and reaffirmed our intention to comply with our contractors and staff with the timely payment rate.
Each person will receive payment according to the ordinary temporary rates applied in normal circumstances.
This, in particular, reflects the period of illness when you can't work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people use their work as a way to make peace around us.
What we do can bring wonderful results, especially in such times.
And again, it's about self-help.
We ask you to communicate with our leader to know what to expect, and to be able to correct your actions in a way appropriate.
Some types of work are considered significant.
Such activities should always be supported.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety and Fundation commands (including other) are critically critical to need additional support.
We initiate the process for all units to assess the current objectives and raises the emphasis on support, which is very important for our mission.
There are many tasks for each of us, and we're just focusing on the most important projects.
The late today does not mean negative consequences in the future.
We are not planning to work “twelve more to be dispatched” after the end of the pandemic.
You do not need to work above to comply with unreal deadlines for the present time.
We recognize that the circumstances have changed, and we will work on the establishment of new objectives and deadlines as possible.
What happens with the APP (annual plans)?
In order to re-establish a new reality and expectations of daily worktime, we intend to adjust the period of implementation of our Year Plan for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose the extension of the deadlines for our plan for 2019-2020, thus ensuring more time for the budget, which allows staff to give critical priority to the work, self-related work, and, in the context of those who need or who want to work, will ensure a decreased calendar for the next few weeks.
This extendment allows significantly to reduce the current planning and pressure burden on all organizations.
The next week, we will submit our proposal to the Council, we shall inform representatives and teams of the actual information on the following steps immediately after receiving the relevant confirmation.
Thanks to the ACP team for the leading role in that work.
Status of offices, risks and disposal
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues from San Francisco could be infected by the COVID-19 virus.
However, in addition to the number of warning measures, we took the anti-virus team to determine all surfaces in the office in San Francisco.
They used anti-virus solutions to detect all surfaces, as well as for accepted and lifted balls that can be accessed to our stage.
The building shall apply its own rules for cautiousness with the use of products that ensure the safety of their actors.
We feel that the office will be well prepared for the period when we decide to return.
Our office in Colombia (DC) is on the WeWork company network, which has shared with us and all staff in DC, its rules related to COVID-19.
Last week, our office in Colombia was fully moved to the removal work in accordance with the instructions made in San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues from New York have been known, we also discussed the issue of the building in Brooklyn.
Such discussions continued, but they can be rejected.
Some of our colleagues first work away.
Our elderly colleagues who work away know about the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended to limit the length of meetings at one-two hours.
In the need for more long-term sessions, consider the possibility of cutting them on the course of a few days.
Determine clearly the goal of the meeting, the agenda and delete the material for information.
Default use video connections to facilitate interactions and connections, such as Google Docs and Zoom.
The coordinator is a person who will monitor the deal of issues in the chat and control the list of spyers, as well as the marking account (or joint packing).
If you need to use a pleasant beauty, click in the service of e-mail support.
Use your Wellness Reimbursment program advantages when buying shops.
Keep connecting to #remoties in Slack to talk to colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team is studying the allergonology guidelines available in the web format to promote the effectiveness of the distribution of all organizations.
Last week, we requested all receipts of the community ' s shareholders to abolish major activities financed by Wikimedia, such as 'editors' until the WHO declared the end of the pandemic.
We understand and inform that our requests on such cancellations and other restrictions may not affect the unfair implementation of agreed grants events, and no one will be affected by the delay or change of such purposes.
The next week, we will take follow-up to WikiLeaks and other regional and thematic conferences of the Community.
The global community is not only an interruption of work, but also some feelings of facilitation in relation to understanding and the opportunity to focus on its own communities, Wikimedia and not only.
With regard to the prospect, the CRT works on pages in Meta-Wiki, which provides space for the community to monitor effects and society.
We remain in contact with COVID-19 issues
We will send an invitation to your Calendar to the Special Meeting of Personal, which will be held on Friday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 P.
This time, we use the opportunity to share further information, answer your questions and to take together time, connecting to each other.
We are together in such a situation and are ready to help all of us.
You can still receive information from such an electronic list, and other important information on COVID-19 from the Wikipedia Office.
The CRT will update these pages and all information will be gathered in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with a personnel living in countries that have significantly affected the current situation.
In the case of travels, activities, key flows, information-release issues, or if necessary, contact CRT.
We are willing to support and safeguard contacts as necessary.
If there are problems related to confidentiality, please contact Brian Judan (Bryan Judan), director of HR International Global Operations.
No such changes should be considered as refusal for our work and our obligations.
Instead, this is the recognition of the existing need for a new adaptation of our work and obligations.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support each other and to ensure that they continue to work, to support our movement and all the world through the necessary service.
Our planning work will be waiting for the appropriate time.
Today is time to support each other and to create a space for the important work of the future weeks and, perhaps, months.
In order to do so, we need each of you to help, and we need you to be able to care for yourself and your families, as well as to work with the maximum departure, as soon as there is a need.
Now, please, help your hands and don't care about your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S) and other members of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is a pharmaceutical pharmaceutical (cellular membranes) cells in light, artificial, heart, shocks and cups.
ACE2 is contrary to the activeness of the corresponding angiotensin (ACE), the reduction in the content of angiotenzin II and the increased Ang (1-7), by making it a lot of promised decisions for the treatment of heart-conciliating diseases, and AC2 also serves the income of cells for some coronary virus.
The human version of the farming is often mentioned as hACE2.
The angiotensic pharmaceutical pharmaceutical pharmaceuticals is a cycling metal that is on the surface of the endotelial and other cells.
The ACE2 white contains the N-commerceal M2 and the C-commerce transport domain of the renal aminocystal collection.
ACE2 represents an unilateral memorandum type I, and its slightly active domain is on the surface of light cells and other tissue.
The Included Domain ACE2 is excluded from the transmissible domain of another farm, known as shaddas, and the cut-off white is released in the blood skin and, finally, the snake is released.
The ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is designed to the cell membrane of most lyrics type II, tonic tube interactions, artificial and ventricular cells and glouse muscles of the majority of organs.
Biosintesis ACE2 and RNK are also found in the main corner of the brain, striatum, hypotalamus and brain.
The basic function of ACE2 is to speak as an anti-Ace.
ACE covers the hormone of angiotenzine I in co-conciliating angiotensin II.
ACE2 defeats carboxyl-contamination of fenylalanin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tir-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it in vascular angiotensic angiotensic (1-7) (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may also cover a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9] - breadikin, appeline, neurotensine, dinarphine A and grelin.
ACE2 also regulates the member transporter of neutral aminoxis SLC6A19 and presents Hartnopa's disease.
As a transmimber white, ACE2 is the main point of input for some coronavirs, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SARS) virus; and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 virus).
Nevertheless, the linking of S1 whites of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with a pharmaceutical ACE2 domain on the surface of the cell leads to endocytosis and translocations as well as the endosome farming within the cell.
This input process also requires a S-serial protease of TMPRSS2, which is currently studied as a potential to therapy. Some thoughts that the reduction of the ACE2 level in cells could help to combat infection.
However, many vocational communities and regulatory bodies recommend that the standard therapists of APF and BRAS continue standard therapy.
According to the systematic review and metanalysis published on 11 July 2012, "the use of APF inhibitors was related to a significant reduction in the powder risk in 34 per cent compared to the control group".
Furthermore, “the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced in patients receiving ACF inhibitors who have been subjected to higher risks, pneumonia diseases, especially insults and cardiac insufficiency.
The use of APF inhibitors also associated with the decreasing mortality from pneumonia, although the results were less reliable than patients with the general risk of pneumonia."
The recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is the newness in therapy when heavy damages, and it seems to be improved by light geodynamics and oxygen populations in the symptoms of the respiratory insufficiency caused by lipopolisharids.
The rhACE2 period is around 10 hours, and the start of action is 30 minutes, in addition to the duration of the effects at 24 hours.
Some data show that rhACE2 can be a multi-promising means for people with the non-conformity of the retina-angiotensic system (CPI ingibians) or in diseases that have increased the circle angiotencing II. The rhACE2 was evaluated in clinical tests in the treatment of an extreme syndrome disorder.
COVID-19 annexes are the software applications for mobile phones designed to help epideological investigation in the 2019-20-year-old panody panodemia of the coronavirus, namely the identification of persons (contacts), which could be contacted with the individual.
In some regions, many applications were developed or proposed by official supporting authorities.
A number of applications have been developed to monitor contacts.
This has generated a discussion on confidentiality issues, especially on the systems based on the monitoring of the geographical location of the users of the applications.
The more flexible options include the use of Bluetooth signals to register the user close to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple declared that their efforts to integrate such applications would be linked directly to their Android and iOS operational systems.
In China, the Government launched a annex that enabled citizens to check whether they had been communicated with people infected by COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities, which are used in Singapore as TraceTogether.
The application was developed by local IT companions, has an open source code and will be transmitted under the control of the Government. The Northern Macedonia launched the Appendix “StopKorona!” which works at Bluetooth to monitor contacts with potentially infected persons and provides operational connection with health bodies.
The Annex was jointly developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
At 14 April 2020, the annex expected registration in Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
12 April, the Government stated that the annex to monitor contacts is at the final stage of development and will be available for deployment within a few weeks, and the same applications are planned to start in Ireland and France.
Australia and New Zealand consider the possibility of use of applications based on the Singapore Application TraceTogether and BlueTrace Protocol. Russia intends to use an application with the geo-onization function which aims to monitor that patients with COVID-19 diagnosis in Moscow do not abandon their home.
Ross Anderson, Profesor for Security Safety, Kenbrid University, defines a number of potential practical problems that can face with applications, including false work and potential inefficiency in the use of only a small part of the population.
In view of the concern about the dissemination of the misconduct or harmful “cononavir” applications, Apple was limited to the list of organizations that may propose its applications related to the coronavir in App Store, including only the “official” or other reliable organizations.
Google and Amazon also introduced similar limitations.
Participants expressed concern about the consequences of the population’s oversight by the applications related to the coron-virus; in particular, the question of whether a monitoring infrastructure was demobilized for the fight against the pandemic of the coronavirus would be disappeared.
The International Amnesty Organization and more than 100 other organizations have published a statement to call for restriction of such supervision.
The organization has declared eight conditions that they have been declared to Government projects:
Monitoring should be “lawful, necessary and comparable”;
Monitoring and monitoring should be supplied by the restriction of the duration of action;
The use of data should be limited to the purposes of combating COVID-19;
Data security and anonymity must be protected and evidence of such protection should be provided;
Digital monitoring should exclude cases of discrimination and marginalization;
any exchange of data with third parties should be defined at the level of legislation;
The protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse should be guaranteed;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter without border) also published its lists of conditions.
Google and Apple propose their joint plan to address the continuous monitoring problem, which is intended to remove the monitoring mechanism from their operational systems, just as the need to disappear.
In some countries, the network monitoring of locations is used instead of loading the applications and the possibility of avoiding monitoring.
The network follow-up was approved in Israel.
Network decisions that have access to location data also have major potential confidential problems.
However, not all systems with central servers should have access to personal location data; a number of systems have been developed with the maintenance of confidentialities which are used only for connection (see section below).
In South Korea, the system was used for monitoring contacts that did not use applications as a basis.
Instead of using the special application, the system has collected information on monitoring from different sources, including the monitoring of mobile devices and card transactions, and then combined them in order to establish notifications in the form of text communications sent to potentially infected persons.
The Government has not only used this information to prevent citizens of potential contacts with informed persons but also provided information on the location of the general available place, which has been possible because of significant changes in the information protection law which had been made after the success of the MERS in this country.
Access to such information can be available through several applications and websites, including Germany, the use of centralized systems as well as confidential systems.
As at 6 April 2020, the details were not yet accumulated.
The monitoring of contacts with confidentiality is a significant number of research literatures dated at the minimum of 2013. In April 7, 2020, more than ten experts were working on decisions which provide confidentiality, such as the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to register user approach to other mobile phones.
However, PEP-PT is a product of coordinating efforts including centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentrated trases with the conservation of confidentiality (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), protocols for confidentiality, mobile contact mechanisms (ACT) and others.
These protocols are responsible for the identification of personal data never left the device, and all comparisons have occurred on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab, is designed by SafePaths, a platform that ensures the conservation of confidentiality in the collection and use of data on location or transfer of ways to follow the distribution of COVID-19.
The work of this platform is based on the studies of the Apps Gone Rogue document (Apps Gone: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an epidemic): as to maintain confidentiality during episode), published in March 2020, another similar project is a SafeTrace platform developed by Enigma MPC, company designing confidential technology, which was also the original basis of the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses reliable technologies that allow users to exchange confidential data on localization and health status with other users and officials, with no risk of confidentiality of these data.
5 April 2020 by groups separated the same approach and similar protocols was based on the global coalition of NGOs, which was the goal of reducing fragmentation and ensuring the global coherence of applications to monitor and advertising, which is the key factor of their wide dissemination.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore Government announced that it was opened by the BlueTrace code used in its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies controlling Android and IOS mobile platforms, have announced the initiative to monitor contacts, which, as they said, provide confidentiality, and which is based on the combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography that allows to maintain confidentiality.
They also published key technologies used in the work of the system.
According to Apple and Google data, the system should be turned into three stages:
Developing instruments allowing Governments to establish official applications to monitor the movement of the infected coronavirus by the citizens, but maintaining confidentiality of data
The integration of this function operated directly in the IOS and Android, Google and Apple plans to solve permanent monitoring problems, first entering the system through the update of the operational system, and then removed it so after the disappearance of the threat.
The reposition of the medicinal product (as well known as proliferation, readministration, change of tasks or therapeutic transmission) is a reproduction of the approved medicine to the treatment of diseases or medical condition that is separated from the disease, which is specifically prescribed in the development.
This is one of the research directions which are currently used to develop safe and effective COVID treatment methods.
Other research guidelines include the development of COVID-19 vaccine and the transfer of re-concentrate plasma. SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 tanks that have the effect of drugs, each of which has a number of ligade-related parts.
The analysis of these linked areas is an appropriate basis for the development of effective anti-avirus preparation against COVID-19 bals.
The most important white-levels for SARS-CoV-2 are the patinain-protease, the independent RNA polymerators, the helicopter, the S and the ADF-riboosfatase.
Hussein AA and co-actors studied a number of candidates that were then optimized and analyzed their structures with the most appropriate preparatorys to accelerate the development of high effective preparation against SARS-CoV-2, which will be recommended for clinical research.
Chlorokine is an antimotherary preparatory, which is also used in the treatment of some audio-immunal diseases.
18 March the WHO declared that hydroxycrokine and associated with it would enter the number of four preparations under the clinical “Slidarity” test.
The Governor of New York, Andrew Kumoo, declared that the tests of cloroxine and hydrochlorokine were started in New York State on 24 March. On 28 March FDA authorized the use of hydroxylogen sulphate and chlorokin fosfate in accordance with the extreme application permit (EU).
The treatment scheme was not approved during the clinical FDA test process and was permitted in accordance with the United States only as an experimental treatment for immediate assistance in patients who are hosted but cannot be obtained in clinical test treatment.
CDC stated that “the order of use, monitoring, or duration of recovery of hydroxylorokine for proliferation or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection is not yet established.”
The doctors say they use the prepatrate when “no other output”.
The Turkeyn research group in Istanbul conducted a small study on the use of clorocine in combination with skin and vitamins A, C and D.
The main-scale studies are conducted at the University of Duke and the University of Oxford.
The New York University Medical School studys the safety and effectiveness of hydroxylocarbon preventive use.
Chinese clinical tests in Uhana and Shanghaine showed that fabrics were “unlike effects”.
35 patients in Shanjjen, who received this prepatriation, were negative results in average 4 days, while 45 patients who did not take prepair, had 11 days of illness.
In Uhana, there was a study in which a large oversight of 240 patients with pneumonia, one half of which received favilyaries, and the second half of the Umifenoir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical State recalled the public that the results of the effectiveness of preparation should not be considered to be final.
2 April, Germany declared that for the completion of its reserves in Japan, and for its delivery in university hospitals where the prepair is used to treat patients with COVID-19 is used by military resources.
According to the South China Morning Post newspaper, Sindzo Abe reported the Trumpa Administration about the possibility of purchase, which may be less effective in cases of disease.
It may be dangerous for pregnant patients or for patients who are trying to retain.
As a result of a study of the combination of antivirus “lopperavir” and “ritonavir” (Kaletra), it was concluded that “the effectiveness of the use of preparations has not been identified”.
The preparations were designed to inhibit HIV replication by linking protease.
A group of researchers from the University of Colombia is trying to modify medicines to find connection with SARS-CoV-2 protease. In the scientific community, drugs are criticized to reproduce specially for HIV and AIDS.
The WHO included the combination of colonavir and ritonavir in the international test of “Solidarity”.
Remdeviir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences for the treatment of Abola and the Marburg Virus infections, and then found that the Gilead Sciences has an anti-viral activity in vitro with regard to numerous fil-, pneumonics, paramilizers and coronavirs.
One of the problems related to anti-viral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and transmissions.
Some early preliminary studies show that rumdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance, and there are several clinical tests, including two university clinics Climberland; one is conducted in patients with dead forms of disease, and another in patients with more painful forms.
There are currently three clinical tests for internal vitamin C for people who are hosted with a serious form of COVID-19: two plasma control studies (China, Canada) and one without use of plasma (Italia).
24 March 2020, in New York State, the antibiotic antibiotics began.
The Japanese National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (GGM) plans to conduct an Alvesco clinical study (cyclesoni) Tejina, an integrative corticosteroide for the treatment of asthma, in order to use it with pre-symptoms of patients identified by a new coronavir.
The experience of the phase II, the forms of angiotensic phenomenon 2, are conducted with the participation of 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria, hosted with severe forms of disease, with a view to identifying the effectiveness of treatment.
Studiers from the Montreal Institute of heart-consistent disease, Canada are currently studying the role of colhicin in reducing disorders and light complications in patients with weak COVID-19 symptoms.
For studies called COLCORONA, 6000 adults of 40 years and older who were diagnosed by COVID-19 were invited with light symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Temporary, pleasant and unnecessary women's contraceptive means cannot participate in this study.
A number of coagulants are tested in Italy.
Niskolecular heparin is widely used for the treatment of patients, which has built the Italian Medical State to publish recommendations on the use of this preparation.
14 April, Italy was declared a multicenter study with the participation of 300 patients to investigate the use of enzym resistance to preventive and therapeutic additives.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a significant scientific focus was focused on the re-proliferation of approved anti-virus preparations, which were developed for previous episodes such as MERS, SARS and West Nila virus.
Ribavirin: Fisheries were recommended to treat COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th publication of Chinese recommendations.
Vifennair: Vimifennair was recommended to treat COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th publication of Chinese recommendations
Some antibiotics that were recognised potentially to use as COVID-19 treatment:
Tocilizinumb ( anti-IL-6): approved in China.
Also tests in Italy and China, see Tocilizumab #COVID-19.
COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetic vaccine against coronavir 2019 (COVID-19).
Despite any vaccine tests, many attempts to develop such vaccine continue to be undertaken.
By the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it was not expected that vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 could be obtained before 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were investigated for security phase I.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
In 2020, the major success of this disease has been distributed throughout the world, resulting in significant investments in the development of vaccine and research activities in its connection.
Many organizations are used to develop possible vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
As stated in April, the key tasks of the CEPI vaccine development initiatives are to ensure the necessary speed, production powers, wide development and global access.
In April, scientists reported that there were 10 different technological platforms to create effective vaccine against COVID-19 at the beginning of 2020.
Some main platform objectives included in the security study of phase I:
nucleus oxygen (DNC and RCN) (developer stage I and vaccine preparation: modern, and RNK-1273)
Virus vector (developer of the I phase and vaccine prepaid: CanSino Biologics, adenviric vector type 5)
As scientists of the CEPI reported in April, 115 potential vaccines are on early stages of development, 78 of them are used in approved active projects (79 of the Millennium Institute); further 37 candidates, but there are little general information available (possitively on planning or development).
At the I-II stages, the preliminary test on safety and immunity, as normally predominantly, plasma controlled, and on a number of parts, with a single definition of more accurate and efficient areas.
The phase III of the tests usually covers more participants, including the supervisory group; the preparations are tested at the stage of the prevention of diseases and at the same time follows the adverse effects in optimization.
From 79 vaccine candidates actively developed (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020) 74 have not been tested on humans (these are still at the stage of the productic studies).
On 24 January 2020, the University of Quinsland, Australia, declared that vaccine capacity is investigated with molecular shoes that genetically modifys virus skins to stimulate immune reaction.

On 17 March 2020, the Italian biotechnological company Tacis Biotech declared that it would receive the results of the alcoholic tests and their final vaccine prepatriation could start testing for people in April 2020.
On 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Innovation in Episode Preparatory (ECPI), France announced the investment of $4,9 million in the COVID 19 consortium with the participation of the Pastor Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vene, Austria) and the Pittsburgh University.
Other CEPI investment partners in the development of vaccines from COVID-19 are modern, Curvac, Inovio, Newvax, Hong Kong University, Oxford and Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials declared that scientists have started testing six different candidates for animal vaccine.
Imperial College, London, announced 20 March 2020 that they develop self-ampliciated COVID vaccine.
The vaccine preparatory was developed for 14 days after receipt of China ' s correspondence.
At the end of March, the Canadian Government announced the allocation of 275 million Canadian dollars for the financing of 96 research projects on medical control against COVID-19, including the development of numerous vaccines in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and Saskatchewan University.
At the same time, the Canadian Government announced the allocation of 192 million Canadian dollars specially for the development of vaccines against COVID-19, as well as on the plans for the establishment of the national vaccine bank, where a number of new vaccines could be used for the new success of the coronavirus.
On 2 April 2020, Pittsburgh University Medical School researchers reported about the testing of the PittCoVacc, the possible vaccine against COVID-19 on the mouse, said that “MNA introduced joint vaccines of SARS-CoV-2 S1, causing strong antigen-specific anti-general [in museum] responses that had been identified through 2 weeks after immunization”.
On 16 April 2020, the Canada Pharmaceutical School of Waterloo announced the development of potential vaccine based on DNA, which may be issued in the form of a national barrier.
The DNA bacteria will be multiplied within human bacteria and form without dangerous viral parts that can stimulate immune anti-corporate anti-virus with SARS-CoV-2.
In March 2020, the Government, the Industry and three United States universities combined IBM supercomputer resources in combination with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google areas.
Some vaccines have geographical effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have other advantages, in addition to the properties of prevention of disease.
Another early study conducted in Australia includes 4170 health workers.
Developed vaccines may be hazardous or inefficient.
The first studies on the evaluation of vaccine effectiveness with the use of animal models, such as ACE2-training muscles, other animals and low-standing laboratorys, indicate the need for measures to maintain biosafety 3 in the processing of living virus, as well as the international coordination of standardized security procedures.
Vacuum against SARS and MERS was protested on animal models.
In 2020, there are no drugs or protected vaccines that would be safe and effective for people.
According to the research work published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and physicians for the treatment of typical pneumonia was a priority for the Government and public health institutions worldwide.
When MERS started to be distributed, it was considered that the SARS study, which was understood at that time, could be a standard for the development of vaccine and the terapeutic means against the infection of MERS-CoV.
On March 2020, there was one (based on DNA) vaccine from MERS, which passed in the first stage of the clinical tests in people and three more vaccines, all of which were vaccines based on the virus vector, and were in the process of developing, two addenavirus (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one (MVA-MERS-S).
In social networks, the theory of the reservation was distributed, claiming that COVID-19 was not very new, and that vaccine already exists.
Publications in social networks quoted some patients who claimed that the existence of patents to the genetic symptoms of other coronavirs, such as SARS coronavirus, and vaccine for these stamps.
Coronavirus is a disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19), a infectious disease caused by a heavy respiratory syndrome of Coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2).
The worst diversity of symptoms include disorders, cash and breathing.
Other symptoms may include feelings of illness, muscle pain, diarrhoe, torment in the torment, depression and pain in animals.
The time from the first symptoms to the pipe of disease is usually about five days, but may also vary from two to fourteen days.
Most cases have been demonstrated by light symptoms, but in some cases, diseases are in viral pulmonary and poly-organic insufficiency.
At 17 April 2020, more than 2,24 million cases of infection in 210 countries and regions were registered, and over 153.000 people died from this disease.
More than 5680,000 people have been residualized, and the virus is mainly distributed in close contact with people, often through microscopic cables that are in air at the castle, smoking or conversation.
Although these caps are formed at the air, they are usually threatened by the earth or on the surface, but are not transferred through the air on large distances.
People are also impressed about the contamination surface, and then their eye, noise, or rat.
The surface of the virus may live within 72 hours.
In the first three days after the symptoms, it is the most powerful of its dissemination, although it may be possible before symptoms and later stages. The standard diagnosis method is a polymeric reaction of re-reaction in real time (RT-PCR) to be taken as a smoke from the powder.
The use of medical mass is recommended to patients with suspicion for diseases, as well as those who care for them.
Recommendations on the use of health mass are different: some states recommend that they do not use, some recommend their use, and others require it.
There is no vaccine or specific treatment of COVID-19.
The local dissemination of disease was registered in most countries in all six WHO regions.
The persons identified may have no symptoms or symptoms of grip, such as shock, cash, slowness and shock.
Extreme symptoms include difficult respiration, constant pain or feeling of skinness, consciousness, difficulties with trial, smuggling of the person or thumb; if there are above-mentioned symptoms, it should be immediately requested for medical assistance.
The symptoms of higher respiratory ways, such as breathing, smuggling, or pain in the wolf, may be observed.
In various percentages, wealth and skin symptoms, such as tosnote, routine and diarrey are also observed in different percentages.
Some cases of the diseases registered in China were clearly shown only the feelings of grain and heart-training.
In some cases, illness can be progressed by developing in pneumonia, polyorganic inadequacy, and finally death comes to death.
This is called an incubatory period.
COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but may be between 2 and 14 days.
97.5 per cent of the symptoms are starting to be demonstrated within 11,5 days after the invasion, according to data, the symptoms are not all informed.
The role of such unsymptoms reporters in transmission of diseases is still fully unknown, but the preliminary data show that they can contribute to dissemination of infections.
The percentage of infected persons currently unknown, it is only investigated; the Korean Control and Prevention Centres (KCDC) reported that 20 per cent of all cases and hospitalizations on virus during the disease was unsympathized.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include insynthmic cases in its daily report from 1 April; from 166 cases of infringement registered at that day, 130 (78 per cent) were rejected in symptoms at the time of test.
And the molecule, and the salt, may have a large concentration of virus.
In the hole, the air speech is made more caps than the normal volume.
A study conducted in Singapore showed that the cover can be distributed at a distance to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
The virus is not generally aired, but the National Science Academy suggested that the transfer of a bioaeconomic virus is still possible and the testing of the air processed by air collectors in the coridors of the rooms showed the existence of the virus RNC.
Some medical procedures, such as intuination and heart-ly-life reaction (LLD), may lead to the distribution of extraction products and, therefore, to disseminate the virus in the air.
There are also fears that virus can be distributed through fece, however, the risk is considered low; the virus is the most contagious when people are symptoms; the dissemination of the virus may also be even before symptoms, but the risk is smaller.
The European Centre for Prevention and Control of Diseases (ECDC) said that as far as the virus is evident, however, it is known that one patient usually affects 2 to 3 other persons, the virus can survive from a few hours to a few days.
In particular, it was found that on the carton surface, the virus can live within one day, on the plastic surface (polipiline) and on the nervous (ASI 304) — until three days, and 99 per cent of the medical surfaces up to 4 hours.
However, these indicators are depending on the power and temperature.
The fat and my means in their proper use have a very useful effect in combating the inpression: the mile destroys the grass protected glass of virus, deactivating it so, and it can be removed from the skin surfaces and other surfaces.
Other deficiencies such as benzolgenic chloride and glucoonic chlorics (chirurgic deficiency) were less effectively against the virus, and in the studies carried out in Hong Kong, the samples were taken in average two days after hospitalization.
In five of the first six patients, the first test showed the highest concentration of virus in blood, and the sixth patient has been identified in the second day of blood testing.
The intense coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe coron-virus syndrome, in the first time found in three people with pneumonia from extreme replicator diseases registered in Uhana.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also met in the nature of coronavirs.
Without human body, the virus is destroyed by a brain milk that covers its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 is closely associated with the original SARS-CoV.
The legkey is the most substantial effect of COVID-19, since the virus is in the cells through angiotensic angiotensin 2 (ACE2), which is most distributed in the alveolial cells of light type II.
The virus is connected to ACE2 and passes in the cell with a character of glucoproteine – "ship".
12 per cent of the infected persons in Uhana have been diagnosed by a microcarbon injury, which is often seen in a serious form of disease.
The rate of heart-consistent symptoms is high due to the system-related response and the violations of the immune system in the progress of disease, but the disadvantage of the microarm may also be related to the existence of ACE2 receptors in heart.
ACE2 receptors are present in large numbers because they participate in the work of the body.
The high rate of transbosis (31 per cent) and venus tramboombola (25 per cent) observed in patients with COVID-19, and may be shown inconsistent pregnosis. The audience of patients who died from COVID-19 showed the existing diffusions of allergic injuries (DAD) and limfocyto-container in lightly.
While SARS-COV-2 has a thropothesis to ACE2-expressive respiratory cells, patients with heavy COVID--19 symptoms are observed in system hypersensitives.
In particular, the pathogical GM-CSF T cells were in line with the replication of IL-6 monocytes, and the weak pathology of COVID-19 patients.
Limfocitar filters were also found when hiding.
WHO also published a number of test protocols on this disease.
Polymeric cep reaction in real time (RT-CPD) is a standard testing method.
The test is usually carried out on spectrums obtained by a snake, but can also be used by a snake or a snake.
The results are generally prepared for a few hours to two days.
Blood analysis may also be taken by brothers, but they require two tests of blood in two weeks, and their results have no immediate value.
The Chinese scientist could set up a coronavirus stage and publish its genetic symptoms so that scientists in the world’s laboratorys could self-develop tests of polymeric cep reaction methods (CPP) to identify the existence of this virus.
As at 4 April 2020 the anticorps tests that could detect the existing infection at the current time, as well as the fact that possible in the past were developed in the stage of development but have not yet received a wide dissemination.
Chinese experience in testing results showed that the accuracy of them is between 60 and 70 per cent.
On 21 March 2020, the Office of Food Control Quality and Medical Products (FDA) adopted the first test for the diagnosis on place, allowed it to use at the end of the month, in indications on the diagnosis published by the Hospital of June of the University of U.S.A., the infection methods are defined on the basis of clinical characteristics and epidemic risks.
Multiplele subparameters on the type of "Materic Steel" with peripheral, asymmetric and asymmetric distribution are the partial symptoms identified in the early stage of disease.
Subsectional domination, symptoms of a bowl strip (from detection of resettlement with changing alveolary) and consolidation is developed in the progress of disease.
The microscopic incidences and the pathophysology of COVID-19 have few data.
The main results of the pathological study in hiding:
Macroscopians: pleasant, percardite, pulmonary and leakage
You can see four types of viral pneumonia:
Little pneumonia: light, hyperplasis of pneumonia, large typical pneumonics, inter-relative infrastructure and multi-year hygiene cells
Heavy form of pneumonia: diffused alveolar damage (DAD) with diffusional vessel exit.
The DAD is the cause of a extreme syndrome distraction (ORDS) and a heavy hypothesis.
Vibrators: organization of ex-states in alveolary pools and medication fibros.
Blood: diffused internal convergence (DHS syndrome); lycoethylelactic reaction
Preventional measures to reduce the possibility of infringement include home residences, the avoidance of human places, the use of milk hands and water within at least 20 seconds, the compliance with the respiratory hygiene rules, and the avoidance of sighting, feet or smell of hands.
CDC recommends to close the mouth and the smell with the box or the smell or, in the absence of the smells, to close the mouth and the inner side of the hand area.
It is recommended that a quality hygiene procedure should be carried out after the box or shock.
The Centre for Control and Prevention of Diseases (CDC) recommends the use of tiny massas in public places, in particular in order to limit the transfer of infections by persons with unsympathized diseases; social distance strategys are aimed at reducing the contact of infected patients with large groups; within these measures schools and undertakings were closed, citizens movement limits and large public activities.
Recommendations on distance also suggest that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) each other.
There is no anti-COVID-19 pharmaceutical preparations. Since vaccine development is expected before 2021, the main part of COVID-19 measures is to reduce the epidemia pipe, known as “paid exit”.
The CDC also recommends that hands with milk and water beat at least 20 seconds, especially after visiting the toilet, or with strong pollution of hands, as well as before food and after smiling, box or smell.
CDC also recommends the use of a deficit spy (spirit content, at least 60 per cent) for hand processing but only when milk and water are not available. In areas where such deficiencies are not sold, WHO provides two receptives for local production.
These compositions are used by stain or ispropanol with antimicrobic activity.
The switch of water is used to eliminate bacterial spots and is not a suitable means for handing anti-septic processing.
Grycellol is added as a owner.
Patients show supporting therapy that can include infuzional treatment, oxygen support, and support of other affected vital organs.
CDC recommends those suspected that virus is infected to bring usual medical mass.
Extra corporal oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory inadequacy issues, but its advantages are still studyed.
In order to strengthen immunity, it is recommended that the rules of personal hygiene, healthy life and diet be respected.
The supporting methods of therapy may be shown to patients with easy symptoms at the early stages of disease.
In the United States, the doctors of intensive therapy and polmonologists promoted the therapeutic recommendations of different IBCC institutions.
No specific treatment of COVID-19 is available at April 2020.
In order to treat symptoms as first line preparations, some medical employees recommend the choice of paracetamore (acetaminofen) compared to ibuprofen.
In the implementation of procedures where air-capital emissions, such as interruption or hands, are necessary to take warning measures to minimise the risk of transfer of virus, especially in medical institutions.
Medical workers with COVID-19 recommended that the AIIR air-capital isolator (AIR) be placed with additional standard precautions for contact and air precautions. The CDC has published recommendations on the use of individual protection (ISI) during the pandemic period.
Recommendated personal protection means: protective heat, guard or medical mask, eye protection and medical primates.
N95 repairs are authorized for use in industrial conditions, but FDA has allowed the use of these receptors in accordance with the extreme application permit (USA).
They are allocated to protect parts from air, such as powder, but not guaranteed by the use of efficacy for the protection of specific biological agents.
If medical masks are not available, the CDC recommends to use protected persons' screens or, at least, to produce the masks in home conditions.
In most cases, COVID-19 is insufficient to require the art ventilation of light or its alternatives, but there is a certain percentage of cases where it is necessary.
The type of monitoring support for hosted patients with the respiratory insufficiency related to COVID-19 is currently actively studied, with some evidence that insulin cancer cancer cancer could be avoided by a intensive air flow or a double-scale pressure in diet ways.
Before not known, whether there is one of these two ways for patients in critical situations as effective as IHL.
Some doctors choose for invasive mechanical ventilation, if available, because this is significantly limited to the dissemination of parts in the air compared to the incremental air flow. The risk of heavy disease for older people (60 years older and especially 80 years older) is very higher.
In many developing countries there is no need to be malicious cocks for the population, and health systems are too limited to increase the number of cases of COVID-19 in a serious form of hospitalization.
As a result of a study carried out in China, 5 per cent of the patients were hospitalized in intensive therapy office, 2.3 per cent was needed in mechanical support for light ventilation work, and 1.4 per cent had ended.
About 30 per cent of the people hosted by COVID-19 in China finally have been realized.
It is complicated to ensure the art ventilation of light, since the extreme syndrome of the syndrome (ARDS), the development of the COVID-19, and oxygen is increasingly difficult.
IDP, with the support of earning pressure and DPC, is required to deliver maximum oxygen oxygen and to ensure the minimum damages of ventilation, resulting in which the pneumotor can be deployed.
In the early models, higher ventilers of higher DPC may not be available.
The investigation of potential treatment methods began in January 2020, and there are some anti-virus tests at this time.
The worst perspective is the rüzdesivir.
The development of new medicines may extend to 2021, but some of the tested preparations have already been approved for other purposes or are at the last stages.
Preventional preparations can be tested on patients with severe forms of disease.
The recommended WHO volunteers participate in the testing and safety of potential treatment methods. FDA provided an interim authorisation to use a recovery plasma as an experimental treatment when human life threatens serious or direct risks.
It was not implemented in clinical studies that should be conducted to prove security and effective treatment methods.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile annexe for the fight against disease.
Users should enter their name and identification number for access to the users.
The Annex may find “prominent contact” by monitoring data and, therefore, determine the potential risk of infringement.
Each user may also verify the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is discovered, the application recommends not only self-resolution but also the notification to local health bodies; the analysis of the large data collected with mobile phones, the recognition of persons, the monitoring of mobile phones and the art intellect, are used to monitor intelligent people and those contacted in South Korea, Thailand and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli Government allowed the security authorities to monitor the data of the mobile phones of persons who are presumably infected by the coronavirus.
Measures were taken to ensure the carnaval and protection for persons who may be contacted with informed citizens.
In March 2020, the German Telekom virus also provided the Federal Government institutions of Germany and the Robert Coha Institute aggregate data on the location of hundreds of offenders.
In Russia, the recognition of persons has been introduced in order to identify the carenzan violations.
The Regional Health Auditor Italy, Julia Galler, reported that “40 per cent of people are still moved to the territory”.
The German Government has conducted a 48-hour programing marathon in which over 42.000 participants participated.
The President of Estonia Kerty Calulayd also called for creative decisions against the dissemination of the coronavirus.
Persons may experience stress regarding carrantine, travel restrictions, treatment effects or fear of infection.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connor: “Increased social isolation, unity, health concern, stress and economic falls, perfect conditions for harming mental health and welfare of people.”
Diseases can easily be seen with low or unnecessary symptoms that remember other general respiratory diseases, such as ordinary simplicity.
Patients with easier form of disease generally enjoy, within two weeks, while the treatment of patients with heavy or critical forms may require from three to six weeks.
Recent women may have a higher risk of receiving a heavy form of COVID-19 based on data on other virus such as SARS and MERS, although such data have no COVID-19. Some of the COVID-19 people may be slow and cause pneumonia as complications.
In persons with the most severe illness of COVID-19, they can rapidly progress in a strict respirator syndrome (ARDS), which causes respiratory deficiency, septic shock or polyorgenic insufficiency.
COVID-19 complications include sepsis, annual transbobination, and heart-, skin- and penis problems.
Traffic analysis, especially protrombine increases, were described in 6 per cent of the patients in the hospital with COVID-19, while expecting functions are observed in 4 per cent of the group.
About 20 to 30 per cent of COVID patients have increased the pigment (transmission).
According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and death was 10 days, five of which were hospitalized.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death in patients transferred to intensive therapy was seven days.
According to the investigations in cases of early disease, the average time from the initial symptoms until the day of death was 14 days with a full range of six to 41 days.
According to a study conducted by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate among men was 2,8 per cent, and between women is 1,7 per cent.
Hystopotatorological studies shows the difference of alveol with cell fibromsidates in both lights.
The pneumonites observed viral cytopathy changes.
The external spectrum recalled the accurate syndrome of the syndrome.
11.8 Per cent of the deaths registered by the National Health Commission of China, the heart-related problems were to increase the tropical or decline of the heart.
According to the data provided by the United States in March, 89 per cent of the hospitalized patients had previous health problems, and the access to medical resources and the social and social situation in the region could also affect mortality.
Death assessments are different from such regional differences, as well as due to methodological difficulties.
Inadequate effective calculation of cases in a simple form may lead to increased mortality level.
However, the fact that death occurs as a result of previous diseases may mean that the current level of mortality is not valuable.
In smokers, COVID-19 symptoms have been increasingly 1,4 times, and these patients were about 2,4 times more needed in intensive therapy or died compared to non-commercies.
One of the Hungarian clinics found that some patients who were injured from this disease had reduced 20 to 30 per cent, and their scanning has been detected.
After recovery, this may also lead to the syndrome “Send intensive therapy”.
As at March 2020, it was unknown whether the patient's immunity was dealt with against it in the rescued virus.
According to other coronavirs, it was considered positive but was also reported on cases when COVID-19 tests were still positive.
It is estimated that there was a long-term place in these cases, not a repeated detention.
Virus is natural, has animal origin and represents infection disease.
The factic origin of the virus was unknown, but the infection was almost completely condemned by human transmission from December 2019.
The first 41 cases of COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, are called the first date of the first disease.
Official data published by the WHO, this date is 8 December 2019.
A number of methods are usually used for quantitative mortality evaluation.
All figures are depending on the region and the dissemination of diseases, also affect the number of tests, quality of health systems used in the treatment scheme, since the improvement of diseases and population parameters such as age, gender and general health.
At the end of 2019, the WHO contributed to an emergency aid code for ICB-10: U07.1 — for the death of the laboratoryly confirmed infection of SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 – for the death of the clinically or epidemicly diagnosed COVI-19 without the laboratory confirmation of the infection of SARS-CoV-2. The number of deaths and infections is the number of deaths depending on diagnostic cases during a certain period of time.
According to the statistical data of the University of Johns Hopkins, the global number of deaths and infringement cases is 6.9% (153 822/2 240 191).
This figure is depending on the region, and some other methods include the determination of mortality rates resulting from disease (CFR), which reflects the percentage of patients diagnosed by diseases, as well as the determination of mortality rates resulting in infected infection (IFR) which reflects the percentage of infected patients (such as diagnosed and unidentified cases).
These statistics are not associated with a specific time and reflect the population's indicators since the infringement of the disease has been completed.
Despite the development of anticorps in all patients infected, such anticorps may be understood to understand how many people have been infected.
In Italy, Castellon d'Ad, a small village of 4600 people, 80 persons (1,7%) are no longer living.
In the city of England, sickness was distributed to young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all cases of COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been reloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3 per cent of the population may have anticorps, judged by donor blood indicators.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0.004 per cent of the population).
Pandemia and mortality levels are different for men and women.
According to the investigations carried out in China and Italy, the mortality level above men is dead.
The largest risk group is a man over 50 years; the indicators between men and women have only 90 years of age are increased.
The mortality level in China was 2.5 per cent for men and 1,7 per cent for women.
The exact reasons of this divorce are not known but may be in genetic and conductive factors.
Gender immunological differences, less diversity of smoking among women with male diseases (e.g., hypertension of men in youth than women) may be a cause of higher mortality among men.
In Europe 57 per cent of the infirmed men had been composed, and 72 per cent of the death of COVID-19 were men.
As at April 2020, the United States government has no gender statistics on COVID-19.
Studies showed that Virus diseases such as Ebola, HIV, glup and ORVI have different gender statistics.
The majority of health workers, in particular the medical personnel, has women, accordingly, more opportunities to take place.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of that disease, COVID-19.
The WHO Manufacturer, Mr. Tedros Adan Gabreusus, explains: “CO” means “co”, “VI” – “virus”, “D”, “disease” and 19–19 when the first time was identified: 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid referring to a specific geographical position (e.g., China), animal or groups, as required, international recommendations for the names aimed at preventing stigmatization. The virus called COVID-19 is called a severe coronavir respirator syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO public communications further use the term “COVID-19” and “COVID-19” virus.
And disease, and the virus itself is usually called “coronvirus”.
During the initial injury in Uhana, China, virus and disease, normally called “coronvirus” and “Uhanic Coronarus”.
In January 2020, in accordance with the recommendations of 2015 on the use of geographical sites in the names of diseases and viruses, WHO recommended the use of the terms “respirator disease 2019-n Cov” and “2019-nCoV” as the temporary names of virus and disease.
On 11 February 2020, official names were published, “COVID-19” and “SARS-CoV-2”.
Because of the limitations of standard savings, some digital services producers have printed medical materials, such as tanpons to take snakes, and the details of IDP devices.
In one of these cases, the Italian clinic was urgently needed in the ventilation clamp, and the supplier was not able to put it into the required time, then one of the local productions was revised and was able to print the necessary 100 clips per night.
After the first dispersion of COVID-19, the Internet has become high speed of the various theories of the reservation, desinformation and factual information on the origin of virus, its scales, prevention, treatment and other aspects.
It is likely that people can infect the virus of other animals.
The results of research did not confirm the dissemination of virus among porcs, skins and skins.
There is no approval vaccine from virus or drugs for his treatment at this time.
Today, government organizations, academic groups and sector researchers have conducted various international vaccine and drugs of COVID-19.
In March, the WHO initiated the SOLIDARITY Trial programme, which aims to assess the health effect of four existing connections that are the most effective ones today.
There is no vaccine prepared until there is, but various organizations are actively developing vaccine preparations.
As SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are in human cells using the ACE2 receptor, therefore, scientific developments are using the results of previous studies carried out by SARS-CoV.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, researchers are trying to create an integral-virion vaccine.
The use of such virus, whether an inactive or dead form, is intended to make a rapid immune response to the new COVID infection.
The second strategy to establish sub-unical vaccine is to create vaccine that increases the sensitivity of the immune system to certain virus components.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies are aimed at destroying the S-shiper-shaped white, which helps the virus to go into the ACE2 pharmaceutical pharmaceutical receptor.
The third strategy is the development of vaccine based on nuclein cycling (ADN or RN vaccine, a new vaccine method).
Experimental vaccine developed in any of these strategies should be checked on security and efficiency. 16 March 2020, in Seattle, the first clinical vaccine test of four voluntary voluntary volunteers began.
The vaccine contains an unfortunate genetic code collected from the virus that causes disease, which was identified as one of the potential problems in the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this suggestion has a constraint character.
At April 2020, more than 300 active clinical tests are conducted.
The preparations approved for malaria were evaluated during seven tests, four of these studies were hydroxylophin or chlorokine.
The re-proliferation of anti-avirus preparations is a major part of the Chinese research; at the end of April, nine studies were conducted in a number of countries.
In April 2020, a dynamic examination of vaccine and candidates for the treatment of COVID-19 was conducted with a number of other existing antibodies for the treatment of COVID-19, including rhedezir, chloroquin and hydroxylochlorokine, lopenar / ritonavir / ritonavir, and ritonavir / ritonavir.
In March 2020, the preliminary use of the rhinder has been used.
The clinical improvement was observed in patients receiving rhedezier as an exception.
The three clinical tests have already been conducted in the United States, China and Italy, and the application of chlorokine used previously for malaria has been reviewed in February 2020, and have pre-releved results.
However, there is a need for an expert assessment.
Corea and China health organizations recommend the use of clorokine.
The Whanya Virus Institute recommends that a single gram substance be acknowledged, but notes that the adjustment of this is very dangerous and may lead to the annual outcome.
On 28 March 2020, FDA has issued a permission to the extreme use of hydroxylocarbon and chlorokine for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. The 7th Chinese publications also indicated interferon, fisherin or inhiphenoirs as a means against COVID-19.
Previous data indicates that fisheries are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanid was recommended for detailed in vivo study, demonstrating SARS-CoV-2 inhibition in low concentrations. Studies showed that for SARS-CoV-2 interaction with the ACE2 receptor, the switch of the transembrancing protease white must be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 (TMPRSS2).
Studies of the use of chlorokine and hydroxylogen with axitromicina or without it have serious limitations that do not allow the medical community to use these methods without more detailed study. Osellamivir does not involve SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 is unexpected.
