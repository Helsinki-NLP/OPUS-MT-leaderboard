The big burden in a chemistry that was particularly dangerous in the northern French city of Rouen has been removed. This shared the prefectures of Normandia on Friday. The fire was broken on Thursday night. No one was blessed at the previous accident. The fire shooting was with about 200 drivers.
The fire could be ordered
Anrainers were called to not leave their houses. The building was evacuated around 500 meters, schools and child farms remained closed on Thursday.

The manufacture belongs to the US-millionary Warren Buffet company and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive of the EU, which provides strict security stocks.
In the work, about 400 people worked. Chemistry manufacture has already been careful in the past for slaughter cells - about 2013 by a sleeve the gas methanthiol was developed and the environment was widely shocked by faul eggs. In 2015, the city was shocked around 2.000 litre mineral oil in the water system.

In the hope, Katie could still stay in the hotel, Carole King went to reception. "The commander said, "He's gone about four, four and a half hours ago," remembers Carole King against "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie was immediately shocked. A slight donor was slow to the dog in panic.

Oil Tanker "Stena Impero" left the Iranian port
More than two months after his establishment by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the ports of the city Bandar Abbas on Friday. As a result of Refinitive Shipping data, the tank moved and left the Iranian port. The target port was given by Port Rashid in the United Arab Emirates.
In fact, the tanker was already released by the Iranian government on Monday, but first he remained in Iranian waters, and from the Riederi it was called to wait for an official decision from Teheran.
The "Stena Impero" was introduced on July 19, by the Iranian Revolution Gardens in the Hormuth Sea Strategy, under the provision of violating security arrangements, but it was noted that Iran reacted to the strict, interim establishment of an Iranian oil tanker before the United Kingdom.
The street of Hormuz is one of the most important waterways in the world. It connects the Persian Golf with the Indian Ocean. A majority of the global oil exports is disappeared by the sea. The swimming in the region had been slowly slowed in the last months. The trade ship was entered into the conflict between the United States and Iran.

Musk aims at delivery records
Teslas Quartal may be ready for recording. Despite the extraction tree, there were last losses at the electronic autoconcert.
New York.Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given its electronic car concerts with the view of new record numbers. "We have the opportunity to reach our first quarter with 100,000 delivery", wrote the Musk in a email from the Branch Blog "Electric".
The question is strong, so that Tesla could benefit 110000 orders, it continued to write in Musks rounds. The challenge is to bring the cars to the customers slowly. Thus Tesla should provide as far as many resources as possible.
As a result, Teslas shared with more than six percent from the trade. So strongly the course has not been added for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had produced a good 95000 cars and thus reached its best value.
Musk needs recursing to achieve its high objectives. 2019 he wants to deliver totally 360000 to 400000 cars. This requires six-year-old numbers. Especially the most favorable Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here are less than the winning rates. Despite the boom’s losses.
Residue solved: That's why we can't kisse ourselves
A kind of brems in the big brain prevents people to kick themselves. This found researchers of Humboldt University in Berlin with the help of experiences on rats as they shared at the Sunday. In addition, progress is made on the question, why children are so strongly fighting against the kitchen only to demand more.
Finally, it has also shown why only the nearness of a kitchen hand has been dissolved before the driving laugh. This lies at a deep speed in the big brain that already solved the laugh at the expectation of the kitchen.
According to the information, previous research showed that rats react with "Lachen" in the ultra-scale area when they are kitchened by people. This "lake" is measured by the part of the big brain whose central processing of haptic authorisation is given.
Laugh is undermined during self-training
Before it has been found that the brain between self-training and conducting can be different from others - so people can't be able to kitchen themselves. The Berlin researchers now find the experts to the rats that the laugh as well as the activity of the area of the big cerebral during self-training, it is also likely if the lives themselves are swept. During the care and the kitchen by the scientists were to rise the activity in the skin and impuls.
But pass the self-training and conducting by others at the same time, it also stressed the laugh. This indicated that the brain of therats could not be between the self-training and other conduct. The new knowledge closely led to people not to kit themselves because self-training activates a brake in the big brain.
The rats were also trained to kiss themselves. In order to make this initiative in the experiment at times, they showed the behaviour or shock stars. This ambivalence equals the behaviour of children. The environmentality of the Kitzeln is a behavioral reaction that is equal to rats and people.
Catastrophe used: Big Brand removed in French chemistry
The big burden in a chemical work that was particularly dangerous in the Northern French city of Rouen has been removed. This shared the prefectures of the Normandia of the news agent AFP on Friday. The fire was broken on Thursday night.
According to the authorities, there should be no health-risk substances. The samples taken don't give any reason for an inquiry, as prefect Peter-André Durand said on Friday morning at a press conference. No one was blessed in the event. The fire shooting was with about 200 drivers in use.
Schools and children were closed
The inhabitants were called to leave their homes. The buildings were evacuated around 500 meters, schools and children were closed on Thursday.

Munmal on the suggestions of Oslo and Uûya is enthusiasmed
More than eight years after the appeals in Oslo and Uucciya with 77 dead is enthusiasmed on Saturday in Norwegia. The monument "Jernrosene" (South: the iron rose) consists of about 1.000 eiser Rose narrative training. They recall the Roses that thousands of people were covered in the days and weeks after the appeals before the Dom in Oslo.
At the same time, the project of the artist Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is now being enthusiasmed - the Roses were embraced by people from all the world, including survivors and families of the victims. For opening, the Kronprinz Haakon and the Kronprincessin Mette-Marit are expected to be opened.

Iran has a British tanker free
The United Nations general debate did not have a solution in the Iran conflict, but now there is a less problem, but the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" was able to shoot again in the sea and could be a pozzle in the Iranian president Ruhani's peace plan.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" which has been held on the street of Hormus in Iran has been returned to international waters. After release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on the way to Dubai, as the Rideri Stena Bulk reported.
The "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas and now the crew runs for medical research to Dubai, explained Reedereichef Erik Hånell. On midday the ship left the Iranian waters. "That's finished," he said to the Swedish television SVT.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London called the establishment of the ship as illegal. "This is part of a template of attempts to threaten the freedom of the sea. We work with our international partners to maintain the shipment and international law," said in a communication on Friday.
The Iranian Revolution gardens had set the tanker on 19 July under the prosecution of the law of the sea in the Persian Golf. Seven of the 23 employees were already released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crowd members were going to go accordingly to the circumstances, said Hænell. They would have been professionally in the last ten weeks. The retreaters now worked with their families as soon as possible.
The British government shocked a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar following the establishment of the "Stena Impero": where the beginning of July was a supertank with oil from Iran, which was intended for Syria to be set to the chain. The delivery requested the authorities against the EU sanctions against the Syrian War. The reference to the ship was received from the United States.
The Iran spoke of "Piraterie" and threatened the consequences. In the middle of August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released, and the courage was dealing with a smoke business to be freed by the "Stena Impero" as London was very old.
The street of Hormus is one of the most important marine streets of the world. It connects the Persian Golf with the Indian Ocean. A majority of the world's oil exports is disappeared by the sea. The swimming in the region had fallen in the past months. Trade ship was entered into the conflict between the United States and Iran.
Among the shocks between Teheran and Washington, the Atom Stretch of both countries. The Americans will want to build nuclear weapons, and the Iranians returned. The United States in 2018, in all parts of the International Atom Agreement which prevent the Iran in the construction of a atomic bomb, and in comparison with their political and economic isolation. The US government has to develop the lead in Teheran with massive economic organizations against the country to enhance a strict and expanded agreement on other areas.
In view of the fight on the "Stena Impero" and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Golf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the United States works for a coalition for military protection of trade vessels in the region.
The Iranian President Hassan Ruhani presented a UN Voluntary Meeting on the Hormus Street Plan for Security and Peace in New York.
Indeed, with its Protectionist Economic Policy, a better future will be made.
In view of the criminal rights associated with the American President Donald Trump against Chinese producers, foreign producers in the People's Republic, it is intended to redistribute. Financial chiefs of Asian enterprises who intend to grant their production from China in a other country, call India in an inquiry of UBS as one of the preferentious alternatives. This has not only to do with the uncertainty of Chinese-American trade wars.
But now India has been divided into Trumps focus. From the wheelhouse as a "the King of the Zools" referred to as "the Kingdom of the Zools", the United States took the trade benefits for 2000 products. The U.S. is prohibitively banned by India and demands better market access to farmers, mobile telephones, smilings, motor leaders and others.
On the world map of trade wars, the riberies with India are freely a side view. The United States also considers the world's largest democracy through the security policy. Delhi and Washington are connecting the concern of Chinese power in the Southern Ocean. Before this background, an uncertainly save American punishment against India.
The problem is in another place: the imperially encouraging those that open markets accelerated the economic development has been a serious position in the Socialist Republic of India, also under the Modi. His reformers aimed mainly on the bureaucratic Irish, which has so long renewed all enterprises' spirit in the multinational state. Firms now receive rapid construction grants for buildings. They benefit from an improved energy and transport infrastructure, and the conditions that are encouraging insolvencies and concursion law to ensure that the companys of high schools are able to liquidate.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rakings, and in India's first five-mode-years, there is much better in order to improve, but it does not apply to trade policy, but to protect little international competitive enterprises against foreign providers, the national conservative government has created even new pains.
In the West, the model of the Nimbus of the energy reformers renewed its country economically radially. However, this impression is not debt to the state that the Carismmatic Prime Minister is only to know what vocabulary of the Western Managers like. In the Kern, the "India First" Advocat was never declined by a Protectionist Economic Policy, which prevents that Indian companys would be able to resolve an accromistical exhibition and so that they would be dealing with the global competition.
Adoption of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
The former French president Jacques Chirac will be introduced in Paris in the next week.

The location will be held in a close family circle. To Sunday was a public trauma in Paris Invalidandom, as reported media.
The competitors are aimed at: Dabo is the first home herd of the lightathletic WM
The world's skin was a long time at the end of the exciting Khalifa International Stadium. In the first time of men over 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby was shocking dangerously from Aruba. He was able to take 300 meters away from the target, slowly swift in an unfavorable position as a Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau and supported him the last half stadion rounds in the goal. The forces were in both, yet, to stop the goal of the weapons. As the snipers were not enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same", said Dabo after the rain in Mixed Zone, when he had completely unexpectedly expected the attention of the collected journalists. The shooter would only want to speak about his heritage. Finally he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he noticed that this would be difficult, he would only help a suffering partner. And unless he would only be proud to represent his country that was invited to the WM from the world's group. In normal circumstances he couldn't start.
He did that at the night with a lot more intensive than he was thinking about it. Because this herdentat will be remembered. At the time, Dabo left his competitive busby even on his goal and was voluntary over the last place - the other five minutes after the Ethioopian Selemon Barega, who wins this pass. On the end, it was nothing to do, because only with much helped busby was disqualified by the end of the World Lightline Association.
Dabo, who lived in Portugal and studied there in Lisbon, took place to set up a personal best time at the WM in Doha. It was often official data with 18:10.87 minutes, but he himself was deceived: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. In 18 minutes I was a little." However, in the training, it wasn't the best time.
millions of machines: Egyptians are covered for wild Protest Day
In Egypt, the security measures have been strengthened in advance of possible regulatory critical protests. In the centre of Kairo, an increased police presentation was observed on Friday. several U-Bahn stations remained closed to the central Tahrir plate.
Last days, the police had strengthened their road controls, and the phones of footholders were in part searching on news and photos related to the protests. Hundreds were arrested by two non-governmental organizations.
Opposite of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, it came to Protests in Kairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura, with hundreds of participants. They opposed the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critical corruption and misconduct. One such open protest against political leadership had not given it in Egypt for many years. In the Spanish exile, the Egyptian buildings and players of Mohammed Ali, who had the demonstrations with video-boats on Facebook, had not been given to a "millionary mars" central places in the Spanish country. Alit calls for a revolution "Volux".
The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) continued to comply with the number of prisons relating to the Protests, and the Egyptian Centre for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the Human Rights Watch of Human Rights (HRW) said of more than 2.000 prisons. Independently, these figures were not first confirmed. The Government also confirmed and not commented the numbers.
Volunteers
Many people were "weakly arrested" only because they were "fake in time on the wrong place" shared with HRW in vocational lawyers. The lawyers against the prisoners were able to have the information of their lawyers of "distribution of false information" to membership in a "terroristic association". In Kairo, Alexandria and other cities, they asked for security forces in Uniform, but also in civil clothing, according to HRW instructions.
HRW also criticized the centre in the North African country. The government blocks Kairo websites and online services to connect further protests against Sisi.
Online employees: Senders should be able to send back
For online shoppingers, many lost packages are lost. About 20 million return countries so on the moon. But there is a alternative.
The Financial Ministry has shown online hosts such as Amazon and Zalando a way how they can sell returned products instead of destroying them.
Although the companies could not be freed from the transfer tax to Sachspends, the Ministry explained a question of the Green Day Group which reported the newspapers of the Funke media group on the freeday. However, the handlers could apply the market value of the non-produced returns so low that they should not pay any or a few reimbursement taxes.
Scientists at the Bamberg University had identified that the federal citizens return to their sixth packages on the Internet. round four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - would then land in the mould. They would be able to pay the companies to cost more money after the current legal situation, as the financial authorities evaluate the debts as a transfer to the tax.
The Green Fraction Chef Katrin Viewing Eckardt requested the Financial Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify that companies can evaluate non-producing products in accordance with commercial products and free of charge to common organizations. The companies should not be able to be punished for costs. This was not only for the online chain, but also for other businesses from the model load to the construction market.
Banksy rate for auction: There was never a better time to sell this store
The known work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", is to be improved first.
The Banksys work underlines the "formation of the oldest parliamentary democracy of the world in the foundation expressed by animals and stages".
The work was first issued in the 2009 Museum of Bristol in South Western England, where Banksy lives. In this year, the artist had re-exhibited the event, as well as the original Brexit date on 29 March. In this case, the work called the previous "Fragestunede" was called "Devolved Parliament" ("Delegated Parliament").
The image could change the owner for a million amounts.
Lastly, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had given himself a hard slaughter with the opposition in the midday after the first meeting of the subcontinent after the departure of a Johnson's slaughter suspended by the Supreme Court. Johnson would also like to comply with the twice moved brexit on October 31, as well as without agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has been in the Brexit debate. In Dover in South England, he called a man who is a man who has a star of European fleet. The work is seeing thousands of Lkw-fabrics and other visitors at the entrance to the United Kingdom.
Brexit-debates are like a "spacing in the park"
The huge attacks of the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit's enemy in Parliament have not contributed to a climate of hate. In comparison with the election campaign before the Brexit Referendum 2016, the current contraverse is a "spacegang in the park" said Dominic Cummings on Friday at a book presentation. "We will enjoy this. We will come (of the EU) and we will win".
Johnson had attacked the Brexit opposite in Parliament in the past days and predicted them, among others, "training" to the people, and accused that he could threaten the Members because they could be a goal of murder threats, he did as "humbug".
Cummings said that the only way to make it quiet, is if the Members would finally respect the decision of the United Kingdom for a departure from the EU, and it is not surprised that people have been covered that the United Kingdom had not yet been out of the EU three years after the referencedum.
In view of the exciting smiling, even the bishops of the English Church were to retain. "We should talk to each other with respect," he said in a statement. "and we should also hear."
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan requests one entry in Kaschmir
With a emotional appeal, the President of Pakistan, Iran Khan, reiterated the United Nations to reiterate the Cashmer Konflikt.
On the other hand, if a renewed war between the Pakistan and India, most likely, Khan said on Friday at the Un-General Debat in New York. "If it is bad, you hope to be the best, but prepared to the worst." The United Nations had a responsibility for Cashmir. "If you had to prevent this."
Independently from the British colonial rule in 1947, India and Pakistan have led three wars to the shared region of Cashmir. Both nuclear forces control a part of Cashmir, another part of China. At the beginning of August the Indian Cashmir regions had decreased the autonomy status and increased the spendings in Pakistan.
Not even a flash water
The demonstrators in Cairo demand the slaughter of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
With the current protests in Egypt, the government reacts with a hard hand, and it can shoot the population with a heavy shooting shooting, shocking over 2000 prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners that were already insepared there. Protests were never dangerous in Egypt. However, since General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the State Apartment makes everything to avoid a scenario as at the time of the Arab spring.
But one of the protectives in 2011 was the bad economic situation. Poorness, perspectiveness and feeling to be justified by the own government spend millions on the road. This is a problem that also does not get the regime of el-Sisi in the face, even as it is hard towards opposers.
Today, every third in Egypt lives under the poverty limit. Since 2016 the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is 10%. Those who want to buy a float water in the Supermarket must decide whom he finances: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the Military. Lastly, it is not only responsible for the subscription, but also for the largest economic actor. The military builds streets, houses, football stadiums, produces food and many more. This was already before it. With the authorities have a lot of experience, the Dilemma is an alt market. It is always a major part of the population's weakness.
Tv tests in the terminal: BER-Chef: No "showstopper" more for the main city flight
Two months have been examined whether the complex installation in the BER-broad protection works in compliance. The operators are satisfied with the loop, but the TV is not yet completed at BER.
After large Twiv tests at the end of the future headquarters, the operators have confirmed the opening planned in October next year. This is sure, the Supervisory Board of Bretschneider said after a meeting of the Control Committee.
Airport Chief Angelbert Lütke Daldrup said about a successful test, but he also said that there are still misses in the terminal. "We have a lot of details, but we do not have a real shower." He assured the time schedule to enter into the end.
However, there is evidence that the temporary reserve should not be too large, and the construction sample should now be introduced during the first quarter of 2020 at the Bauam, at the beginning of the year, it was expected for this origin.
For hundreds of cable misses are still to be accompanied; the Tüv wants to examine it until February. "In order to create the conditions for the adoption of the aircraft, it must continue to work intensively in the processing of the missiles," said in a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said, in many cases it is lacking evidence, less about the new cable. There is no deliverance for all the cable trails in which the cable trails are covered. The airport chief expects that these are present until the end of the year.
In addition, the burning protection is not satisfied with the transfer to the train court under the terminal. The problems of the project had been conducted in a further crisis three years ago. This time is about smoking smoking shoes that were slowing at a burn as a swimming swimming swimming to expanse the smoke. They are too slowly. 36 engines should therefore be disrupted.
Problems with burning protection and other trees and planning errors have been delayed the opening of the airport for years. Originally, it should be operated in 2011. The costs of two billion euros were expected to be opened in the next year since the beginning of 2006.
Because the passenger numbers in Berlin have been significantly increased, the responsibilities planned the construction of the airport, and it should be announced at a summer meeting of the Supervisory Council on October 18, as the President of Bretschneider announced.
The airport company now searches for two new managers. Finance Chef Heike Fölster changes the end of the year to the German Bahn, Personal Chef Manfred Bobke-for Camen goes in Rent next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She has set the airport finances on firm feet.

On the analysis of 9000 people's heritage, Hamburgers and Swiss scientists want to get more detailed on the scene the causes of cardiac cycle diseases.
The research project is the largest type of this in German space, shared the University Clinic of Hamburg Eppendorf (UKE) on Friday. The Queen Foundation promotes the project with EUR 12.5 million. From Switzerland, the high-equipment clinic of Davos, which belongs to the Foundation, and participates in the University's university pital Zurich.
Overweight, smoking and unsuccessful food includes the essential risk factors for cardiac cycle diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. The match between genes and external effects is only unreasonable. Now the scientists want to compare the complete assault of 8000 healthy people with the UKE of 1000 former patients of the University of the heart and the plant centre.
Currently, more than 4000 of about 20,000 relevant human genes have been known with the DNA’s potential changes that caused DNA’s disease - called mutations - called the clinic. Each year, about 200 adds.
The aim of the five-year project is to develop new options in terms of precaution, recognition and treatment of heart rhythmus disorders, heart weaknesses and heart infections. The data could also benefit from research of other people diseases, such as Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University's heart and blood centre.
The Chairman of the Cown Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kuhne (82), also stressed the vast will to use the data to investigate other diseases. The Clinic of the Fundation in Davos has been treated until all all all the more allergians. Now, on the site, a centre for cardiovascular precision Medicine is produced for bioinformatics. For the creation of his commitments, he has been organized in Hamburg three years ago and was very thankful.
The bioprotections of healthy participants are from Hamburger, who also produced at the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 probands, the most local health study of the world is, according to the details of the clinic, which is the most local health study of the world. When the heritage encryption is strictly covered on the protection of the data anonymized, the scientists were safeguarded by a petabyte (1000 Terabytes) to data, said Holger Moch from the University's university pital Zurich.
The heritage of a person today can be decreased within 24 hours. The clean expert costs are at EUR 1300. The first gene sequenciation of the world, which was published in 2001, have also costed several hundreds of millions of euros. The study will begin on 1 October 2020, and all 9000 samples will be analyzed in the year.
Nigerian police frees hundreds of mistreated boys
In Nigeria, the police freed more than 300 young people from a coran school. After the instruction of the people, the security forces in the northern Kaduna city, and found the victims of the police speaker Jacobu Sabo, in part of the age of the city of Kaduna, were discovered. "The victims were misleaded. Some of them were offered to be slaughtered by their teachers," said Sabo.
The kids were maintained under the front of teaching in the Korean and to be "excepted". In fact, the protectives of their teachers were maintained under "the most appreciative and inhuman conditions", said Sabo. Eighth hundreds of students, including children of nine years of age, were in a small area.
The Coran School showed the details for about ten years. The authorities would have taken note of repeated irregularities in the establishment. The parents had shown themselves shocked when they were taught about the situations in the Coran School, said Sabo. They hadn't heard anything by the suffering of their children.
In the most Muslim Northern Nigerias, there are many private coran schools. They are replaced by most of the unfortunate state institutions. People in the region suffered in a common attack of armed bands. According to the information of the United Nations Refugee Help work in the past 10 months, over 40,000 people over the borders in the neighbourhood.

World flight selection: Additional forecasts by Mesis and Klopps Kür
football "not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe
With a gala in Mayland, the World Fussball Association Fifa is the best player, the best player and the best trainer of the year. For Lionel Messi it is the sixth food and then record.
After Nicaragua's captain explained that he never agreed to the World Fussballer Whale, other countries have come to the Fifa. Egypt was not assessed - with a curiose foundation.
In the past years, many of the Fifa has proved that the WM's dubble plans of their President Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of different corrupt officials. The Fif-World Fullballer's WM has not yet been suspected to defeat unprotected persons - if you see the stimulated national train and national humanity capitals of memberships often under sympathy because, according to an objective assessment, it was not possible.
However, after Nicaragua's captain has not agreed, he has now made further inconsistence: Egyptians claim that the votes of the National Train Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account.
The Fifa regrets that "the signs on the elected forms were not valid and therefore were not valid". You have contacted the Egyptian association more times to clarify the situation - without answer.
Sudans Trainer also wonderful
In the case of Egypt, the Sudan’s association has not agreed as a result of the choice. While the position is complete in the case of Egypt, the Sudan’s association states that Trainer Zdravko Lugarisic has not agreed as well as it was finally evaluated: Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three occasions, Virgil van Didio Mané, in the case of Lionel. According to Fifa, the vote was in the same way, with signs and official stamps of the Sudan Association.
In his case, Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera said: "Don't vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All information on my voice is wrong, thank you," he wrote. In his case, it was sweet that the Nicaragua football association just agreed in his name.
From the association now, the report: Successful but, of course, it was not intended. The completed chosen documents were "unfortunately" with the name and sign of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, were identified in a communication of the association. However, in fact, he chose the second captain Manuel Rosaz. "We take the responsibility for the administrative error," he said in the Communication. While Rosas and Managers Henry Duarte had agreed for the Messiah, "as it is in the official list of FIFA."
The other cases can check the Fifa in an investigation now, but it stresses that the outcome of the selection was monitored from the PriceWaterhouse Coopers advisory company. As long as Lionel Messi remains the first unrelated winner of the world Fuzzballer and Jürgen Klopp World Trainer of the year.
Ukrainian Africa: Ranghohe Republicans speak for official investigation
Two fraternal Republicans have opened themselves to an official investigation against the US President and Participant Donald Trump. "I think that the investigation is important," said the Delegated Governor of the United States Body State Vermont, Phil Scott. "If it comes from here, it is determined by the facts that are determined." He wants to know more about the Whistleblower's affairs before being taken action.
Scott said he wasn't surprised by the enthusiasms, and they showed that Trump had once again asked the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selensky in a phone to investigate the activities of the candidate and former Vice-President Joe Biden in Ukraine.
The Republicans have retreated the Trump criticism because of the Whistleblower's affairs, only few have recognized uncertainty. Scott's statements are now a first sign for the Trumps party, and Virginia's moderate Governor had already been applied to the Trump's policy, for example against the locking of environmental protection rules and the strengthening of immigration rules.
When other ranghood Republicans also said, Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, for the investigation. "It's a deep devastating situation," said Baker. "The right action and responsibility for the conference is now to investigate the matter and to go on the basis."
Scott and Baker have formally not spoken in the anti-trump procedure, which will be decided in the Congress, and their statements are especially symbolically important. However, the first Senators of the Republic of the United States have also been criticized about the situation. The state of Utah in the second Parliament chamber said that the case was "extremely devastated, deeply devastated".
The business could be invoked in the introduction of an official detention procedure against Trump, which the Democratics in the Representative House have announced an investigation, which will make him use of powerful misconduct for the purpose of a foreign impact on their own political benefits.
There is no precise schedule for the office, and the majority of democratics in the Representative House could make a so-called impact, but the decision on a real office was made in the Senate where Trumps Republicans have the majority, and the perspectives of success of such procedures are therefore less, and there was no President of the United States by an execution procedure.
Should he go to the board of Rackets "Sea Watch"?
Three men were arrested in Vienna, they should be assaulted and murdered in Libyan refugee pools.
The German Captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after she was arrested with the Sea Watch 3 ship and 53 libyan refugees on Borde has been unable to control the port of Lampedusa. After strong protests and international criticism, also by Austrian Federal President Alexander van der Bellen, her home prison was returned to a few days from a Italian judiciary.
Now there are new severe pretenders against rats. So three men who are subjected to torture in libyan refugee pools would be reached in Italy with the "Sea-Watch 3" in Italy. The suspects are taken into an accommodation camp in Mexico (Syria), after migrants had recognised their penners in Italy. "We can't exclude it, but they have no safe information on it," said "Sea Watch" speaker Ruben new constructioners of the German Press Agency.
The police called the police in Middle September that the suspects were assaulted, killed and even killed by the North African country. It was Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematicly discovered and executed by recurring and continuing physical violence," he said at that time in the communication.
NGOs and aid organizations now point out that they can't know exactly who come on to the ships. "We can't scan who are the people. They come without pass," said the new-builder. Folder is one of the main reasons why people run from Libya. It is therefore likely that the murders are also on the ships. "It is therefore very important that the ship comes."
Italian former Minister Matteo Salvini requested rackets that were still identified for an illegal immigration aid in Italy.
Musk seeks the delivery record at Tesla
The Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given its electronic auto-concerns with the perspective of new record numbers.
"We have the opportunity to reach our first quarter with 100,000 delivery", wrote Musk in a email published by the Branchen Blog "Electrec" employees.
The question is strong, so that Tesla could use 110,000 orders, it was called in Musks Roundships. The challenge is to bring the cars to the customers slowly. In order to provide Tesla to the quarterly as many resources as possible.
As a result, Teslas shared with more than six percent from the trade. So strongly the course has not been added for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered a good 95,000 cars and thus reached its best value.
Musk needs recursing to achieve its high objectives. 2019 he wants to deliver totally 360,000 to 400,000 cars. This requires six-year-old numbers. Especially the most favorable Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here are less than the winning rates. Despite the boom’s losses.
US Budget Street: Refinance only a bridge
The new budget year will be started in the United States on 1 October without a general budget. The Senate has followed the Representative House on Thursday and has decided to transit finance until 21 November.
Although the United States Congress and President Donald Trump in August have agreed to increase the expenditure limits for the financial year 2020 and 2021, the United States have decided before the new fiscal year starting on October 1 October, more than without expenditure plans. The Senate has followed the Representative House on Thursday and has still taken a transitional financing (Continuation Resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without such decisions, it would be held on Monday on Wednesday to a Shutdown, a part of the Federal Office.
Shutdown interrupted
The Federal Management is now funded at the level and, according to the priorities of the expenditure plans for the end of the financial year 2019, which is not temporaryly able to have some of the 12 expenditure laws that provide the various departments and authorities to the funds; therefore, the federal administration cannot first benefit from the extent framework for the new financial year of 1.3 Bio. to $1.4.
Democratics have completed ten of the 12 laws in the Representative House, but the expenditure laws reflect priorities of the Democratics who have no chance in the Senate dominated by the Republics, and also have ten of the eighth expenditure plans, which are less likely to be more or less prepared.
The Spirits are mainly the theme of the resource allocation for internal security and border security. In the Senate, the Republicns are trying to strive $12 billion for the wall construction, one of the great priorities of President Trump. Democratics are cut into the wall plans and their financing, which are actually for other military buildings and projects. The fight on the wall was already calied and led to a 35-day shutdown in December 2018.
The Spirits are divided on the wall construction
It is unexpected to how the parties want to approach this issue. Probably as an agreement to all twelve expenditure laws in the coming seven weeks is a prorogation of transitional financing over 21 November, and then a shutdown is not excluded.
In the context of the continuing incapacity of the Congress, some of the twelve expenditure laws are at the time, and the pertinent risk of a shutdown wins ideas on the automatization of the process to the publicity. Proposal S. 1877 for avoiding Shutdowns, the financing of the Federal Management would automatically continue at the previous year level, connecting the relevance of the parliamentarys and retaining their wages until the new annual expenditure plans are proposed.
France allows artistic freeze for lessons and Singles
In France, the artistic flexibility will also be opened by single women and lives: the Paris National Assembly agreed largely with a majority of the laws of the Government, after which all women are able to make an in vitro relief, and the demand for anonymous seeds should be significantly increased.
The presentation also needed the approval of the Senate. In the three-day period of emotional debates, critics had warned in the right place that in the future can grow many "children without father" and the French Bishop Conference is against the renewal.
The new arrangement is the main part of a bioethic sequence, which defended the Minister of Health Agnès Buzyn as "Chance" for society. It was the modern family where children with only one part of their parents or homosexual parents are given. After their opinion, the costs for artificial experiences for all women of social insurance are required.
Prohibition with sperma of all husbands
With a great majority of the national Assembly, the widow should return to an amendment for an artistic relief to the sphere of their dead husbands. In Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom, the artificial movement of "post-mort" has been allowed. In Germany, there were cases that were in the past, in which women were complained about the provision of a victim's specimen. The enemy of the presidency was argued in Paris, and so generated a child had a "small slicksal."
Many Members of the Government party La Republic en Mare (the Republic moved, LREM) by President Emmanuel Macron and the deputy of the opposition had, however, expressed themselves on the artistic movement with the sphere of the murdered partner, and they pointed out that a widow would be a "double trauer" if the death of their husbands still remained unpleasant.
The initiatives of the current amendment are injusticeful that a widow can futurely be able to condemn the specimen of an unknown person but not with their own partner.
For now, the artistic freeze in France only allows theeroexual pairs that cannot witness children. They must be married or at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that the maternality was still prohibited.
In Germany, the art flexibility of all women is theoretically open - for single or lesbian couples, however, it is often difficult.
Equipment for climate: Call after flights for Uniteds will be slower
The high schools will be fleet much, so the country wants to make an climate allocation in the future, and the rectors say they had no money for it, but now they are also under pressure.
The high schools should also be limited to flights. Photo: dpa/Julian Street Schools
The discussion before the summer pass has been held on an climate allocation to flights of universities and high schools. After the country recruitment conference skeptically reacted to a corresponding post from the green-free coalition, the plans are now supported from high schools. In a common statement, the doctors of six bath-wormberg universities and a padagogical high school for compensation of services. This is now a "needly necessary step" for a broad debate on the flexibility of the fleet, it says in its opinion.
Russia reiterates North Korean fishermen
According to the secret service FSB, the prisoners were in Russian waters to be able to fish. 10 days ago, 161 fishers from North Korea were arrested, and then there was a shock between border protectors and boats. The three Russians and a North Korean, the fishermen later slaughtered his serious violations.
The Communist North Korea leads to chronic food lack of food. The North Korean fishermen were then walking in Russian waters, where the Russian coastal waters run, according to their own information on the protection of their multi-biological resources patroulies.
30,000 T-shirt swimming pool
In the renewed controls, 30,000 pounds were discovered and invited to the boats. In addition, the details were invited after three fishermen and two motor boats and entered Suodka and Posjet at Wladiwostok.
The Russian fishermen also had not issued fellow licenses to the northern Koreans, and thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been arrested in this year.
The head of Russian fishing companies' association in the Province of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently condemned high environmental damages by the North Korean fishermen. They were fishing with close synthetic networks that were prohibited in Russia, which would also help small lives from the sea. In addition, the networks would be simply discharged in the sea where they needed 200 years to be destroyed.
Currently only 18.000: US depending on the asylum level
The "greatest nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with the selected police advisers in the White House.
The most rich country of the earth is shocked against protectors: As the foreign minister in Washington confirms, the upper limit for legal access of refugees is further declined. In the first place, it is to receive threatened believers and Iraqi asylum.
However, the US government wants to cut the lowest borders for the adoption of new refugees, but in 2020, which is in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, at least 18.000 people should be left in the country, as the United States Foreign Minister stated.
The Government of President Donald Trump has triumphated the reception preparation for protective demanders from all the world in the past years, and under the operational government of Barack Obama, there have been higher access limits.
The highlighting level of 18.000 refugees would be the lowest since the United States Refugee Programme in 1980. However, the United States minister called "the fullest and most powerful nation in the history", a formulation which is strongly reminded of the use of the official US President.
A "responsibilities-conscious process" with refugees was able to describe that refugees can return to their homelands to help them rebuilding there. For his hard courses in migration policy, he receives a lot of right by the attendants, but there is also a massive critic.
In order to finance a border, Trump had the national emergency. If there is an temporary link between the current measurement and the current internal developments in the United States Headquarters, it is unexpected. Trump is currently under press because of the Selensky's shippings and a possible threatening official restraint procedure.
The US government wants to concentrate on the inclusion of two refugees groups in the future: people who are following because of their faith - and Iraqi who have helped the United States military in the country, and have been in danger, as the Declaration of the Foreign Minister, which should be included by Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, at least 1500 refugees.
The United States wants to achieve that in particular people from this "North Trieck" Mediterranean in other countries of asylum, which have only concluded with Guatemala and now with El Salvador and Honduras migration agreements in order to develop immigration to the Southern America border in Mexico.
The Court orders the release of individuals from Zoo to Zoo
A person-Utan woman was invoked on the desires of the Argentinan justice from the former Zoo of Buenos Aires in a Headquarter for Humans in the United States. In 1986, the "Sandra" born in Rostocker Zoo was granted the rights of a "non-human person", therefore it was forced to be released. The animal was brought to Dallas, but not as a passenger, but in a fraction, as the lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez stated.
Since the 53 kilograms of serious human efficiency is not able to adapt the life in the wilderness, it will be necessary to live in the free of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 more people and 31 spicans, including "Bubbles", former household of Popster Michael Jackson. "Sandra" is still a 40-day Quarantine in Sedgwick Zoo in Wikia in the United States.
"Sandra" passed after her birth in Rostock a few years in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelenkirchen before she was entered into Buenos Aires in 1995. The 2014-bodies-training process on the "Sandras" fundamental rights has engaged in transforming the Zoo of Buenos Aires in an ecopark.
Register for Swiss Extremberg Level: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extreme hills, Dani Arnold, is a new hair rit at almost 3.000 meters higher rings in the Italian alpines.
Without the network, double land or other tools, the Swiss was 550 meters high of the big wine in a new record time.
Beat with Jeans, T-Shirt and only supported by absolute swimming freedom, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the resort. He then took the old Bestmark for almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now recorder in Free Solo Speed at four of the six most important European walls.

The Italian authorities have now held 38 randalious fans of the register Juventus Turin with stadion bans, and four of them should not be involved for a period of ten years, shared the police. For the oversights, the bans from four to seven years would apply.
The fans are connected to launching investigations against 12 leaders of Ultra fans in the area of Juventus. The 12th was proposed among other severe pressures, money weight and private violence. The club had made the findings with an indication last year.
The Ultra leaders should switch out Italian media reports behind the black traffic of tickets. They would have been "militarically controlled" for the fankurve and have had to have pressed Juventus-military workers in order to come to more later cards.
Generation Z: Is she really different from Generation Y?
Millenniums are narcistical, generation Z is political - all the years will be considered with fair names. Do you see more accurate, strike the marks full of contradictions. How do these labels therefore describe the perceived feelings of young people?
"The Kraps come!" On September 21, officially started the crowd at the Gucheng Sea in Gaochun, which also stated the opening session of 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as it was announced by the Nnjing-Gaochun District Committees.
Gaochun, who is the Southern Exploitant of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental areas. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and is also the Chinese site of the international "Slow City" movement.

Conflict between Iran and USA: Ruhani speaks from the end of the sanctions - Trump opposes
The Iranian President Hassan Ruhani, after returning from the United Nations Volunteer Assembly of an appropriate offer of the United States to resort sanctions, declared Ruhani on its official website, in contrast to conversation with the Tehran leadership, that was the end of all sanctions.
The US President Donald Trump, however, opposed the Iranian Office colleagues on Twitter: "The Irani wanted to put up the sanctions against him so that there is a meeting. I said no."
Ruhani, whose event was: the Federal Officer Angela Merkel, the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the French President Emmanuel Macron had been present in New York and had had been struggling that a meeting was held. "And America says I have on the sanctions," added Ruhani. The type of crimes that should be completed has been held at the debate. "And they have clearly said we've on all sanctions."
However, if it is not acceptable, Ruhani criticized. In view of the current criminal measures and "the dismissed atmosphere of the maximum pressure" no one can predict the start of negotiations.

Black earthquake near Istanbul - Fast 200 suites
After the western Turkey in the shortest time of two earthquakes, the fear of a catastrophy increased. 34 people were affected at the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the sunday, there were almost 200 posts, the Turkish Vice-President Fuat Oktay said on Friday. This increased the concern for a disaster.
14 schools in Istanbul have been closed by security reasons. Hundred buildings were damaged. The earthquake of the 5,8 had been shocked on Thursday, the Marmara region before Istanbul, and the Panic was dissolved in the millions of meters. Now the government wants to set a Commission to prepare a better country on earthquake.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been prepared sufficiently at the beast, said Istanbuls Citizens-Master Ekem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latter risk is always ignored. Each year, the badly built houses are shocked - among other murders made by many smaller earthquakes that are regularly shocked by Istanbul.
Cities planners such as the famous architects Mucella Yapici have been warned for many years that large open areas in the centre have been built as refugees. First at the 20th anniversary of the Golcek Beds in August, the building chamber of Istanbul warned that estimated a million buildings in Istanbul would not be safe.
The epicentrum of the beach of the Sunday was located in the maritime sea front of the Silivri district and around seven kilometers deep, as the Afad Protection Authority shared. A smaller neighbouring surrounded a few minutes later for more panics on the streets.
The Istanbulan citizensman Ekem Imamoglu had not first been reported on Twitter, lost or damage. TRT showed people swimming in panics from the houses. Schools were brought from the Silivri district for security reasons for the buildings. Some students wined as they were seeing images.
Istanbul is particularly threatened to the earth; under the maritime sea there is a part of the so-called Northanatolic disaster that marks the borders between the Eurasian and the Anatolic Earth Platt. Turkey is always shocked by earthquakes. One of the most dead was the beast in the nearest of Istanbul in 1999.
Researchers are afraid that a earthquake of 7.1 to 7.4 might threaten. But when it comes to the earthquake, it is not clear. At the earthquake on Thursday, the west of the country and Istanbul was again found.
firms develop emergency plans, private bags called Go-Bags with all the needs finished by house doors, and schools contribute to children as they have to be taken when the earth wakes. When the next big beast comes, it's not clear.
The Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan said after his return from New York, eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered slightly damage. The Estonian citizensman Exem Immoglu followed the developments of the Istanbulan Catastrophe Coordination Centre (Acom). After this information, two miners of Moscheen in the area of Avcilar and Sariyers.
Warning for posting in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users of Panik. buildings watched. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Telephone guides were interrupted. It was stronger than the service day, writes a user. The chief of the Turkish red halfmonds, Kerem Clinik, warned by Twitter, called the people to stay closed from buildings that had had had perpetrated visible damages.
The time of the beater is specified according to official information at 13.59 p.m. Only a few minutes after the first beach, CNN Turkey has given a post that has been given with a strength of 4.0 on the direction scale.
First, on Thursday, a earthquake of strength 4,6 was shocked by the Turkish maritime region, and it was to find it until Istanbul. The Epicentrum also has located in the sea west of the millions of meters, the Afad Protection Authority has already shared on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that was careful for slaughter lines on this Tuesday: Pakistan was also taken by a serious earthquake.
Scientists believe that it could come early or later to a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the sharing between the Tekton plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that they will ever be defeated - and massive damage.
The earthquake researcher Ersoy calculates that the earthquake is now a warning. If it became more likely, he said to CNN Turk. "This might be the signs of a larger earthquake," he said Ersoy to sender. "Free or later the great beast will come."
A few weeks ago, it had been an interruption - the beast also solved great concerns in Istanbul. In Albania it had also given a strong earthquake just a few days ago - it had been 68 lost.

In a video distributed on the Internet, which says the US media of 1554, it is to see how many people try to free the woman. "We work at the moment to open the door, Ma'am. We'll get you out soon, okay?", says a man. The flight company apologizes at all flights. Open was first if the woman gets a punishment.
The Coke Lake: From Kafka inspired: Ian McEwan writes Brexit-Roman
How is a writer like Ian McEwan with the whole Brexit chaos? He writes a book about - and his protagonist is unreconscious.

McEwan was sent to the words: "When the parliament is closed, the government can not be requested in a critical moment if the Minister is sweetless as the Soviet leader in high positions, if the Brexiteers are going to spend the disaster of a No-Deal, then a writer must ask what he can do. It's just a answer: write." From McEwan was just in the early year of the Roman "Makings like I" about artistic intelligence.
Cafkas was first published in 1915 by Gregor Samsa, who waits for a morning and sees "in an unexpected unexpected unfortunate injury", was excluded after the family and society. "Ian McEwan is in the front of Cafka to describe a world that is the head," said the Diogene Verga.

For a long time, Prince Harry continues to join Lady Diana. In Africa, he is now walking directly on the spots of his mother.
With a blue slipter protection weight, the British prince Harry in Angola has cut a spring mine and destroyed.
With a camp of the British Halo Trust at the Dirico place on Friday morning, he launched a quarter of the TV cameras. In safe removal, the spring body explosed in the Savanian country without damage. Although only the Halo strip has destroyed more than 100,000 decades of pushing conflicts in the African country, there are still more than 1000 mining fields that are threatening the population.
On the fifth day of his African journey, Harry wanted to walk directly in the city of Huambo on the springs of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same splengmester who first joined his mother, he wanted to turn back the way she went to the time. The pictures on which Princess Diana 1997 went through a slightly mining field were around the world. She also showed support for the Halo Trust.

Stockende Brexit negotiations: The danger of a No-Deals remains acute
In fact, Primer Boris Johnson had clearly defined: it will not guarantee a third decrease of the Brexit negotiations; but what explanation is possible to carry out at the polarising British forever. The recent judgment of the Supreme Court in Britain would be as a degree of hamoklele over the Bangladesh. His suspension of Parliament to bring its Brexit course to the date of arrival has been cancelled at the beginning of this week, and Johnson was obliged to resolve, in the case of the EU's concluding negotiations until October 31.
Boris Johnson keeps the case for it.
However, the pressure seems not to be spoiled to go to Johnson, and in this way he made it possible for the visit of a hospital Andeutings that he supported the extension of negotiations in the case of non-license until the end of October:
You know, we'll hold up the law.
At the same time, however, we are convinced that we will leave the EU at 31 October.
I'm carefully optimistically that it's crazy.
And the time of the Brexit Manufacturers in Brussels has been able to take place, and some six weeks the EU and the British Prime Ministers have had the time to prevent the end of the European Union without agreements. However, the recent discussions have no interruption. A agreement seems to be most difficult to be present until the end of October. The British Prime Minister does not have the law, it is a renewing date of arrival. The opposition is not the words of the Prime Minister, but it is not afraid that Johnson would be in the case of a No-Deal Brex.
US officials: Additional death accidents by e-Zube
The number of losses related to the use of e-smoking in the United States has been increased to 12 years. In addition, 805 losses were confirmed in this connection, the US Health Authority shared CDC. A study in the New England Journal of Medicine had already been more than 900 affected, confirmed about 500 of them. The cause for lacking damages is still unclean. In Europe, there is not a similar increase in losses. The applicants seem to be limited to the users in the United States.
The fear of new protests in Egypt increases
A million times, Mohammed Ali's videos were shared in online networks. The manufacturers and players in Spain calls for a "volks revolution". For the volks revolution today, he called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Egyptian militarys who offer critical corruption and miscarriage. Ali is expected to be massed with a million participants in central places of the country.
In any case, the security authorities have been alarmed. In the centre of Kairo, there was already a increased presence of the police. several U-Bahn stations remained closed, locked roads around the central Tahrir plate. In recent days, the police had strengthened their road controls, and the hands of footgrounds were divided on news and photos related to the protests.
On September 20, the demonstrators also gathered around the Tahrir plate.
Last weekend, the security forces had been held in Kairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura to protest with hundreds of participants. A such open protest had not been given in Egypt for years. Successfully reacted to the security forces. According to the information of the Human Rights Watch of Human Rights (HRW) have been arrested by almost 2000 people since last week. Many of them had been recently arrested - only because they were "for a false time on the wrong place", they shared HRW in vocation to lawyers.
The organization also criticized the centre in the North African country, which blocks the government in Kairo websites and online services to bind further Protests against al-Sisi. The General governments the country since 2013, after he had destroyed the Islamic president Mohammed Mursi, thousands of Islamics, government enemy, bloggers and actives have been arrested and partially condemned in the past years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs from Grönland-Expedition
The Polarforscher Arved Fuchs was returned to his Grönland expedition on Friday. He was welcomed at his arrival in Hamburg port, including the Skipper Boris Herrmann, Greta Thunberg, with the "Malicia" renard over the Atlantics.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs studied and documented the consequences of the earthwarming in the past months on his "Dagmar Aaen" ship on the Coast Islands and Greece.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the Polar researcher. He has been waiting for years to report the young generation to words.
"What happens on the sea is often found out of publicity," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform the people about the impacts of the earthwarming and the destruction of the sea. When the expedition was improved by a droid of Greece and was pesed with microplastics, it was said.
For his "fighting for a sustainable and respectful use of the world's sea", the polar researchers from Bad Bramstedt was excited in the Hamburg climate night with the "Seadevcon Maritime Award". "For all those who survive the oceans in the heart, Arved Fuchs is a great example", said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the prices. "He is a witness of the changes that have been brought to the Arkites in the last decades."
There Spaghetti in Rome: Tourist payments for Nudeln 430 euros
430 euros for two tears Spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near England in Rome: This seemed to be too much Japanese tourists. The account of 80 euro drink payment was included by the two women, but they posted the departure on Facebook, which reacted with slight reactions.
"Solche cases are harmful to the view of Rome. We call the police to ask to ask whether it is a fraud about this," a speaker of Federation requested the association of travel leaders in Rome according to the Roman Day Journal of Il Messaggero (Freeday Exhibition).
Soon the reaction of the owners of the restaurant. The Japanese were not only ordered by Spaghetti but also for fresh fish, justified the local owner. However, this is not to take out of the account. A drinking payment from up to 20 percent of the account was normal, the guest said.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is cut? President Donald Trump can be faced with the turbulent enthusiasming last days with an official detention procedure, which democracy wants to examine the research in the Representative House as soon as possible - the talk is from weeks until a decision would be taken.
At the beginning of the skandals, the telephone calls with the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj. The proposal of the Whistleblower, which has finally taken the discussion on national security and the democracy of the United States with its complaints, is monstrous: the President has misused its power to instrumentize the government of another country to influence the election 2020. He has used the dependance of Ukraine to be actived against a political enemy.
The Kern of this project is also to complete the digest of the conversation with Selensky, although it does not return to the complete word. The phonemat of 25 July is only an episode of a much greater history, in which the centre is mainly next to Trump his own lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story takes from the view of the public in May 2019 its beginning when the New York Times of Reiseplanes reports in Ukraine. He wants to meet in Kiev with the elected President Selenskys, and the lawyer knows that his purposes are very heavy. "We don't take us into a choice that we're not going to make in a finding what we have the right," says the newspaper. I can say that it's unlikely, but "daran is nothing illegal."Juliana wants to be followed in Ukraine for the investigations that there's no basis for a "while this information is very helpful for my people to be aware of being helpful for my government."
The lawyer and former New York citizensman seems to have been infected with the right conspiration fans that have been fixed on Trumps' opposition in 2016: Hillary Clinton has conspirated with actors in Ukraine, said the critics at the time to build a place for Russian employees in the United States. However, this provision was never serious.
This is about the exact findings of the Trump in July on the phone with Selensky, which says: The former Vice-President and the current candidates for the Presidency of the Democratics, Joe Biden, have been the Ukrainian Officer of Obama on the release of the former Ukrainian General Officer Wictor Schokin. However, in order to stop the investigation of the Gas company in the Council of Supervisory of its son of Hunter-Biden, the senior has financed Ukrainians to develop the corruption of his family.
Indeed, the end was something different. When Joe Biden requested that the Ukrainian general lawyer should go, the investigations against the gas company were already closed, the infringements were never directly affected. Scokin was also proposed the strongest corrupted barriers that the U.S. government was not the only Western partner who was on his displacement. In overall, the Obama government also supported the findings against the company.
Disorders at Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disorders at Instagram and Facebook. In particular, Germany, England and Spain are affected. The users report that Facebook has not always been loaded from around 15.30 hours. Instagram also shows that the error message is not able to load contents. What app seems to be affected by the distortion, even if not even at the same time.
Instagram and co. opening of disorders
It is not the first massive crash in this year. Prepared in March and July the services were deleted for several hours. As in the previous cases, users also turn back to Twitter first to make their bad air.
Polish scientists in Antarctica saved
Three Poland scientists were saved from the chilean air weapons from the ice of Antarctica. They were with a shooting boat on the road and several miles away from their base, as their motor was shipped. They had lucky in unfortunately - less than one hour needed the chilean saving shooter for the discussion.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4 Chile air responsibilities:
"As 9:30 we received the message for a short time before we started, and a good 20 minutes later, we were over the shooting boat."
In Poland since 1977, Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station, 19 scientists worked there. The frozen researchers were safely returned to their research station.
Attention: Download Smartphone NIE cableless
Practical, but harmful
Indutive technology through Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
As far as several new smartphones have been on the market, supporting cableless downloads and sell themselves very well - all before the new iPhone-11 models, we would like to call a study of early July in memory. The free load of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not appropriate.
Higher temperature to battery
Scientists are warned before the unclean load of Smartphones. This is the expertise of the University of Warwick for the devices. This is why it is the significantly higher heat development. A phone normally by cable, the battery is up to three hours on 27 degrees. In cableless downloads, the researchers themselves have been loaded at the perfect direction of the smartphone on the ladepad always measured over 30 degrees. Leave the phone somewhere beyond the sleeves, increases the temperature. In addition, the switch of the laptop is also higher.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature is a crucial factor for the slowness of batteries. As each degree plays a role. When loading higher temperatures, the battery is not only the capacity, but it is not just so long, so the life period is lower. The researchers reason to load the smartphone always by cable. As a battery is constantly connected to modern smartphones, it would have to be more helpful. The apple has the costs for a battery even even increased by cable.
Practical
The technology is extremely pleasant: In fact, the device is loaded on a suitable loadpad - they are already in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the bathroom will be loaded without a quiet cable salt and a powerful steel flight. As it is used to Qi (inductional energy transfer) a global standard, where even apple is very short, there is little limitations. However, the machine should be used only by the researchers in derogation.
Everest-Stau photo: 13 8 thousand in six months
A nepalese mountain increase has reached only six months within 13 of the 14 higher mountains of the world. Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the pitches of the Manaslu in Nepal and ordered a record, shared its expedition event.
The former soldier wants to reach all 14,000 months in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He once made international slaughter lines: from him is a photo of mountain-sized hills that are on the Mount Everest Slange.
The image of the Massenand Rand solved a debate on strengthening security measures on the 8848 meters higher mountains and the highest crowd of the earth. In May, 11 clusters died within the last few days.
A problem for Purja may be the relief of the 14th-eighth thousands: China's authorities now learn the Xxabangma beg in Tibet. As a reason for this, it is called in other bad weathers. Purja wrote on Twitter that the Nepal's government wants to talk to China to him.
Four all elephants on Sri Lanka found
Among the dead animals are also a tragic elephant cup, a police speaker shared on Friday. "We believed that the elephants were revivaled."
The four castles were found in a protective area near the famous and many tourists from Sigiria. The animals were likely to be the police speaker between 15 and 25 years of age. It was ordered for an autopsie to determine the cause of death.
At Sri Lanka, about 200 elephants are killed each year. The killers are often farmers in which the animals have previously remained unfavourable. Similarly, about 50 people are killed by elefants. This is often happening when the animals are going to be built by the villages near their living space.
In Sri Lanka, estimates live only about 7.000 elephants. The death penalty is theoretically the death penalty.
Conserved British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British Oil Tanker "Stena Impero" left more than two months after his arrest by Iran the port city Bandar Abbas. This gave the seaquarter of Bandar Abbas known according to the news agent IRNA. The Iranian Revolution Gardens had established the tanker under the British flag on 19 July under the provision to have seen the rule of the sea law in the Persian Golf.
Thomas Cook Management in the Critics
The competent Economic Committee of the Subcommittee wants to investigate the role of the traveling Thomas Cook, which is to go as well as to the question why the British government did not want to contribute financially to the surviving enterprises. "We are interested in supervision in the company as well as in the control of external books", said the President Rachel Reeves in London. "Openly we have to do it with a very example of management managers."
According to experts, genes are exceededed at dark brain risk
The role of the gene in the family increased dark cancer risk is obviously overlooked. In this conclusion, researchers of the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) Heidelberg in a current study. Other risk factors such as family food habits are likely to be more likely to be taken than ever. This has resulted in calculation of the individual carcinour risk, highlighting the DKFZ knowledge.
Elon Musk allows to increase Tesla actions
This wrote Musk in a email to Tesla employees published on Thursday (Original time) by the Branchen Blog "Electretic. The question is strong, so that Tesla could visit 110'000 orders, it continued to write in Musks round.
The challenge is to bring the cars rapidly to the clientship. Tesla should provide as far as many resources as possible.
Income: Teslas shares went with more than six percent from the trade. So strongly the course has not been added for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had produced a good 95'000 cars and thus reached its best value.
Musk needs record to achieve its high objectives. 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400'000 cars. This requires six-year-old numbers. Especially the most favorable Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here are less than the profit rates. Despite the boom's losses.
Will British Government start Brexit-Getz? Johnson Return
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson considers whether he is looking for an circle of the last legislation decided by Parliament against an unregulated Brexit; on a question that he said only on Friday before journalists, his Government will hold its right.
The law proposes that the government should ask for a movement of the end of exit should not be achieved by the EU until October, and Johnson criticizes this as a "capitalization law", which decreases the negotiations with the EU.
The former British Prime Minister, John Mayor, had expressed the conviction on Thursday, Johnson could try to "political skane" to implement the law. Johnson can set a procedure strike that changes the entry into the EU's access to.
Johnson said he tries to adopt a treaty with the European Union. "We are likely to leave the EU on October 31, and the best way is the one with an agreement."
Iran flys obvious uranium adventure up
Iran's President Hassanō has increased the pressure on the saving of the historical Atomic Agreement on the European Contracting Partners. "The leadership shows the European States inability or lack of availability when it goes on concrete action," said the Thursday, in a press conference at the New York United Nations Assembly on Thursday. In the case that they did not make their promises, he put "widespread steps" away from the agreements of the possible negotiated agreement of 2015.
The conflict on the international agreement on the prevention of an Iranian atomic bomb, which was opposed to normalize Teheran's economic relations. The United States, in 2018, decided to deal with the Agreement with the "maximal pressure" to a course change in the narcotic policy that was an aggressively adverse. The Government of President Donald Trump wants to deal with a new agreement with urgence-related plans and to re-estate sanctions against Teheran.
The International Atomenergy Authority (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now used or prepared the use of Uran at the beginning of September, and, at least, it has prepared the construction of more than 300 other centres.
Maybe the Europeans were not ready to take their part in the deal and, therefore, the Iranians left with the costs and the last pressing United States sanctions alone, but it will give further discussions, which hopedly have a solution.
Estimate Iran's development in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after attacking a significant oil plant in Saudi Arabia in September, the municipality has changed: Germany, France and the United States estimated that Teheran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Huthi revolts supported in Jemen were known to the attack, which was evaluated by the United States as a false recognition. "We have nothing to do with this," acknowledged  Rowland in the midday afternoon.
"They who are in charge must be proof of this," said Gregor. However, it would have not agreed with him during the UN General debate. Instead, they would only say that the rebellies in Jemen couldn't be attacked like this. Rowland had met the federal Kansler Angela Merkel, President Emmanuel Macron and the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in the last days.
For possible discussions with President of the United States Trump, the wide sanctions of the United States administration should first be dealt with, he requested the government in Washington to convert to a policy of "dialog and conciliation".
Commits of other stars crossing the sun system
Astronomists now observe a commit from the deep of the world. This has been once before. The commit allows resignation to other sun systems.
What was just a confusion, it is now confirmed: A intersystemal guest crossed by our sun system. The commit from the depth of the world has been baptized after his discovery on 2I/Borisov and has shocked the interest of astronomes throughout the world.
The largest commit was found on the Crime on August 30, by the amateur astronomen Gennadi Borissow at the Margo Observatory, with a self-building telescope of 65 centimeters of diameter. After observing various observers, they confirmed not only that it was an unknown committee, but also showed that it was not out of our sun system.
2I/Borisov has been viewed after 1I/'Omuamua of 2017 only the second interstar object that has been viewed at a flow of our sun systems.
2I/Borisov offers the rare opportunity to get attractive views from the nearly an extra sun system before he disappeared on a nickel. The first observation shows that the interstellary committee of which our systems are different, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of Canars. "The current speed of the committee is about 150,000 km per hour, which is significantly above the typical speeds of objects that are around the sun", reported about David Farnocchia of the US Radio Aviation Authority in a communication.
The commit is also responsible for the appointment and categoryization of sky bodies. To honor of his discovery, the inter-screen swifsters, which first had been conducted under the catalogue number C/2019 Q4, which indicates the first part of the name 2I/Borisov, which indicates that it is to be the second inter-actoral object that is discovered in our so-system.
The astronomes have been happy: On the contrary to 1I/'Omuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been viewed in the flight. Thus the researchers remain a few months for research. "The object will reach the largest light in the midst of December and then be seeing with a medium-scale telescopes," explained Farnocchia. "To October 2020, it will only be observed with larger and professional telescopes".
several observers have already taken the visitors. Thus a team of Karen Meech from Hawaii University, who had already led to the characterization of 1I/'Omuamua, shows a significant swimming of the committee at 2 to 16 km.
Scientists and researchers of the Astrophysical Institute of Canarys (IAC) have already gained a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar Sweefster, which offers a kind of finger impression of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is different from the committees of our sun systems, and it knows that the composition must be similar," reported the IAC researcher of León. This observation is closely high that compositions in other solar systems could be formed by similar processes as in our, complete León's College Javier Licandro.
The discovery of two inter-screen visitors within only two years shows that these objects can open a new way to investigate certain solar processes in other sun systems; however, how often such styps are, it is still difficult to deal with. One of the next intersystem visitors may be a planned satellite mission of the European Railway Agency Esa.
The Agency wants to station on a waiting position of 1,5 million km from the earth the three-party space "Comet Interceptor" (e.g. comet starters). It is according to the director of Esa knowledge, Sunther Hasinger, or on an unrelated, fresh coma from our own solar system, or on an intersystem visitors like 1I/'Oumumua.
First load on Pekings new Mega-Airport Daxing
Recently before the 70th birthday of the People's Republic, it is so large: At the new Mega airport in the south of the chinese capital is a first passenger machine of the United Airlines, a special honor for Captains and Crew.
Up to 2022, about 45 million flights are to be completed annually, 2025 should be 72 million. Chinese President Xi Jinping announced the opening of 450 billion projects. The recent Chinese press project is also called "Seestern" because of its sixth building structure.
The complex has four start- and landway trains that will be expanded later to seven and are equipped with the world’s largest automatic transport system. A new U-Bahn transports passengers in only 20 minutes in the town of Peking.
Soon during the building, the Chineses had been able to learn from Berlin from Peking several times. The opening of the building in 2006 - and significantly smaller - the main airport in Germany has been moved to the same time. Nevertheless, in Peking, the first passenger machine was a first passenger machine for four years.
New surrounding aircraft is to fly 2030: In four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in only four hours - the British Railway Agency UK Space Agency is dreaming. It may be to do this for the over-time flights (Synnergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which developed the company's Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, quoted the US Sender CNN. "This is the technology that can be edited finally", said Agence Graham Turnock. "We are talking about the 2030s for the invasion, and the work is already continuing."
In order to advance the project, the British Railway Agency wants to cooperate closely with the Australian aircraft. A flight from the main city of New York to the Australian Metropole is now at about 20 hours. As the only overall aircraft for passenger transport, the Concords of 1976 to the establishment of its operation in 2003, the New York City was discovered and used for three to three hours to half an hour. In 2000, the United States’s Railway Aeroports also arrived at the start of an accident on the Paris Airport Charles de Gaulle, which had been in all 109 instances. In the past year, the US-American Locket Locked Plecked, known with the US-Radiovital Authority, has also entered into the programme.
"Sabre will make the world more smaller with its high speed-up-to-Punkt transport", writes Reaction Engines, among others on its home page. The sare driving could be used for efficient travels with a speed of Mach 5 - which means five times as fast as the shore. Additionally, such aircrafts are also accessible outside the stores and allow the "first generation of re-useable rail drivers".
Accommodation in Washington: Trump wants to explore anonymous tips in Ukraine
In Ukraine's appeal for the possible use of the President of the United States, Donald Trump wants to observe possible skilled places in the white house.
"I want to know who had given the Whistleblower the information", said Trump on Thursday before the United States Embassy workers at the United Nations in New York. The person concerned is nearly a "a spon" and has been struck in the past "a little different" than today.
The event was not public, but more US media distributed audio media on Friday by the conversation. Democratics responded to the statement of the President.
The Democratics in the United States Representative House had announced preparations for an official detention procedure against Trump, and their claims were mainly based on the written applications of an anonymous secret worker, the serious accused against Trump and its government centre.
In its work, the Whistleblower wants to receive information from several government employees, as the President of the United States "uses the power of its offices", to achieve that another country is infringed to its profits in the United States 2020.
In the centre of the predecessor, a strict telephone between Trump and the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj is encouraging his official colleagues to investigate his political rivals Joe Biden. It is about former businesses of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and the efforts to protect his speech before the Ukrainian justice. People are in the reence to present the Presidency Office for the election of 2020.
The Whistleblower accused the White House with regard to the Ukrainian Telephone also to the debate: Leaders of government workers would try to keep the exact expression of the conversation under the box. As normally, a electronic word word protocol was prepared. This was only published after the discussion on the instruction of lawyers from the White House, but from a common data database, which was provided in a specially protected system.
The identity of the instructor is not publicly known. The New York Times reported that it is an employee of the foreign secret service of the CIA.
Trump reiterates the credibility of the source in question on Friday. In a series of Tweets to the theme, the President wrote, among others, that "ashing named Whistleblower" has distributed information from the second hand that had been unacceptable.
As Trump expressed in New York about those who had to play information to the Whistleblower, but resolved, and the Chairman of the United States Representative House, Nancy Pelosi, reacted to anxiety and accused of the Trump's statement, raised the integrity of the government once again.
In the Representative House for months, the various commissions have been conducted in various research against Trump and its environment. In view of the Ukrainian proposals, the Democratics are now being investigated with a new sense in order to place a possible administrative detection procedure against Trump.
"The Whistleblower gave us a driving plan for our investigation," said the head of the Secret Service Committee in the Representative House, Adam ship. Trump shocked ships, a false show of things before him and reiterates the return of the Chairman. Trump was shocked regularly and requested for the return of the committee for months ago.
More than 300 former US government employees from the security and external policy areas, mostly under democratic, but also under the Republicn presidents, have been held in a statement published on the voluntary day under the possible investigation of the democratics for an administrative detection procedure. If the preserving of the preserves, it would be called by Trump, it would be.
There is no precise time for the other processers; with the majority of the representative households, democratics could emphasize a so-called execution procedure, but the decision on a real office was made in the Senate where Trumps' Republicans have the majority, and the perspectives of success of such procedures are therefore less.
VW: Employees will be decreased
The VW Market plans, in which the production continues, could go to the latter of the production in Germany and Europe, and this concerns will be made to the bus Council of Bus manufacturers, which will depend on its annual manufacturing costs of ten billion euros to 2023 to two billion euros. This is why 500 million euros will be allocated in this year.
A key is the staff costs: 2016 between enterprises and the Employment Council negotiated "success package" has already seen the decrease of 14.000 jobs in Germany only until 2020. It is mainly applicable: a job place can only be decreased at the car manufacturer when almost proved that related activities are no longer needed.
However, as our newspaper is now produced from operational crystals, jobs in the production, which are not actually "speaking" on a different way - so on the official course.
In these cases, the Operation Council has no possibility to prevent the redistribution. In the meantime, there are many staff's cases to take the job dependance, the concerns for an entire exemption of the vehicles would be greater. In order to ensure that the vehicle production could be delayed by Germany and Europe because they are more favorable in other parts of the world.
Marke VW wants to standardize the world's production and to control new projects centrally. It also aims to reduce costs and to accelerate decisions, including the goal to increase productivity and to ensure competitiveness. And Andreas Tostmann's production plan said to be a managerial conference in Berlin: "Gradued in unsafe times from Brexit to the threatening trade war between the United States and China, we are well advised to make us a crisis."
To this way it has already been successful: so, for example, in this year, for example, the production costs for vehicles for the first year since 2013 compared to the previous year. Tostmann said that the production time for the Golf 8, which is to be presented on October 24, which will be reduced to 1.1 hours. Exact numbers for the production period call VW not, according to the information of our newspapers, it is located at the Golf 7 around.
20 hours.
Our region is the only VW Fabric of Wolfsburg, which is produced in the vehicles. The works of brain swimming and salt guitters are produced. For the VW internally, the faust rules are required to build there an annual 800,000 cars in order to be satisfied with the work. 2018, the extradition in Wolfburg was only in about 700,000 vehicles - provided by the slightest essential demand and the problems in the revision of the new consumption and gas test process WLTP.
As Tostmann has announced last year, however, in Wolfburg a million cars should be rolled "perspectively" in the band, which is intended to make the strike of the golf production in the stamwork - because Zwickau is able to switch up to the location for e-auto-production.
Moreover, SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfburg. However, the sales numbers of Golf and Tiguan have recently developed. So the expectations on the Golf 8. It must now remain at all efforts to build e-mobility first the Wolfsburg autonomy.

It has investigated the existances of 454 farmmarks known in Europe. 265 are not at any other continent.

It seems very bad to the common Russians. It's being "feated" since 2017, the two levels of the IUCN scale. The largest threat is located next to a pillar of the Balkan motor. It has been widely extended by Southern Europe over the whole continent and has little natural enemies.

Sounds like clouds played a key role in recycling nutrients on the ground and are an important food source for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation of many overwhelmed and underestimated species is precarious to form the backgrad of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, Director of the European Union of IUCN. "We have to limit the effects of people on our ecosystems and make priority to protect these species."

We believe that the risks are too large," said Pad the "Handelsblatt" with regard to the construction of the new 5G mobile network.

Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson no question about Brexit tactics
The British Primer Johnson criticizes the "capitalation law" adopted by Parliament.
Parliament has returned to a law to the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos brexit, but the critics fear that Boris Johnson could still use a smooth, but this is what the Tory politicians say.
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is seeing whether he wants to implement an unregulated brexit - despite the last legislation decided by Parliament, which is to prevent it exactly, and Johnson said only before journalists, his government will hold its right to the right.
The law proposes that the government should ask for a movement of the end of exit should not be achieved by the EU until October, and Johnson criticizes this as a "capitalization law", which decreases the negotiations with the EU.
On Thursday, the former British Prime Minister, John Major, was able to try to "political skins" to implement the law. The First Minister could set a procedure strike that turns into force of the law on the time after EU agreement. Johnson said to adopt a treaty with the European Union. "We are convinced to leave the EU on October 31, and the best way is the one with an agreement."
Johnson's chief advisor dominic Cummings stated that he accepted the political discussions on the Brexit as "Spacing in the park" and demonstrated that the aimed EU access was still able to say: "We will enjoy what we will win, we will be (e.g. red., coming out of the EU) no concern," said the British newspaper "Telegraph" in accordance with a book view.
Cummings, who led the Brexit Campagne "Vote Leave" during the election campaign before the EU Referendum 2016, now functions as chief Strategy in the British government Hall Downing Street. He has to shoot behind the uncompromised policy that the Prime has led to a slightly free situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" of Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all standed before the camera of Linda McCartney, who became one of the large rock photographers. But it must not always be the great love. The photobook "The Polaroid Diaries" (Taschen) looks a deep in the entire private world of McCartney.
Paul McCartney, who was married to Lindas in 1998, was apparently proud and encouraging when he presented the "The Polaroid Diaries" band in the middle of September in Victoria and Albert Museum in London. The illustrating guests also belonged to Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders Frontfrau Chrissie Hynde.
After the Launch event, McCartney wrote at Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is an extraordinary view in life of an extraordinary family from time before instagrams, a party to the ability of LindaMcCartney as an engaging artist and the emergency magie of the polyroid film."
With Linda McCartney, who had studied the art history at the university of Aizona, until she found the photograph, the camera was always there. Thousands of polyroids have made it, some hundreds of these are first published in "The Polaroid Diaries".
There are portraits, styles, landscapes, several hasters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interestors from the early 1970s to the late 1990s. "He wanted real moments," writes the artist Ekow Eshun in his term. And of course, there is still another one in the middle point: your husband Paul - as you may have never seen him.
When he danced with his daughter Mary on the shoes, calls in the bathroom with a sweet on the head or brings unfair moonboats. Truly, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but outside the shooting light on their farm in Southern Great, or Scotland also leaded to a very normal life. So Mary McCartney said that she had been sleeping as a baby in a bed that had been buried with her father from old cartons. And it was not always in the McCartneys.
As little as a other media, the Poloraid camera starts the immediate moment. Linda McCartney's inceptions are certainly a kind of family daybook, but they are much more than clean shoes.
It's about the decided click: you must recognise if a wonderful photo happens before you. And then you've got to kick it exactly in the right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you can get two seconds later or two seconds before, it may be a completely different photo." And Linda had the gift to start exactly the right moment. "He knows that she had it," said Paul in the Eshun-Essay.
That is true the light, the composition, the image extraction and the colors that "The Polaroid Diaries" makes not only a main book for Beatles fans, but also a great athletic advantage, where landscapes have already been affected as astray. The perfect addition to the new Beatles album "Abbey Road", which has appeared over 50 years ago.
"We'll buy further oil and gas from Iran."
In spite of the twenty-first year, the twenty-first-first-food of the twenty-first-first-food of the twenty-first-first-first of the twenty-first-first-first of the twenty-first-first-first-first-first-first-shaw of the swimming-first swallows.
We will purchase our earthquake from there," said Erdogan in New York, where he had participated in the UN volunteer Assembly.
Nevertheless, Turkey had problems with imports of Iran, since some undertakings had been "for the United States drugs".
However, Turkey will "prosecute, especially in this issue and in many other questions, our relationship with Iran," said the Turkish President, who has repeatedly criticized the United States networks against Iran in the past.
Since the international Atomic Agreement with Iran has been a policy of the "maximal pressure" towards the Islamic Republic, the United States follows a nuclear programme in the secret and does not hold the agreement.
Their sanctions have caused Iran's oil export and a serious economic crisis in Iran. In the past months, the disbursements in the Golf region have significantly increased.
US government wants to limit the inclusion of refugees
The United States government wants to be drastly limited to the registration of refugees, and the United States Foreign Minister stated on Thursday that the annual overwhelming level of a new-development programme was deleted by 30,000 to 18.000 refugees, which corresponds to a total of 40 per cent.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the United States would continue to see the support of refugees, but the most important task is to protect and serve the US citizens.
The US government wants to concentrate on the adoption of two refugee groups: people who are following because of their faith - and Iraqi who have helped the United States military in the country, and are in danger, as the statement of the Foreign Minister is declared.
In the 1980 programme, refugees from UNO camps are selected in the world and newly settled in the United States. 18.000 refugees for the financial year 2020 would be the lower in the history of the programme. As the current overwhelming level of 30,000 is a deep value. As the president of US Donald Trump, Barack Obama, left the white house, the number of about 85,000 was.
Help organizations responded to the announced decline of the top limit. "This is a very tragic day for America," said the Chief of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. The United States would continue to damage their leading role in protecting the most vulnerable people of the world.
Trump tries to limit immigration to the United States - legally as illegal -. The US government expects to be limited to its own details for the coming budget year 350,000 asylums. These figures are separated from the new registration program.
Donald Trump - "Come a split near"
US President Donald Trump has remarked the Whistleblower officer of the Spionage. Whoever always wants to make him powerful malnutrition has changed the corresponding instruction "It's close to the Whistleblower" said Trump, in accordance with a registration of a private event on Thursday in New York. This reports several US media.
The Trump said to workers of the United States Mission. When he was asked after the person who informed the Whistleblower about swimming operations in the white house, he answered: "This comes near." Then Trump added: "You know what we did in old times when we were broken? Right. The Spione and Verrat, we used to do something different than we do now."
The observers estimated the possible impact on death penalties. Democratics had a serious criticism on Trump's exhibitions, and were prompted to prevent the Witnesses. It also tried to defeat a congress survey to a possible official decision-making procedure, writes the Chairman of the Committees for Foreign Affairs, Secret Services and Supervisory in the Representative House.
The Whistleblower proposes the President's complaint to have a misuse of his office in a country in the United States 2020. It is, among others, about his surrounded telephone with his Ukrainian Office Wolodymyr Selenskyj in the summer: in the conversation, the trumpet closed to him to investigation against his possible democratic democratic responsibilities Joe Biden and his son in Ukraine. Trump is able to keep a shock.
It is not clear that those who are both the Whistleblower itself and their informants. As reports the New York Times, it should be an analysis at the Whistleblower of the foreign secret of the CIA.

Location immediately set: WeWork allow real estate markets to sit
WeWork was the largest officer in New York.
Within less than years, WeWork increases from the small startup to driving force on the most costly real estate markets in the world. But now the company is in the crisis. The shippers need to fear milliarity income.
The crisis of the officer WeWork threatens the balance on the world's largest real estate markets. The company had been able to win for the next weeks and months before the reasons Adam Newmann, to move the planned bridge, and to sell girls and values, such as the private item for the leadership forces, and to win the financial space for the coming weeks and months. In addition, the British "Fincial Times", WWork has cut off the end of new advertisements with immediate effects. This is among others in New York and London's largest midst of offices.
WeWork has a long-term office area and prevents it in such small units to members. This can be individual free professionals, small startups, or all sections of large concerts. WeWork has a short-term expenditure of money with this business. Last year, the company carried out a loss of $1,6 billion, with an overwhelming of $1,8 billion. In this year, only the average costs of new large lands will always be estimated to $2,5 billion. In order to lose the new business, the firms must now be limited to the emergence and the new flash will be slowed.
According to the "Financial Times" WeWork has concluded a period of up to 15 years with the obligations of more than 40 billion dollars, not only for the company itself and its investors, but for the whole real estate markets.
Calculates by the Economist Dan Alpert from Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork in Manhatten, one of the most precious real estate markets of the world in the past 24 months, at about 300,000 square meters of office. Only WeWorks assured that the demand to offices in New York was higher than the new markets in that time. Without WeWorks Expansion, the Office Learning in the US-Metropole would be held in this period, as Alpert wrote in the "Business Insider" in London.

Russia has reaffirmed many North Korean fishermen
The Russian coastal wave again has been held against the northern Korean fishermen. In the past days, 262 more Wilders were arrested, which had been illegally fished in the waters, shared the Russian internal secret service FSB in accordance with the Interfax Agency on Friday.
First ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Before the border shooters were shot and three of them were blessed. This time it hasn't led. The Communist North Korea leads to chronic food lack of food.
The North Korean fishermen were in Russian high waters. The Russian Coastwave runs on their own details on the protection of their multi-biological resources. Renewed controls were discovered by 30,000 pounds of fishing and two motor boats and invited Suodka and Posjet at Wladiwostok. The Ria Nowosti Agency set up over 8,000 residents in 2018.
The Russian fishing authority had also issued in the case of domestic employees not to the North Koreans, but thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been arrested in 2019.
The head of Russian fishing companies' association in the Province of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently accused also high environmental damages by the Northern Korean fishers. They were fishing with close synthetic networks that were prohibited in Russia, and they would also have helped small lives from the sea. In addition, the networks would be simply discharged in the sea where they needed 200 years to be devastated.
The FSB later died after his infringements. On 17 September, Russian border protectors set up a North Korean boat first and then a second after opening the fire.
U.S. prohibition of travel against ex-President Castro
The United States have linked Raúl Castro and his children's children to travel prohibitions against the former Cuban president. The American Expenditure Minister found that it was in a communication on Thursday with Castros participating in "great human rights violations." As the Chief of the Communist Party of the Caribbean State, he presented a system that would wish to be arrested in the thousands of Cubans and gave it more than 100 political prisoners.
As President of the forces of the forces, Fidel Castro, who was deadly revolutionary leader, was also responsible for the support of the President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, to human rights violations. "The injury of human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime, is responsible for the sustainable crisis in Kuba and Venezuela," tweeted the American minister Mike Pompeo.
President Donald Trump spoke on midnight, among other members of the Venice Government and the Military. In Venezuela, a murdered force fight between the government and the opposition has been linked to a number of sanctions against Maduro's government to strive him to help the leader and self-employed Interim President Juan Guaidó to the power.
Cuba is one of the most closely associated Maduros. The socialist carbicincincincincins received from Venezuela's oil in the exchange of services sent by physicians. After assessing the United States and the Venezolan opposition, Cuba has also sent many secret officers to Venezuela to help the government to undermine governments.
New Climate Protests of Fridays for Future
One week after the greatest international climate protections, but thousands of people want to go on the road for more climate protection.
The movement of Fridays for Future renews actions and conjunctions in twenty-five countries. The beginning of the New Zealand and Australian switch was to make the Protests from Europe to North America. There was a desire to participate in a large assembly in the Canadian Montreal. The Demonstrates were also assembled before the white house in Washington.
How large the world's access to this Friday after the recording of the night will be, it is relatively unclean. Thunberg itself was good. " Last Friday has been over four million people for the climate. This Friday we do it again," she wrote on Twitter. As long as it had been given 6383 actions in 170 countries, she complemented it.
In particular, in Germany, the past Fridays for Future was very large. A good third of all world demonstrates - about 1,4 million - had been in the estimates of Fridays for Future in 575 German cities. This time, a list of movements planned at least 65 cities. In Metropolians such as Berlin, Hamburg, München and the Columbia, but also in smaller communities and cities as Jews in the Northern West or Western country, people want to go to the road.
In the age of 15 years, Thunberg was placed before the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 in order to encourage their country's policies to make a greater use of climate protection, and in a short time the Fridays for Future movement has been made, especially students and students, but also growing in a growing range of researchers and other adults.
They are in common calling for more honor for the policy to fight the earthquake and the threatening climate disaster, especially under the Paris climate Agreement, the global warming should be decreased at least 1,5 degrees compared to the pre-industrial time.
Thunberg was attended just a month ago after a two-week transatlantic tricks with a high-measury rail in New York, where she had finally participated in climate protections and gates of the United Nations. On Monday she was a emotional talk to the United Nations, where she had finally spoken to the state and government heads of the earth. In her home Stockholm, she was in the midday for its use for more climate protection of the alternative nobel price of the Law Live Hood Office.
Russia prohibits smoking on the balcony
The people in Russia do not have to smoke anymore on the balcony. This looks like a change in the burning protection. "This is also applicable to smoking", said a speaker of the Ministry of Emergency on Thursday in Moscow of the Agent Tass. The prohibition will enter into force on 1 October.
However, those who smoke have to recognise the money penalty of 3,000 rubels (42,46 euros). If the smoking should remove a fire, the punishment is higher. Under the prohibition, the Ministry falls as well as burning corners, and also the shooting skin on the balcony is not allowed.
Success to Cyber Criminal - Auditor has a server out
In the fight against crimes in the Internet, German investigators first have evacuated a large server provider for illegal business in Darknet.
In total, 13 murders are suspected to have stored in a former Nato bunker in Traben-Trabach on the Mosel numerous websites on the international actors operating their powers.
This shared the General State Authority in Koblenz. Seven Defenders were arrested at the Sunday at a large action. The Darknet is a separate part of the Internet.
The customers of the actual suspects should, among other things, be the second Darknet market sites for drugs, "Wall Street Market", which had been the investigators in the early year. The attack of 1,5 million Telecom Router fin November 2016 was controlled by the General State Authority on a server in the Cyberbunker.
A such hoster has been taken up first time in Germany, called it. A web hoster provides the infrastructure for an Internet presentation.
In accession with special units such as GSG9, it has provided research in Germany and in the nearly foreign country, which has resulted in almost five years of investigation. The investigators want to inform further details on midday.
New world climate protection of Fridays for Future
A week after the greatest international climate protections, thousands of people want to go to the streets for more climate protection.
The movement Fridays for Future renewed actions and competitions in twelve countries to end an international climate night.
In Germany, Protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including in Metropolies such as Berlin, Hamburg, München and Columbia, but also in smaller communities and cities such as jungles in Northwest-Westphalen or Western country in Sylt. Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a large accommodation in the Canadian Montreal.
Climate Protests ✔ Who are Thunbergs Intermmanners?
Justice senses and courage are, even in the 21th century, a world full of wars and smoking manufactures that warm the climate. To the surprise that a 16-year-old girl takes the powers of this time before the nase. But what's in there? Is it a helpful marketing of an climate activist? History master service or manipulative tactic for himself?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg moves the massas and brings young people to swim for a better climate world. It is historically not seen the first time in Europe that a young man created a congregation of children and youths to win for himself. In 1212, a child named Nicoleus from the Columbia has felt a cold to make himself a world more fair. Then it has also made a horrible for young people to win to get over the sea in the land, so as Greta Thunberg has shortly made a segel to the United States.
But this is about a shadow page? Why is it necessary for a action named "We don't have time" to save the world? Moreover, Greta Thunberg has a rich PR-manager on her side. Nevertheless, her mother has published a book that has sell a lot of selling, thanks to the daughter in the light. An old-selected followers of Greta Thunberg had a little disappointed about the last PR show, or. The travel with the ship was likely also a few follow-ups. This is not reasonable, because the action came in the world's media very well-related followers and was a lot of money in the action.
It is still true if some people's creatures are working together in the world's management partners with the börsenmakers? The same position is finally about a critical and reflected point of view in a democratic society, because democracy lives from different opinions and discussions. It may therefore be likely to be asked from the projects of certain trends.
Compet discover: Intersteller guest crossed by our sun system
A foreign comit crosss our sun system at the moment.
The confusions of the astronoms have confirmed themselves: a foreign comit is crossed in the moment of our sun system - he is only the second of his type.
Garching/Washington - Lange the researchers have just disappointed it, but now they have consciousness: one commit of another star crosss our sun system in the moment. He was baptized after his discovery 2I/Borisov and is just employed by world astronomes.
2I/Borisov: comet was discovered by amateur starms on the Crime
The inflicted body was discovered by a amateur star named Gennadi Borissow on the crystal. He saw a self-building telescope in heaven and other observations confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually a unknown commit that didn't stand out of our sun system. He is only the second of his type that was seen at the flight.
The great opportunity for astronomies is now to get closely into an alien sun system. It is obvious to the comits of our own systems, as reports the astrophysical Institute of Canarys. The commit is clearly intersystemal income and is currently moved on a so-called hyperbival train that leads him from our system.
Comet was already seen before the flight - and can be observed several months
But before it is so far, the astronomes can watch him immediately. As in contrast to his operational, 2I/Borisov is already seen in his fleet, which means that he can be investigated from the earth for many months. "The object will be reached by the midst of December, and then to be seen with a medium-growing telescope," says Davide Farnocchia by the US Railway Author of Nasa. "They will only be viewed by more professional telescopes until October 2020."
The new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumamaua".
First knowledge of comet 2I/Borisov makes hopes in science
According to the first recognition, the commit is estimated at 2 to 16 kilometers diameter. At the same time, the sky body seems to be similar to our compounds - as the IAC researcher Julia de León expresses it, the spectrum of the Swiss star is similar to our. This observation is closely empty that commits in other solar systems can be formed by similar processes as in our Leon's College Javier Licandro.
However, the observation is beyond individual knowledge. That two such objects have been discovered within only two years, allowing in circumstances a new way to investigate certain processes in other sun systems.
Asteroids re-employed again, and recently a rise-asteroid passed to the earth, and they were dangerously near.
"Aucunely Compressed": Rachel Johnson is a brother
For Boris Johnson it will be alone. First, his young brother leaves the castle, his sister now sweet with clear words the armed language of the first one as "shockless". It's not the brother she knows.
"Captuation", "Betruck", "Contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and continued to be shocked, at least at least at least. In the sub-hour of question at the home of this midday, it was on the massive reputation of the opposition, and there are still other critics: Dutch Bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The known journalist and authorin said to the Sender Sky News, his brother uses words such as capitalization, as if the enemy of a EU-related "speaked, diged, diged and feeded" should be used, and it was very convincing. You did not recognise her brother's version, said Rachel Johnsons, who was at the elections of the EU Parliament for the Anti-Brexit Party "Change UK".
In particular, she said that her brother Jo Cox, a EU-friendly subcommittee who had been killed by a Neonazi in 2016. They could be the best honored by the brexit, said Boris Johnson in the underhouse. "It's very uncomfortable to refer to a deputy who was killed by someone, the 'Britain first' rief,” critised now Johnson' sister. The murder was clearly coming from the straight-wide layer, which is "theart of language".
The Witwer of Cox also criticized the Prime Minister. "It makes me sick if Jos Name is used so," he tweeted. The best way to honor them is, if you are suffering and decided for what you believe - unlikely what you think. But never should "demonize the other side". He also claimed that a atmosphere was being arising in the attacks.
A few weeks ago, Boris Johnson was a young brother Jo his Office as the Secretary of State and his mandate as a Tory deputy. "I was destroyed in the past months between the loyalty to family and national interest - it is an unsolvable shock", founded Johnson.
Johnson's language was also a serious criticism in the church. As the "Times" reports, all 118 Bishops and heritage chiefs of the Church of England criticize the language that the "this country is not valuable". In a common statement they explained: "In the last days, the language is not acceptable, both in the debates and outside of the Parliament. We should speak with respect to each other."

A player and YouTube plays Egypt's ruler: First of all Mohamed Ali remains a loveer in the foreign.
The two men who have influenced the blood of Egypt's streets have returned to the two weeks in the foreign. One of the two people returned to Kairo's airport. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned to the United Nations General Assembly. The 2013 former Secretary-General, the Muslimbruder Mohammed Mursi, who was the first chosen Headquarter of the country, had a suitable time in New York: President of the United States Donald Trump had seized against the political and no silver regard to human rights in the Nile - lost human rights in a week of security in Epide.

The 45-year-old boys were known only as a minority of Egyptians. Today he is the tokened voice of the political discourses in the Cafés, the villages and the teasters of the country: with his youtube-Kanal-Mohamed secrets.
He goes to the Head of State directly and through rustic language. While the people were hungry, the President in Luxus, and let himself build a precise new palaces, it is. The army execution, which is based on the Sisi government, introduces Aliruption and Agriculturation, because he made it in his second employee as an employee for 15 years with exactly these rulers, it seems to know exactly exactly what he speaks - at least the impression of many Egyptians, as it shows the numbers of clicks to explode.
After the first week of Sisi Griff was arrested after the power of thousands of people against his rule, and almost 2000 citizens, among them, the prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, called Ali for this Friday to a "millionary" market, which would really be cared on the streets. But it came to be unified smaller protesters, for example, in Giseh in Kairo and in the place of Kina in Luxor. Videos of the social media showed Protests that the parts of Al-Size Corruption warned and forgiven their departures.
From the city of Mansura in Nildelta, where demonstrates were cut by the port of the President in parts, it was reported to the massive press of the police. Security points built in the city and on the outstanding roads. In Kairo, several U-Stations in the city were decreased because of "containing work", most of the streets around the Tahrir place, the heart of the revolution of 2011, were blocked.
Mohamed Ali made these arrangements to change his tactics: "We must not be the Tahrirplace", said Ali in Barcelona in his video camera. "Let's not put us together with police officers." However, as a backend, it should not be understood: "Ganz Egypt is the Tahrir place".
If the supplier has too much performance
Within the Internet connection, it is always much lower than the supplier, there are different test opportunities.
Those who conclude an Internet contract do not need blindly to trust the suppliers' speeds. The customers can see how much it will actually be achieved.
Finally, the previous transfer rates are a part of the contract and should therefore be achieved, explains the consumer central Bayers.
As far as the connection is always slower than the supplier, there are different possibilities of testing. So the methods of the Federal Network Management (BnetzA) are measured to the actual data transfer rates and compare the rate agreed in the Treaty.
"But the tests of the suppliers are carried out according to offering specific requirements and therefore are not unique and objectively calculated", provides the consumer central Bayers on their side.
If the connection is significantly slower than announced, customers can place a appropriate period of 14 days in order to make the promised performance. This makes the customers in writing the best.
If there is nothing to do after demands, customers can declare and, in circumstances, also demand the damage rate. However, the success of the extinct success is only helped by the slaughterway.
First François Republicans for Research
As the first random Republican, the Governor of Vermont has expressed its comments against President Donald Trump. "I think that the investigation is important, yes, and where this comes from here, it will be determined by the facts that will be determined," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the Whistleblower affairs before measures - a execution procedure can lead to the suspension of the President.
Scott said he was not surprised by enthusiasm that Trump had asked the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskys again in a phone to investigate the interventions of the candidate of democracy and former Vice-President Joe Biden in Ukraine. Because Trump observed "seven years".

Scott, a moderate Republican, has already been employed against Trump's policy, such as the locking of environmental protection rules and the strengthening of immigration rules.

May showed himself shocked and encouraging on her blog to have no idea of this action. To substantiate this, she posted the original: you, in conversation with citizens, a beauty in the hand. However, the one put it right to be from Bambus. You always have it there. One speaker of the parties said that it was just to submit the partylogo into the image, and not to shoot something.

Influencerin wants Gratis appliance: Life ban in Cathay
At first, Jaqueline Ng was certified by Cathay Pacific a update. But when she asked for check-in, she did not stop board - and she should never be able to fly with Cathay again.
Spontan receives an update for the business class - it dreams many flights. Sometimes they have luck, and the workers at the check-in offer a channel from the Economy class free.
This case, however, shows how to do it: A self-declared influencer has actively requested the Airline Cathay Pacific for a free update. Instagram Jaqueline Ng follows more than 65,000 users. On May 30th, she returned from Taiwan to New York and on June 7th.
On the flight, the employees Jacquesline rejected an upgrade, although they showed a mail where their Cathay Pacific is available to have an update. The writing wants to receive the infringement of a marketing employee of the airline. However, the airline accused Jaqueline that has been wronged.
Indeed, Jaqueline tried to get an update for the long trail flight. This time the woman should have shown the same email, but with another reference number. The employees at the JFK Airport were skeptical: they were allowed to be at the centre. And the ordered whose emails were used to have discussed the mail contact with Jaqueline. This also confirmed the mail system where the messages weren't reached.
The airline employees canceled Jaquelines ticket and sent a long-term flight prohibition with Cathay Pacific. For 1.400 US dollars (circa 1.280 euros) they had to buy a new airport to Taiwan.
The influencer of Elliot Advocacy, a company that was consuming consumer interests, was with her case, because Cathay had paid her price for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also requested the costs for the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not reach the metadata of the Mail, the case is clear: For Cathay, the influencer fraud has started, it remains for future flights. The conditions of the airline also indicate that they should not pay the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied with this, and now enable a lawyer.

The United States had not done anything to implement the decisions of the Gipfel in the past year, said the advisers of the North Korean Foreign Minister. He also criticized the United States sanctions and the common military lawyers of the United States and South Koreans, but he hoped that Trumps would be a "wise" and "motive" decision to come back to a reconciliation.
Trump said on Monday he wanted to know what was a third meeting with Kim before he was ready to clarify. The negotiations on a disbursement of the North Korean Atom and Rakete programs were born in the stock since the second meeting of Trump and Kim in February in Hanoi in June. In June both met in the immigrated zone between the two Korean States. They agreed to repay the negotiations, but without great success.

Doping: Provide more Russian manipulations
Materials from Moscow analysis are manipulated - this confirms David Howman, the only Director of the World Entertainment Agency (Wada) and today's chief integrity of the Lightthletic World Association.
In view of the lightathletic WM, new details about the Doping Scandal in Russia are expected - and they destroyed the few of the credibility of Russian sports at the beginning of the year and have only been able to get back. In January 2019, the Moscouer Doping Lab finally delivered the requested tests from 2012 to 2015 to the World Intent Agency (Wada). Now he found that they were blessed.
In December 2014, the Wada was enthusiasmed by the Russian antidoping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time, Russian sports were not freely banned by the World Sports. The International Olympic Committees read individual examination at the summer games in Rio in 2016, around 270 athletes of the country under neutral flags, at the winter games in February 2018 were 168 Russian Sports and Sports at the start. In the world scenarios, they also wanted to be in the sommer in Russian Guarantee as a part of the sports.

We should check whether the Task Force has received the right data", said David Howman in the interview of the "Frankfurter General Journal" from Friday. "We have determined numerous discovery between the data that the Wada of a whistorist blog, and those they received from the Russians."
The WM does not affect
This confirms the position of the IAAF: The Lightthletic Association remains the only organization at the Russian Bann. In Doha, 30 Russian sportors started under the neutral flag. They had to prove that they trained outside the Russian system and tested.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada manipulations had already been placed in the space and requested Russia to respond to the predominants within three weeks. Russia now threatens the renewed spectres of Russia and, in the worst case, also the exclusion of the Olympic Games 2020 in Tokyo.
