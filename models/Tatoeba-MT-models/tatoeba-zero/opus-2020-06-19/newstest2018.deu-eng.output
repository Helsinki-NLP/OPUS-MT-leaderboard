Munchen 1856: Four cards that change your view to the city
A irrelevant situation where youths are to meet today.
A call capsule where the S-Bahn tunnel is entered.
Small farmers are managing the only reason for farmers.
The oldest official map Munchens promotes slightly stories on days.
It's nervous if landscape cards are not currently.
This knows everyone who had to be shocked once, because the auto-Navi instead of a green swimming street showed a green Wiese.
The historical cards of the digital Bayern-Atlase, a offer of the geoportal Bayern of the State government, are all different than the current - but therefore it is very close.
Especially if you compare them with current online cards.
Then it will be clear how cities and communities have changed from the 19th century in the distribution of the monkey Merkur.
The digital Bayern Atlas is a fleet-pipe that you don't recognize as such.
In the large oversight cards, more detailed cards were developed for cities and communities, such as urgency cards.
These occurred according to the details of the Bayeric Communities Management between 1810 and 1864 and decreased the first Baierns measurement.
Your contractor: Napoleon.
The French Heir leader has established Bayern since spring 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wished to be overviewed about the land and gave a topographical adoption of Bayerns in order - of course for military purposes.
Even when the French troops ended out with the peace of Luneville of 9 February 1801: There were the present neighbors who created the idea of a surrounding Bayern card.
Kurforst Max IV. Joseph continued to conduct the project, founded the "Topographic Office" and thus the Bayeric Meeting Management.
The Puzzle for Munchen is from 1856 and is to find all other on the website of the Bayeric Landes Library.
The comparison of early/day is the example of the headquarters of the country as most impressive.
The city has been extended to all directions and has grown together.
For example, a sub-ending is a relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was assembled 21 years after the map, so 1877, as a municipality of Muncher.
Today, the submission is located in the middle of the city.
The households are focused on 1856 on the current Plingan Street named only 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the residence of the Bayern farmers against Austria 1705.
Where the West Park is today, nothing is seen as fields - on the first sight: A smaller card appears with twice lines and numbers: manually digited flow pieces from the so-called "Receivement", from which the basis tax was taken.
Small parcs there are no more farmers today - but small farmers of the installation "Land in Sun".
A large green surface is located north of under-ending.
The Theresienzee, since 1810 view of the October Festival, was in the 19th century still a mosquito - and no beton-south desert.
On the other side of the Islam, the historical map gives a view in the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the honourment plate, in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, the road names "a guest" or "Auf the Lefts" are read not only in large letters "Irren stand".
Yes, here on the outdoor road, one of the people had an innocenced ideas.
There was 1858/59 the Munchner surrounding statue "After the Aure Lüften".
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard of Gudden led the establishment of the Psychiater, which is put into account with the death of King Ludwigs II.
"He was continuously for his time and ended, for example, the anket of the so-called Irren.
He has also understood the staff to use violence against the injuries," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen, who has been employed for an exhibition.
For 280 patients had been first place, then 500 places were expanded.
Sometimes this capacity also did not exceed - the reason for the construction of the surrounding plant in Haar 1905.
There is one of the largest psychiatrics in Germany since 2006.
On the area of the former Auer State, youths at the Munchner Salesianum are now attended.
The site obtained the 1920 building complex and moved to a young house with training.
Westernly, the football area of the TSV Munchen East, the Eastern residences from the 1980s.
2015, the Child Haus "Casa Don Bosco" was established in architecture to the construction of the Irène Statue, which was destroyed in the Second World War of Bomben attacks.
The marine place was marked around 1856 as "Haupt Place" which was called "Cupinger Gasse".
The Second World War also made a decisive change in Munich.
The bombs of the Allied were in December 1944, many of them in the city.
A great one remained until today - at the Marien Court.
The English Institute, small business houses and a medium-year-old call capelle were at the Marienhof, where these days were the preparations and the spatentics for the second S-Bahn stage.
With the skiberegyer, the old munchen cards can compare the air image of today - and fill the loch at the marine court.
Citizen rights group published travel warning for Missouri
The National Collection for the Promotion of Colorants has made a warning for physicians that travel to Missouri because of the discriminatory policy and the racial attacks of the State.
"The NAACCP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is to enter into force until 28 August 2017, calls for African travelers, visitors and Missourians to give special attention to travels by the State and to provide an outstanding attention, since a number of fragrant, racially based incidents in the last time and will be observed in the entire State," says the group's opinion.
A recently adopted Missouri law, which makes people more difficult to win discrimination, as well as the Criminal Training Authorities of the State, which are unrelated to minorities, enable the group to make a warning of travel, said the NAACP.
"They have violations of citizens' rights, the people happen.
The President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star, will be observed because of their skin colors.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard."
It is the first warning that the organization for a State in the United States has issued.
The group quoted events such as racism against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in fragrant circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no benzine through the State and was taken in custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The Council also pointed out a recent report of the Office of the General State Avocat of Missouri, showing that black cars in the State are more common than white.
"The recommendation is that people are conscious and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"The people have to be ready to bring a cash or to let the partners know that they are traveling through the State."
Missouri registered in 2015 100 Hass crimes, following the latest numbers of the FBI Has crime reporting the State in respect of the number of such offences to the 16th country's country.
The travel warning is also a response to a new missouri site that would make it more difficult to pay an undertaking for housing or employment discrimination.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the adoption of immigration laws, the United States imposed the local criminal persecution authorities to arrest people because of immigration infringements, which would be contributed to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are generally issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently interest groups have implemented the action as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Weidesun project is elementary
The fisherman project Weidesaun is a successful project and is continued in the next year.
Peter White and Cordula Kovac, on Thursday of the CDU, have taken up a picture in place.
At the Court of Justice of the Family Schneidermann, representatives of the CD-Original Association met with Mr Thomas Sneider and the two Members.
Markus Schwendemann first provided views in his operation, in which he managed 55 hectares of Wiesen and 40 hectares of forests, providing 40 milk cot and also many young people and hide in five accommodations.
The "shorewald milk" for him is the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cot, so sweet man.
On the table of the holidays are only regional.
As it is also BLHV's Chairman of Fisherbach, he called the weightening project as "elementary".
I can't shooting a victory on such steel surfaces.
The greenland will ensure a lot of work, many of which should be edited with the motor scenes.
"We have to fight here with the conditions and the topography," said the men.
2003 he took the oldest exploitation and managed it without chemical plant protection and dinners, even if he did not lead to biobuilding.
For Master Thomas Sneider, it was clear: "The community has recognized the importance of the weeds project and is happy about the Leader's promotion."
Agricultors should be supported in costs of 3000 to 4000 euro per hectare.
It is hoped that it could be brought to the restoration of the surface for a whole time.
"The greatest shame we have is the people working in the agriculture and thinking about how they continue to work", emphasizes the citizensman.
Agricultors are often in criticism because of the promotion
In 2013, a total of 25 parts of 11 participants were collected.
The opening surface is therefore 40 hectares that should not be resorted to at least 2023.
From the total costs of 71 500 EUR, half of the Leader was promoted, one fourth was the fisherbach community.
The farmers remained 12,610 euros that they had to invest in 16.2 km Weidesaun.
"The great advantage is the long-termness of the teeth," Hundmann explained.
Cordula Kovac emphasized: "You do a good job, without farmers and girls aren't going to do it."
Also for Peter White, the best food will be produced.
The Landscape Guideline (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the public promotion of weideZuns.
The target is the opening of the blackwall.
Conditions are the maintenance of one of the LPR cultures.
Furthermore, the cut-off area should not be slow-scale (advanced over 35 per cent) and should be threatened by rescue.
For the fisherbugger project 2018, the request of eight participants is currently undertaken with 24 parcels that want to build up about 16 kilometers of shaun.
The opening surface corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.
Is nothing sacred?
Now the white house of Trump takes the state of freedom
The most secure sign of a regime changing is when they start to attack the status.
The Americans estimate these as well as any other - so the carefully instructed Storz Saddam Husseins on the Firdos place in Bagdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axt in a hot combat with Jim Acosta from CNN on the proposals of the President to drastic restriction of legal immigration with the freedom status.
To stay fair, Miller does not take the status itself.
A horse of boat owners and Liberty immiters would have come to him if he did it.
But he considered their importance, and especially the importance that she was written when the famous dimension of Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the end of the thinking, was added to his basis.
As Miller Acosta said, "I don't want to come here to a complete idea of history, but the state of freedom is ... a symbol of American freedom that lights the world.
The smell that you relate to, which was later added and not part of the original freedom state."
Miller is quite right, but as he himself formulated, it is not really about history.
It is about the temporary resonance of Lazarus, the only ones in which a State is invited not only some old immigrants, but the poor men: "Your mood, your poor, / your threatened mass, which then seeks to breathe, / the decline of your rich coasts."
There was never a time to see the "also discards" on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he clearly made that those people in Trumps were not welcomed.
This conflict because of the importance of a statute is part of a broader political and cultural counterparty: it is in fact a conflict on the importance of the United States.
Lazarus - and their friends, who used to place their words after their death on the basis - were very well known that they made a high-political action.
The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicanism, representing them in a disadvantaged classic illustration of women's freedom.
Lazarus changed this importance: In her sight, the woman's figure is no longer detracted - she received a voice.
And she himself has a very different name: the mother of the exilians.
The link to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and an enormous attack on the American nativism.
And as Lazarus changed the importance of the statues, people wanted to change this for a long time.
The great grief Rush Limbaugh, a type of John's Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued 2010 that nobody invited the Freedom Statue, but more than a preceding neoconservative that brings the American flags into the nightly world: "Lady Liberty goes forward.
It will take the section of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.
The fake should not light the way to the United States."
Nevertheless, Limbaugh is shocked here.
The importance of the statute is a question of the position of the approval.
The great fantastical act of Lazarus was to see them as they were by the shocked, shocked, but hopeless people are long and often horrible travels on the boards of ships.
It is in the real sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people, looking for refugees and an opportunity to improve their life.
Their statute speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear.
And of course, this is not the perspective to recognize the milliars and the Trump ever.
Your seckle should not light the path, but the hair that is its only source of power.
World Meeting 2017: Neil Black loats Scotch members of the team of Britain
Eilidh Doyle remembered at a time when only two shoots belonged to the team of Britain
The performance director of the UK lightthlet, Neil Black, says that the 16-powered scotic continent in the World Meeting Framework will "a massive contribution to the team".
A record number of swedish athletes was selected for London 2017, starting on Friday.
Black believes that "I'm going to develop something special in Scotland" and that the UK's light subtitles have to learn about it.
"We welcome it, and we tried to understand it, and we'll continue to lead it until we find it", said Black.
"I'm talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it's something to do with what they've done.
The Scotch Athletes think that there's something to do with what they've done.
British lightathletics: There's something to do with what they've done.
And with the guy on the road box.
Whatever the combination of the circumstances is, it's absolutely brilliant."
Many of the Scotia Athletes are Medaillen advertisers, including Laura Murir and Andrew Butchart, who will be attacked against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team captain.
"Eilidh is quite aware.
Your Captain's talk was unbelievable," says Black.
"A series of athletes, whether they were shocked or where they lived or trained, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The suffering and the real feeling that Ilydh of course introduced were great."
The Commonwealth-Silver Medaillen winner, who will occur at its fifth world masterships at the 400-m, says that it is "incredibly" that 16 shoots are in the British Mania.
Skotland’s best number of athletes at the World Meeting was seven that were reached in 1983 and 2015.
The Mediterranean flower Muir leads to this way and has established five British and two European records last year.
It will take part in the 1.500 m and the 5,000 m.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1.500 m, is another shoot that should be observed after a great season that was to be able to win at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle recalls her first world masterships as the only other shoot in Lee McConnell team.
The Head of Manaties says that they are "awesome" to the fact that many of their country offices are not only part of the team, but also to the medailles and the finals.
"The special one to be the team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was also a great honor, but to know that my team colleagues have voted for me and have chosen me, it makes it something very special for me", she added.
"Openly, I am very proud of all the shoes belonging to the team.
It's only showing how far we came.
And they're here as ethics, athletes, who want to grow on podians.
What about my speech as Captain?
Yeah, I think she's okay.
I just indicated that we are very happy in this situation, since we have a home mastership.
So it's really important to put this home support and benefit from our re-olymployment in the Olympiastadium.
I have a second opportunity to go out there and competite, and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there."
Blocking critics on Facebook: Do not use a public office if you can't handle the invasion of elections
Our country's father knew something of bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it wasn't long until the newspapers struck him for everything, from the internal policy to its political principles.
He's shocked at the criticism, sure.
But he didn't put his critics into shock.
Because in 1783 Washington said: "The freedom of speaking can be removed - and we will lead to the sheep like the sheep. "
This brings me to Maryland to Gouverneur Larry Hogan, who needs to work for more than Washington.
Hogans employees have blocked and removed the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union declared him because of the beginning of this week.
The stage of the Governor decided the clamp as free, and the online commenter was full of a reaction with "Na, and?".
"It's just Facebook," many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican Governant in an overwhelming democratic state that is surprisingly popular.
He has the second acceptance of the 50 rule of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactional Hitzhead.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his State and strict compliance with the principles.
He was also very sent to use Facebook as the primary means to connect himself with his electors and playing his handless head to chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, the blocking of persons who come on to the side of the Governor is a public forum which is officially called and paid by employees who are payed with public tax Dollars is unnecessary and finally dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans Sprecherin Amelia Chasse defended the acts of the Governor and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls, spammers or hairful people who sneak the pitch online.
The post talked with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only true people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, a entrepreneur, and a paradise, no trolley.
They all said that their comments were respectful, remarkable and not profaned.
The Pharaoh quoted the Bible in his post and called Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Bowie, Md., was not filled, but she asked for hair crimes.
"I've noted that I was angry that there was no reaction to hair crimes and other current news", she wrote in the commenting area of the newspaper "The Post".
"I don't believe this idea if a number of people take the same position to the subject, then they will be misleaded by some more than such collective use and not recognized as a large group of citizens concerned."
What the guerrants called "concentred spam attack", others would probably be called "Fürsling language".
The Facebook's age makes it easy to switch a message by simply blocking a critic or removeing a negative comment.
It is much more clean than previously, if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and broken newspapers with critical leitatics, or arrested and slaughtered.
But exactly that happens just digital.
Hogan is not the first public official who will be criticized for his injury to Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is accused of Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first mile stones in this question has fallen in Virginia last week.
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun Council injured the First Amendment, according to the US director James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she displaced a choice from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Gouverneur Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of the accessing ports had similar effects as the Internet.
The number of newspapers varied between 1776 and 1800, and the anonymous writers launched its guidance.
And even then, Washington had an anonymous trolle.
The people who used the Pseudonymes such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all letters in newspapers that declare Washington's decisions.
Petitions that criticized his position on the Amity Treaty, trade and shipping with British Britain, overcome his office, according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project’s online papers.
But he didn't put her into a shock.
Discussion, diversity of opinions and discussions are based on our nation.
And true leadership means accepting this.
Ronan Rafferty is hoping on awesome comfort in the Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will be expected in the next three days on home comfort, since the Renaissance Club in East Lothian is the 25th version of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Norther, who led to the end-round in Archerfield Links last year before he lost against Paul Eaux, is connected to the new transmission site and functions as a tourist message named the founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi.
"I saw how the Renaissance Club was built, and we see how he reached his spirit with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he is in a great condition.
Jerry made a great job when he set up this place.
He's a lonely shock of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a wonderful creator for this course."
The English Eaux is pleased to defend a mastership for the first time, although in his 32-year-old career, both in the European Tour and in the European Challenge Tour.
"It's really aware of it," said the player in Southport.
"I couldn't defend the Extremadura Open, as they were taken from the program in the year after I won it.
Back to this part of the world is magic.
It's a wonderful place to play golf.
Remembers from the last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a very special time and one that we will always appreciate."
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday in this year, returned to action on homelands.
This event will be its first shocking event since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play home," said Orr, the man from Helensburg.
"You want to do well, but you also feel this additional pressure.
I really have played it together, and I played a solid golf.
I'm glad about how long it went."
With the trio on the field, the former Master's victor Ian Woosnam and the senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and the former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six shoots on the field, the other are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entry is free, the parking costs £ 5 per car with a instant and £ 10 per car with two or more insectes.

Reverse lungs crystal by passing search
In the past two decades, people have always died less than because of passing demands of lungs cancer.
This results in a study by scientists of the University Clinic Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE).
"After our estimates, we have to return to cyclopedia accidents per year 167 on passive requests", said the student Chief Heiko Becher.
For comparison, he conducted a own study on this subject of 1994.
Thus, there have been 400 lungs bleeding accidents in Germany for a year.
The new investigation is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
The household keys are very complex
The construction works in the Villing Street are in full gate and "hire some times in time", says the leader of the buildinghof Fred Heinze.
In the field of the household keys, the situation is more complex than the smuggling, since there is a lot to hide, which is not observed in the plans.
The transport that is always back to the construction work is a great problem for the company Stumpp's construction throp.
"The ignorance of the car drivers before red packs and absorptioners is already great", reports Heinze.
The road is locked and only the line buses are entitled to the driving.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from the company Stumpp are working on the bridge for weeks.
"The warm days were very nice.
But lucky we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with quiet mineral water," says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and death in Indonesian Goldland
If Bardina Degei bought the dinner, she does not use herd.
It's just a rarely use of a bit.
In their wood house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regency in the unreasonable Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife normally places a sweet card named "nota" directly in the midst.
After half an hour, the thicked ring will be taken and switched with easier, unwashed hands.
Degei is sit on the liver tree - she has no building - where she also performs their daily work, for example clothes with dry water from the nearby sum.
A egg in a soonless room serves as a latrine.
As recently the four wifes of her husband have not been assigned to her fields.
Polygamie is normal here.
Of course, it can be late to work: most village men are unworked, and many drinking hard, and there are soldiers here.
"Nobody wants to walk after 17 hours in the village," she says.
It is a rare view of the daily life in the Highland of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was included in 1969 after an overwhelming reference in Indonesia, as only 1.026 elders should vote by a public handling before the disposal instruments.
A existing movement towards the independence against the Dutch government quickly turned against the Government of Jakarta, under control over the region and exclude foreign journalists or law observers.
In 2003, the province was officially distributed in Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua-Neuguineas, including the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is located as well. The journey includes a 90-minute flight from the province of Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-style car.
There is no public transport.
The city with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses around the wooden houses of bamboozzhounes, and of wavelengths converted by red to various grain tones.
Only very few Indonesians have made their travel here, since journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries, Mee Pago Papuans commended a God named Uga Tamee.
There have also been other changes.
"We were not intended to take this clothes," Degei says, "and shut up on their lived, handed Turban, your dark hair and her light rock.
"We had only feet on our body."
Papua is the most poorest province of Indonesia, where 28% of people live under the poverty limits and have some of the worst child mortality and alphabetization rates in Asia.
But it's also the Indonesian Goldland.
The largest and profitable goldmine of the world, Grasberg, belonging to the McMoran Freeport from Phoenix, is only 60 miles away from Paniai, a highland Province in the size of New Jersey with 153.000 inhabitants.
Only in 2015 Freeport has decreased 3.1 billion US dollar gold and copper.
Papua also has wood resources in value of estimated 78 billion US dollars.
However, these riches are a source of the fund for the Papua that ensures that the Indonesian powerful militarys keep a prestigious presence.
A 2005 survey in New York Times reported that Freeport local military and units paid almost 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004, including up to 150,000 US dollars to one official.
Papuanic demands for greater autonomie threaten these golden gains and are treated without pregnancy.
According to the information of activists, more than 500,000 Papua were killed and thousands have been raised, tortured and arrested by Indonesian military since 1969.
Massive murders in Papuas Stammesshochland in the 1970s were killed by the Asian Human Rights Commission.
Only in the region, the Indonesian police arrested over 3,900 peaceful demonstrates last year.
"We all lose" means in a report of the Erzdiese Brisbane from 2016, in the reports on the Premier Year's Graduates, such as unlawful guidances and Folders - administer and electricity are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal detection of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to contain the number of victims, as every week happens events," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researchers for Human Rights Watch.
The slaughter has strengthened, since Papua's resources bring a stroke of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3,5 million people in the province is Christianly 83%, but the demographic development changes, since muslim economic migrants come from the rich islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warning cancers sold by dog and Gado-Gado, a mixed measuring plant with ground sauce.
Local people fight to hold here.
"The migrants have started to sell hairs and vegetables on the traditional market more than the local Papua", says Abeth You, a 24-year-old paniai home who moved to work in Jayapura Provincial capital.
"It has costed the domestic Papua - the mother-mama [the women] of Papua - its market."
The Indonesian president Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, promised the inequalities and legal violations in Papua during his 2014 election camp.
The former roomman saved 27 of the total 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai, on the path to the presidential camp in Jakarta.
But in Papua there has been little changes, and today the homes have been affected.
"Our hearts are broken, because we have voted for the 2014 Jokowi, with the hope that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be rebuilt", you say.
Indeed, Paniai is only two months after Jokowis in October a deep point.
On December 7th, 2014, a group of 11 children was outside and bloody Christmas feasts before a castle fire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers were shocked on a motor route through the darkness.
The scared kids told them that they should cut their shooters.
One of the soldiers took up their voice and later came back with four soldiers, so the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had been shocked and buried the group with their arms, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired in the group of children.
A 16-year-old boy, Yulianus Jeimo, was so hard to struggle that he disappeared in the coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was placed in Brand and the things were scaled on the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered themselves on a football place before the local police station and the Military Commander Center to demand justice.
They took ceremonial jagd boats and led the Waita Tanz - walking in the circle and imitting a bird shoe - by Papuas Mee Pago stamm.
Some demonstrators began to smile stones on police and military posts.
When the smiling was defeated, the soldiers was sent a command through a internal cell: "If the mass are more than three times resistance, they shoot them", it says in an official document of TIME, which has not been released to the local media.
Jeremias Kayame, 56, the leader of the Kego Koto Veteel of Enarotali, saw the threatening danger and called for peace and requested the amount to return home.
No one was to hear in the smile.
"When I turned around me, I was soon shooted into my left hand shoot," he said on the TIME on his sweet wood house.
Kayame still don't know who shooted, but he says that the ball from the series of the gathered soldiers came here.
"It was over, many shoes were shooted," he added.
The domestic man Alfius Youw was taken three times, so his cousin, who was witness of the fires.
"I went to him and studied his body to go to security that he was it," said John, who only gives a name as many Indonesians, the TIME in deep smiling.
"I saw him died... I eated him."
The Chief of Papua Polizei, Yotje Mende, said reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" because they would be attacked.
"We must defend us when people threaten to kill us," said the speaker of the Papua Policei, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistayo, in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrates were killed and many more hurts.
The news about the murders came only on the next day "filtered" to Jakarta.
Three weeks, Jokowi in Jayapura was a suffering talk in which he expressed sympathies for the families of victims and sweared the historical failures in Papua.
"I want this case to be solved immediately, so that it will not happen in the future," he said.
Minister of Security Wiranto said in October 2016 that he set up an extraordinary mechanism for the relief of historical human rights violations.
But the experiencing began almost immediately.
"The majority of the injuries have occurred long ago.
Some were in the 1990s and beginning of the 2000s.
The point is that we have committed us to act on these crimes, but there are processes that must be carried out," he said.
Then Wiranto made a departure when he spoke with TIME on June 5 and said he had no plans to establish a complainant mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "If everything would be legally regulated," he said.
Weanto, who claimed the UNO for "criminality against humanity", which requested more than 1,000 victims of the Blue Independence in Osttimar of 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations were already undertaken in Papua, including paniai cases.
The families of the Paniai officer took such oppositions with grieve incredibly incredibly.
"I was interviewed four times in the past three years, but there was no progress." John says.
"I'm crazy."
He says he's still in fear for years.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid to be arrested by the military, I'm afraid to be shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people are afraid in Paniai to discuss the incident.
He said he was shocked by the military after he helped to shoot four of the victims.
"After I entered the bodies, the army searched for me," he said.
The shoes haven't stopped.
On Thursday, the Indonesian police took place on villages in Paniais Neighbourhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a building company that refused to take a man in the hospital, a person died and 17 other were damaged, including children.
The man, who was 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who was shocking in a neighborhood, died on the path to the hospital.
Increased villages protested before the company's location.
The police said that the village's stones were on officers that reacted by warning shoes.
But domestics say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitar police) began to shoot the amount and killed one.
"We were so in Panik, we've feared that it will be struck", says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and was witnesses as the last ones were quickly sent here, so the TIME.
"I hid me two days in my house."
The Deiyai Parliament called on to take account of the officials involved and to return the mobile bridge of the police from the area.
Paniai was always a disappointment for the Indonesian government.
The lack of sensitive development strengthens the inadequacy of the stakeholders Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green home of Papua.
Many are closed to the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebellious army who claims to defend the rights of Papua by attacking sporadic attacks and discovery of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top-OPM leaders were from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In the past few years, thousands of people were arrested in Paniai and will have been held in custody under the "safeguarding national sovereignty".
Some don't get out again.
Among the people in Papua is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens inadequacy.
The little trip sold in Enarotali is too expensive for domestics.
Brothers are also excluding the wide range.
People build everything they eat, especially notes and fruits and breads.
Agriculture is the task of women that can edit four or five fields of the sweet card.
They keep the majority of the rewards for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of note cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupies (75 cents).
During the time, economic inequalities have grown between the domestic Papua and the new immigrants who have been opening new flight routes to the Nabire airport.
The smallest jobs in the region are usually towards the best-educated and well-being migrants.
Papua has rarely the capital or the necessary ability to conduct its own companies competitively.
"Young people are not interested in staying in the village... because there is no jobs or money," says John Gobai, President of the Paniai Stadium Council.
Isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Papua.
Furthermore, restrictions of the reporting international media continue to be encouraged.
The French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longham were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although they were given the rare permission to films.
According to Phelim Kine, the Asiant Director of Human Rights Watch, the discussions of the Jokowis election campaign have not been achieved to reduce the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia the unfortunate Eastern Provinces of Papua and Westpapua: Visa refusal and a black list," he said in a statement.
The lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government remains widely limited to the immediate neighbouring Papua.
In March, six Pacific States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - requested the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "different and broadly distributed violations" in Papua, including the Paniai Scheier.
The same countries have seen the OPM historically supported.
The speaker of the Indonesian Foreign Minister Arrmanatha Nasir returned to the priests of the group and said journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia still applies to a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to make evidence of human rights cases."
People want to know that more foreign governments do this.
As a official delegation from the Netherlands, under the leadership of Kees Van Baar, Jayapura, on 4 May visited its homelands and threatened him "We want freedom", according to a source that also wanted to be attended at the meeting but anonym.
Indonesia has an additional presidential election in 2019, but the Papua said that they will probably not be voted for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man who has good ideas, but he is around the people who are involved in the Paniai Shuttle," says Gobai, Chairman of the Stadium Council.
He wants to know Jokowi that the Paniai Volk, unless it lives under the constant threat of a ruberian military, is in armed education and health services.
Gobai says that the paniai leaks, such as Papua, consider their voice for Jokowi as a "schuld" he must return.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and threats, families of Paniai Schuss offered a final symbolic act of the confusion: the body of a victim was entered in a pleasant place against the police and the military station.
They know that they may never come to justice, but at least let the responsibilities forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," said Yacobus with a sweet head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire takes the 'Turch' coal cratcher from Dubai for the second time
A fire found on Friday in one of the highest residences of the world in Dubai, with hundreds of people who lived from 337 meters to fly in 79 pounds.
It is the second burn that flows in only two years through the higher house, which is randomly called the Torch Tower (Fackel Turm).
The building was evacuated, not reported injuries, and there was no direct word on the cause of the flags.
"We've sleeped and we've been riding at the fire and the cry of the people.
We walked down the floor, and it ended about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th edition," said a people who acknowledged his name as George, Reuters.
Dubais Civil Protection Authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4 a.m. (00 a.m. GMT) removed the fire and coaled the building.
The government said she worked at the disposal of accommodations for interested persons.
The incident may re-examinate matters of safety of materials used in foreign areas of higher houses throughout the world.
An investigation through the management of the Torch building after the Brand in 2015 showed that the majority of the damages caused the closure, the external closure to decoration or isolation.
In the United Kingdom, the police said she believed that the system of plates for isolation and closing at the London Grenfel Torm in June could have contributed to the rapid expansion of a burn, where some 80 people died.
No Davis-Cup reform: Continue Best-of-5
The President of the International Tennis Association (ITF) has been held with its great Davis Coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting at Ho-Chi-Minh-stadt, the revolutionary proposal for this sport was not supported by the dual-disciplinary deal of Davids-Cup units.
Though they are often very long, but also very appreciated five-size-class clusters are also available to the traditional complaint.
63.54% of the Member States agreed to reform, therefore, the objective of the ITF Chairman David Haggerty was only unexpected.
"We respect this decision, but we are desired that our memberships have not adopted the whole reform package for the Davids Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions", said Haggerty.
You will continue to work to improve the applications.
It is not only to vote, but also to many agreements before the proposal, the final is to be taken into a neutral place.
New from 2018 are only smaller than more details: so the finalists in Davids Cup and Fed Cup will have the right of guest in the next year in the first round.
To reduce the costs for events, the requirements in matters of training, etc. will be facilitated and the players will be completed before the Davids Cup less official media terms.
More than 1 of 5 US travelers bring prohibited objects to the flight, find a survey
A flight passenger survey showed that more than 20% of objects conscious or unconscious of the control points of the US Transport Security Administration were smokeed, including at least 6% that were involved in the flight while they were forbidden measuring or other objects with Krings.
Never than 1 percent said they had been late discovered that they were irrelevantly shocked with shooting weapons, munitions or spring fuel.
The survey of more than 1.000 people, which were carried out by a Jet Charter service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also stated that young travelers misuse the rules.
The questionnaires who indicated that they have tried to fly with something prohibited by the TSA were 19.7 per cent of the Military, compared to less than 15 per cent, which were members of the Generation X.
The most common items at TSA agents were food and liquidities.
More than 3 per cent were to have carried out knowledgeable objects with Krings through security control, while 2,2 per cent of the women's claims and 3,7 per cent of the men's claims also confirmed that they had been brought to the aircraft prohibited.
The company said it had asked travelers in the whole country to find out how many amazing smoking products had been carried through the airport security and how many it had done.
It is not surprising that those who were the most commonly flying people, known or uncertainly, were those who were the most commonly.
However, the company emphasizes that the TSA directives are a little complex and confused.
People are often insecure, which liquids can take, or how much of it is.
It is therefore not surprising that the largest amount of the objects which have been prohibited by the TSA are the liquids.
For a long time, people thought that TSA could look at books as a smuggleware.
Flights are allowed on internal flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk is unlikely: Ten thousands of Tesla clients ruining order
Electron Musk offers the huge number of prescriptions for its new "Model 3" Tesla.
In this way, he stated that a part of the customers had already recovered their unboundary reservation.
In addition to the always triangle numbers of overwhelming and gigantic targets, Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has first reported another less glad number: the storms in the new market model 3.
Musk had often received in the last few months with the more than 500,000 preserves for the new car which is just starting.
Now it is Musk: from total 518.000 prescriptions have already been recovered 63.000.
Criticals had always reaffirmed that it was only for unboundary reservations.
In a storming, Tesla pays 1000 euros (US$ 1000 and UK 1000 pounds) "Reservation payment" completely.
At present 455,000 such unbound reservations were presented to the Musk in a telephone conference with analysts.
That the stornment of up to 12% of all orders could be a problem, however, the Tesla Chief does not believe.
Its argument: The challenge of the ambitious growth goals is not at the demand, but on the product page.
Last year Tesla delivered 84.000 vehicles.
2018 - all models should be collected - 500,000, 2020 a million.
The request is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are now 1800 reservations per day.
The one who orders a "model 3" today, the second half of 2018 may first receive the delivery - if Tesla makes it to run his new nagels, never in the practice without greater interruptions with maximum extraction.
Many experts doubt that it is possible.
However, if it comes to greater delays, the inconvenience of reservations to the problem of Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent inadequate customers from walking in the shadow of it.
EPA Chief Pruitt is returned to reduced emissions because of the employee of Obama Era's rules.
One day after he was declared by 15 States, Scott Pruitt, the chief of the Environmental Protection Authority, took back his previous decision to delay the implementation of the rules of Obama-Ara to reduce the emissions of smog air damage.
Preuitt presented the change when his Agency demonstrated the needs of the State environmental authorities to react faster than up to date administrations.
He did not mention the complaint raised against his previous office in a federal vocational court.
It is a deadline that depends on 1 October for states to keep the standards of 2015 for land neighbouring ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would be delaying the compliance for a year to give his authority more time to study and to avoid the plan, "if it would take place in local decisions or delay the economic growth".
Preuitt, who was before his appointment by President Donald Trump State lawyer of Oklahoma, was a long-term reliable enemy of strict environmental protection rules.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeated to block or delay regulations which reverse the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry.
The sudden round of midnight is the recent legal retreat for the Pruitt's regulatory Rollback Agency.
Last month, a federal training court in Washington decided that the EPA manager had exceededed its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rules of Obama Administration, the Oil and Gas companies to monitor and reduce Methanlecks' control and reduction.
In an opinion published at Middle Wednesday, Pruitt suggested that its compliance with Ozon standards simply enhance the disposal of the EPA to cooperate with the States by the complex process of temporary compliance of the new standards.
"After previous administrations, the EPA has often not maintained the deadlines for implementation and then expected to be complained by active groups and others, and in agreement to establish the term of implementation," said Pruitt, who claimed the EPA more than twenty times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in a regulation by court procedures, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority that we have is serious."
However, the EPA's opinion recommended that the Pruitt will once use its "compliance to late and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the rules are based on a solid policy and the best available information.
The Republicns at the Congress are at a comprehensive revision of the Ozone rules.
A last month approved legislation draft should delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 at least eight years.
The measures were not yet voted in the Senate.
The New York General Advocate Eric Schneiderman, who led the Coalition of the States who declared the EPA in this week, said that the group intended to maintain the legal pressure.
"The changing of the EPA - after our cards - is an important winning for health and security of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans that are directly involved in the smog, which strike in their communities," said Sneiderman.
In this case, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the district of Colombia.
Bode-Ozone decreases when damages from cars, motor works, oil fingers, chemical equipment and other sources in the atmosphere react on sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of previous deaths each year.
Representatives of the public health and the protection of the environment have joined a surprising course.
"It's unreasonable how much pressure it needs to take this conscious step from the responsible for the protection of the air we take", said Lori Ann Burd from the Centre for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the ideological crossing of the Trump government, offer themselves to environmental consumers and their special interests."
Tumlingen celebrated 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 Years of the Church of St. Hilarius: The Jubileum of the Mountain Church will be invited at the Old Friedhof Arréal in Tumlingen on Sunday 16 July, at 16:30 p.m. to a serenade.
Whether his idyllical situation and a beautiful perspective on the area is the historical St. Hilarius installation to disappear a favorite place.
The visitors of the sixth Benefiz Serendies can condemn themselves from this powerful place.
The saving and maintaining of the oldest building in the place have made the friends and promotors to their concerns.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It's a unique trial boy."
In 1267, the St. Hilarius capelle was originally mentioned in the Württemberg's original book: Graf Hermann sold by Sulz "the mountain with the found Pharaoh Church to Tumlingen after the Vogtei" in Magister Eberhard of Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silber.
In the original terms, on the Tumling Mountain, there was also a dominant court to which the church or the ruler's right was belonging to.
So people lived there.
As shown in the description of the Oberrate Joy Town city of 1858, there was also the suburb and the top village, which are now in the local image of Tumlingen, the "berg" of the third, the dominant seeds of the village.
Old cards from time to the year 1600 support these stories.
The Patronat Law consisted of the early Mediterranean ownership law.
One Lord, who built a church, and put up with a paradise, continued to escape this church and could also perish this own church.
In this connection, it was the right to use a parent or to propose the Bishop a new pavilion.
There were three altars in the church and two clocks on the tower.
The size of the two is cut on Christmas 1673.
The newly established lock was then the first time, 1692, but later was to be issued in the Second World War in 1942.
In the 30-year-old war (1616-1648) the window boards were shooted and locked the lock.
The toilet was easy.
1796, French wars were near the church.
They put the channels and church shoes out and used them as a holz.
The rest of the church threatened to struggle in 1809.
By 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius Friedhof also served as the last place for the dead of the sworns.
1823 the Friedhof was extended and the Hilarius Church broken.
Only the drought was left.
In the night of the New Year 1834, a storm switched the shore and the half shocked.
To prevent a disaster, the tower was broken.
Only the present Turmsweek remained a witness of the 750 years of old church history.
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem from the "Shirt Rentners" as followers of Dieter Dockhorn the hilarius place.
As an event, the friends and promotors invited the Sunday 16 July to the sixth Serenade on the old Friedhof to St. Hilarius capelle.
This is established by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium's Combo and with words of Kurt Kubler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local Chairman Hartmut Romans speaks the final word.
The programme starts at 16.30 p.m.
The entry is from 15.30 a.m.
At the end of the Serenada, a switch is placed before the Friedhof.
"Have a summer shore under the shadow of old trees and with the swimming view of hows to the forest," the events show the fantastic view.
The Serenada's only found in a soft weather.
The events hope that many supporters have been maintained by the historical St. Hilarius plant that is important for tumors and hearers.
The friends and promotors feel that the home work is particularly bound by how Serenade-Organist Walter Martini confirms.
The agreement wants to check the authorisation of winds
"Boisheim" does not see legal conditions for the construction and has therefore been used to the agriculture Council.
The Boisheim Agreement has requested the Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to return his approval to establish wind power plants planned in the Boisheimer Net.
She has been on the right side.
The Agreement argued that at the time of the approval of 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette, there was no wind power plants that could be approved, since only a wind-concentration zone was at the time of four in the city limit to Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind energy plants are essentially possible, but the concentration zone also affects an exclusion of the wind energy use for the rest of the city.
These zones are to prevent a "contamination" of the landscape.
The city Viersen had just a few days ago decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Net - but the central government of Düsseldorf was not authorized because of a formular.
"For the lack of planning conditions, the authorized authorisation decides to return as before legally and therefore therefore," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim".
Current state of things: The City Council has re-established the wind concentration area in the Boisheimer Net; a authorisation of the district government is still deleted.
Recitals: "There is the provision of an authorisation for the establishment of wind-energy plants in this area".
The circle confirms the arrival of the request.
"The relevant writings have been introduced since last week at the circle four," said one speaker.
The circle takes it to review the matter again.
However, they are not expected that the procedure will be stopped.
In view of the current procedures in the administrative court, the circle did not want to express the argument of the Boisheim Agreement on Thursday.
The NEW Re, a daughter company of the NEW, plants on a surface on the Boisheimer Nette the construction of four to 200 meters high winds.
Over the past year the company in which the city of four was medium-sized has concluded contracts with the owner of about 65 hectares.
With the establishment of the four wind energy plants, the electricity needs of around 11 400 households can be covered, which corresponds to a fifth of the energy requirements of all four households.
The NEW Re will invest around 20 million euros.
In the past summer, Fourens City Council gave green light for the purchase of three wind power plants in the Windpark Linnich at Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind-energy plant in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg.
Car and Tractor smile together: Woman dies in terrible accidents

A woman was killed there.
Two other people were easily hurted.
The country strategy remained locked over hours.

Cities and handlers plan "Heimat-Shoppen" weekend
Bad Langen Sales and people from the region will newly discover the opportunities of buy in the city in September.
The shopping agreement and the city management want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to locate the people to buy a boom in the city.
As the Chairman of the Acquisition Agreement, Christian king, the "Heimat-Shops" weeks, the customers should realize what offers the city itself instead of the normal supermarket ware.
It is planned to be a market with regional providers, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, domestic enterprises should be presented with their training places.
Furthermore, the business of the city is to invite the "Mights Shops".
The action is not only to the inhabitants of the city and the nearby region.
In preparation, advertising was a radio, an Internet video and pressed pieces that indicated on the action weekend, so Christian king.
Cities management and trade agreements cooperate with the industry and trade chambers.
This is how the shopping agreement and the city goes to another stage of the project "Attractive Innenstadt".
This includes new offers such as the first "active-day" to the breakfast and sales Sunday, conversations with all customers and workers to move them to the active participation.
An attractive offers on Saturday and on parking costs at this day are part of the concept.
Furthermore, the potential of customers should be renewed or resolved.
This includes guests and tourists.
But also many inhabitants had lost the city when purchasing the eye.
At the end, everyone should contribute to live in the city - until to avoid, the operations of the whole city and beverine.
It told the king to overcome the leshargie with a network that had so widely powered.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen, shared the third "Heimat-Shopen" day, first five Thüring cities.
Besides Bad Langensalza, this Weimar, Sunda, Holy city and Bleicherode are the weimar.
The day aims to “promote its importance for the common welfare of our cities for the evaluation of the local trade”, says Streich.
The action under the IHK Federation and with many partners also clearly makes that every citizen with his purchasing behavior could affect its directly environment.

Trump placed after switched transscripts of phone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the bordermaker
Transscripts of phone calls between President of the United States Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post.
On 27 January, Trump called on a telephone board with the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop speaking publicly that he would not pay for a planned borderwale.
The President of the United States murdered him because he had publicly struck the wall, and reports said to him, "It's what you can't say the press."
Trump began his presidency campaign with the promise to create a wall at the southern border of the United States, and nor to allow Mexico to pay for the project.
Transscripted his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was also published and enthusiasmed an encouraging exchange.
Mr. Turnbull said that a trade for the United States refugees who were swimming after Australia would be "shiny", "man" and "dumm" and that the existence of the trade that the Government of Obama had been sent to him would be a "depp" after proposing a prohibition of residue of refugees in the United States.
Mr. Trump finished the call after he said to Mr Turnbull, "This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moors Ford Massaker: Actors leading racist Lynchat as a call for justice again
A 1948-year-old Ford Mercury went through a group of observers in the rural monroe, Georgia, and turned into the Ford bridges of Moore.
Before the car, who had four black passengers and a white driver, the bridge could reach, a group of white men with arms came up to block his way.
The leader of the Mobs - a medium-year-old man in a nadel-streif age - took a long train on his Zigarre and checked through the wind protection chief.
The insectes were in fear.
"We want this n ---- r Roger!" burned the man.
"Have him out of the car!"
The style of a young black man was disrupted from the carriage room.
Happily, this horrible scene has been played on July 22, just a idea.
But when a slinge is thrown around the hals of "Roger", almost all in the public are very real players.
Since 2005, citizen lawyers return to Moore's Ford Bridge to follow the night where two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were entered in 1946.
No one was sentenced because of the murder.
"It's really unfair that in all these years no one was arrested - although we see them in our community, although we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps the organization of the opinion.
"It's a shock of a story, but it's a burden for our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old Congress Member of the Georgia State and a lifelong civil lawyer.
For him the opinion is a dramatic call to act and makes an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want criminal persecution, we want the condemnation, we want sanctions, we want condemnation, but first we have to receive justice," he said.
"We can't achieve sanctification and condemnation until we receive justice."
A physician has a bed over the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford-Lynchen on 27 July 1946.
According to the FBI data received by the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding graffiti in the Lynch process were suspected.
But no one was sentenced.
Although the suspects have remained free for decades, citizens say that the double motivation for Lynch actions in the whole city was always known: policy and sex.
In April 1946, a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice allowed the black citizens in Georgia first to leave their vote on the pre-aventured campaign in the summer.
Nearly the same time as the election, the FBI's information of the black farmer Roger Malcom took a white founder, Barnett Hester, during a fighting, likely because of a woman.
Brooks said that the weeds in the city had been that hester with Malcom's wife Dorothy had sleeped and that the baby that she found was not by her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison paid a prominent white owner, $600 to free Malcom from prison, so the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But when they went away from the prison and the Moore's Ford Bridge closed, a Lynchmob turned the car.
"Who it comes out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murder," a FBI report concludes.
"It is also obviously that there was a compliment between the State and local criminal persecution that was not only involved in the murder, removed evidence and condemned the identity of Witnesses."
Brooks form it still pregnant.
"It was a choice massaker," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this Community: "If you let register and when you vote, then you will happen here."
Ford Bridge Lynch murder, Cassandra Greene has led the annual idea of Moore Ford Bridge.
Its exhibition is attractive, and is founded in a form of deep racism, from which many want to believe that he is not anymore in America.
It's hard to look, and it's still hard to look away, but Greene said that it's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lynchen, because then we'll be faced with your hospitality in all of us," she said.
"Are I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or not to hear what I had done."
The samples for this year's production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 spectacles - a twenty-white and the rest of black - began in a room and shooted when Greene began a good view of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is the Greenes Co-Register.
He has played the role of the Chief Clan member for years, but he said that the role will never be easier.
"I feel angry because I'm not so much," said Marbaugh.
"but I think it's very important to get this story in life because we don't want to return to those times."
On the other side of the room, the player Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried to play their lines.
The piece starts with Malcom, who cried the hester and threatened him, angry that he sleeped with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n --- he's gone from my property!"
Rascona answers the fire.
There's a break.
And then, every one (the least all black players) is cast out in sights.
Greene laughs the laughest.
"What?" asked Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
I was too hard?
"No," said Greene, still awesome.
"I just don't think that white people's just said ".
"Doch," one of the other black showers.
"You just have to meet the hard 'R.'."
And exactly there is the energy in the room, a feeling of the camera community.
Everyone is busy to do this correctly, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N word, he said it's hard and with pressure.
Absolutely nobody's laughing.

Max Quante works as volunteer
They work in their voluntary year equal to several places.
Where are you?
Quantity: Normally in stone floor in the building, once in the week, I help in greens in the building bridges.
And I've already worked at school in the open day.
How are your experiences?
Number: It's a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You're 26 years now, so a late volunteer.
How does that come?
Number: I've made an abit.
And then a construction student, let's say, successfully broken.
I realized for me that it's the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else to work with people.
And then I asked what you do.
Make a social year, there's a view, you can see how it is before, in the burning point, maybe it's really.
What was that?
Number: I gathered great impressions.
I'll start my study in the winter.
I'm going to study, probably to make a social worker training in the youth of Herne in Hamm at the School of Academy.
Is it not uncomfortable to have several places during the voluntary service?
Quantity: Yes, it's very variable.
It's probably always coming to where you're doing his FSJ.

With me it was very excited.
I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon.
For me, it was exactly the right thing I've seen.
I could recognise my own powers and see how it really works.
Other than in the construction student?
Number: No clear, this is not about to record statistics.
You always have other people that have a very different story behind each other.
Whether a refugee, whether a young man who has been taken out of the family, must always be in the individual way.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have a gang?
Number: I'm not the guy for that.
It's a areas that have a lot.
A great love, a lot of friendship.
There are some negative moments, but that's how life is.
Pearson shorts more 3,000 jobs and cuts the divident to rebuild the business
The British education group Pearson said that it will reduce more than 3,000 jobs and slow up their inter-party 72%, since a further restructuring program is started to overcome the pressure with which the company is faced.
In addition to its previous restructuring, in which 4.000 places were already lost, the general director John Fallon announced for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019.
Pearson announced in May a third cost reduction plan for more than 300 million dollars (394 million dollars) to re-establish a business taken by the fast step to digital learning.
The company, who had participated in the Penuin Random House in the Bertelsmann partner in the last month, said that the view of the business year was unchanged after it had reached an increase of 1% to 2,05 billion pounds of funds in the first half of the year.
Convoi attack of Kabul: Nato-Soldat killed in self-assault attack
A suicide murder has attacked a military convoi in the Afghan Capital of Kabul, killed a Nato soldier and struggled several other, says officers.
Five soldiers and a dolmetzer were damaged, they shared a statement of Nato.
According to unreasoned local reports, three civilians died in the city of Qarabagh.
Bombering is the last act of violence that Afghanistan took this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide killer killed two people near the Iraqi message in Kabul.
In an opinion of the Nato, the explosion was occurred on Thursday when a common patrouille was attacked with the Afghan army from a "improvised spring band of persons".
The statement indicates that all lost victims are in a stable condition and are treated at the U.S. Military Hospital House on the airport.
Correspondents say that the growing force of the Taliban and the group known as so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a great concern for NATO struggles near Bagram.
According to the United Nations information, at least 1.662 civil death victims in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 were at least 20% in the capital city.
By the end of July, a self-mortal bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly skistic district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had executed this attack.
On 31 May, a huge bomb in the city centre killed more than 150 people with the most killing military attack of the country, since the U.S. troops of 2001, the Taliban was cut from the power.
Violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, since President Donald Trump decreased to increase the number of US troops supporting military and police in the country.
Co-responsibilities say that self-assault in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policy, and in particular in the call by President Ashraf Ghani.
The EPA decides to delay the Smog Rule on cash
The American Environment Agency has decided to delay the Government of Obama, which is bound by the States to deal with Smog emissions, one day after 15 States declared the Agency for the step.
The EPA was late at midnight, the decision to be forwarded to such "Ozone Regulations 2015", and said that it had the obligation of the Agency to cooperate with States.
"We believe in the dialogue with and in reacting to our State partner," said EPA Chief Scott Pruitt in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the aim of the EPA to measure ozone provisions, in which one part of the country's pollutant emissions should be measured in order to determine where the averages should be made to keep closer air quality standards - to delay one year up to October 2018.
A group of 15 major democratic States, together with the district of Colombia, joined the complaint on Tuesday, and said that the efforts were illegal.
The Government of President Donald Trump has tried to restore a wide range of environmental stocks that the former President Barack Obama has established as a part of a broader agenda that, according to Trump, is to make the economic growth.
However, efforts have solved the distortion of democracy and natural protection groups that are concerned about the increased impact of public health.
The EPA’s website says that the anatomy of the ozon contains "Reduce the lamination function and enhance the respiration symptoms" such as as asthma.
The Council wants the Community space
At the end, the decision was clear: two opposites decided the Joint Council of Fluorn to establish a Community space in the future of senior residence.
Before the debate, there is an important information: the purchase contract for the lack of the basic part has been signed, reports Master Bernhard Tjaden.
Although there will still be a long time until the area that belongs to the church community is in the community, there is no more planning obstacle to the project to vote by a private investor.
There is a debate on a Community space for this purpose.
One of the two investors that are still on the ship has offered to come to the community.
In the earthquake, he would provide a living area - around 55 square meters - and a border terrace with 70 square meters of surface for a special price.
The management and majority of the Community Council proposes that a Community space is not just a position to predict for the inhabitants of the senior rights residence, but to enter into the community openly.
For example, the word "Strick coffee" made the round.
The decision which has already been adopted by the allocation of resources for the current budget will be satisfied by supporting opportunities.
The building is in the sanitation area.
The establishment of a Community space would, therefore, be reported, with 60% of 30% of supportable.
The proposal for a decision aims to report to the investor that it does not want to do a button between the skins to determine that both sattels - which is rejected to the construction of the environment, as well as pultdach - would be reduced and make the building more economic.
It's not just Wilfried Sohmer, it's the addition.
If it's helping, he's just instead of happening the gramm.
It is not so simple that it is in the Community space.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many of the buildings with which you are not going to be so right, so now you're not going to leave the Community space out of the window, she says, "I'm hard to do this."
Yvonne Staiger is unlikely to the Community space - however, absolutely against a common participation.
It looks like a covered subvention to any owners or even external investors.
This is not the case, since the acquisition of the area is not a subvention, but a real, doubtless contrary to market, is the contrary.
The application for a decision shall be covered by three representatives.
Thus there are two opposites in the original programme that Stefan Haller is as a whole: "If we take this decision, we make a rise in order to closure a fall in our infrastructure."
Collision with car: Radler is played on the road
During the road, a 82-year-old rail driver in Garath is cast by a car and is hard to hurt.

Turn to stars in the round of stars
In the Harz, the first "Sternepfad" is to be found.
This plant of the United Starwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planet road in gods - since 2003.
A "sternpfad" comes to the need for information of many Harz consumers, said it.
He enjoys nature, science, movement and sports performance.
Members want to set up the road tables planned and inform them about stars and stars.
In a first stage to 2018, the Agreement plants "good to reach facilities at five to six places" in the top.
Inquiries come to St. Andreasberg, Brauning, Highest and Sieger.
The information on the tables should be complemented by Internet.
Thus, in the location selection a good mobile reception plays a role.
Barriere freedom is also a criterion.
Later, the starpfad will be extended to train.
"After the starspfad, the viewers learned a lot of knowledge, for example, about the physical of the individual stars," the Agreement stated.
Moreover, they learned why stars had different colours or why a star was stronger than one of the other, although he was significantly slowing away.
It will also be measured in which star image is selected and when it is the best to see.
The Agreement is already employed in the mountain city of St. Andreasberg, the highest starwart of Northern Germany since 2014.
The location in the National Park Harz is part of information from the Federal Natural Protection Office to the six darkest regions in Germany.
Of course, from the milk roads and even the Andromeda galaxie are clearly seen with a simple eye.
In the United City, since 2003, there is something similar to the planning stars – the planet road.
Before the Berghard's hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the inside of our sun system, the planet journeys with its stones towards Hainberg and Starwarte, as well as a "Austrian" location in Demarden (Community Equivalents) with the Planet Sedna.
The steel with the individual planets - including the degraded Pluto on the end point - are exactly set out in the distance and measurement of one to two billion.
The earth is cut on a ball of 6,5 millimeters of diameters, while the exactly 75 meters away from the sun misses 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planet road is well 4 km.
While the light of the sun to the Pluto needs about eight hours, footballers need a good hour to steel with Pluto.
So footballers are faster than the light in the world.
But the Marsh for the next fixster would last a half year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko first meet, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be in a collision course to insert the most slightest box camp in near future under 147 pounds on Thursday, were meeting the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unexpected World Boxing Council, the river went down to Lomachenko, to welcome the World Boxing Organization Super Feedweight Champion.
After Garcia's winning by a single decision on the former four-party World Meeting Master Adrian Broners on Saturday on the showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pound list.
Garcia put the right hand out and said, "Who are you, Champion?
I want you a lot of happiness."
Lomachenko defends his duty against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at 19:00 p.m.
When the couple posted for photos, Lomachenko-Manager Egypt Climatics noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect size order".
"I'm a premature weight," Garcia reminded.
"I'm riding for broker [140 pounds], but I'm not so big.
I'm small for 140.
I'd like to get out of light weight.
And he must move on light weight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let them give it."
Lomachenko was right.
"Boxes need this battle."
Climats asked whether it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko must fight with a 135-pound department in this year in order to agree on a date in the next summer with Garcia (37-0,30 knockouts) that also interested in fighting Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell on 23 September.
"This fight could happen in the Pay-per-View mode because all fans asked him", said Garcia and later pressed openly to fight in the network offering the best financial package.
We're the best ones.
No other names can create this type of attention.
Whenever they are ready ... "
Garcia said he estimates Lomachenko as "a huge fighter", and may be going to participate in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko took the great lob for Garcia and said he thought he saw the three camps champion from the riverside very slowly. I'm sorry, Mikey... you wanted to see the co-aus."
Garcia said to be the focus to show the shooting boxes, then boxes.
Both said they could feel the moment that they built for their own fight.
"This is the fight that must be done.
No other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more happy to work with it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the top fighter, and this is Mikey.
It will be a great fight."
Four Treasured after Rifen Places
When a accident at the A7 accident, on Thursday, four people were difficultly injured.
After the first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira has lost the control over his vehicle after 16.30 p.m.
The Pkw slowed right into the shooting, where he shocked, and then remained on the toilet in the green strike.
The four insectes - two adults and two children - were very difficult in the accident.
During the first shipping of losses through the rescue service, the A7 was cut into Northern direction for about one hour, then it could be able to preserve the transport on the left driving lines to the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Thirds work better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes that after 2:2, the stage attracts the braunschweak that the optimization of the deformation in Aue points.
With the first season game, Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result, the two opposers were not there at 2:2 against brunish.
"The two opposers were too much, and we need to look better in Aue," said the players of Fortuna Düsseldorf.
The three chains are also to be optimized in the bridge.
And a door after a slaughter, the sweethearts don't want to take up.
"For the future, there will be no more on the line next to Michael (Rensing)."
Hoffmann is convinced that his manity is better justified after the experiences in preparation with the three chain than with the fourth chain.
"I don't know how we're going to work in Aue," says his train Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is safe to his matter, "for we just have the three chain on the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Giesselmann, who can build good."
"It's predominant, but that we are still better harmonizing and not giving us so many game errors in the construction."
Of course, Hoffmann also runs to Aue to win the game.
"But if you can speak after an indecision of a misleading start, you don't know.
The performance could soon be good", said Hoffmann.
"But when we are on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the pokal, we'll probably be able to talk about a general season attract."
Davon wanted to know anything about his trainer.
"The start in the season I just judge after six to eight days of play," said Friedhelm Funkel, who did not want to speak from an advantage to the ear, just because the game of the Sachsen in Himalayan home was to be shocked for a shock.
"The last time they can start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann, "that the players of Aue may even be something more fryer, because they couldn't have a hard and complete game like Fortuna against an increase in the bones.
"But they don't know about 100 percent where they are now", says the Internal Protector of Fortuna.
Even though guests from the Rheinland are as a light favorite on Sunday at the final (approximately) finishing stadium of Aue.
"What we get them away, only because we have the right to come under the first six, it's a blonde sense," says the molecule whose balance is positive in only a swimming position against ear from nine games.
"There is no manage in the 2th Federal Link that you have to shoot from before," says Fortunas Chefcoach.
"It would be arrogant and overwhelming."
And so Funkel wants to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of Swedish asylum tests
The recent results of tests for asylum demanders in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new method for the medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80% of the tested persons are older than 18 years of age, but not everyone believes the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Medical Authority for Forensic Medicinal Medicine (Rapporteur) has started testing in the past year.
During the asylum procedure, they should make assessment of the age more accurate after the Swedish Migration Authority (Migrations) for errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees who were less age.
To this day, migration box has sent 6.880 cases to test, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of total 2.481 tests from Middle March to 31 July 2017.
Eight per cent (2002) was estimated as 18 or older, while in other 25 cases, the Forensic Medicine Agency was estimated that the person may be 18 or older.
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person may be under 18 years of age.
The tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Talansson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are responsible for the last months.
"We do not see a great difference in the statistics of the last months, the numbers are very consistent," he said the magazine The Local.
The high amount of cases in which the person has been judged as over 18 years does not mean that the asylum applicant has lied over his age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that "proposed that the investigated person was 18 years or older."
When the Svenska Dagbladet surveyed the 581 results published, she noted that in 243 of these cases, the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old in this year.
The methods of medical age evaluation, which are made in the raining of skins and MRT sights of rings analyzed then by dentists and radiologs, were also criticized in some areas.
A skeptiker is the endocrinolog Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes the evaluation of the biological rhythms of people to see whether they went before or later by the puberty.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think that the type of measurement should be used.
The biological age of this way is very insecure.
If we can't say it sure, we should not do as if we could," he said the Metro newspaper.
But Varansson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult is low.
The largest risk is, if the person is just under 18, in this case, about 10 percent."
Full in the plan
The work on the three bridges of the Land Street 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg are good forward.
On midnight, a seven tons of seven tonnes was installed on the bridge at the Eastern Lauterbach site.
"We are very good at the time, it loops super", says Reinhold Light, head of the roads and transport in the Freeburg government presidency.
In April, the work began at all three sanctions bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The building end is scheduled for October and it is easy to ensure that the timeplan will be held.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads through the Trombach.
It is a wooden stone bridge from Beton, which has a red buntsandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
She was built in 1900.
As well as the other two bridges, they have come in the years.
In order to ensure the stability and transport security, the three buildings are now well curated.
The other two bridges lead to the lauterbach.
They're built out of red buntsandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are 12, relatively 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the site of Lauterbach has now received a 1,30 m width and seven tonnes of a severe bridge head called.
This is a random control which is also used as an operational route.
On the south of the bridge, a width of 2,20 meters of the bridge should be used on Friday.
That's where the footsteps are going to go.
It is especially that it is about the final parts, a patent of the Schramberger Company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already missed with the patented bridge caps.
Especially thick pink feeling has required the injury of leadings through the building in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a glass feed cable, which is connected to many companies.
The populations were informed in the front of the work by handle on the project.
Furthermore, fish and cancer should first be dismissed.
For the bridges between the building building and the gateway in direction Schramberg, the transport is insecurely regulated by a camp.
For building work at the bridge at the Lauterbacher localseingang, the road in the bridge is fully hidden by the "Taninerhof" hotels and "Seven lines".
The costs for the three bridge recovery include 700 000 euros.
Financed the whole country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bunter Protest at German kartoffelsalat
It is not so often that the parties go to a ring, but if it goes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is only difficult to bring them under a hair.
The Vulcan fleet parties (CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, and the left) in the Circle Day (CD, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, and the left) are part of a wide crown that shows peacefully the flag, since the AfD in the Gerolstein City Hall Rondell is called Plakat "groen selection camps."
And the known names take place - as Alice Weidel, which together with Alexander Gauland forms the Spitzenduo for the Federal Day's election on September 24, and the present president of the Federal Chairman of Storch.
But those who are already in place for hours before the event start, do not want to listen to the AfD students, but to demonstrate.
The Motto "The Eiffle remains awesome."
Originally, the city film was planned under the Motto "All at a table" on the bridge place, but now it is located on the parking area below the Rondells - and so directly before the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the city Hall.
A good picture that offers it.
And what Christa Karoli, Chairman of the Forum A world and one of the most important organizations, is very happy: "That many people have come here."
There is music and all of the foods, including a "urdenced cartoffel salt, which could also eat unfairly", says the woman who brought him.
The police has managed many officials to Gerolstein, especially on the train station, which is just a few meters away from the events.
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes reported by the AfD Vulcan fleet, he tried to make such an event and get the attack.
The 45-year-old age from Gunners village had first been asked in Daun, but there was a depth because there were no enough parking places because of the already built laurity kids.
Now the Rondell, Hompes, is happy that "we can have such a beautiful event here."
In view of the event on the Rondall board, he says, "This is the right of people, the main thing, is remaining peaceful."
This is also: up to 20 hours on the Rondell board, a band for entertainment, in the city Hall various redners, including the Rhinland-Paletic Apartment of the AfD boy.
In the room there are some 200 listeners who waited for the special candidate for the Federal Day, Alice Weidel, and the representative Federal Chairman Beatrix of Storch keep their talks.
The police's presence is unchanged, but until then the officers had a quiet night.
A few more than one hour periods the AfD event that guests on the place have a longer breath, but there is also a short departure after 21 hours.
The police can cut out - no special responsibilities.

Coe honors "real" Russian apology for Doping Scandal
The World Chief of Lightthletics, Sebastian Coe, loving on Thursday, which he described as an outstanding apology from Russia to a Doping Scandal, but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be included again in the sport.
Russian Lechtathletic Chief Dmitry Shylakhtin, during the IAAF World Meeting, said that the ban of his country was right from the sport and that he decided to fight the doping.
He said it's sorry for "to all athletes who were cut off in competitions of gold and silver medals".
Despite his comments, the IAAF contest for the conservation of the prohibition that was linked in November 2015 was found after a report of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) reported on public supported doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said the Chairman of the IAAF Chairman Coe to the reporters.
"The whole Council and the whole Congress were glad that the Russian Federation has recognized themselves that she has experienced some very warm times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation will be rebuilt."
Coe said he was also "rejoiced" of accepting Russia's criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think that progress has been achieved, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to restore Russia," said Coe.
"We need to do everything in the next months to normalize this situation.
The principle of guidance was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the defeated system," he added.
Twenty Russian athletes will be present at the Lightthletic World Meetings, which started on Friday in London, following the strict IAAF criteria as neutral actors.
The chief of the IAAF-Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia should comply with some of the criteria for reconstruction.
Drug tests were still inadequate and prohibited trainers are still free, and he said reporters in London after a talk to the IAAF Council.
Trauring for distorted soldiers in Mali
During a celebration in the North-Hess Fritzler, about 1,000 soldiers have thought about the two of the two of the soldiers killed in Mali.
The ceremony was placed on Thursday in the Sunday city under high security arrangements.
For the still unexpected absturgence cause, the Minister of Defence Ursula said nothing from the Leyen (CDU).
They called the two surrounded pilots, but they were "the King of their Fachs".
"We destroyed us before this higher victim they brought in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
Mayor and the 47-year-old Stabshaptmann from North Hesse were living around a week ago in the West African Mali.
They were transferred to Germany and joined on Thursday by an overwaff of the Federal War in the Fritzler Dom Sankt Peter.
On midday, only the members of the church were accepted.
Then the feasts in the family’s circle, close friends, the representatives of the federal law and the policy began.
In addition, Hessens Minister of Ministers of Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the Federal Inspector-General of Volker Wieker were the Minister of Volker Wieker.
The most tragics left Roses down, and the family stood arm in arm to the snares.
Before the church, Fritzlers and many soldiers followed the ceremony on a shift.
The Minister of Defence by Leyen called the surrounded soldiers as "high decorated" and employees.
The Stab Shauptmann has been built with a fretzler aircraft of the fighting slaughter in Fritzler and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regime, whose troops belonged, also explained: "If this installation couldn't defeat the absorption, then no one would escape it."
The United Nations Mission in Mali has not shown doubts by the Minister of Lebanon: the use is dangerous.
But he is also of high importance "for a country we are separated by only two States," she said.
After the breakfast, the shoes were taken out of the dom.
When and where they were allocated, the federal law did not provide information.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grabe next to his wife.
The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), will not be ruled next to his wife.
This shared the king's house on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish king couple is used in the Domkirch of Roskilde.
The Bjørn Nørgaard image has already completed a sarcophag for the two.
The Queen is agreed with the decision of her husband, and it continued to be called in the communication.
Where Prince Henrik will be buried, you're still unclean.
But he has not intended to be implemented in his French home.
Prince Henrik never did a illness that he wasn't happy with his title.
After his wife Margrethe was throne in 1972, he would like to become king.
In 2016 he went to the peace and also deleted the title "Prinz Low".
Since Henrik in Denmark did not get the title and function that he wanted, he did not see himself as equal to his wife - not even after the death, Lene Balleby explained the chief of the Danish king's house.
Where the last place of the 83-year-old is going to be unexpected.
But he has not intended to be used in his French home, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he worked for the last 50 years.
Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French age, had learned Margrethe 1965 in London.
He worked in the French message.
While his later wife continued to fly the sympathy of the people, Prince Henrik had a serious position in his 50-year-old government in Denmark.
In an autobiography Henrik expressed the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was deceased, I prefered wine instead of beer, strick-sockets, citroens instead of Volvo, Tennis instead of football.
Even for the gauloises I was smoking instead of Virginia's bag and the country called to be the Mark of Social Critical Intelligence, I couldn't hope to be overview.
I was different.
I seem to be satisfied with this position and not to hurt me.
It was just two mistakes!"
President-in-Office
CDU and FDP before possible majority in niedresaches
Niedersachsen, President Stephan Weil (SPD) after the loss of the Red-Green Government for a rapid new development of the country, he does not want to come back.
Because on Friday, for the resolution of the Parliament.
Before the surprising exit of a green-member from the Niedersachsen Group, the Government of Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) had been a serious crisis.
Five months before the official end of the Sunday's election, the Red Green Coalition in Hannover lost its nice one-size masterity in Parliament to the opposition of CDP and FDP.
The previous Green Deputy Elke Twesten founded his step with the non-nomination of the election 2018 in its election circle in Rotenburg (Women).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she explained on Friday in Hannover.
CD-Fraktion Chief Björn Thumler wants to recommend its group to take it.
In this way, the CDP and FDP had 69 seats together in the Netherlands's Land Day, SPD and Green 68 seats.
The relationship was changing.
The new Saturday is regularly selected on 14 January.
Thumler said that the Red-Green Land government should now decide whether they can continue to register in this situation without a majority.
However, Stephan because it is unnecessary that the latter may soon decide its self-resolution.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on Tuesday on its further action.
The Constitution also proposes the possibility that the Sunday depends on confidence to the Ministers and elects a follower.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities must be checked rightly clean", said Thumler.
"All questions will be discussed in calm, if they are legally examined."
"Twestend step" with the "fighting somewhat curiosity".
The politician himself stressed: "I'm not a trader.
I feel very good."
It was called a member of Black Green.
The Greens requested the abstracted Members to return their landscape mandate.
"We are self-conscious of her country officer who she has received on the green country list with immediate effect," the President Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Korner shared with the country President.
The President of the Green Group Anja Piel said, "We regret the decision of Elke T West."
They have decided to conduct no debate in the Group.
"Only before the background that there was no content differences, we can't comply with this step."
SPD Candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of the Netherlands Green Deputy Elke Twesten to CDI as a defence.
"The behaviour of the former Green Members in Niedersachsen is not only the torment of the elections and elections, but also the Treatment of Red Green," wrote the Federal Social Democracy on Friday on Facebook.
He supported the decision of President Stephan Weil (SPD) to make it possible to re-elect the Sunday.
The outcome of Twest costs the majority of red green in Niedersachsen.
The politicians "in their deceived fashion and in their own interests towards the well-being of the country" criticized Secretary-General Hubertus Heil.
"It's a scandal that the CDU in Niedersachsen has this smiling intrigence game and tries to shoot political capital."
Niedersachsens head of the CDU Group Björn Thumler will recommend its deputy to include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
The SPD head of the Federal Day, Thomas Oppermann, proposed Twesters to false the outcome of the 2013 landscape election.
The CDU was at the time before the SPD's most stronger force, but SPD and Green had a huge majority of a voice.
Agricultural Minister in Interview - How do we protect us from guests, Mr Schmidt?
Germany discusses insecure eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How to protect consumers.
The Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is interviewed with the Editor Network Germany (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can the consumer protect its eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers and consumers to see eggs in your fridge and to check the temperature pressure.
The Consumer Protectionport www.Environment Warning.de the Federal States shall use the most recent information on the oil chargens concerned.
These eggs should be destroyed or rejected.
Even if, after everything we know now, a health risk is practically excluded.
Now Aldi takes the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the Deputy Minister of Agriculture is not really undertaken?
Food monitoring is the task of the federal countries.
However, my house has immediately been shocked and has been held since the complaints of Germany's interest in close exchange with the authorities of the country.
All information and risk assessments are available for consumers.
The trade has to ensure that the sales products are inevitably commercial and healthy.
If eggs are exceededed from 0.005mg/kg, these are not circulable.
However, inflicted eggs can be sold and depleted.
This time the operators are not guilty.
Sit production companies and consumers in the same boat?
After the current knowledge, the production factories do not have an immediate debt.
Moreover, they must, due to illegal practices of service companies with economic damage.
As always, there are too little control colors.
Is it not only personal or even the final responsibility?
It was just the official controls that discovered the process.
However, it is also true that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded to 100 percent.
This is therefore essential for a declaration of such events and for transmission to State authorities in cases where criminals can be enabled.
I have already cleared that I have expected an unfair declaration by the responsible authorities.
Is it really necessary for the regular alarm in food channels?
Consumers and consumers have the right to obtain only safe and transportable food.
If a non-allowed insect in the food economy is used, consumers and consumers are entitled to the right.
The funds funds are made in a situation that is not absolutely necessary to manufacture, handlers and consumers.
It must be clear: the right-width use of the insectic fipronil in the situation of living animals is not adjustable and must be immediately terminated.
This is necessary to be worked with high pressure at all levels.
I hope that all competent authorities will be declared slightly and slowly clearly.
How the financial rules of football in Neymar's shopping to Paris are affected
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenditure of the European football unit will not defeat Neymars World Record Transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French St. Germain.
There will be some consequences for Paris Saint-Germain from the EUFA, as the leading organization that has monitored the European game has the power to prohibit the access to the pre-respective League tourist.
Financial Fair Platform Rules, called by the EUFA in 2011, means that PSG must at once prove that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without great loss.
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million (262 million) to purchase the Brazilians from its contract, and Neymar will receive a content that will be contained by several ten million dollars per year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's trade to France.
PSG can with security make the money locker to sign Neymar and bring it into a galaxy of other stars, in view of the financing of the team through the rich dominant family of Katar.
For the purchase of players, it must apply a lot of money, but with legitimate sources of income to taxes that allow them to make the Break edge point in their football business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his choice to EUFA President in 2007.
The former French players believed that Verine, who had taken great debts in their efforts, had effectively seen and risked to destroy themselves when banks or owners returned their support.
In 2011, FFP reduced the debt of the club to monitor their losses.
The amendment means that the business model used the Roman Abramouk originally in Chelsea in 2003 - buyed a club with potential and then intensely invested to improve the manity and to build a global market - should be a worse matter.
During the current three-year FFP event period, which runs until 2018, clubs can lose 30 million euros.
Although the 2015 Presidency has fallen in Hungary, his EUFA follower Aleksander Ceferin continues to decrease excessive expenditure.
"Verily FFP is not dead and we will still strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, responsible for EUFA for FFP, against The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid the Buyout clauses of Neymar in a pauschale, it may pay the amount for the accounting period of its contract.
Neymar has signed a fifth year contract, so that the expenditure sums for the next five years may be issued in the annual conclusion of 44.4 million euros.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has taken the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is in the possession of Manchester City, with the most serious sanctions.
The PSG has received a punishment of 60 million euros (hereinafter 82 million dollars), which later was raised to 20 million euros, and was ordered that the members of the Management's Champions League of the 2014/15 are limited to 21 players instead of the other normal 25 players.
The EUFA is on the search for clubs that could try to overlook their financial supervision by stopping its income by companies associated with the owners of a club.
While a catalyst company could sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, EUFA would not apply this as legitimate income.
The fact that the EUFA decided that the value of the Sponsoring of PSA was disabled by the Qatar Tourism Authority was disabled in 2014.
It was reported that a part of the PSG reports in Neymar could come to catalogue on payments of the WM 2022 Organization Committee.
But PSG and catalogue 2022 have claimed that Neymar WM-boaters will be and that such a manner for EUFA regulatory authorities could be easy.
The previous sanctions against PSG means that the EUFA will be more emphasized to consider any attempt to implement the rules.
The EUFA did not have prepared discussions with PSG on Neymars transfer, said on Thursday people who are trusted in the situation.
They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, since they were not able to discuss the PSG situation.
The last reports show that PSG 2015/16 has achieved a profit of EUR 542,4 million.
The accounts for the last business year must still be published.
PSG expects that Neymar's arrival is a blessing for Sponsoring Deals, Merchandising and Tricot sales.
The agreement shows that the transfer will increase at least 30% after the signing.
The Spanish liga was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and she tried to prevent Neymar's pathway by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"It's a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the state," said President of La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish newspaper AS regarding catastrophics at PSG.
Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger, whose agreement is an American sport type, shares the preserves of La Liga against a State that finances an agreement.
"This is the consequence of the ownership and it has completely changed the entire landscape of the football in the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"When a country has an agreement, it's possible.
It will be very difficult to respect the financial Fairplay because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a large actor to represent a country."
Swiss is on the search for a new shoggi supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey Border Schokolade produced for Swiss.
The Swedish cooperation is now before possible ends: the aircraft writes the task again.
Swiss speaker Meike Fuhlrott confirmed the request of the news agency sda a corresponding report of the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" from Friday.
With the current planning, the airline will derogate a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be checked every two to three years and understood by quality control.
"In the present provider Chocolat Frey, we are very satisfied," said the speaker.
Rund 17 million small redwise packed shogboards to 14 grams per year share the aircraft members before loading to the passengers.
With regard to the costs, Swiss did not want to make details.
Inspectors estimate the term "Nordwestern Swiss" by 1.5 to 2 million Frances - the Migros girls have a annual sum of about a billion Frances.
But more important is the public effect: for a shogy producer it is a prestigious task.
As many applicants there are in the new registration, Swiss does not want to deal with.
However, there is only Swiss manufacturer in question.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to try to renew the spring Treaty in 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss manufacturer was not available for an opinion.
Swiss's tables are distributed to their flights since 2006.
Before Swiss concluded a contract with the Migros daughter, Barry Callebaut had provided the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug.
The possibility to place the logo leaded Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Chocolat Frey.
The airport company works together with various Swiss shock-producers.
On long-term flights, customers of the first class with leckerie from the Confiserie Springli, in the business class calling passenger shoggi of Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi of Chocolat Frey.
Swiss also shares shoggi of Chocolat Frey, both in business and in the Economy Class.
Lightathletics - Discuss-Olympiasier Robert Harting reached WM-Finale
The three-year world master fights on Saturday at the end of the end on a medaille.
His brother Christoph, the Olympicist of 2016, was deceived in the WM's national decision and was able to look at the competition campaign only from the tribune.
At the same time, with the first attempt, the Poland Defended Piotr Malachowski, 65.13 meters long, was qualified for the final fight.
Nostalgie goes into "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" in the Nice
This repeating of the story is simultaneously nostalgic because of the glorious days of the 80s, for the 90s-year-old age (such as the predictor David Wein and Michael Showalter the Sketch Communities "The State" for MTV), and for itself, it means, for 2001, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd.
As cultural artists, it is equally a parodie and a confusion of our Facebook-able era permanent memorys.
But as Franchise, it feels like the time would be over.
"First Day of Camp" worked well, not only because of his absurd humors (this was a original history for a talking dose plant, spoke by H. Jon Benjamin).
While they seen on the corner of the Gags - sculptors play medium-year-old kids that are grown - but they created the unable to return the last part of the witz.
"The Year's Later," with adults who are now playing adults, is less emotionally endured and his parodie goes more according to the principle of gypsy, including a riff on the scalker film of the 90s like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The hand that looks at the rows").
On one point, a character is cut by a Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991".
Many of the central historys are the same.
The lovely Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Roman author, has not yet forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not yet lost his adolescence.
And there's another crazy-bossing pleasing, including the Ronald Reagan (such as Mr. Showalter), which is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good outstanding impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions of the best part of Franchise.
It's especially fun to see the ever-going young Mr. Rudd, Matt Dillons sublipperable of "Singles", whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old skin.
These are the moments of an accidental sense that could emphasize this Franchise as a kind of repeating "Seven Up" series, until he reaches what I am as his logical conclusion: "What Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scenes will show the bands how they will visit the film premiers of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon remembers another kind of nostalgie: the renewal of the cold war of "The Americans", on the film "Atomic Blonde" and even the "GLOW" with its East-West-West-Ringbox icon.
The commodities created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka are the government of Rhys Thomas to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the twenty-first years with both police officers as friends, two officers from Bukarest, who fight for truth, atheism and the way of marxism.
The main roles - a hard-speaked Gregor and a idealist irophe - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogs of Channing Tatum (e.g. a exporter product) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt synchronized in English.
It's a great idea.
But it's not much more than one idea.
There are some beautiful games to look (the police slows the time to look at the TV how Americans may do it with football).
And the list of the famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloé Sevigny - provides for a suitable game 'Finish the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is involved in the ability of a doubted propaganda-drama - a killer that brings a reagan mask will be included - that it often plays as a single.
In six long episodes there is, and the commodity is not enough or often enough.
"Comrade Detective", who was edited to a smaller length, could be better delivering his actor, since Gregor and Iosef will always visit the American message that Lobby has always been placed by two gentle men who disappeared a swimming Hamburger.
The message for the imagined communist public is that the Western culture can make everything for food for a place.
The fixed Roman Creators did not fail: we even do it with our own young people's history and with the sheep.
Drug-mafia in the country
The police is a struggle against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, many objects were investigated in the Blackwald Barrier, in Rottweil, Constance, Expositions and Stuttgart, as the State Authority informed Constance on Friday.
15 accused in age between 25 and 77 years of age were arrested and were already arrested against them.
Furthermore, the officials made greater numbers of marihuana and cocain, shooting weapons and several hundreds of thousands of euros.
Two persons were arrested at the same time in Italy.
With the two suspected Italians, there was German prison officers.
The two of these are probably extracted to Germany.
In the action, Italian and Bayerian investigators participated.
In total, over 300 police officers were employed.
The members of the Mafia are designed to organize drug crime, serious violence, tried murder, rape and pressure.
Soon since summer 2016, the State Authority has identified Constance against the organized drug traffic in South German space.
Among the State Authorities in Constanz and Palermo was a rich exchange, and the investigators of Cripo Rottweil had closely contact with their colleagues on vineyards.
The large income was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning.
In the vision of the surveys, mainly Italian nationals were closely referring to the Italian mafia.
An incident on 27 May in ports, where several shoes were shocked in a guest station, should go on the band account.
In the same way, large shoes in the foreign register
"Dates of citizens that should not be found there": a report shows significant shortcomings in Germany.
This leads to serious lacking decisions in asylum procedures.
The advocate for the Federal Government's Refugees Management, Frank-Jürgen, took note of a media report on large clouds in the foreign central register.
Many of the data registered there could lead to "to be severely severe decisions" in the asylum procedures and decisions, warning in an analysis that presents the "South German Journal".
In the register, the information has been taken by 10 million people with foreign nationality, including about 5,7 million from non-EU States.
The data are managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because data were not sufficiently collected, if data quality in parts has not been good until then.
In individual cases, data from 1921 were found, "for people who have not been alive, or by citizens who have become German citizens and shouldn't actually be in the register."
The report continues: "The wrong data inputs can delay significantly the return processes", says the report.
In the statistics on expenditure persons, however, EU citizens who should not be experiencing.
However, such false arrangements were "to a decreased debate on the process of exit responsibilities", it says in the analysis.
However, the federal government has obviously started to return refugee families with 16-year-old children to Italy when they were coming from there.
The result of a internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "New Osnabpresser Journal".
The paper states that the BAMF has implemented such procedures "faming families with children - with exception of sugars and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014 the practice wasn't possible, the newspaper refers to the difficult situation in place.
The Dublin Agreement is responsible for refugees of the EU to first reach them.
If a migrant continues to another EU country, this State may return it to the homeland.
The Bureau now writes: "In the meantime, the acquiring capacity for families with minor children in Italy has been significantly increased."
Italy has issued for the accommodation and accommodation of families guarantees.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECMR) is sufficient.
Other EU States would also return refugees within the Dublin Agreement.
The Internal Political speaker of the Legal Group in the Federal Day, Ulla Jelpke, criticized this decision: "Family with children are threatened because of the minors in the Italian asylum system of human rights and a threat to the well-being."
Second results
In total, 220 litres of people living in the overseer, the blood care service has already been available for other people.
At least the 12 citizens who were expressed on Friday.
All prior to Jürgen Greule, who shared with 100 feet in the area 50 litre blood.
Traditionally, the community accepts the multifunction of blood at the meeting of the Joint Council.
"It's generous as our body is designed for it, and we shut up respect for the sponsors that provide their blood for foreigners, even unnoticable," said the citizen Carlleinz Kistner.
"A single blood slaughter helps several people," explained the head of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, because the conservations are cut into their components.
That's how three people could benefit from a blood surgery.
Similarly, Maisenbacher reported about the actions carried out in the early year in the top of the bank.
"In this year we achieved with 114 expenditure the second result", said the DRK Chief.
Obviously, the change in the theatre house has led to higher numbers for a few years ago.
Before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were excited to the multifunctioners, and 50 of them were excited.

The Bank of England will hold the interest rates at 0.25 %
The Bank of England is likely to be informed later that the interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the declining of inflation have declined the speculations over an increase.
The Bank of England warned that the economic growth will remain "funds" when it contributed to the interest rates on family income in a increased pressure.
The monetary Committee's political decision-makers agreed with 6 to 2 in order to maintain the interest rates at 0.25 %, with less Members to increase in this month, as the weak economic growth has declined to increase.
In its fourty-year inflation report, the bank reduced its growth prognosis for 2017 to 1,7 % and for 2018 to 1,6 % and warned that the pressure would continue to be on the budget income, and that the inflation was likely still increased by around 3 %.
But she reported that in the next years, interest increases would be needed to increase the inflation raised by Brexit and said that the credit costs may be more than expected on the financial markets.
The members also agreed to retire a part of the Mammut Conjunction package issued a year after Brexit.
It will request time for the financial plan to provide more financial for banks since February, although it was said that it will now be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds of sterling.
After the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said: "In the central prognosis of the MPC, the Brutto Inland Product (BIP) remains short-term weak, since the pressure on the real revenue of the budget remains consumption."
In terms of interest, she reiterated that "a certain punishment of the monetary policy" would be necessary for the decoration of inflation and a "also greater" measure than the markets expected.
The markets now prognose the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that increases would be "surely" and "limited".
The bank's following corrected growth prognoses for this year and next year are compared to 1,9% and 1,7% prognosed in May.
It has maintained its growth prognosis at 1,8% in 2018.
The fund went after this news against the dollar and the euro.
The pound went up to 0.5 % to 1.31 US dollars and fell 0.4 % to 1.11 euros.
The decision is not amended after the recent increased growth rates have reduced the increased expectations to increase interest rates and the GDP has increased in 0.2 % in the second quarter of 0.3 % in the past three months.
The growth will be expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will be easy to recover the bank at the end of the year.
The recent inflation report was little shocked for budgets affected by an increased inflation and smaller deterioration, since heavyness will first be worse before it becomes better.
It added that the monetary policy in the next years could not "interfere to income", but added that the wages will be "declared" at the end of their three years prognosis.
The economy is also strengthened by the increased demand of British goods, which is to be reduced to the weakest fund, which will compensate a part of the lower consumption expenditure.
The decision will take a year following the reduction of interest rates to 0.25 % in August last after the shocking EU vote that caused the sense of the fund.
The bank estimates that it will probably be for four years until the prices and economy will be completely achieved.
Before the last judgment of the bank to the interest rate, the call was increased after an increase in interest, since the inflation increased the pressure on hard-related budgets, with three political decision-makers demanded an increase of 0.5% in July.
In the last month of 2,9% in June, the inflation was decreased to 2.5,6%, although the bank said that this was expected and will return to it in the next months.
The bank said that the overruning in relation to its objective of 2 % should be "ganz" to the weak fund.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "In view of the recent decline of Swap rates, the Hypotheke market should be more competitive, since creditors are looking for business and want to end the year positively.
The market looks particularly good for those in which the existing contracts run and the new hypotheks are closed, and many with free options and low rates will always be more favorable."
NHS (National Health Service) is intended to write anti-AIDS drugs 10,000 people
Patients will be obtained from September after a fight before the High Court against the financing of the medicine in the NHS access to a "transformable" HIV prevention treatment.
NHS England acknowledged that a pre-exposition prophylaxe (PREP), which can reduce the infection risk of high risk patients around 86 per cent, is now delivered by the health services through a first three-year study for a estimated 100,000 people.
He was willing to finance the process after confirming a sentence of the Supreme Court of Justice in the past year, which the NHS had the power to pay for the PREP, despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.
The shooting announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England Chief Simon Stevens as "important new intervention", while the National Aid Trust (NAT) called this "decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are part of the first allowances for the registration of humans, and other clinics will be followed in October before it be introduced in the whole of England in April 2018.
Pre-exposition prophylaxe (PREP) is a consequence of HIV preparations that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have demonstrated that PrEP significantly reduced HIV transmission in infection threats.
PrEP to take before sexual trafficking means that only sufficiently medically exist in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines may be taken every day or two hours before sexual trafficking.
For those who are involved in the treatment, there are genuine or bisexual men, transsexual and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been treated successfully.
In clinical clinics, appropriate participants are identified which agree to the study, including men, women, transparents and individuals who have a partner whose status is not known by controlling antiretroviral treatment.
People living in England and registered at a home physician may also register their possible participation in their local sexual clinic.
The programme will be signed by 10 million and NHS England to deliver the medicine in this week after an international competitive acquisition.
The study aims to assess the entire potential of PrEP by collecting clinical loans as it is used, incorporated and implemented in large-scale table.
Stevens said: "This great new intervention should add and overcome the extensive and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the progress that continues over three decades in addressing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity."
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust), said: "This is a crucial moment in fight against HIV.
PrEP, when it is aimed at the needly and dangerous people, offers the possibility to change English HIV epidemies.
From September, people with high HIV risk have access to this NHS financed attempt in England to develop a new tool that is really controlled individually and does not undertake a negotiation with a partner, which leads to a better life.
We are fully welcomed by this proclamation."
Ian Green, Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be understood that the study will be undertaken rapidly throughout the country and that no one who has a HIV risk is left.
Now, since the PrEP test has been equipped, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."
Sharon Hodgson, Deputy Minister of Health, said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overcome after months of late and deterioration by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of these life-changing infections.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that this study will be performed as soon as possible in the whole country to protect people who are HIV infected, and that we will contribute to a step closer to the end of the dissemination of HIV in society.
The great life: between shoes and clue designer tricks have transformed this small earl's Court Apartment to a great house
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a license for real estate, reduced 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to a former Court Apartment.
It is located in the first skate of a elegant Queen Anne Terrasse - and it is a evidence for the new design that Joanne has not packaged and sold its taches.
"I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a very larger room," says Joanne.
"I searched for something that was comparable to my price.
This apartment was shown in Erl's Court, and she had the same high shoes.
I loved them and made a offer on this day."
Since the first consideration, the 1.000 square room was completely extracted.
Originally, a room-screen with a slowed layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to bedroom - wanted to add Joanne Stauraum and a interface shop to use the big kitchen high.
"I wanted high thick, big window, much light.
That was my demand," she says.
To this end, she asked the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high feet and to create a house that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The box was not enough to place two rooms on each other, so that the architectonic challenge was to create a interim shock where you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the prescription.
"The steel work is very complex," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were shocked each other without we had to beat us.
It was not just to build a simple platform, but to set the steel so that he had the right height for the function above or below."
This order allowed to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama.
For the interview, a classic copper window of Retrouvius looks below over the glamorous residence area.
Especified gold mud, silver attractions and Vintage Serge Mouille shows the style for the program.
The use of Spiegels plays a role when adding the theatre, space and light.
At both ends, a short corridor is reflected to allow him to affect it more long.
In the kitchen it feels like a window in another room.
At the entrance, reflected units offered places for all beaches and grains of Joanne.
The beauty of the living room can send the kitchen if not used.
Coffee kitchen are nothing new.
The special of this is that it's a garage officer.
"A little engineering art came to it," says Erfocus from the steel strengthened, furnished MDF tour.
"It's contrary, so that if you shoot the door up, it's very easy to mount."
Thanks to the clear use of space and stauraum, Joanne could win additional 16 m2, additional bedrooms and improved swimmingout.
"After the end of the day, you will sell the baseline - or, as you are estimated, your real estate", says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estatemaker will be introduced and a calculation is based on the ground size."
Here they have made it to increase the surface and to use high-quality materials that give their luxurious benefits to the area.
"The materials are the things you're touching and therefore helping them to create a emotional connection in a house," says Erfan.
"You don't love you in the electric steck doses in the walls.
These are important, but they're not playing with your hearts."
It shows that a apartment can be transformed through good design and increased square meters of something normally into something very surprising.
In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave this.
Brothers fight for a 500 million US dollars real estate imperium
Two brothers were four decades after their Italian family founded the dynastie, in an interview because of one of the largest real estate imperial Victorias, more than $500 million.
The former Director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his young brother Paul. This has brought him to the Supreme Court of Justice to explain how to share their property and business property.
Paul wanted to go back from the family business since 2014, but a deep interference on the separation was held in the Supreme Court.
With her mother Anna, the 38 real estate brothers have more than a million of dollars, joined since 1973 the family purchased a business in Smith Street, Collingwood.
The Westco Jeans family founded a chain of 160 private trade.
It was sold for 85 million US dollars for 1999.
This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and buying centres in the city.
Following an agreement with his father, Colin has Paul's "the main manager and the dominant personality" described in the family De Lutis, about two thirds of the company's property and Paul about one third.
A court states that this means that Colin ownership has $316 million and Paul valued by $176 million.
The distribution of real estate and bargeld has proved to be a problem point for Paul.
"The departments proposed by Colin have left him with what I had for the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit.
On the past Friday, the first hearing of the Supreme Court was held after several defenced communications.
Brothers are now fighting for controlling the existing business - which Colin, as Paul says, have excluded him.
Colin argued that this is not true, but Paul proposes to manage some possessions incompetent.
In an early African, who was sent by Colin, he said he hopes to join the war.
"My Italian heritage says that the family is the main priority," he wrote.
The costs are increased in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, E-mails and reports of companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both of the lawyers held.
Mrs. De Lutis and her murdered husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who employed milk and delict business from the late 1950s and purchased a business in Brunswick in the early seventy years.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood Association, in the Colin opened the first Jeansload of the family.
Colin says he began there when he was "in my last years of high school, when Paul was still a little kid (approximately 10 years old).
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to deliver her own to her sons.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers before the court countries," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis entrepreneurship group, where Colin states that Mark has been paid when the company leaves $10 million and Luke 26 million.
Although Lukas and Mark were, Paul says, "the conditions of their financial separation were denied".
Colin was very resting, although he was a former AFL Presidency member and after a biography from Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the TV star in 2015.
Fairfax Media took contact with Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Just Colin answered by SMS to say, "I can't really say much," because the case is before the courts.
"It's very tragic that my brother Paul decided to punish me and to take our family names through the courts," he wrote.
Within the midst of 2016, Colin wrote to the court that he tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father wouldn't want Paul and I would end in our current struggle," he said and added that he "forever on a solution."
On Friday this hope seemed to be over.
"In close future our affairs will be resolved from the courts", wrote Colin.
Trumps planted a new head to restrict the media abstinence of the President.
Others have tried it and have gone.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he'll be the first.
Political reports that the new head of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including the reports of the media, in the hope of maintaining the Chief at an equal course.
This is a part of reporter Josh Dawsey:
"If John F. Kelly, the new head of the White House, joined his first working day with leaderships, was a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House that he wanted to repair: bad information generated in the hands of the President.
Kelly said the employees should fly information about him - whether on paper or in letters - because the President would take better decisions if he would receive good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to throw Trump by monitoring their media.
President Trump's television relationship is enough for decades - and now where he is in the white house, his television is still strong.
"When Candidat Trump was enhanced because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a complete reporting of places to be convinced," said the former election council Sam Nunberg in February against Political.
Politicals Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keep Trumps's Twitter habit is under control, according to six former election camp officers there are to ensure that his personal media consumption is a permanent lounge price."
Okay.
But the idea that Trumps Twitter habit was ever "in control" is laugh.
Maybe these campaign officials know something that we don't know others - that Trumps Tweets had had contained without their interventions.
We'll probably never know anything about the Tweet that the Trump has not sent.
If his employees have made him a few times to keep the wrongs away from him, then their efforts were rewarded.
But no one has thus been able to prevent Trump's contrasts.
A part of the problem is that people in a white house, which is composed of competitive parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump materials that may promote their views from the world.
Political - with this story - reported in May on the favors of the advisers to make the President doubtful information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Gold Macher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump, like a vulcan, can react to negative press dispenses, especially such with damaged skins, and that he can find out where these are.
Like the end of February, when a person was published to the President a printed copy of a article of GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provocator Charles C. Johnson, who accused the stab chief Katie Walsh to be "the source to be behind a chair of Lecks" in the white house.
Although Johnson was permanently banned from skins from Twitter or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that in the past he expressed false prejudiciary and reacted to her.
Trump read the article and began to ask workers about Walsh."
Gold Macher added that the current stage Chief Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "succeeded to implement a system to manage and document the paper channel that receives the Trump."
How did you get it?
Kelly tried to do the same three months later.
Maybe he will prove to be a more effective manager as a Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers still seek to influence.
These unchanged factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Favoritely wrongdoers receive post from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the aid of the population is offered and expected.
The police in all Europe sends postcards to dangerous crimes on the fleet in this summer (virtual).
Since the addresses of the requested brokers are not naturally known, the guidances from the population are expected and supplied.
Europol reported on Friday of the action following the EU Most Wanted Adventual Calendar.
Experiences had shown that many refugees are hiding vacation destinations, called Europol.
21 post cards for searching offenders from 21 EU countries have been compiled.
Since 2016 the website is available at www.eumostwanted, more than 2,5 million times it was seen.
36 of the online visits could be arrested at the time, at least 11 of which resulting from the indication of the publication on the website.
Re traveling negotiations on a grain and return to 'millionary'
Some of the most well-being householders of West Midlands are back with some decisive travelers on war stakeholders who have negotiated one of the crowns taken from the community to request a field before their homes.
The travelers have paid their 20 living cars outside a well-being street of Solihull, which is called "millionarys Rihe".
They brought horses, babys and a army of transporters after they were taken out in May without being struck by one of the slaughtered grains to prevent their accidents.
The tactic group found a shut in the defence devices and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained unlimited to find a way.
Incredible people have threatened the Solihull Council, who said that it is "not useful to address the problem".
An anonymous inhabitants said, "They were taken there on Monday after they were sent by Bentley Heath, where they cast stones on the passengers.
The Council must be endorsed by the shame of implementing, since it was unnecessary when the problem was addressed.
The travellers were there in May, moved and now returned.
More evening came tonight, probably even more today."
She added: "The Council of Birmingham knows how to do this by maintaining long-term instructions to protect their parks.
I live on the streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my community tax if the Council can't even stop it."
A inhabitants who didn't want to be called said, "It's sweet, we just saw the last round of these travelers only to be cut by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and have even seen a horse in the park area."
A speaker of the Council of Solihull said: "We are conscious of an invalid placer on the country outside the streetsbrook Road and working together with the police of Solihull. We take the necessary legal steps to continue as soon as possible.
To support our proof congregation, it is very important that many people may report an anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling them 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation where the court must examine when we present our case."
From Birkenhof is the Waldhotel Luise
From the former Hotel Birkenhof, the forest hotel Luise is.
The house is now renewed before the gate of the city of joy and will be opened again on 1 March next year.
That's good news for the city.
Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the current operating company mbH on April 13, 2014, around 30 000 overnights per year and also income by the curtaxes.
In spring 2014, the hotel building was offered to the Country Board as a collection site, which was careful for controversial discussions.
The city prevented the submission of asylum applicants by establishing a construction plan to ensure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not unreasonable at that time in the Council of Communities.
However, mainly the pleasant citys, Julian Osswald, defended the hotel location and then spoke of serious interests in the house.
He should keep the right.
The group of Luisen Hotels with business leader Birgit Scherer with seat in Bad Bergzabern has purchased the former Hotel Birkenhof in a voluntary decline in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three-star Plus category under the name of Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the joyful city object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are named Hotel Luise, Luisen Park, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
The previous hotel Birkenhof has been located since the long time before the entry, and when you enter the house, it will be clear to which large renovation works are made.
The bowls were discovered, cuts up in part, old bathrooms away from the rooms.
The whole hotel building is the only building.
To March there's still much to do.
"It's actually a beautiful hotel," Thomas Scherer says in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything should be renewed in the black wood style.
The rooms are equipped with large adjustable douches, the entry area is converted, it will be built new windows.
Everything is going to be "sweet urban near," as Thomas Scherer expresses.
"We want to make a smuggle round."
The swimming pool, the Wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment.
You don't want to place on the high level of the hotels in Lauter bathroom, but already on a higher inner city level, shoes Scherer.
The Waldhotel Luise with its about 60 rooms wants to be wide, explains the wheel.
Even individual holidays, groups or business rooms should be pleased in the hotel.
A conversation with OB Julian Osswald and director Michael Krause has already conducted so Scherer.
The ideas of the city are similar to those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
After the height of the investments, Thomas Scherer does not want to set out exactly.
It has been calculated under a million euros.
The foreign installations are also put on the front man, which is already clearly visible.
A large terrace, which is public, will be available in an interior court.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freuden City is a good market."
Russian-Africa: US Special Employer puts Grand Jury into
In Russian as President Donald Trump, President Donald Trump, Sonderrmittler Robert Mueller has introduced a so-called Grand Jury report.
In the last few weeks, the group has included the work, and the Wall Street Journal wrote the persons trusted in the matter.
The newspaper estimated the step as a sign that Mueller has extended and intensified his research.
The Sender CNN reported that it was already given the first invitations of the group in relation to a meeting between Trump's older son and a Russian lawyer.
The US Secret Services have been accused of the Kreml for a long time since they have seen themselves in the presidency fight in 2016.
Mueller examines whether there were discussions between Trumps' election campaign and Moscow.
In the context of the investigation, several men should be acted as advisers of the Republicans in the election campaign.
The reports also took Mueller more and more Trumps private and business environments under the Lupe.
The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the extraterrestrial Trump was cut into the center and investigated whether the President may have displaced the justice in the course of the business.
The main task of Grand Jury is to check these evidence in possible crimes and to decide whether the accused is to be sentenced.
The great Jurys is therefore called a lawyers.
They are generally activated when it is about larger and contrast cases.
The procedure is always following closed doors.
The body may also be enabled by the State Authority in order to invite persons to grant permission.
According to the Sender CNN, proposals were already issued to turn into contact between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
Those who participated in the meeting were requested for a statement, said in the report.
They should also provide documents.
Besides Trump Jr., Trumps's advisers and Sweigerohn Jared Kushner and his former election chairman Paul Manafort were talking about it.
Legal experts said on Thursday in the U.S. France that the inclusion said that Mueller was not drought in his work and that, if necessary, he wants to act quickly.
However, it should not be pregnant that the Grand Jury will be enabled at the end to decide on a complaint.
However, the introduction of a new phase in the research and a new reason for the concern of the President Trump is to be introduced.
Among the new enthusiasms, the President used a speech in West Virginia to represent Russian appeal as a campaign for his political enemies.
"The Russian history is a total exhibition," Trump said.
The theme gives the Democratics an opportunity to "I feel good because they have nothing else about which they can speak".
His Special Adviser Ty Cobb explained in an opinion, he didn't know anything about the introduction of a Grand Jury.
But they also worked in the secret, he stressed.
The White House proposed any measures that accelerated the work of the other arms in a "fair" way.
The former FBI Chief James Comey said three times that the presidents would not be identified.
There is no reason to accept that there has changed something, and it continues to be said in the statement.
But Mueller was used only after Trump Comey was fired.
Because of this outcome, the lawyers became aware of the Trump, he wanted to disfellowship the justice.
Comey said in June before a senate committee, Trump requested him to investigate the current national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The President is under a large pressure on the investigation.
After the presentation of the US media, the White House collected material against the other arms and its employees.
The speculations solved whether Trump Mueller wants to leave.
On the other hand, as an independent quarter of the Congress, such as in the Watergate Agency, Richard Nixon, who was later returned, Mueller has a position in which Mueller could be theoretically shocked on the shock of the President of the Ministry of Justice.
Many senators of both parties want to prevent such step.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators introduced draft legislation on Thursday which could no longer be resolved by other militants.
Antarctics: Gigantic Eisberg travels in the Antarctica
In Western Tartics, a gigantic Eisberg was solved from the nearby seven-fold Berlin size.
This shared the Bremerhavener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Sea Research at midnight.
The over a million tons and 5800 square kilometers big colons are now going to the north and will probably need two, three years until it is sweet.
He is 175 kilometers long and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the biggest ice inherents that have registered researchers in the last three decades.
It's not a threat for humans.
How much the climate change has played a role in the breaking of the Eisberg, it is clear to researchers.
However, the US research center for Snee and Eis (NSIDC) has been a series of unnormal combinations in the region for about 30 years.
According to many researchers, this can be associated with the earth’s warming.
The now broken colony was a part of the Larsen-C shell.
Sleeves are swimming on the sea and are shocked by large shoes.
So it continues to grow into the sea and regularly declines.
The Larsen-C-shell is located south of South America near the pitches of the Antarctic half.
In the north of this wheel feed, the equality of waxes and defects was stolen a few years ago.
A complete shelf is cut there, Daniela Jansen writes AWI researcher.
Some say that the Larsen-C Schelf is in danger, because the front side has never been able to go as far as now.
Furthermore, the glass plate is under swimming and can defeat, if a part is broken at a key place.
The slope of shelf and Eisberg does not increase the level of the sea because they swim on the water and swallow so much water as it produces after the slope itself.
However, the loss of the slipper leads to the slippers directly to the sea and can get much more faster than previously.
This could increase the marine level, but only in low-scale, writes the British research project to observe Antarctics (Midas).
The Larsen C-shell is the fourth largest shield of the Antarctics after AWI's instructions with nearly 50000 square kilometers.
On the cross of the Festland, it is up to 700 meters of dick, on the front side to the free ocean around 200 meters.
There it is regularly declining.
"Only it is a natural event and no direct connection with the climate change is known, the iron shield is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University.
"This is the most important decline since the beginning of the records", he also confirmed.
Scientists should be struck whether the Larsen-C Schelf will now grow or return long-termly and may have fallen together, said his College Adrian Luckman and added: "Our models say that it will be less stabil."
But this development will last ten years.
Even though these researchers do not turn back to the climate change of this giant ironberg, in the past decades a lot of iron sleeves of the Antarctic halfbine have fallen.
This long point of the Antarctic is directed to South America.
After data from the British Antarctic Survey program, the iron surface of Antarctic halfbinsel has fallen up to 28.000 square kilometers from the 1950s.
The temperature increase has contributed to decline.
Antarctic halfbines have been warming around three degrees in the past 50 years and are among the areas where the temperature increases the fastest.
DCU wants to be a home-care at the staff
Because it is always more difficult to use free places, the CDU calls for the workers' association to become more attractive.
First prior to the summer breakfast, the quarter 41 new offices in the management have been winning.
More than 1100 employees and officials are working for the circle management in Mettmann.
Now, 17 trainers have been back to their first working day.
The circle instructions are obviously very attracted.
round 620 applications were to describe the places to be forgiven in this year.
Nevertheless, the circle continues to be able to observe the increased requirements and tasks.
There are now places not placed before 50 in the circle Mettmann.
It is requested among other doctors and intellectors, as well as the general management forces.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative, together with the FDP and the UWG, and engaged in the management of the expertise.
The management aims to develop a approach to staff benefit and personal development after the desire of the parties.
The aim is not only to cover short-term needs of experts, but also to strike up the complainant competence.
The overall approach should be shown by internal and external orientation and concrete measures for raw insufficients and maintain a educational compliance with the demands of CDU, FDP and UWG.
That's a good approach.
Because the circle has to do it with personal problems that you did not know before.
Other cities take good officers and equipment and offer more attractive conditions.
The speech is of a regulatory "competition of public employees".
There is a high number of employees that differ from the service of sickness or older condition.
The maximum time for trade is therefore to keep places unlimited.
However, Klaus-Dieter Volker, head of the CDU Group, continues to go beyond the common application.
He was so long asking for a faust surprising on the circle day when he publicly questioned the personal cost dischargement and discovered the other parties.
People want to be examined with all the possibilities that allow an outcome from the Community employer association.
"If we do not come to a short-term solution, the circle management should be working with the workshops - maybe in cooperation with the Greek cities - to work a budget Tariff," says the people.
In this way, the CDO tries to better pay the employees and officers than it actually provides the tariff order for the public service.
The customs are currently exactly prescribed, increased or more money are only if they change to higher levels that are orientated to professional years.
However, the tasks of the circle have grown increasingly in the past years.
The first few weeks ago, new rooms were to be established, where employed to care for the provisions of the new prostituted protection law.
Not lastly by the increased number of asylum applicants, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Circle Director Martin Richters have a problem: you have too little staff.
Italy increases the sound to NGO migration boats
Italy has warned that it is not possible to continue if they do not keep new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs does not sign a new comportement code, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work", said the Minister of Interview Marco Minniti, in a interview with the tourner day period La Stampa.
Minnitis Warnung came a day after the Italian authorities called a boat of the German Help Organization 'Young Relief' because their manity had worked effectively with human lawyers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which has been operating since one year, refused to express its explanation of the Italian State lawyer Ambrogio Cartozio.
"For us is and remains the salvation of human life our primary priority. So it's very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and salvation zone at the moment," said the organization in an opinion on social media.
"We can just judge all the accused that are currently covered, after we gathered all the information and judge the situation."
The Italian authorities watched the ship of 'Young Rettet', the Iuven, since October.
It is convincing that his posting of smoking boat immigrants takes board that will be delivered directly from human lawyers, and that the smugglers can go out so that the ships can be used again.
At least one of these meetings was only 1,3 km before the cities of Libyan, according to the Acts of the State lawyer whose content was published by Italian media.
It is suspected that the authority of the Italian coastal guards, the savings in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reasons.
The code of conduct must have ships like the Iuven, in particular, a Italian police officer who monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and salvation results have been ready to keep the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
Last day, on Thursday, the new rules would be unnecessary, but acceptable, since they would not bring out their rescue actions.
Among those who refuse to sign the Nobel Price Organization is the doctor without borders (MSF).
In fact, Minniti said that the number of immigrants who took place after the rescue measures in Italy had been deeply returned in the last few weeks, which indicated that the efforts to strengthen the Czechwave and the cooperation with the local civilians have made fruits.
"In the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He has announced plans for further discussions with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with Tshab, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who have left these countries in hope to achieve Europe.
Storages and trials
Neon Weilermer Biker, the "Berliner Foreign Posts" and two guests met in Wachenheim in the northern pool for four days to enjoy trials and visionalities.
For this, three friendly guides were available.
The accommodation in Wachenheimer Tal shows that it is a good starting point for the tours.
The Bug and Wein Festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led to the wind temperatures along the winebergs to the Michaels Capelle above Deidesheim.
There were spectrums, such as doors, from which we were able to look closely over the pellel forest and the levels pre-related.
Dazwischen has always been more incentives for the long trials.
On the second day, it went to Bad Dürkheim to Saline and to the People's Festival Market.
Once again, the spectrum of the spectrum, associated with "flowing" trials and moderate attractions.
In the last two days, many heights were reared.
Hospital, rocks, towers, snakes, shoes and shoes had welcome pauses.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers entered the heavy sun in the free lunch hall.
Neustadt was also controlled.
After 173 kilometers and about 4500 meters of height, the group had learned the Pfälzer forest from its best - sportive and cultural side.
Konsole instead of Rasen - Federal Liga is equipped for e-sports
Sit the sport stars in the future before computer consoles, instead of fighting wind and weather over the stadium race?
The fact is: E-sport is long to a serious sector, become a lucrative business - large stars, millions of fans and large tourists with high guests.
This has also recognised the first federal links that are increasingly involved in this area.
The beginning of 2015, the VfL Wolfsburg, followed the FC Schalke 04 and finally founded the VfB Stuttgart, which founded a E-Sport Division in the middle of July, and adopted two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope to join youth target groups for the VfB", says the President Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure that "this is up on this train, even some of them."
In the next weekend, the FIFA World Association organizes the first "Interactive Club Cup" in London, in which the games of various clubs are playing together.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV endhoven were qualified.
Robin Dutt also looks great potential in e-sport.
The ex-tractor of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now an Agency for Virtual football players.
"The real football must, in particular, depend on the 14 to 30 years of age, that young people still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old boys.
And: Verine tried to employ all possible markets, especially Asians.
With the prominent e-sporters under the Treaty, you could be present on these markets more open than once a year to send the Federal Links to Asia.
What's exactly what's going on?
In e-sports, computer games such as "League of Legends", "Dota 2", "Comtrastrike" or FIFA's simulation at competition levels.
So far, as in the normal sport, the links have been employed, in which the professionals face each other.
And with Asian games 2022, e-sports are already part of the official program.
But is it really a right sport?
For many, the idea is safely necessary.
Also, Ingo Frobose has discussed the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sportshoch School in Köln, e-sports is a sport because it is competitive and many biological and physical reactions say that you also find in classic sports - for example, increased heart frequency, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also requires cognitive abilities, technical and tactical understanding and rapid reactionability.
Professional gamers should not only train their body and take care of food.
"The Fit Player is a good player."
Frobishers also see problems: "Doping will always become a theme".
Controls were hardly implementable at online games, and in the scene the structures of classic sport failed.
Positively, the scientists have the high integrative effect of the e-sport.
The players are internationally underway, this is like a great global family, there is no intercultural hinderance.
A study of the Deloitte and the Federal Association interactive entrepreneurship software (BIU) provides a large growth in e-sports.
In 2016, 50 million euros were implemented in Germany, mainly on advertising, sponsoring and large tourists.
In three years, the overwhelming is 130 million.
With the slightly 2,4 billion euros of the football liga is little.
However, the e-sport is "not far from the other enabled sports such as handball, basketball or eishockey", the Deloite manufacturer writes.
Internationals are still many countries.
Great markets are Asia and the United States where Ex-Basketball players Shaquille O'Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood-Speaker Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport Witness provider unikrn.
There are also some in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sports have been introduced as a educational point, Frobose says.
In the Netherlands and in France, the football rings are obligation to establish an e-sport division in Dutt.
"The European compartment is in the back of Germany," states VfB-President Röttgermann.
Only to lose nostalgie and to explain the old times, today isn't enough.
It goes to maintain the tradition of the Agreement, but the company also set up on the modern market.
"We live in a digitalized world," says Dott.
"That can't make sure that only at the football remains so much as it was always."
Gaft-Eier Ade - The Ei-Alternatives for Coffee and Bags
From scandal to the most frozen eggs, almost all federal countries were involved.
Aldi Southeast and Aldi North have reacted and took all the eggs from the sale.
Regularly, only eggs should be taken, which, of course, do not contain fipronil.
Michelle Carter condemns Conrad Roy to suicide.
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced for two years because she encouraged her friend by texts and calls to self-mort.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will be carried out 15 months after his guitars and five years have been expelled.
Carter was sentenced in June because of an accidental murder of Conrad Roy, who took the life on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said on Thursday at the hearing: "My family is unfortunate.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was able to stay free to work.
She was confronted with a maximum punishment of 20 years, but her lawyer claimed that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a psychological disease.
In red hair and a crome colorful flower, Carter stood there with sweets in the eyes, with sweet hands and the eyes sent down when she was condemned.
"Your actions have killed Conrad Roy," said the lawyer to the court.
"He finished his life to make her own better.
She didn't take responsibility," she said.
"He hasn't shown a virgin."
But Carter's lawyer said it's "that's a terrible condition that she's fully regretted."
Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, said that he did not find that you have a significant impact on their actions.
A State lawyer reads a statement of Roys Mother Lynn Roy, who claimed that there's no day in which I don't believe the loss of my loved son.
I want that he is proud of me and how I go around with everything. I try, despite all my pains that we will be brought with us for everlasting, to be there for his sisters," says it.
Roys sister, Camdyn Roy, said she will "prosecute" from the knowledge that she will never be involved in the marriage of her brother or would be a tank for his children.
"No more to have this only person with whom I was joined every day since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to have a case of predictation, since there is no law in massachusets that makes it a crime to demand another to act on self-assault.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in 2014 to a carbon monoxide in a vehicle.
The case took national attention after Carter’s text communications expressed that he had encouraged him to end his life.
"Spoke up, spring from a building, first you yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several news she sent her in the two weeks before his death, while he was with his family in vacation.
In the moments before his self-defense she wrote: "You must do it, Conrad" and "All things you have to do, the generator will be able to be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter searched attention by the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit from any press by the case.
The case has shared the legal opinion.
Amanda Knox, who was sentenced for the murder of her British council in Italy for two years before she was released.
Mrs. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter has a fellow feeling and help, not in prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new Mini Lahm of the FC Bayern
That Joshua Kimmich stopped as Captain at Audi Cup is no accident.
The FC Bayern has a great season to the Confed-Cup seat - Extra-motivation does not harm there.
There was something different on his place in the kitchen, which saw Joshua Kimmich immediately, even though the additional clothing room was very small.
But since the end of the second day of the Audi Cups, of course, no Philipp Lahm was to see the new Manuel, he made the dedicated bridge to his arm.
"The trainer has not announced it", said the Confed Capider, after his first use as Bayern captain.
Well, the instance could be better than at 0:2 against the SSC Neapel.
But the sign of the Coach could also tell Kimmich.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal was chosen as a player from youth players, debtors and just from the vacation of C-Elf.
Zuckerl is the most loved to share those who want to keep up with the laune.
So whoever has been excursive to come to the heritage of Lahm, a small extra motivation can only use well.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: take responsibility."
On midnight the 22-year was a mini lahm over the field.
Right down, this is his position, the white band on the arm made her over.
And all the way Kimmich worked in this starting form like those who could take the ruder as well as the best.
He gave instructions to try to launch the unclean truppe.
He had the view of all, while many others were busy with himself.
Vidal to overcome his lack of fatness (spoke little); Renato Sanches to join the benefits of Asian travels (clapped only only); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle so that they should not be negative in their first invasion in the Bayern Trait.
That's all right.
Süle went next to Kimmich, Rudy before the slaughter, both acted sovereignty.
The Napoli storm was often hard, also tried a few times in the play construction.
His colleague Rudy acknowledged that the result was "not as we hoped it."
But he also showed a general performance at the debtor.
Game movement, time change: "For this style I was also obtained."
As inhabited by this Bayern world is still for the new access, you've been seen in the end of the party.
Rudy, for example, gave not one or two in the catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimmich adopted a few sweet words back to his new player.
There he heard from Süle a interesting word: "What's going on here, I've already noticed.
You just have to win every game with Bayern."
Forever, he doesn't need to add the new ones.
Alaba motivated OFB Dame
David Alaba believes the success of our OFB Dames
Austria's most famous footballers have recently registered the game on Twitter and wanted the OFB dames all good.
The Bayern Legionnar is almost club collections of OFB Capitaine Snaderbeck and fits with our Ladys.
The twoth of the Austrian footballers of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivation splendid.
The famous Bayern-Dusel may also need our ladies well.
Enterprises satisfied with rhine-Palse Minister: Economy expensives Time
It was often unfair, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, as Eveline Lemke (Green) and the Minister of Economic Affairs of Rheinland.
This shows more than one year in which the new Minister of Economic Peopleer Wissing (FDP) is at the office.
Rooms and enterprises from the region speak on T-V requests of a change in economic policy and at the same time the old minister.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Trierer Company (VTU), says: "Wissing decreases the desire of the economy that Lemke has blocked all the ways."
The largest employee sees Natus in the infrastructure policy: The closure of the trains 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now above the country's priority list.
In this year, the Ministry hopes that it is a planning procedure, until 2021.
A role in the country's plans also plays the Western Trier's action, which is in the main need of the Federal Transport Plan.
The goal is to operate the roads in December 2020, says Minister speaker Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus looks like a way to support regional but international competitive enterprises.
The Industrial and Trade Chamber (IHK) is striving as Wissing calls for, in the wine, a Rheinland-Pafalz label to increase the paragraph in supermarkets and stop the tension of German wine exports since ten years.
Moreover, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to found a company, loving the IHK.
In the new Master-Bonus, Trier's handwork box is an additional encouragement to young trainer, says director Matthias Schwalbach.
It is expected to be a premium of 1000 euros for the existing master examination and $2500 if the results are self-responsibilities within ten years after master training.
The household list for the country remains long.
In the planned road construction, the facts were fast to create, as well as the country was not needed to be personnel, says Jan Glockauer, head of IHK Trier.
From 56 new engineers who want to set up wising to the country industry mobility, only 29 places have been placed.
The IHK calls for more appeal to external offices.
The CUD Fraction Vice Christian Baldauf refers to calculations of the Court of Auditors in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros in the maintenance of countries.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country, as it wants to deal with the expert lack of force in the region.
Incredibly, it is also the country's previous wide range construction.
In 2016, regional enterprises estimated network supply in an IHK survey only with note 3.4.
They are estimated about stored internet connections and abbreviations.
Ex-Company Minister Eveline Lemke is now out of the policy and is still in the Supervisory Board of the Wind Power Company Pro Wind.
The Green Group leaves Lemke to April to become President of a private high school in Karlsruhe, where she had been back to the field after four months because of inadmissibility.
Audi intends to change 850,000 such vehicles - Auto manufacturers see a contrary reaction
One day before the Audi announcement, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW President said that the company is the view that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions", and in this way concerns European cities, including München where BMW is closely - to prohibit or restrict such vehicles.
Daimler was known on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes factors in Europe to reduce its emissions.
None of the companies described the submissions as a return.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of such vehicles in Europe and the United States to support the compliance of the rules for carbon dioxide emissions.
But the stick oxides that emit the cell motors are as carcinogen and can cause asthma.
The costs for car manufacturers to install installations to neutralize the exciting expenditure by the vehicles are also difficult to keep the price of the cars competitively.
The German Federal Officer Angela Merkel is also accused of shutting the powerful autonomy companies and ignoring the problem.
The enterprises try to avoid the error of the public car that the use of such discharge devices could regulate emissions in order to maintain the rules when a car was tested but returned to normal vehicle conditions.
In the United States, several insurers were accused of people's cars, others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former leader of the thermodynamic was arrested in the development of Audi in Germany.
The former manager, Zacheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected before delivery and could be sentenced in the United States.
In the beginning of this year, Audi was included in German criminal investigations in the people's cars after accused of the Audi authorities to have installed a system to implement emission rules in Europe, and a question focused on the United States.
The involvement of Audi in the research could be difficult: the Luxus auto manufacturer is over-proportional to win the people's cars.

Mordillos clouds and the laugh against the pain
Mordillo was at the time one of the most public chartoon detections, the clouds of his figures are his marks.
Also with 85 marks the Argentina and works on a movie.
His message: Laugh, "then there are too many suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the first years, as a artist, he became a testimony for happiness cards - which frustrated him.
"The most happy day in my vocational life was the day as lost in my job," he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris ended in the 1960s, his cartons went to "Paris Match" and then in the "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Once again, the artist was inspired by towns.
Gross, surrounded Mordillo flowers are cut into drawings with the shirt tour of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Place in Moscow.
On the early morning, he sits his own information even today on the sign, he works almost ten hours every day.
About calendars, puzzles, books for green and small, T-shirts, particles and clocks will still find its drunk figures worldwide.
For six years, he works on a character trick and a TV series with its figures.
The main person in the film "Crazy Island" is a guilaffe - the animal liked by Mordillos in his desktops - who has a thousand feeder than a player.
First of all, his figures speak in the 3D film, which is to come to the film innovation in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're gonna say, it's strange for me," says Mordillo.
The dry book is not written by him.
So it puts it more on the TV series, which is, like its original labels, which will be produced without a production.
Lavender from the Provence of Climate Change threatens
He has become a symbol of the Provence in South Africa, but there is a warning that is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is decreased because of the remembranced conditions and of the insects that overcome diseases, what scientists and farmers who try to find solutions provide great head pain.
Eric Chaisse, expert of the Agricultural Institute CRIEPAM in Provence, said: "The lavendel in Provence is effectively threatening because the plants in the past years have led to the impact of climate change that has brought much less rain in the early year and in the summer much more.
This has an impact on the lifetime of Lavendel.
There is also a small cycade, a microbacterium that overflows cycling, and there are many of them with very severe weather."
And it's a lot on the game.
Lavendelöl locks not only for holidays, it is also very demanded for parfum and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant plants with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, subdeveloped and missed or missed.
So we have less parts with atheric oil."
The solutions to be taken into consideration include a better water distribution and the slowness of the swimming area from the ground, but also the slighting of plants with a protective mixing of tons and water and the development of species that are more resistable to the severity.
The town of Geisa in the thuringian routine celebrates its 1200-year-old existence.

The murder of a journalist stresses the growing threat in Mexico
The workers of the week period of Riodoce are normally meeting to review their plans for reporting the most recent Chaos in the Sinaloa State by organized crimes, corrupt officials and drug wars.
But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were informed that it is important to change their rutin.
Two high-range journalists discuss what feels safeer: they should take their children into the office, which 2009 were the goal of a attack with granates, or leave them home.
Security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: opposers, neutralities, associates.
They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary to enhance the applications and feelings of swimming.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, business laws, journalists that are suspected to stand on the content list of the Government or the card, a catalog of offenders that cause the Caos of Mexico.
There is no peacepause from violence, and while the bodys of the whole country are covered, there are still more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took place in December 2012. 589 are at attacks and threats under federal protection and at least seven deaths in the year.
Among the latest, her exhibitor and its inspirer of Riodoce, the co-funder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest error is to live in Mexico and to be journalist", wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books about violence in drugs.
His lack is deeply recognised, although his presence is overall - a large photo of Valdez that shows his medium-finger with the word "Justice" is in the fassade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the three-third years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, have a T-shirts that shows his laugh face with brille or his typical panamahut.
The workshop finds less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their alptspaces, sleeplessness, paranoia.
Although a special advisory authority was established in 2010 to edit the cases of journalists, it has provided only two criminal procedures to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
Like the majority of thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organized crimes every year, the murderers of journalists are only rarely in court.
In Riodoce, they still have the aim of treating Sinaloa's violence, although they are unfortunate and even now the terrain is more violent.
Without the information about the killer, without justice, the meeting on the debate of security has little benefit, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to spend my time in this workshop," he says.
"When we don't know why we all miss it."
On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the Riodoce newspaper office in the capital of Culiacan.
He only created a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was held by two men. He was shocked from his car and was shooted on him 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - the "Twoirth River" is translated.
The shooting went out in his car and damaged it nearly.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two adult children.
Guests are near to move to Culiacan free.
But on the subject Valdez, there's nothing practically like sweet.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and the extradition in the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the most delicate struggles of the country, whereas rigorous groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people will be shot on the road or that the Friedhof is full of shocked, two-scale muscles for drugs that are larger than many houses for life.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of the "Ruhe" when only one card has control over the coast state with its valuable ports and drug harbour routes in the United States.
Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, is Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-funder and director of Riodoce, with the fault that he could not protect his friend.
He believed that two misunderstandings were involved in the murder.
First, in February, the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of the rebellious card groups in the war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have deteriored the sons, consumed guest members have purchased each example of the expenditure when they were issued at newskioske.
The second error was not to force Valdez to leave the country to his own security after the appointment of another newspaper published by the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and foreign, and his murder is seen as a milestone in the mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.
He was in 2003 as an experienced reporter for Noroeste when he closed with five colleagues for the creation of Riodoce and sold $50.
In Sinaloa, "who is impossible to operate journalism without shooting on the smoke problem," said Bojorquez.
With the time, the newspapers received a call because of the modest and honest reporting, and the revision and advertising were taken.
Reporters loved it to publish hard research without fear of Zensur, and the readers were fascinated by a publication where they were able to read stories that nobody else had to treat.
Eight years after the creation of Riodoce, she received the predictable "Maria-Moors-Cabot" price for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez wins the 'International Press Freedom Award' committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of the mexican drug history, where she always engaged.
He volunteered that he was afraid.
"I want to survive," he said at the time of the CPJ designation.
Drug traffic in Sinaloa "is a life-wide", he said last October in an interview with Rompevento-TV.
"They must take the task that you are to be a journalist - or that or you play the dumbs.
I don't want to be asked, "Why did you do so many dead... why didn't you tell what happened before you?
The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the swimming bird that could flee as a porter worker, the friend, the greatly shocked with weapons and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted in his routine.
He would always take his hair.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar against the office and sit there on the same table.
Now they ask, was his love for ruining his destruction?
Her death has also forced her to ask her own acceptances about how they can achieve their best work and keep their lives.
"You don't like it if you're working with their women, their children, their clean business, their home start and land trains," to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best times, a high measure of self-defense and self-conservation.
He trusts his own instincts.
If it's wrong, leave it.
The crime is, said the employee of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "touch a sense that can be struck ... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, do not apply in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other States, where a giftful mixing of lucrative smuggle routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is home.
The landscape is constantly changed.
In the area where the workers of Riodoce met for security training, no phones were immediately allowed. It was known that spywares that are only sold to governments were used to monitor journalists and activeists in Mexico.
Outside two police protectors were searching for 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.
They were employed by the country government to protect Riodoce's offices in a four-off building in a mid-class terrace of Culiacan.
Some reporters asked whether these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the police, who themselves called the Governor, were not confidence.
There are months since the reporters have been in the mountain country where drugs are in fact controlled.
For the output of this week, Riodoce has seen three main historys.
There was the murder of the brother of the former known Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposure to the State expenditure focused on the city of the guerrors' home.
And there was a group in one of the most precious restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the State lawyer's office.
There was no official word about who has been cut off or how it happened, so it was given care when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drugs and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who heard the Governing institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated almost all the political levels of the century.
Recently, several PRI governances were accused of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous accidents in this local, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman was a military accident.
Only a few months ago the readers would have viewed the columns of Valdez than the most informed source of the exhibition.
"We had already knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the "El Flaco" name because of his sweet body station.
"The last time all channels of communication are broken with our sources."
The office of Valdez was surrounded to the conservation room for signs and clothes that protest against the murder of journalists, because the employees have become something that they never had expected: actors in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs and went to a demonstration on the next morning because of another journalist to the office of the State lawyer.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the Western Michoacan state.
A burned body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it's his.
In the whole country, journalists have become more prominent in organized Protests "SOS Press" on ways and buildings.
On this day, the Governor Bojorquez is out of Washington and is trying to collect international support for justice in the Fall of Valdez.
When a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day following the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spontaneize journalists and to kill them because they said the truth.
She has therefore requested that the government be re-distributed again because it is concerned that her egoes have suffered their objectiveness.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico of organized crimes, government officials involved in it, and an equal society "exhibit".
In his last book "Narco-Journalism" he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug groups, but also on the command of politicians and security forces that were covered by organized crime.
The Media Watch Group "Articulo 19" has sent more than half of the attacks against journalists of police and officials last year.
"In Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth," Ramirez said.
Of course, the murder has a terrible effect.
Nobody forgot the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Your body was found together with a note that was usedly signed by the Zeta card: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer board and head-to-level standed next to their separate head.
Some officers have chosen to close the newspaper El Nord in the northern border Chihuahua after the murder of the co-responsed Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue how El Manana did from Newvo Laredo after the murder of their directors in 2004.
2010 Diario de Ciudad Juarez was publicly addressed to the drug card with a license on the title page with the title "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have been fled from their home states or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in the exil, and they still observe the streets and search for dangers.
And sometimes she will be shocked how it is clearly the photograph Ruben Espinosa, who was killed with four women in a apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight of Veracruz.
For those who remain and continue to work, it is a daily dance with risking decisions.
Ibarra, who first wants to be a thrilling, is that the drug traffic is scared of him.
"Mexican goes to hell, and therefore I became a reporter," he said.
To midnight on Friday, when the last issue was finished, the editors of Riodoce have been on the citizen shift before the office and shoot birds as they started to spend all their phones at once.
A number of shoeses with bander rivals and security forces near the Badepart Mazatlan had left 19 dead.
The war continued to scalled how it was promised by a number of cards in the region.
From the borderstone site, they published the news on the Riodoce website via phone.
The title page had to be changed on the next day.
Sirenen shouted near - another shoes in the area.
Bojorquez was a look at the police who took the watch to see whether they were ready.
If they were afraid, they didn't show it.
Under the aggressive portrait of the resident of the newspaper, which was visible for the entire Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed their shoes.
"When you can just stop thinking about," said Bojorquez, "when on the same day, when Javier was murdered, the practitioner asked me to send her to report on the road."
Dinosaurier used to avoid his enemies
At the first sight it looks like a statue, even a horrible.
Scientists have now found that the first knowledge of the unbelieving Nashorn of a Canadian mountain worker were so well received that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurier".
It was so good that they could even find that his sweet skin was of romantic brain - and they said they had something from a "inflicted past".
The report in the magazine "Current Biology" was called "the most enhanced dinosaur that has ever been found, and one of the best dinosaurary exemplaries of the world".
The fosil is a newly discovered type of nodosaurier who lived in the middle of the circle period from 110 million to 112 million years ago.
His incredibly good-received state has researchers who describe it as "really remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the worst plant fresh is the best received fossil of its type.
It was found by Shawn Funk on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray, north of Alberta, Canada.
He met something that seemed unlike the stone around, and decided to look out more accurate.
The Fossil found by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleonology.
They carried out the next six years to cover the wild animal within 2,500 kg (1,100 kg) serious earthquakes.
After all this hard work, the final result is now ready to be enthusiasmed.
"If you're just a little blind with the eyes, you might almost believe it's sleeping," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist of the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to see.
"It will be in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and the best dinosaurier exhibition - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosauriers."
Researchers have found that this plant fresh, although it is captured with a refrigeration and a walking panzer, probably was threatened by fresh dinosaurers.
The strongly painted dinosaurers used a red and white design to hide before shooting, and used a switch technology that is known as an opposite assessment, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would make it possible to mix in its environment and to avoid his enemies, tell experts what is clear that it was threatened by larger dinosaurers.
The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier has made the first sleeves in May and is now viewed at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeonology.
Scientists have now studied the wild animal and called the Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of the teams who carried out over 7.000 hours to carefully discover it.
The surprising conservation of the example allowed Dr. Mitchell and a international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of shoes and shoes on his body.
They discover the container estimation, a broad defence method in the animals, which means that the pitches of creature were darker than their subpage.
Although container estimation is common, the results are surprising, since the size of Borealopelta is overwhelming in the present lived animals.
It indicates that the dinosaurs of sufficient pressure had been struck by a fresh dinosaurier that evolution benefited the interpretation of the confrontation as means of survival.
But most of the temporary animals, which use the container estimation - think of ships, Zebras or grains - are much smaller and more tragic than beasts, which reports that this nodosaurier was a real fight to survive.
"Starkes raubier behaviour on a massive, strongly enhanced dinosaurier shows how dangerous the dinosaurier raubers of the round time have been", said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic connections in its scale also shows that the skin of the dinosaurer was root.
Scientists continue to investigate the animal's instructions on his life, including his conservated Darmine content, to find out what it has eated as his last food time.
They believe that the dinosaurer, when he died, was slaughtered into a river and was shocked out to the sea where he put down to the back of the sea.
At that time, Alberta was so warm as Southern Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably have much more landier than they are today.
"This nodosaurier is really noted because it is completely captured with sweet skin, but also remains in three sizes and remains in the original form of the animal", said Brown.
"The result is that the animal is almost like today as in the early round time.
You don't need to use a lot of phantasie to rebuild it. If you just shoot a little with the eyes, you might almost believe he's at sleep."
The round time was a time, as a huge theropod, milk-free dinosaurers, who stood on two legs, the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the painted dinosauries was struck by some of his horrible previouss.
This belongs to the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tons of serious monster.
Scientists, whose recent knowledge appears in the Scientific Biology Journal, believe that Borealopelta was passed after death in the sea and has been mutatised in the slam.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray, north of Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the world's most sweet dinosaurier, including skin and skin, and is complete from the sweet to the midst.
The creatures were averagely 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3.000 pounds (1.300 kg).
It took two 20-third-shirt spots that were shocked by his shooter.
The researchers believe that the worst plant fleet was shocked through the Western Canada until a overflowd river flowed it into the open sea.
But the underwater depositment of the dinosaurier preserved his location in exquisite details.
The hidden rests of this special examples are so well obtained that the other Hs still check up hot panzer plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of maintenance is as 'silky as a win in Lotto.
The more I see it, the more confusing it will be.
Hidden rests of the skin still cover the hot panzer plates that take the shoes of the animal.
His right front floor is on his side, his five fingers are split up.
I can count the shoes on his soil.
In weather: Mass carboat on A8: Many of lost
Heavy accident on Sunday on the A8: Only 30 vehicles have been converted into a mass carboat.
There are numerous losses, miles long stairs and gaffers.
On the train Stuttgart Munichs (A8) late Thursday at a mass carboat, about 20 people were injured.
After the first information of the police, there were 30 vehicles between the Adelzhauses and Odelzhausen stations (Landkreis Aichach-Friedberg) during a swimming swimming car, including the most likely last car.
On the precise number of losses did not initially provide any information.
It's about light to a medium-spot injuries, said a police speaker.
A great departure of relief vehicles was at the accident site.
The A8 was completely locked in the direction of Munchen.
In bicycle, Munich was a ten kilometers long back.
As reported by a AZ reporter, there were also massive disorders on the rail trains, through numerous donations.
The firewear noted the signs of the vehicle lockers which now have to be recalled with remarkable punishment.
Shortly after 18:45 p.m. there was another second accident on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
It was a collision between a car carrier and a Pkw.
A rescue slaughter was on the way to the accident site.
German Bahn: Conzern tests "Comfort Check-in"
It's a moment that almost everybody has experienced once: nothing of course you're sit on the train and sleeping.
Or you're deep in your work and have just a generous thought.
And then, pufff.
Come to the shooter and switch a switch or spend the passenger from the medium flow.
Card control.
But the time of interruptions is soon over.
The German Railway is currently testing the uncreased drive card control.
Simply confirmed by phone that you take your place and evaluate the driving cards.
Currently, a test operating runs on two lines.
"If you get the offer, we're going out of it.
It will be expected that the next year will be available to many further television trails in Germany," said a Bahn speaker.
"Comfort Check-in" the train calls the drive card evaluation without schedule.
However, to be able to use these, some conditions must be fulfilled: you need a smartphone or tablet.
And you got to have booked a online kit - what's going on, no matter, most of the passengers.
You must also have purchased the DB Navigator's app, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking.
And finally you need a seat reservation.
Because the "Comfort Check-in" works like this: you're growing on the train, calling your drive cards under "My tickets".
When testing appears, a button for electronic detection appears.
The adjacents receive a message on their mobile devices that the X passenger is on the train and has taken the booked Y seat.
When the adjacent comes to the drive card control at the Y place, he knows that there is a passenger with already equipped online ticket.
So you can sleep, work, go slow.
The "Check-in" has two advantages: one for the customers, one for the train - what to use the passenger again.
"Whoever wants to travel without ticket control through our adjoint personal, simply checks in the DB Navigator.
This allows the passengers to build their travel time on the train more personally", says Michael Peterson, Marketing Chamber of DB TV.
Second Plus: "and our employees have more time than today to go to the individual customer needs."
Who often runs the train knows that, next to passing and passing trains, the drive card controls are among the largest firms.
Because often you have yourself, but one of the partners does not need any documentation that you need to deal with online tests.
Or the credit card or the personal reference or otherwise is missing a document to be presented.
The results are unfinished discussions between passengers and passengers, which leads to bad stimulation in the section or large space and delays in the control of the own ticket and takes time to care for other concerns.
Not only a small number of test students can use the new service.
And it's just on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund Statgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart Essen.
Additional train numbers on the same road are not still free.
How a activer came to learn the answer to the question: "Why streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Britishtany Ferrell was assaulted to its nuclear.
Only one day after she arrived in New York City, the St. Louis Geborene was on the bed of an airbnb idea which she shooted and scrolled by Facebook on her phone.
She helped a post of someone from the High School.
"The police just killed a 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," he said there.
It is convinced that nobody else posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah has been constantly stored on its Timeline.
The rapper from St. Louis's area was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black boy who was killed by a white police in Ferguson, Mo., to tweet.
He posted a picture of browns leblon body that was thrown on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"It's a wild one," Ferrell thought with himself.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She left her phone later on Tuesday night on the Canfield drive.
There were photos from the police group and people shouting, and by a man who said to be the father of Brown, who found a shield with the record: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She observed a Live feed where a police was before a group of demonstrates with a beautiful dog.
In another video, she said, "I'll kill you all animals."
"This is not ordinary," Ferrell remembered.
"This is not the type of murder we've buried and typically called."
In this moment, I felt a shoot frost.
I was angry and angry."
She bought a return and went home on the next day.
After landing at 23 a.m., she took her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning.
What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, the theme of a new documental film, "Whyose Streets?", in the cine from 11.
It is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of humans who live in the Community and have filled the roads to demand answers.
As Ferrell and her daughter, who took a flower clothes and a suitable krone, traveled to Ferguson, the two talked a conversation that she had a number of times before this morning “over the black experience and the black condition”.
"Do you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" she remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that's not right.
I couldn't take her back," Ferrell said later.
"What happened today is a high point of what happened in the past.
She needs to know and see it and to be put there.
It must be well developed, not only activeism and organization, but also the various parts of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we need to do to be free to free ourselves.
Even if I have the luck to give you a experience in which she personally experiences no racism, she is not different than the next black girl.
I feel that I would show her a bad service to keep them away."
The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was at the South Florencia Road, a place against the police authority, which was to a camping area, when the aktivists waited for the possible non-declaration of officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and her daughter were connected to a local business holder that made lunch.
They prepared the cups before and helped them to continue to demonstrate.
Unfortunately, a new type of activity for Ferrell Geestalt began to accept.
"My activity has changed in total after August 9, and she noted that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association, she was focused on food justice and healthy inequality in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It's all done."
Weeks later, Ferrell met a night-demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-registers of the film.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado wanted to "document" what happened.
One question came to Ferrell in the sense: "Do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"
This skepsis was affected by numerous cases of people, often white - in a Community that benefited by their pain and resistance.
As Folayan recently explained in a interview, "We had heard that people who were born and grown in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it different."
Folayan had already worked with Damon Davis, a artist from the area known for his activeism about deathtrainings.
The Ferrell's commitment made the project closer, together with six other homes, followed the team of "Whose Streets"? in the years after Brown's shot.
"This film is not one who speaks for us or speaks with us, we talk", said Davids.
"This was the main thing for me, how these people are being displayed, because I'm going to be presented."
The goal was not to concentrate on Ferrell's experience - to show that it is "not for a Messianic leader, but for a community that comes together", said Folayan - she appeared as the openest participant of the film.
Subsequently, documents of "Whose Streets?" are surprising personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she loves and married her wife.
"I felt like nackt," said Ferrell, and crying when she saw the final product for the first time.
"Af I have understood that it must be a certain injury in this work and in the humanization of black people."
Moreover, Ferrell's history repeats the role of black black women in the largest black-lives-matter movement.
Two of the three reasons of the movement that, after the murder of the black girl Trayvon Martin in 2012, the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media identified themselves as a black.
"Shear, weird women in leadership positions have put the move to the whole", said Ferrell, "and therefore we are struggling on different fronts.
Black, black women must take the main charge of all."
Folayan was true to notify that "the movement of black women and many black women will really be maintained".
However, it is that "that is no claiming type of action" in Ferrell, because of its identity, was chosen as a heart of the film.
"It was the person who taught this energy," she said.
"It's not a accident, although she was at the front, because in a life of these crups as a black, black woman is so much on the game.
You can feel their energy through the screen."
The news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police are still existing.
Ferrell is on board for 21 °2 years because of the blocking of a car at a demonstration.
She describes the social policy atmosphere of the area which she calls her home: "A Chaos".
However, she feels obliged to have this memory since she went to Ferguson three years ago.
"It's our obligation to fight for our freedom.
It's our obligation to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains."
From "Tspace" to "Green Weapons": Debating TV readers about Bit-Galerie
Bit-galerie moves people, although it is not built for a long time.
But the idea of a buying center on the south of the footground zone has been cut off the population since the first presentation of 2009.
Calt doesn't make the theme one.
Also on our Facebook page "Volks friend Bitburg" the topic is discussed.
While the one to the Bit Galerie says: "It would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "It would be really class" (Nicoles), comes from the other side: "No man" (Siggi beds) or very simple: "Grou weapons!" (Lars Scholz).
While the preferenties build that a gallery is more customers in the city, which also benefit the other business, the enemy is afraid that the football zone is cut off.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the baseline where the farming market chain is offering its products in 13 direct markets.
With the beginning of the construction work, it will be concluded.
The gallery machers want to integrate a market chain in the new construction - to beda place with the possibility to be outside.
Simone Room: "We have been buying almost weekly in the farm market hall for many years.
In particular, our eggs, but also the cooks of agriculture women are still very pleased again.
We also found the Metzgeri for us.
We would like to want that during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is an opportunity to receive this offer.
In other cities there are also things.
In particular, the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gard Densing: "In order to settle direct marketers in a market chain in the gallery, the amounts are higher.
The new project should not, however, be low."
Eva Kilic: "What are you buying guests in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugs or supermarkets: I find this overflowing.
There's enough in our city.
You see how many ladders are empty here - some have been for months and years.
However, as there is not even a general weekly market here, it is so important that we have at least the market chain.
Because the products offered there are fresh, most of them are offered directly from the producer and obndrein is valued.
As you see, loading business in a shopping centre will be used only by larger companies, because the loans often are not traceable for a individual shopping.
Injury, special business is not almost anymore and what's the rest of it, then it's probably going to disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A buying center with a market chain does not pass together for me.
And the galerie doesn't go to Bitburg.
In particular, where is the farming market chain during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even on the duration, if the Bit Galerie comes at any time.
Or does the spend Bit-Galerie already make it possible to leave all business from Bitburg?"
George Marquet: "This will not work.
And a shoot-center that's empty, no one needs.
I think it would be better to promote a right farm market instead of this gallery.
But for a farmer market hall, there were no more places thanks to the huge many - as I find - uncomfortable construction projects in Bitburg.
If the farming market chain is defeated, a part of the culture will disappear."
A suitable identity: Artists create portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA
In the midst of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces have to see - white, black and blue, which are almost unreasonable - swimming on cables from the deck.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from wanges and hair cuts which were sent by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the exemptions from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former Secret Service Analyticin was a 35-year-old prison penalty after she made it publicly a secret diplomatic report on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Becoming Resemblence (a suitable identity).
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline has joined its technological competence, computer science and art, and Maning, a transfrau and dismissing dissident whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of the DNA that was extracted by Maning and created from the 30 ports, how someone could look with these genome data, if even some intellectual comments are not only to the formability of DNA data - the many ways how they can interpretate and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to create an identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but since her puberty has been openly condemned as a woman, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 appeals, including six infringements against the Spionage Law, Computer Drugs and Skill.
With the prison, her image was understood, so much that there was only one photo - a king, black-wheat sefie, in which Maning seems to be sit on a bike site and a platinblonk pene - with which it was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was just due to the great success of its 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
The artists produced the ports of foreign artists from foreign factors such as cigarette smoke and cooking by extracting the DNA from the distance to produce a picture of how these people could look.
That's the time she received an e-mail from a newspaper machine.
"They conducted a interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted to join this article," said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit and couldn't be photod, so she took contact with Chelsea and asked if she wanted to make a DNA port.
The artists and their arrested museums were to be incomparable letter friends who exchanged several letters during two years.
They even created a comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which predicted a future in which President Chelseas would turn to judgment and would be able to see the exhibition.
That Obama was actually only a few days after the publication of the book, Manings release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome type of meetings.
There is also something deep and starkes in the opening of the exhibition, since Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government and against transgender trails to find new, two-two-wide ways to shoot the stars he should actually do.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the strange Timing of all these things, she said, "It's a certain reason to happen."
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, the maning requested to include its overwhelming sign (the "i" in their family names is seen with a heart) a end of the "automatic distraction which has been based on gender, race, sex and culture."
On the opposite wall, its mitocondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet feet of Cs and Gs and As, is written in Blelist.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the high-developed scientific lexicon of the artists) as amazingly similar, at least in biological perspective, we are all.
"What people will be taken about it is that our gene is not careful about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video generation of 2007, Spurious memorys, is also to see.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so 30 of these stories."
The latest part in the exhibition that is stored in a own room is a page of the Comic News mentioned above.
It shows Maning how they look like King-Conng with a free telephone in the hand from the US disciplinary architects.
"If they cold your speech, they won," it says.
"Don't ever hold the mouth."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," the artist who grew from Philadelphia.
"I'm still getting ghost when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition - as it was predicted in the Comic book - but if it should do it, then it will be welcomed in the midst of the masks, by its own genome simulations, which are assembled as horses of protesting.
This was also targeted, as everything in the exhibition, until the size (5 " 2, Manings Statur), in which their genetic haplo groups were written with bleistift.
"In the past I had her on the wall, but I wanted her to feel like a majority of people," said Dewey-Hagborg from the port.
"I wanted to feel like a mass movement that formed himself with Chelsea, such as the movement, which also stood after their release."
Professor of Northwestern University and an Oxford university employee for murder
A country-wide human year is in the gang of a professor at the North Western University and an employee of Oxford University, which is searched for suspects after a man in a luxury apartment in Chicago with murderal injuries.
On Monday, for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) prison commands for murder because of their worthy participation in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as shown by the Office of Cookie Board.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stories.
A Community warning system published by the police authority of Chicago states that the body was discovered on 27 July.
The officers received a call, came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several infringements in his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared on the place of the event, and detectives investigate the stories as a murder, while the police is looking for the two suspects.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor for microbiology and immunology at the Northwest University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President for university Relations, said in an email statement that Lathem is now enabled and was excluded by the participation of the Campus of North Western University.
"This is now a criminal matter which is investigated by the competent authorities, and the North Western University cooperates with this investigation", said Cubbage.
Warren is the senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford.
A speaker of the University and the Solarville College said in an e-mail explaining that "What the police is ready to contact and help the US Emirates authorities in every way. "
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wants to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said he requested the suspects to put up the authorities.
"The police has a view of their residence place, and our efforts to localize them, strengthening themselves," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help the suspects.
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the large-plaza building manager who had just received a strict tip that accused that something happened in the apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as a very graus.
Guglielmi said that it was unexpected whether the incident also occurred on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.
The Grand Plaza Management Team issued a statement to the inhabitants: "The police is currently working at the time and the background of the victim and investigates a variety of reasons, including a possible cause."
The Russian Vice-Premier Mutko will be finished in close future.
The Russian Vice-Premier Vitaly Mutko said it will not be long-term until the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the reconstruction of the Russian anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) will be implemented.
"In a certain stage of compliance with the criteria of the driving plan, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA facility was updated in this regard," Mutko explained on Thursday.
The PM commented the second part of the WADA driving plan to comply with the code described by the criteria for re-integration of RUSADA and recently published on the website of the organization.
According to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could be concerned about Russia.
"All have been announced, everything is implemented.
And the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in close future," he added.
However, one of the criteria referred to in the list states that Russian antidoping officials must accept publicly the results reported by WADA's approval investigation by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren.
With regard to the matter, Mutko said: "We conduct the investigation because our antidoping system has made a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there was no State programmes, and we will not admit anything that is not existing."
Many words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the independent Russian anti-Doping Commission.
In conversation with the Russian Seller RS at the beginning of the day, Smirnov gave Smirnov problems of the past in Russian antidoping organizations, and then added: "We have repeated that the report contains strict positions and rules.
Nobody intends to accept this report without condiction," added Smirnov.
RUSADA was excluded in November 2015 by the WADA’s Doping Scanda by the implementation of Doping Controls in Russia.
However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit from the Headquarter of the Organization in Moscow in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli explained that RUSADA moves "in the right direction" to be re-used.
Aldi sales first no eggs no more
This shared the company groups.
It is a pure precaution measure that cannot continue from any health infringement, said in the Communication.
From immediately, only eggs should be delivered to aldi, which are obviously negative to fipronil-halting anti-lampen.
Aldi wants to make clearness and transparency with his customers.
The startups that will be helped by your company do not become the next Uber
Amy Erbett wanted to measure the luck with your employees with your e-commerce-state-up, but the surveys did not work.
The answers were often slow, little helpful or worse.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers do not believe the process.
"There was never a consciousness and objectivity", said Errett, who is employed by the 75-Person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed.
She called people from outside to help.
A new race of the Human Resources Startup is at the guard to help companies find out how to feel their employees.
The establishment and license of software, which has the specific purpose of measuring the employer's commitment, allows it to undertake surveys to address specific groups and demographic groups, to provide workers' anonymity and complaint hotlines, and, in some cases, allow Whistleblowers to implement the C Suite Guide Forces and apply directly to the Governing Council.
"He has now tools like Strava and Fitbit for the persecution of their health, but where is the fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, Co-funder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools is used to measure employees' commitment.
Erratt said they're a better view of what your employees think and feel in the three years with dent.
In addition to the Snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company that shows a view of which units have the majority of complaints and which leadership forces show low approval results - so that you can add to reasons.
enterprises come to see that there is a need to remain in the pitches of the workplace culture so that you do not be the next published in Scandale since a former employee has published a blog post that describes a area of reliefs in which those who have spoken were punished.
For start-ups such as Glint, this wish is a lucrative business possibility after a overview.
Global government, regulation and compliance framework 2020 could have more than $118.7 billion, following the financial site Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and recognise bad behavior, saw an increased interest and activity in the beginning of this year in a missing credit.
Convercent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has registered as a customer recently.
As Glint, Convercent companies can send cuts "pouls-" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time and see the warm cards of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that can be reported with the employee's bad behavior.
And if the principal business manager is involved, the complaint is going directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The Court of Public Opinion has taken the regulators", said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and business leader of Convercent.
If a company is found to be treated badly or untrusted by its employees, it may experience cost-related consequences through consumers' boycott, employees' functionation and cash, said Quinlan.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant kit with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and procedures and have a simple opportunity to reach their business centres.
Previously, when a contractor wanted to report a problem, he had to find a phone number or email for the company centres, reach a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.
It was often a defense and unreasonable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Council, who said there was no good opportunity to follow the complaints of employees.
Now, since the company convercents can be hidden, problems that were before the leadership forces in offices in cities or states, such as discrimination, distortion or unlawful practices, are identified and addressed.
"I can get closer to this universal, 360-grad style in the experience of employment," said Vitrano, who guides the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday.
"and we protect our shareholders from employment-related law."
Employees began to take more seriously the Ethic, values and employer's commitment in 2002, after the booking company Arthur Andersen joined the Ethics by the Enron Scandal, said Quinlan.
But it was long until the "social media arrived to their right," that companies recognized that you couldn't prevent their smooth shoes online.
"For the use of technology to monitor the ethics, people used hope as a strategy", he said.
Both Members and Convercents offer your software as a service service, and the companies with recursive costs for the use of their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of Venture Capital investments that have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in the financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with a total of $47 million.
Glitzern secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its entire funding to $60 million.
These investments are not surprising in view of the connected nature of enterprises, culture and Venture Capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees are expected more than ever.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high deals and interesting projects are only income.
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and estimated and that you give your time a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company, they feel that they hear their voice, and that the work you do is reward, then they feel stronger to make this company successfully", said Nina McQueen, Vice-President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which also uses Convercent and Lent.
Investmenters are reached when their portfolio enterprises work well. Companies are good when employees are used and engaged.
If the analytics tools promises third parties to increase commitment and use of employees, it is not wonderful that you find support.
The data on the employer's commitment according to the experts of the workplace culture is important.
But data are unnecessary if the managers of a company do not take action.
In fact, if a employee asked after your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if the change isn't coming enough, or even not, it can swim and demotize these disappointments.
"If you ask 4.000 suggestions, you must be willing to have 4.000 meetings," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen the company who have left the collection of data too much.
"If you don't follow the employees, you really heard me?
Do you mind this?
And who do you not care for this, why should I? "
Madison Reed, who now carried out monthly employees' investigations, was able to conduct measures on the same day when a problem about dent was reported, so Erret.
And after the collection of feedbacks of frustrated employees, the decision-making and the quality of communication had been able to reorganize several teams within the company and to add a communication education to address the problems.
In Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new views on the employees, and it hopes, on a long view, that leads to a better dedication of employees in a sector that is known for higher contracts.
"If you are not able to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you'll lose business.
The NCAA removes the two-day plans and makes a long day for the bruin
It is at 23 hours when a lot of UCLA football players are held on a side of the new team's work camp on the campus.
Some have taken their Tricoto parts and showed the back of the first day of the training store.
For a good part of the team, these inactive minutes make a breakfast.
Players who have been registered to the summer course will return to their final tests before they return to the Football Center on the next morning at 6:30 p.m.
"This is a real swimming mood for the kids next three days," said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora shortly before Monday was taken.
The NCAA eliminates two-day operations to facilitate the last of the players, and has actually extended their days - at least to the end of the Friday.
So the first three training of the UCLA should start at 19:15 to justify the already packed timeplans of the players.
The compromise is away from the two days more than one day in which the bruins moved to the start of the camp almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six playtimes in Westwood.
You should stop during August 18 practices. 20 before starting the formal game preparations for their attack against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said he supported the NCAA rule change, even if they add to the multi-employed routes of the player a further point.
"We put this huge burden on them three or four days, and it's very difficult," said Mora.
"And when they just pressed it, they're still talking, they're good people.
I think when we come to Saturday and we have more time, it's really great."
The UCLA will finish its practices when the camp is finished, as regards the clear view lines of its fields from a crossing park and the limited Luskin Center, a hotel of the highed class that has already been covered with footballs, which will not be a light job.
Bruins players should stop the hotel from this weekend, but Mora found that it could give a problem when these rooms are free during the season.
"We will set our security", said Mora.
"It's a real problem, and it's not very difficult to think that people have a room there and then set up there to store a practice.
If you have the video band from a practice, it's a very good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on the park 8.
We'll do the best with what we have.
I'm not too worried about it.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify facts oversight in fight against false messages
Facebook wants to send more potential items with false reports to fact checkers of third parties and then show their results under the original amount, said the world's largest online social network on Thursday. It is one of his efforts to fight fake news.
The company said in an opinion on his website that it will start with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible false notifications and to send them to verifying facts that may be shown by the original article.
Facebook was criticized as one of the main fake news points for this name, which many believe that they have also influenced the US Presidency election 2016.
The problem has also become a major political theme in Europe, while the French electioners were overwhelmed in the preceding of the presidential election in May with false historys, and Germany supports a plan to be punished after social media networks if they are not achieved, fully completed postings as before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement to German that in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new verification of facts.
"Besides the knowledge of the storys of facts checkers three parties, people want more context to take founded decisions on what they read and share," said Sara Su, the product manager for Facebook messages in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its features on the "in connection" items and work on other changes in his news feed to reduce wrong messages.
Create a Comic Roman: a close in the history of England
In his recent past, the small Scotney Castle was to see in a squeeze music video and was a squeeze for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his gentle seat in the Bewl River Tal in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic Roman of Jamie Rhodes, a mofaar of Yorkshireman with a favorite for historical documents.
"I think it's so nice to look at the document of someone who is dead for 300 years," he says.
"What for a personal relationship to keep this letter into my hand."
'A Castle in England' s upsets the time from the Middle Age to Edward's time and documents the families living in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another, coming British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on a archive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpected emotionally.
"I've only reacted to the print on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobians," he says.
"It's his thumb!
And the letters are always smiling after smoking, for then a fire was burned because of the light.
For a person who lives 300 years later, the skin has an effect as it would be.
Oh, I love Archive!"
For someone who has been buried so with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Art Council of England and almost four months lived in a closed "On to be honest: I have a little overlooked my welcome" seems to be nice to be true.
Rhodos passed his days to study the victorian "new" close, to look at the archive and to study the many shadows and curiositys of the slopes, such as the mounted hyene heads on the walls and flanks that had carried out in the grain for centuries.
He walked through the landscape and the ruins of the old bourgeo and spoke to landmarks, farmers, and sometimes also with the artists who worked at the illustrations of his book.
Then, the night he started "Whiskey and started to write."
The intime history of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust received the full access of 2006 when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes came in a decade later, the employees just started to care for the archive that he was "high of years in which the aristocrates said "Oh, shoot it on the ground".
Daybooks, letters from the time of the English Empire, cards that show that who had anything said, "I could say that land conflicts would be slow," Rhodes says, "but there was a birk to fight the two families.
You guys, let everything go to his gang!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the barg as a start point to reach the English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who allows the newly built barg to connect to the farmer' 1381.
"There is a registration of a 1380-year-old in this book with the title 'Knightly Familys of Kent and Sussex'," Rhodes says.
"The farmer's resurrection began in this area and I thought a stand is a good start.
Maybe the two are connected?"
Other stories are shocked in the history of the slopes - such as 'The Priest', who tells the history of Jesuiten Paters, who hid the Darrell family for seven years during the English reform.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the Smuggler Arthur Darrell was shown from the 18th century, is instant to his own assembly by filling a snake with stones (a discovery that was made first years later when his snake was slaughtered).
The Darrells are the Rhodes' Love Family of Scotney: "The ladies seemed to be very guests, always make up their debts and earn money for things they couldn't lend themselves.
Other generations of Darrell men resolved their debt crisis by marrying rich old women - I put them into me as a bunch of good-specific kids, with a talent to shoot them."
After the end of his use in the closure, Rhodes is on the search for other unique write surveys
He has left a two-week residence in the Finnish wilderness for a Comic Roman on lifemaquek, the end of a Sanatorium from the early 20th century, which was re-educated from nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was worried to go back," he said.
It was like, "Ah, now I have to be done again with the sweet life."
Campagne started: Over 300 years of old Marien capelle in Rāndorf
With the celebration of the 301 years of old Marien capelle in Rāndorf, the town of Bad Honnef started its campaign on Friday to introduce a new showmark (Finnish day).
On Wednesday until Thursday, Master Otto Neuhoff and his Marketing Team on Nelson Artz will be secreted with the logo and slogan.
Finally, at the end of August, it should be given a festivity on the island of Grafenwerth.
"It's nice for us.
Or?", the machines of the action have been asked since yesterday on the places on the shift capelle.
"We don't really think it" they write on their last free website.
"or we use this measure to win your attention.
And to make clear that some are better than it seems.
We are based on the vast conviction that we know as Bad Honnefer citizens about the beauty and attractiveness of our city very well."
In the action it goes over more than "only" a logo and a slogan, it means continue.
"It is applicable to formulate a single promise, one that presents an unchangeable single setting character."
Finally, they are in competition with other communities.
A mid-five-five amount of the city Bad Honnef can cost its new shopmarks and campaigns.
Army Reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear against the army
Every year, in Ankara, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) stays on pensions and transports in the officer.
Like this week.
At first, a normal process.
But nothing is rutin with the Turkish forces a year after the shooting.
The meeting was no longer held in the building of the general table as previous, but at the Department of Ministers.
At the debates, the five Vice-Presidents, as well as the Ministers for Defence, Internal, Justice and External Affairs, were now involved.
In this way, civilians in YAS were overwhelming.
The government is in the military.
General head of Hulusi Akar remains in the office, but the commanders of the soldiers, the air forces and the sea were stopped.
Since the deceased Coup, Head of State 169 of 326 generics and admiryles has been shocked.
More than 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the army series - mostly because of pleasant connections to move the Exil preacher Fethullah Gülen, the Erdogan is a droughter of the powder.
Contrary to 486 persons who should have been involved directly in the swimming pool is negotiated since this week in Ankara.
Soon the day after the Putsch, Erdogan had called the survey as "Gott's gift", since he gave him the opportunity to purify the forces to "completely purify".
But did Erdogan really have the army in the griff?
Finally, in February, the newspaper "Christship" published a article with the title "Inconsistent in the Headquarter of Military".
In the general table, it was concerned by a growing "islamization" of the army, which, among others, manifested in the restraint of the head-to-use ban for soldiers.
The large clean machines in the army and the security forces are in any case.
In the midst of July Erdogan fired further 7395 state servants, including 2303 police and 546 soldiers.
It seems like Erdogan had kissed the military.
The generals were older than the real rulers of the country.
Three times they put their role as guards of the world State.
After his election 2002, Erdogan returned the power of the military step to step, not lastly under profession of the reform requirements of the European Union.
Ancient officer says that Erdogan's goal is towards Islamicization of the forces.
In the Magazine "Vocal Europe" an unnotic officer who was looking for fear of persecution in the island of the Asile, the Turkeyn army will be "complete extremists and salafists" in a few years.
If this is the case, such development could not make Nato cold.
There is no doubt in the Alliance after the pursuits of the Turkish army.
The leadership structures and operational capacity are "fatal", says Nato diplomates.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
It will be given a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
He expects to spend the legal immigrants a year, more strict rules for the arriving of Visa for a timely work permit and restrictions for family-oriented visa.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft legislation shall be discussed in the two chambers of the Conference.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase losses and currency billions of dollars for tax payers, and this will be done by the United States to change the way as citizens from other countries of Green Cards will be issued."
The law will prevent the Ketten migration and replace the current system.
This new demand process will be welcomed to the candidates, speaking English, which have the financial resources to support themselves and to show knowledge that will come to our economy", said Trump, quoted by the American media.
The Ministry wants to cure strikes for renal steel
Once again, in the last few months, the future of the retail increase has been struggled - now it must go very quickly.
Before the end of the year, it is intended to be built on the marine road where the tourist trains run.
In order to ensure the future of the relief increase, the Ministry of Transport has to start on the road in this year, according to the details of the Ministry of Transport.
"If the decision to continue to order and cure the roads of Ilmenau-Renneau, the country is condemned to this mainly important connection for tourism," said the secretariat Klaus Squill on Friday.
The costs for the establishment of roads were around 2,5 million euros.
From this amount the country exceeded 75%.
The contract that the Shuttle is intended to be appointed in the future will now be finally voted to be declared.
The Ministry and the South Thrown Railway as a operator are already agreed on the technical details.
"They are the driving plan which are negotiated by vehicles used and the quality standards", said Sweet.
The planned Treaty between the Ministry and the Rail society will be concluded for a period of 11 years.
In this way, the retaining shuttle was regularly ordered on December 2017.
The Rennsteig Shuttle is a specially popular train connection between the lift of Ilmenau and Rensteig.
In the past months, on the train of a pilot operation, it was tested whether the trails of sufficient many people are used to re-regulate them in future.
The route is also strongly built in parts.
The rising of sex robots is real, and we should be worried about
As you thought that 2017 could not be disappointed, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robbers comes.
Yeah, actually.
Sex robots are now a great thing.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emerging professor for robotics and artificial intellectuality at the Sheffield university, we have to begin to take serious attention.
Customers can choose the eyes color of the robot, its shape of the brown and the type of finger nagel.
"Those are pleasing about them, but the companies give each amount of it, and we will get them much more often," said Mr. Sharkey at the publication of his new reports.
Modern sex pups have developed robotic partners with a silicon hair that feels warm - with conscious human reactions reached by the artistic intelligence.
The user can also "accepte" in accordance with his convictions and choose everything from the sight color of the robbery through the form of the brushwars to the type or color of his finger neck.
But it will be more worried, since many robots have the "persistence" that would make a stepford-friendy progressive view.
Modern sex pups have developed to robots with a silicone hair.
The realBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they are properly found, such as shockness.
And then there are still the Roxxy Gold Sex robots developed by True Companion with planned personalities such as "Frigid Farrah", which indicates the impression of smoothness and "Wild Wendy" with a "abnormal" personality.
"Roxxy gold has a personality that is so adapted to your personality as well as possible", warms the website of True Company.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has their smiling during the day, as well as real people!
She can be sweet to be fixed on controversial or may be "in smiling"!"
There are many incredible aspects in this increase of sex robbers - not tolerated because they replace real human relationships - but the subconsistent women's qualities, the reactions on the drought when you go on a step on the frozen (his here: opposing) Farrah is a threat to most of them.
On his website, True Companion Roxxy with a Vibrator, but for men.
"When women (sic) can have a Vibrator, why can men have no Roxxxy?" says on the website.
However, these sex robbers are not only a fetic or hold only a other sex game.
Their expansion and growing rationality shows to something dark and deep in our culture, to a decline from the ideal equality of the sex to a desire by sex with subvention as optional assignment.
Most men, of course, will not keep sex robbers, and while the FRR notes their growing popularity, they remain provisional at the border of the consumption.
But what goes out of the border zones, it can be very less about the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or political until the free market has the permission of them here.
There is some overwhelming that these high-developed sex robbers are at a time when women's rights are threatened to the worldwide, where there is a president in the white house who agreed to have sexually attacked women.
The most thrilling aspect of the TV series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Magd') are not the graphic images, the disappeared body and the cut eyes, but the realistic effect of this vision.
The Republic of Gilead is a spring, but now it does not feel like a great speech.
The goal behind these sex robbers is to create a physical identity to women realisticly as well as technically (if also with pornostar proportions).
Your producers want to feel humanly that they follow the movement of a real body.
But, on the point when it's about their "persons", robots do not represent real women.
You can't separate from their companions or simply leave.
You have no communication or a background history, nothing that shows independence or anything that could cause the phantasie of total undertaking.
Otherwise expressed: You are abused slaves.
Or to express it in the proof of 2017: Service Managers
Trumps' great performance?
He makes Middle Romney involvement of the healthy human mind
It has become a bi-consciousness of the Trump era that the political discrepancies that have polarised the United States' election have also divided families in a small format.
In the U.S. newspapers, on Christmas and Christmas, there were advice about how to do with the horror of trumpe.
We're all striking in order to put our filters on.
Recently noted is the power of Trumps to bring families together.
I win this because my cousin, a left-building dininger who lives in Chicago and works with the Republicns in our family, has visited me this week in New York.
She recalled me that the unity may have a powerful effect against a common enemy.
With the Trump in the white house, everyone she knows, including the Republicn ' s association with whom she had struggled for decades because of the policy, is suddenly and absolutely on the same side.
It is certainly a good thing to be in the stage, but it is in a further connection that this also brings significant risks to me.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the decisive effect of his presidency has the power to switch us all right.
If we speak of "normalization" and Trump, we're talking about the great possibility that his weaknesses will not be cut off any day.
However, there is a more horrible long-term scenario in the Trump Republican of the Right Flight "normalized" which seems to be slowly in comparison with its standards than the inclusion of punishment.
I find me today from an active nostalgia for the Middle Romney's urcomic version of the crazy - the dog on the autodach, which 14% income tax (and at least we knew how it declared) - both in comparison with Trump in fact a very mild penalty.
If Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicns must only be spiritually healthy in order to qualify themselves as an inadequate improvement.
When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carussell in Central Park, the greatest of the Carussels of the New York Park Department, and the best $3 that you can earn in the city if you don't need coffee.
The horses are very large, the Fiberlas designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are narrow and the animals turn up to view full fear of their own shoes - the extremely dark and the climing music makes this awesome.
So many clergy of a city are desperate: the views of high buildings will be old to be trusted by the Skylines to offer a lot of encouraging, and the reality of the city will not justify the dream.
Fifty-third years later, and I'm still not going over the whole day when I found that Swiss cottage is not Swiss cottage - the theme Poub Ye old Swiss cottage does not contain - but a large circulation in North London.
However, the Central Park-Carussel is still a strange magic experience, since there can be two years of age, 11 years and two women in the 40s and all have a great time.
If I could evaluate the carussell, I would give him the full number, but for luck no one asked for it.
On the other hand, in this week I was forced to evaluate my "exploration" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could take my credit cards.
In the coffee house at the edge of my road, it is the same option to compare the evaluation with a 15% drink payment - this is to buy something over the loading table.
This leads not only to a delay of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also requires pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where it is not necessary.
The poor woman in the buyer house was sweet, while I sweared to experience her to rich my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius with breast pain from prison in the hospital
Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit second time.
Last year, he was put to the hospital because of the treatment of snippets to his handgels, which he has suffered from the prison authorities after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was sentenced for murder after a appeal of the State lawyer against a first murder.
He killed the Steel camp in the early morning hours of 2013, shooting them several times through a gate of the toilets in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius said that he had his friends for a night-in-law that hid himself in the kitchen.
State lawyers have announced their intention to present up the six-year-old prison penalty of Pistorius Appell, from which they say they are too careful.
The National Criminal Training Authority stated that it would be entitled to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and that it could be heard in this year.
Pistorius is dangerous that his punishment will be increased by 15 years when the lawyers are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Bauer Arnold finds a wonderful egg
As the last of the flowerer schools, the fourth classists were left in the holidays and in the leading schools.
Three of the department students are coming to the gymnasium, four to the real school.
Leader Angelica Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Biesental City in Epfenhofes at the service.
The 29 students of the four classes under the leadership of Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder chose a young adler who rises at the Headquarters, but then will be released to freedom.
To this end, the munteer sharp introduced a musical with the title "The Adler in the Heatinghof".
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg, and left it out of his dogs.
Instead of a kitchen, a small adler came out.
But the hope to make a dog from him was destroyed, the Adler wided his fleeves on a high mountain.
Then, the three and four classes showed a hair dance in the study of Yvonne Frank.
The kids danced with the young gockles, the cylinders, for the weight.
The adler was for the integration, said school leader Angelica Sitte.
The juvenile is different than the other youths, however, listened to it.
But he will never be like a dog.
His determination is to be free.
She wanted every fourth class that he feeled accepted in his new school.
It follows thanks to the colleagues, the former school leader Michael Müller, who always returned to schools, and parents.
The kitchen is now over, the class teacher Sophia Schumacher explained.
She left their students after two years of teaching only very unreasonable, because it was a really good time.
Finally, she was able to leave to the four-class clubs.
To the end, all students made a song of summer time and holiday.
In this way, the children had great joy.
For the new school year, eight first classs have already been registered.

Software Updates for Cell Factory: What the interested ones now need to know
How exactly does the software update find?
Should the such farmers take part in the action?
The most important questions and answers in the overview.
In these tables BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Concern software updates have offered around 5,3 million cars.
They should improve the consumption of the emissions of the Euro5 cars and, in part, improve the euro 6.
Euro-4-thesels or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe offers reviews:
Is the new action binding?
No, the dealed software updates are voluntary.
"The obliged updates are only applicable for vehicles that have smell software", says Anja Smetanin.
The motor vehicle (KBA) has ordered their equipment.
How and when will clients be informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced an immediate implementation in the next months, but not yet called a precise date.
Daimler has reported to write every interested person.
If there is no inspection, it will be completed in their framework.
How long should the surroundings be in total?
"What to say," means Smetanin.
The degree of the commitment of the manufacturers and the political pressure.
"When we have seen, the car manufacturers will not act on the environment until now."
How long should the update continue?
The installation itself could only take three to four hours in the workplace.
Time providers may be to get a term.
What do car drivers that do not drive a BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Concert?
The ACE is expected.
Foreign manufacturers would probably follow, so Smetanin.
Does a massive price loss of Euro-4 automobiles now threaten?
The ACE fears it.
But in the regions where the driving bans are threatened.
In the rural room there is no value losses for older celestial.
The ACE is expecting to be sell with a sale.

We make the city living value
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city construction Meister, takes the next year in pension.
The place is already written - however, appropriate applicants are rar.
Since 31 years, Wacker is a city-builder.
And the work still makes him awesome as he shares in the press talk.
He reports about dissuasive, but also demanding tasks that were expected at his followers.
At the same time, he is surprised that no request is satisfied with the request profile.
The city is looking for an architect or engineer for the next time.
In this way, taking into account the regular terms of proclamation, it is still enough for a processing.
Since Haslach functions as a under-building authority for the administrative Community, the applicant must submit appropriate decisions.
Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.
If they are not able to fill this, the citizens should be consulted until Offenburg.
But citizenship is important to the city and it itself, says Wacker, who reports by a good operational climate and a good attitude between the authorities and citizens.
In more than 30 years of office, some significant projects have been gathered on the wakers with pride.
"We make the city a living value," he is safe about the building office and his employees.
But in the future, there are also slow-scale projects on the agenda: the restructuring of the former Hucla Areals and the Netherlands Park are almost shocked.
The thirty-five bridges between Bolenbach and Steinach are renewed, even the stadium ring is still the subject.
Only the last one is shooted with around 1,5 million euros to buche, "if we do right", it estimates Wacker.
"All things wait for good tasks on my followers.
The work here makes it fun."
Sternal to be available for a largest city-building swimming space.
With Haslach's own buildings and gardens can be reacted on many rightly flexibility.
"You can move much," says Wacker, and the creation of the green plants is often mentioned lovingly by citizens and visitors.
Since the old city is Single in the Remember Protection, it is important to "have an eye for what is rejusted", when new buildings are approved, the different city-building master is stressed.
The city's master's high responsibility.
He's Bauherr, "this's over my table.
In care and coordination, he can contain long-year employees: Markus Neumaier (hochbau) has been over ten years, Manfred Schöner (Tifbauer) for 15 years.
Also, that his follower remains long, he wants to say, "We're looking for someone who really identifies and wants to stay with the place."
Because continuity is not only important for a good operational climate, but also for the further structure of the city.
Those who want to exercise Roland Wacker should be able to present a closed study as a diploma or bachelor with architecture and have good expertise in the fields of construction and construction law.
The city construction office is part of high and deep construction, construction planning, basic business affairs, management of urban allies, urban operational court with building courts and urban farmers, and lower building law authorities, including mental protection.
Rounded on directions: Southeast Railway locked
According to the police, the unknown murders had led the blue driving rail from the Railway Translation in the Leobener Street (B116) to the guidelines.
These were so seriously damaged that the nearby goods had to be held.
The investigators go out of two men's murders and search for them since night hours.
The murder was observed by the Witnesses as a roaring roller and a bicycle car.
"This goes far away from a wheelchair," said the ÖBB speaker Christoph Posch to APA.
The murders or murders would have threatened themselves and also threatened the traffic.
In addition to the damage to the location and the installation, as well as the delay and costs for the shipping shipping shipping could also be adjusted to the losses of the train customers.
Overall, it was a "heritarian" summa, said the speaker.
The damages were recovered on Friday Monday, which could be carried out on the South Railway without disabilities.
Only 10 personal trains were defeated on Friday, two of them were the television.
The goods did not fall, but they had late.
According to the ÖBB speaker Christoph Posch, around 200 meters of above should be extracted.
Isolators and mass were also damaged.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate could help to swim IBD (internal care)
Red meat and chocolate can smell for your digestion system like an alptspace.
But a new study precisely highlights the opposition: a diet that is rich of meat-based proteins and milk products, the symptoms of patients with intrinsic illness.
The unheilable state in the United States of around 1,3 million and in the United States 300,000 in Britain causes magnificent forces and blowings, returning or blue accidents, weight loss and extreme comfort.
While the interested ones are normally generated to measure meat and milk products in order to lift their symptoms, researchers found at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid of proteins is involved in developing immunities that promote a tolerant dark.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immunitional patterns in the darm to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in the food do not enter into the body.
Cells that are able to eliminate distortions will be balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without prejudice to hypothesis.
If the weight is too far in direction of distortion, it may result in an outstanding disease.
Experiences have been found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune is presented in museums that bring a certain bacteria into their indications.
And the bacterium needs Tryptophan - one of the stones of proteins - to solve the appearance of cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have a connection between a bacterial type - Lactobacillus reuter, which is a normal part of the darm microbiology, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more Tryptophan had the museums in their food, so much more they had from these immunities."
He suggested that the combination of L. Reuter and a rich food tolerant, less instinctive darmilieus, if the same system also works with humans.
The postdoctorian Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune that promotes the tolerance when she found that a group of studies had such cells, but another group of the same stage, which was separated, did not have.
She summarized that the difference with the darm microbioms of the mouse - the Community of bacteria, virus and palms, which normally live in the magnetic darm trait.
The colds of the skin were sequented with DNA and there were six bacteria types found in the bones with the immune cells, but without they missed with the bones.
Museums were included in a stern environment so that they failed a darmicrobium and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuter and the immune.
To understand how the bacteria effects on the immune system, researchers L. reuters grew in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquidity - without the bacteria - to incredibly immunities that were isolated by the mouses.
The immune cells were developed tolerant cells.
When the active component was cleaned from the liquidity, it appears to be a side product of the tryptophan metabolism known as Indol-3 milk acid.
If the researchers doubled the amount of Tryptophan in the feed of the mouse, the number of such cells increased around 50%, but when the ryptophan values were half, the number of cells were slowly over half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as the moses, and that most of us L. reuters are protected in our magic darm trails.
It is not known whether Tryptophan side products from L. reuter develop the cells in people as in skins, but defects in genes were found in people with insufficient attention.
She said: "The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote, since these cells control distortions on the inside surface of Darm.
Positively, high tryptophane values in the presence of L. reuter can lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United with Nemanja Matic has obliged a "geny"
In Manchester United signed a "geny" with Nemanja Matic, he believed Jose Mourinho after the Mediterranean players had his debut against sanddoria.
The 40 million pounds signed by Chelsea began with a 2:1 win in Dublin, the last presession game, before the EUFA Super Cap against Real Madrid began on Tuesday, and impressed in the stop role as people, such as Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, Matic was excluded from the Blues' preparation tournament and only made 45 minutes that Mourinho had to improve before the first League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a gene in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
"We will help him to be ready before."
Besides Mathic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started as Mourinho formed its start-XI for the beginning of the season.
The Independent enthusiasmed this week that Mourinho wanted three further new commitments, but he found that the club had already done a "fantatic work" to meet three of his four priorities.
"Thirs from four, I thank the covenant," he added.
"I'm going to be more happy if they get four of me, but they have made great effort."
Boeing "malt" Dreamliner in heaven
The US flight manufacturer Boeing has seen the silhouette of a dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle in the USA State of Washington, but the census began to marquette in the US state Michigan and moved into the form of a triamliner over the United States, which are thousands of miles.
The action continued 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screen, it was the form of a dreamliner.
The whole was a delay test for new engines.
Boeing had previously made such an advertising.
So the number "787" and the Boeing-Logo was called in heaven.
New Depth for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
As the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still a SPD chief, social democracy ministers were always looking at the elections with a certain concern to Berlin.
There was no shooting fire from the party centre, but no wine from the covenant - so the most important desire of the election fighters.
Since Martin Schulz leads the party, the substantial change was changed.
Sither observed the employees from the Willy Brandt House with growing reset the events in the SPD headquarters.
What education has been obtained from there since the beginning of the year, it would not be described in the approach.
It was deep.
And one after the other.
After the surprising end of the red-groen majority in Niedersachsen, the Federal CDU views a general signal against coalition of SPD and Green.
"This shows more: Red-Green can't only register permission," said the Secretary-General Peter Tauber to the editor network in Germany (RND).
The surprising group of a Green-Deputy has affected the Government of President Stephan Weil (SPD) in a serious crisis.
Five months prior to the Sunday, his red-groen coalition lost its sights towards the opposition of CDU and FDP.
Michael Kellner, the Green Trade Director, called for the abstraction of the Netherlands Green Deputy Elke Twesten to return your mandate.
The transition to the DCU means a clear false of the election will.
Each Twesten must immediately return their mandate," said the Federal Employee Director and Chairman of the Greens to the Editor Network Germany (RND).
"It mustn't be all true," a SPD fighter spends when the new Job message reaches the central party on Friday.
Stephan Weil, SPD Minister of the Niedersachsen, is there after the transfer of the green Members Elke Twesten to the CDI without its own government master.
It is the provision of a series of large and small crises in SPD ships.
And no one knows what comes next.
The mixers began with the unexpected unexpected clear decline at the Saarland Whale in March.
A blue eye, no more, calmed the kids at the time.
After the landscapes in Schleswig-Holstein and North-Rhine-Westfalts will be different.
That was also - even though everything was clearly worse.
The swallowing place in Como led the SPD to the tables that the Dusseldorf plate slowly turned the party up.
In the past weeks, the gangs remembered again.
Then, when they just got a new courage, the G-20 Summit came from Hamburg.
And with him the next shooter came with him.
Major Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD head, lost his nimbus in that weekend, because he stood in the Elbfilharmonia while burned his city.
And because he made everything wrong in the crisis communication so much that it could be wrong.
Since then, school is fighting for his political survival.
So now's Stephan Weil.
In view of the VW gas employees and its role in the Supervisory Council, the Netherlands Minister has already been critical for a long time.
My values of survey were added.
However, or maybe just therefore, because in the past weeks it has always been stronger to put in the blow.
The efforts of the former civil minister of Hannover to build his power in Berlin did not remain hidden in the area of Martin Schulz.
They gave him, because they talked about a stability of the party.
Now it could be the exact opposition.
This is because it does not take any responsibilities between the Niederlands' Greens.
And there's no school.
In some cases, the gentlemen are trying to close their own lines.
Their shame is on the green, and in particular here is the Twenty-British parliamentary.
"It is essential and democratic, as Mrs Twesten makes its own carriage interests on the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, head of the partial links in the SPD Joint Day, the editor Network of Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten has not been elected as a direct candidate, but on the country list of the Netherlands Greens in Parliament, so the Netherlands's deputy continues.
The logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, Chief of the SPD Joint Day, claims a "undemocratic manager".
"The choice wish was clear four years ago: people have made Stephan Weil to the President of the Minister", says Oppermann, who leads the Netherlands's SPD as a spicet candidate to the Federal Day, the RND.
"At now, the personal concerns of a future CDD-Deputy are false the result of the election", said Oppermann.
He asked to explain the background.
I want to know whether there has been more or has been continuing responsibilities of the CDU Niedersachsen.
Contributions for local carriage III
Those who want to be curated in the years may first receive support from the country.
In this respect, Mr Albert Schindler and three representatives of the STEG city development on midnight in receptions.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler recovered the events until then.
Since 1991 it has been granted in Sanctions Area.
In the savings area I from 1991 to 2004, the country Baden-Württemberg has also taken two thirds of the support sums.
In the Sanation Area II from 2005 to 2016, the subvention was still 60 per cent.
The current sanctions are a "project of follow-up" - it is finally important to promote internal development, not only new building areas.
On 4 April, Karlss Rule has received information that it will be given a sanction area III.
The contribution sum is 833 333 euros, which is 500 000 euros from the country, the rest of the Community receives.
How is the area of sanction?
You will, so skiller, investigate where the "really old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role to improve the interest in the area planned.
If appropriate, the borders could also be moved again.
The STEG treated Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.
Keller presented the contents of the 'Social City' Programme in which the sanctions would then be carried out.
The key of the programme is the revitalization of internal cities, the improvement of living and work and maintenance and the development of infrastructure.
The measures would be objective, namely, by base, to be carried out.
The sanitation area would finally be set as a set.
The authorisation period for the aid shall take place since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
However, even until September this year would be implemented only once, in the context of which those participating in the sanctional area will receive a questionnaire.
In November or December, the statutory decision should be taken as far as possible to begin with sanctions in the coming year.
Piettzmann then declared that each community should carry out the investigated preab undertaking.
It goes to evaluate and decide when it is sanized and in what extent.
It will then include an account of sanctions in the basic book.
Pietzschmann will come again after receptions and make a picture of the situation, promised it.
Gotzel stressed that a significant success factor for the project was the participation of the participants.
This is why there will be questions that will be sent postally to the citizens in the next weeks and can be filled with the end of the summer feasts.
The hot questionnaire is the "building and baseline box" which, inter alia, relates to the construction and sanctional perspectives.
In a green questionnaire, the "budget and apartment box", information on size, distribution and residential housing can be made.
The blue "bogen" is completed only when business spaces are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted how Gotzel pointed out that a full questionnaire is not at the same time an application for support.
Furthermore, reconstruction measures are not promoteable.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of the promoting resources will work according to the "Wind-Hand principle" - who first comes, is worth first.
You can't be able to "reserve" for later.
To the end, photos of the "Ortskern II" project were shown to be "smackable" sanctions.
British finders themselves set up a microchip to come in house and car
A British founder is the first in the country that is equipped with a microchip to open his home door, to enter his office and even start his car with a hand move.
Steven Northam, 33, had planned the channel chip between shoes and skin fingers and now offers the service for business and individuals to simplify their life with technology through its BioTeq company.
He was assembled with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant analist at Royal Hampshire Hospital Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implantation procedure is carried out according to medical standards.
The technology features a skin and dog inplanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds.
The company of Mr Northam also wants to change the drivers of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the Chip, everything for a cost of 300 £ per lock.
The married father of one has now built home as well as at its BMW Z4 technology, which starts when his hand is on the tax.
The advertising costs of the White House costs tax payments thousands
The decision of the White House to flee a marine slaughter to South Lawn for an event that led the American production in the last month costs taxpayers according to the information of the military who have been left to the TIME Magazine until 24.000 US dollars.
The green-wheat Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the President is on Bord, was the heart room of the event on July 17, in the white house with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and head officers of the White House, made a round round through products from all 50 States.
The in Connecticut swimming swimming swimming pool was issued next to a chain of Maine, a shooting car from Wisconsin and a gabel staple from Mississippi.
The Army Office of the White House requested the presence of the Hubschrauber in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, less than 36 hours before the Hubschrauder on the South Lawn, after registrations of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the Hubschrauber.
"I just wanted you to be aware of that because it is such an inevitable event with high visibility", wrote the Commander of HMX-1 at the predecessor of the event, the present Marine Commander for aircraft.
The news showed that the Hubschrauder took place on the South Law on July 17th to 7 o'clock for the event at 15.00 p.m. and remained so long until the race was slept from 18:00 to 21:00 this night.
The note adds that if the flight should be delayed from the white house, it would require a second unit for the return.
The original aircraft was held during the event at the slaughter, while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time.
From which the TIME registers were available did not clearly indicate whether a second aircraft was finally required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees to use public property for political purposes.
Data sets show that HMX-1 asked whether the event could damage the determination.
"A question we put, was whether it was a violation of Hatch Act and we were informed of this wasn't the case," the Commander wrote.
"Clearly if you're closed," the shocked commander answered.
The "Made in America" event was called by the White House as an official event and would not be discovered by Hatch Act.
But also official events have political supervisions.
At the event, the President urged the reform of health reforms in the Senate and propagod the efforts to comply with the government rules.
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically favourable purposes, is not a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for travel.
But their use only for a photo-OP is uncommon.
Trump carried out an investigation in February when the President's flight carried out before his first campaigns in Melbourne, Florida, Taxi Services, and his Twitter account is full of reports that were estimated about the use of the President's flight.
"The White House is shocked by the "Made In America" show - the products from all 50 States that are produced by American employees with American materials", said the Chairman of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 equipment often run training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to reduce the US Presidents in the white house with precise centimeter lines.
When Trump was early July at the G20 meeting in Germany, HMX-1 carried out in the white house 58 surroundings.
The flight for the "Made in America" - Ereignis counted with the training requirements for the month, said an officer.
Helikopter units moved 11 hours further to this day for "non-presidency support missions".
The White House said that the taxpayers were overlooked the last for none of the other requisites presented on the event.
A speaker of Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved in posting the Hubschrauder on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not cover budgets for the President's flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact costs for the event.
However, according to the timelines of the United States Defence Minister for the financial year 2017, the DoD refund rate for VH-3D is 24.380 USD per flight hours.
Signs of the unit show the flight time in 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the real costs for the operation of the slaughter are far below this rate.
"The costs for taxpayers to be determined on the basis of the estimates for refund rates are most irrelevant," said Walters.
"The estimates contain staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs contained in the annual resources."
According to a RAND study from 2015, the refund rates for DoD are not the staff costs, but take into account the costs for vehicles, maintenance and contracting.
At that time, the former preachers of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the Hubschrauber for the event.
"The idea is to present things this week, which are produced in America," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the Federal State Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security, and I am going to say that hundreds of thousands, even if thousands of people are dependent on it.
And I think the majority of the Americans are all proud of the bubble and other military equipment, for which so many Americans have worked unreasonablely.
Of course, it's appropriate to overcome this."
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the Hubschrauder when he moved his round over the South Lawn for the event, but he was placed in the driving room of a fire shooting car.
In the white house Trump talked to Sikorsky's representatives and struggled with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I have three of them."

How Americans of the OMV may harm
Indeed, Donald Trump did not work when he put his sign under the law on the consolidation of sanctions against Russia on midnight.
"In his hate to adopt the law," the Congress encompassed a few "constitutional rules", finally.
The reaction of Moscow also was so hard as expected, and its own Brussels was shocked against the U.S. race.
The draft aims to punish European enterprises that help Russia to build gas pipelines into the EU.
Indeed, seven investors of the domestic OMV, which are funded together with other European companies, are concerned with the construction of the Russian East Sea Guide North Stream 2.
The Drohcules are powerful.
However, it is too early to assess the consequences, so the official statement of the oil concentration.
Indeed, Donald Trump itself should have the sanctions still to live by executive order.

Narcos Staffel 3 Trailer: Without Paul Escobar, the Cali Cartel is pulled in the hire of Netflix in the middle point
Despite the second staff of Narcos, Paul Escobar's killer, the series of Netflix is still not over.
The stapels three and four were already confirmed by the Streaming Service, which first received their first trailer and showed the latest badness of the show.
With the third stage, the DEA has focused on the most rich organization of the world's drug trafficking: the Cali card.
Leaded by four powerful patents, they operate "come a continued-500 companies" only with more state tests and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the card, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz London (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly published trailer, Peter Pascal returned as Javier Peña, the man who invites the American and Colombian criminal persecution authorities to support the war against drugs.
Additional players are Mattias Varela, Michael Stahl- Davi, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third staff of Narcos will start on 1 September.
Role back: the city makes 46 kitchen aids
The city is organizing us-mittagstically again.
With firm conversations partners for children and an adjustment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the urban child day places.
On 1 September, the town of Krefeld is overcoming the food supply in the urban child day facilities (China) in own region.
For Sonja Pommeranz, astronaut leader in the area of juvenile aid, this is a good news: "We all have been very pleased."
Buy is still out of the house: a Caterer takes this task and delivers fresh shopping.
The city is located in the Crefelder area 46 children day places, in 44, the children receive a warm food time at midday time.
In the past week, every 2800 children were at the bathroom, and the need increased.
"Methodless children are not only employed for 45 hours in which we are at midday," explains the pommerance.
"The offer also applies in the 35-hour flight when children stay until 14 a.m.."
46 part-time forces have kitchen service since 1 September: they warm the foods provided, complement them with salt, raw cost and fruit, portion the food time individually, give the food out, swimming, and cleaning the kitchen.
"The employees will be assigned to one of us," says Pommerance.
The size - there are two groups as well as seven group institutions - decides over the hour level.
"The kitchen helpers now belong to our team", says Pommeranz.
"They are so stronger connected and it is for the guidance of more simpler, pedagogical approaches."
Because this is also: healthy food and cooking.
"The children should help prepare the food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is sensitive.
And for the kids.
"They have a well-known power in us, a person who is trusting them, and not permanently changed."
This continuity is important for children.
The removal of our rooms - as well as the kitchen forces - will be carried out in the future by special cleaning personnel.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has also shown the charm that it has made in comparison with the cost of the city's own and foreign trade as the most economic, it is from the press.
And that, although 46 part-time forces are re-installed.
"After these hours, about 750 people in education are not so strong," says Sonja Pommeranz.
The Afghan Democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UNO.
Elections can only be representative when all members of the society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UNO Mission in Afghanistan on midday.
Nicholas Haysom, director of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will be candidated in the provinces; three women are candidates to the role of Vice-President and more than 30 percent of the new-registered electors are women.
"The role of women cannot be overlooked," he said at midnight in a statement.
The elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate unlimitedly and are included in all parts of the election process.
The Afghan elections for the Provincial Council and the Presidential elections are held on 5 April.
The Talibans have published threats against a election process, which will bring together with the transition of international fighting negotiations to a consultative role.
In this year, elections will first be transmitted to the power of peace by a democraticly elected government towards the next.
Haysom said that a strong role for women will still strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan.
The Afghan independent election committee reports that 1,2 million women of totally registered 3,6 million elections were registered.
Transition to TV jubilium
On the basis of the 110-year-old existence, the TV cassages will enter a small change with coffee and kitchen.

Two young men in age of 19 and 23 are trying to train a 13-year-old girl at Thursday.
According to the police information, the men said the 13-year-old boys who met friends at the Colping Street at 14.55 a.m., because they wanted to call the girl's phone.
But the 13-year-old boy refused the sweet and continued with her friends.
One of the murders tried to take the phone and the hairket of the girl, but what was missing.
Without beat, the Duo fly.
The two young men later could be arrested by the police.
The investigations are running.
GMB concerns about investments in the McVitie Fabric in Glasgow
A workshop wants to make aware of the long-term obligation to produce in its work in Glasgow, with managers of the Biscuit Manufacturer McVitie.
GMB Scotland said that the company has succeeded in the future of investments in the Tollcross statue.
More than 500 employees work in the work, which creates other products with Hobnobs and Rich Tea Keaks.
McVities owner Pladis said he had invested more than 5 million pounds in the past years.
He added that workers and partners would "as first learn" if they change their activities.
In a letter to the branch officer of the company, GMB Scotland McVitie's requested to express "remember that the financing for modernization of production lines will not be pre-established."
GMB Senator-organist Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we can win from the general site manager no clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross is deeply related to our members.
Generations of families have been working here and the work forces are strongly focused on the local community and the largest Glasgow, a major scale for human employment in a area with high unemployment and social participation.
It is therefore necessary under the perspective of jobs, loans and welfare, and in front of the brexit, the increased living costs and the chronic production decline, the Eastern end of Glasgow is urgently a floring production price at McVitie."
A speaker of Pladis said: "The filial at Tollcross has just received a letter from the GMB Scotland last night, and the company will react directly because we consider the continuing commitment to workers and workers.
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB advisers at Tollcross, which was openly discussed some of the questions.
We have discussed with the employees that we, as well as all companies that are active in a very competitive and insecure economic climate, continue to review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and positions - to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested in our Tollcross stadium more than 5 million pounds, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We recognize the heritage of Tollcross as a production centre fully accompanied. If our operational departments are changed on the location, the employees and their partners will be the first to learn this."
Did the PSG Barcelona warned Neymar three years ago?
The page of La Liga may be interested in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain is not left in her persecution by Neymar after she has given a offer of 189 million £ to solve its release class, but have they warned Barcelona three years ago before the world's reset?
The sensitive approach has heated the transfer window in the summer, because the Liga 1 club is ready to cut the world record over more than the double of the previous brand, while Paul Pogba returned to the last season of 89 million pounds to Manchester United.
After the end, Neymar will become the most precious players of the world and the world's highest-paid professional sportrs. PSG offers delivery from more than 500,000 GBP per week.
Barcelona is angry about the way Neymar has tried his way out, although a source near the Catalan Presidency is that the club has always given his best to care for him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But the football world was warned by the President of the PSG three years ago before this perspective?
When Manchester City 2014 interested in signing Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any agreement that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we'll be opposed to them, we'll contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, this will have consequences."
Barcelona seems to have overwhelmed this line, expressing the Spanish agreement in the beginning of this summer interest in the PSG football player Marco Verratti.
PSG clearly made that they would not allow it to be allowed to the international from Italy, under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar.

Interview: "Domspatzen report loaded by Papst Brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regenburger Domspatzen report on the falls of consumption dealt with by Papst Brother Georg Ratzinger.
This means the author and historical Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the missing channel at the Regensburger Domspacings continues to be discussed.
Christian Weisnder, speaker of the reform movement "We are Church", explained after publication towards the German Press Agency, he expected from the former Regensburger Bischof and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the Domcapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the priest Benedict XVI.
It would be very useful to the view of the Catholic Church if mullers and Ratzingers expressed their deep regrets about their own submissions or their fault appreciation of the operations.
However, the Vatican newspaper "Osservator Romano" criticized that the report on violence in domestic paths would be measured with "term measure".
With regard to the transactions in Regenburg, no one doubted that it would be "strange and degrading acts" that should be punished and hindered in the future; however, it is the "Grad Medialer Manipulation", as the author Lucetta Scarafia, historic and member of the national Italian Bioethic committees.
"The habitat to designate the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of the daily survey and prepares the public view to keep normal," writes Scarafia.
President Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said in the interview with the Bayerian Rundfunk: "There are pleased to go to the church and this is a fresh found."
She also pointed out that in her youth "sweet a very normal pedagogical means", "to be ready with fresh children as I was one."
She's starting to apply today's standards for the past decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports on malnutrition, Papst-Bruder Georg Ratzinger has also taken place.
The author and historic Michael Hesemann, who, with Ratzinger, was the "My brother of the Pope" (traduced in 12 languages).
"I must be protected by George Ratzinger," said Hesemann, "if all this had nothing to do with him," he values the results of the final report.
What is exactly in the 440-are report submitted by a lawyer Ulrich Weber by the Bistum Regensburg?
Overall, 547 Regensburger Domspatspacings had been sexually misused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s.
The final report states to Georg Ratzinger, who was working in Regenburg from 1964 to 1994: "Truely, it is possible to observe that, in many cases, the Domkapelmaister R. has been applied physical and psychological violence in many cases.
The punishment for students could also be more stronger when high emotionality.
However, in contrast to many other accused persons, many victims are estimating the general humanity of R. and therefore binding in numerous cases even positive memories with him."
Hesemann, in the interview, explains why the final report on the lack of use cancel at the Regenburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger, dealt with his view.
Mr Hesemann, the 440th page report on the "Projects of Violence Exercising to Protection Commands at the Regenburger Domspatzen" provides an opposite image of Domkapelmeister Georg Ratzinger.
For a lot of students, he has his "manyness".
On the other hand, he also appears as cholerator and perfectionist, who was hand-creating when a domspath was not cut up.
How do you appreciate this final report as his biograph?
Michael Hesemann: If you're making the efforts and read the whole 440 pages report from the top to the top, you'll need to ask for a better reason why the name Georg Ratzinger is really present there.
He's only eight pages, and it is clearly free from any suspect of the media or media in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The violence exceededs at the pre-school also appeared outside its effects.
In any case, you can propose to learn about the late or have not taken sufficiently seriously.
The Doms patzen gymnasium, in which he worked, was recommended by practically all persons as - so sensible - "Resolution", "Himmel" and "better world".
Thus, the vast majority of his student Georg Ratzinger also expresses an excellent witness, describes it as "heat", "happy", "respectful", "competence" and "comprehensive", as extremely good teachers, who used the kids regularly with kitchen, kitchen and bonbons, and was "forever converted to traubs of children".
Only a minority is estimated about his perfectionism and its high emotions, which have already caused anxiety.
That he was not only snacked with shoes and was the key connection on the ground, but also distributed horsefoods and all too fresh kids to the hair or ears, he has already given himself a long time ago, deplored and apologized for it.
However, it should be said that such education methods were widely distributed in the 1960s and 1970s, with parents as with teachers.
Do you also know such a detention methods?
Of course, I think each of us who was born before 1968.
I have also experienced this in a world school, a state gymnasium.
Comparison with what is actually in this report, namely the decisive sexual abuse and violence in the pre-school, are free bagatals.
There are some questions about whether it is not better with his advertising and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media just struck on him.
Many who have never understood him still work in the Bayerian pope are still quiet.
However, the truth is: the report deplores Georg Ratzinger in any sense!
In the media, the report was very much reported about the issue of misuse in the Regenburger Domspatzens.
Is Georg Ratzinger also put to the end in the final report any development or mediation in terms of sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Not clear.
No one of the 67 victims of sexual offences claims to have confidence to the Dom Capital Master.
Not even the parents were invoked.
"I never told me to talk to my father or my mother," said one interesting person, "It was all very painful to me."
The real problem in the declaration of sexual abuse was, but the majority of victims were shocked.
If they did not even trust their parents and sisters, then nor would they have been a chairman who would have been a colleague of the murder.
How does the Domspatzen students evaluate the role of advisers in the case of malnutrition?
Michael Hesemann: A questionnaire student made it like this: "Available sexual abuse... I see... no case he had been calculated at the time and could have stopped the murders.
I think it is ... too absurd to accept that it is calculated to him... skins have opened more incredible or clearer or even more than against their parents, internal clothes, teachers of trust, etc.
That you talk to him about sex...
In this way, the report comes to the very clear result: "It could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation.
As regards sexual abuse, georg adviser is therefore to free from every publicity.
Thus, he cannot also be predicted not to prevent or have brought him to show.
Therefore, there is no reason to connect his good name to this present crime, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media a lot of "Govertexes" were to read at the Regenburger Domspaces.
The previous Domkapel Meister Georg Ratzinger will be proposed in the report "View."
Does he have to live with this prosecution?
Michael Hesemann: This is the great problem that in the reporting everything was missing and reduced to a huge mix of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of the report, Georgi Ratzinger.
But exactly this is a misuse of the report.
Indeed, it will be clean: between the school and the gymnasium of domestic paths, between sexual abuse and violence, and again, we say other prostitutes.
In addition, the report discusses events since 1945, and also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not chairman of the Domspatches.
The whole horrible shoes, the cases in which kids of sadist teachers were regularly shocked and shocked and understood, have all been in place at the pre-school in east houses and piles courts, where they have really had to rule skandadal situations.
But with whom Domcapel Master Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he had the boys only faced when they were on the Doms patzengymnasium.
It was on the subject "Vorschool".
You were only happy to get away and so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.
What else was on Doms patzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: Despite the domination of disciplin, there was no sadistic violence.
And this applies also to Georgia Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that "will many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even positive memories with him."
As far as the proposal remains, it remains to have been shocked.
However, in spite of all efforts, the report was only able to define two periods in which it was reported by the situations in the pre-school.
The first time in 1970/71, when he began to evacuate, and from the operations at a school where he was not effective and responsible, (as the witness) wanted nothing to hear, and then back to 1993.
Did georg advisers result in ears?
Michael Hesemann: No, because he already wrote a letter to the Director of Doms patzengymnasium, which has even reproduced the report.
In this way he pointed out that "this will continue to practice the punishment in the pre-school".
In view of the risk of negative press advertisements, he recommended urgently.
Of course, it was at a time when legal clarity was forbidden as punishment in Bayern for a long time.
That's why they were in a legal grau zone, as everybody knows.
It was also difficult to consider where the interested persons may be overlooked or dramatized and where they really exceeded the permitted borders.
But you can't even say that he had always seen.
That's just not true.
First in 1980, the punishment of schools was also officially abolished in Bayern.
Priest Gloria of Thurn and Taxis said that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical measurements to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We are historically talking about the "Fall Strip of Anachronism", so the danger to evaluate the past according to current moral conditions.
The chief's right.
But of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was deceived at all times, and not even to what was interrupted in the school of resistance and violence to innocent children, which is far beyond the employees at the time.
It's all horrible, and I'm glad that it's finally worked.
But at the same time, I have to protect Georg's advisers, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means for discipline and punishment, such as ears and hairs and ears, were widely distributed in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was banned, he has also strictly maintained it.
What picture of his Regensburger time has georg Ratzinger given in the conversation with you for the book "My Brother of the Papest"?
How was the theme of the Prugel punishment also in the language?
Michael Hesemann: Now, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedicts XVI, tells his perspective, where the Domspatsen played only a side role.
However, I don't have any way that he was leading to a strict regime there.
However, it should also be said once: without this perfectionism, without the demanders of unnecessary discipline, it would have been unlikely to be possible to form an institution of a world stand, a true cultural message of Europe and its musical tradition, both in the United States (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With Keken and Bonbons alone, you never make great songs of opposite kids and are in front of any success, just in any area, but always disciplin, suffering and self-training.
How much have you experienced george advisers at the conversation with their book?
Michael Hesemann: With the work of the book and further, I have really learned Georg Ratzinger well and always again as wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deeply believers and discreet people who are not able to imagine that he could only do something to be a flight.
I regularly welcome how many former domestic paths still today, 23 years after his emergence, keep him regularly contact, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family.
Those who do not forgive him until today that he was strict to them are clearly in minority.
Most Doms Passes are grateful to him today for the expansion of their life and has brought them the world of music.
And that he always was a good, parent teacher - a more strict father, certainly that it may be - but he was also a lovely respectful person to whom she still looks at them today and to honor them just.
And please again clearly: everything that you have before him is the education methods that were then at the agenda.
We can be happy that we have overwhelmed this time for a long time.
But it's most unrighteous to make a man, just because he is prominent and one more prominent brother has to make a medium-sized sinbow.
There's the wicked destiny that is in it just to be obvious.
Because the report that was just published is loaded to him.
Now it would be the state of a 93-year-old man who has purchased great services, and who would finally not be aware of the Regenburg Domspatches.
