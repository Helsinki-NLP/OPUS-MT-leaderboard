Assistant doctors at the grev: new jobs to slow up
The assistant doctors asked the representatives to authorize the delay of the shipments as regards the absence of a new agreement.
The English Chief Unit (BMA) has been found in calling to support a more slower job action on the general advisory Committee (JDC) on September.
JDC explained that the departments couldn't be worried about the agreement.
Assistant doctors and students used the email game in agreement with the BMA.
This was rejected by 58% of the players.
In a letter published on Twitter, JDC stated that President Ellen McCourt was "shouldless" about the problems why the agreement was rejected by the government.
He said, "In the light of this, the JDC Administration has been used in the entire way to reject the new agreement and to re-establish the concerns. "
As a response to the silence of the government, a official request was found to allow a programme to increase the extent of the UNBMA's work on the start of September.
Inconvenience, the assistant doctors had been involved in the first meeting of the NHS history in the past year.
Dr. Johann Malawana, assistant director of the BMA, refused to give the address to the terms of the BMA's arrangement.
54.000 assistent doctors and students said that it was a good agreement to be accepted by the BMA members during the meetings before the vote.
After the event, Headquarters Jeremy Hunt indicated that the agreement would be implemented in an appropriate way for the doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: Is a 'unsimious' fashion?
This is a jesus that ends the crisis.
The Russian and Turkey's leaders were a meeting to preach that the eight-month war was officially finished by the Tuesday.
But when I welcome the Turk partner in the showing room of St. Petersburg, I was captured with the sight of the bar, which was the most desired side of Ankara.
The hand's shocked, yes.
But Mr. Putin was very slow and couldn't say any heat against his slow standards.
Recep Tayip Erdoğan once told Mr Putin about "Family friends"; five times as a report.
I surprised the number.
He also said that the relationships with Russia wouldn't go back to the level of crisis, so much higher levels.
The next day, in a newspaper here, Mr. Erdoğan did not act like anything bad.
I think his instinct showed this exactly.
But Mr. Putin showed the cold intime that the Russian leader wasn't forgetting anything.
In fact, the first thing that he explained in the opening explanation was the reason for the crisis: that Turkey would shoot the Russian war flight on the border of Syria.
Then Russia's response was full of hidden.
Mr. Putin accused Ankara to shoot Moscow's secret to make a hard outcome.
The rape was much larger, the opposite friend.
The trust will be hard to be rebuilt in real meaning, maybe impossible.
From November, the idea of the Russian people changed.
The media at the State control was targeted by Ankara in a sense of a month.
Anden, everything's been innocent Turks.
The most serious of these were the cases of the law which was under control of the Islamic State's foreign oil trade in Syria, Mr. Erdoğan.
He rejected it as a deep.
But the official message from St. Petersburg was on the way to continue.
On the contrary, the reason why this meeting was being held was that Mr. Putin asked the Countries from Erdoğan.
Russia can see it as a variety of conferences.
It's very clean in the worth that the fire phones can be delivered for ankara.
First of all, Erdoğan needs friends after the last month we're going to get up and almost slow.
In Turkey, the terror attacks were very affected by him.
Also, economic reasons are active.
The fact that Russia has implemented has often been shooted, especially the prohibition of special occasions to transport a number of millions of Russian tourists every year in Turkey's borders.
This number slowed about 90%.
In Russia, the tour operators and the shopping companies were absolutely comforted that the flights would continue.
They've been bound to the end of the season in the Adience.
And this week, the government's television was found at the suggestor to be reduced on the prices of the Turkish style.
If we're going to take a news in the Vedemosti newspaper "Turists here, domates here."
However, a different political value for Moscow was found.
Ankara, you're angry to West because you don't find enough answers to my income.
When weaknesses of the meetings in the United States have been increased in the speed of a long time, Mr. Putin, which wants to be worthy of the coat between Turkey and the West and the western ships.
It seems like it's clear that the support of the authorities chosen after the Russian leadership is being collected from Ankara's sympathetic.
It should be forgotten that he also was an incredible situation for Moscow, who was a root fear of reign change.
This scene, Russia and Turkey's analyst, which is arranged at the sea level, represents the "unsumable dimensions" of the two countries who rejected the West and acted badly.
However, they are very different, despite this extraordinary appearance.
One of the most important aspects of Syria: the Moscow shows himself as a browser, and the Russian and Turkey supports different sides.
Only three hours after the first meeting, it supports it to say that the two presidents are not talking about this matter at the press meeting.
The Turkish Countries had clearly flew from answering a question about these differences, and Mr. Putin chose to draw the gold of these.
There's no right idea about how a mid-sea will be determined in Syria.
However, after a few months clearly surveyed, - and the Nato-Chairman, Turkey, who appears to have a Russian war flight in the face of the absolute potential of disaster, is not a good progress to start talking at least two leaders.
The Skotland Bank is destroyed for customers outside Skotlandia
According to the president of the Bank, the RBS's mark will be on the back position.
The Skotland Bank will be destroyed for customers outside Skotlandia.
Ross McEwan explained that the RBS Bank's global targets were related to BBC Scotia.
It's been taken back from it and stopped because it was nearly eight years ago.
In that time, Marka Strategic experts used RBS to protect other smoking finance marks.
This supported millions of sterlins from the sixth Ulus ragbi champion Wimbledon Andy Murray champion.
But now it was decided that the more national markets will be right.
Skotland Bank will be used by Skotlands clients but new starts will not be made.
In England and Galler, all stakeholders will be changed as NatWest as NatWest.
The Irish Korean and Northern Ireland's clients use the Ulster Bank mark.
The more smaller markets to be loaded for a single banking banker are available; Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEwan gave a tour reporting for customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
The BBC said to Skotlandia, "There is no longer the mark that our RBS market and our staff will be denied."
As the bank came to a global brand, RBS came to the global mark.
I'm saying it's our local goals now.
Each of these markets will go a little differently in the community, and our staff will work under the name of these markets.
RBS explained that the sixth National Championship couldn't pass the sponsority, and that different markets are loading the profile of the sponsor sponsority.
The President of the Iraqi government said, "We came to time to understand the bank, because (We asked you) how can we make it better for customers?".
Third years ago, we'd be a wonderful bank for our customers, and if we showed that markets would be offered.
But I think we're going to work and not our own, but we're going to see a lot of changes in the needs of customers.
So I think that's the right time.
Frankie Dettor wins 3000 times with the converse in Newmark with Prediction.
Dettor, after he reached a couple in New Market, shuttled Championship.
Jokey Frankie Dettor wins the 3000th war at New Market in England on Saturday.
In the local piston, John Gosden's trained Prediction and wins the second evening gathering to this kilometer.
A 45-year-old Italian, an eyeless English path, is a golden witch to this kilometer.
He's following Ser Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three champion champions in Ghayyar said, "This is a special situation."
And my family, I've been here so much.
It's really happy that I started this job 30 years ago.
This isn't a important meeting, not a Royal Ascot -- just a second night with 20,000 people.
I feel he's smelling myself and relaxing.
Dettor accepted the lawyers after the war, bringing the Prediction.
Two kids reaching the English shoes from this mile: the champion, Richard Johnson, was 20 times champion and was a 20-fold champion, and the sweeper of 4300 in the carriage with the filling cart on the quarter of the quarter, Mr Anthony McCoy.
There's 4493 oppositions in Lester Piggott's carriage who wins the Derby's seats nine times.
Frankie, it's not surprising that we're one of the best kids of our team, and only a few people have reached a kilometer before him.
He's a powerful person, but a tactic mind that has a hope that makes a weight of others in the therapy.
It's a wonderful representation of his horse, and it's a lot of years with the shore of this matter.
A few weeks ago, I told you to Epsom that if Frankie's only finished weekends, and if it wasn't a 6000-year-old fence.
If you have to be serious, Frankie has spent a large part of the 30-year-old UK confronts that it was so nice to see.
It's a very exciting character, and it's a very good feature for these English shops, but it's a wonderful joy over.
Frankie Dettor welcomed the movement of this kilometer by slowing the shooting move.
The slope of the shooting shooting shooting and the shooter of Frankie Dettor has been the symbol of the unforgettable shoes of England for over half a year.
This was a full outstanding way.
In 1996, the famous "Best Seven" warfare in Ascot remained alive in an accident and was banned by the cause of not obeying the medicine law.
Third years ago, if the difficulties were to be back from the six-month departure process, it showed that it was a strong character that was necessary for the best to return.
And it could continue again, and the detector expressed that he wanted to continue to spend at least 50 years ago.
The President of Russia, Putin, took my special ball from Sergei Ivanov.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, took a mission from Sergei Ivanov unexpectedly.
Mr. Ivanov was a part of the nearby environment that Mr. Putin trusted for many years.
63 years old, now as a special representative for environmental and transporting issues.
In an explanation made by Kremlin, Mr. Putin was explained, "Ivanov decided to finish the mission of the Russian government."
In 2012, Anton Vaino was assigned for this position to Mr. Ivanov.
A 44-year-old, Moano, is a former diploma.
In 1972, Estonia was born in Tallinn, known by the Moscow State Institute of the National Discussions (MGIMO) and has been assigned to Tokyo's majority.
The President's protocol and government staff were later concerned; the expressions on the Kremlin website are so (Russian).
After his mission, Mr. Putin said, "Thank you for me."
I think that the most important task of Idarene is to take out the law and to monitor the implementation of the instructions as the head of the government.
Mr. Putin explained that the Russian TV channel wanted to be taken from Mr. Ivanov and suggested Mr. Moano instead.
Are they convinced?
This is a man who shocks Moscow in a wonderful way.
Sergei Ivanov worked as one of Vladimir Putin's nearest routine for a long time and served Soviet security forces as well as KGB.
In particular, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
On a meeting published with President Putin, both of them were taken on the desire of the private calibration.
However, despite the smiling pounds of the cameras, many people have been convinced of this, especially in the course of the parliamentary elections.
So this is an inconvenience from the source of a kind of fight?
Nobody still knows that.
However, a person could be chaired with an official doubt that one of Russia's people wanted to direct the environmental policy.
According to the website of Kremlin, Mr. Ivanov, Mr. Putin, he said: "I want you to trust me for four years in the beginning of the year 2012 in our talk.
Well, it looks like, four years ago, I have been as a special president for eight months.
Mr. Ivanov took this mission in September 2011.
He was placed at the headquarters' assistance and defence defence office.
The Russian Security Council and the KGB State Security Forces, as Mr Putin, are its former member.
At the end of the 1990s, when the Federal Security Forces (FSB), Mr. Ivanov, were on the position of the President of Mr. Putin KGB.
When Mr. Putin passed to the end, Ivanov was one of the five most trusting persons.
Mr. Putin's triumph to be chaired by the President of Mr. Ivanov could be the president after Mr. Putin's second time.
But this mission was deployed to Dmitry Medvedv, another nearby putin.
Mr. Putin, three and a half years later, he was headman before he returned to the president.
The star of the Criminal Minds, Thomas Gibson, was shooted after the shooter.
Gibson, the last month we've been physician supervisory at Los Angeles.
The ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which was made up the directory manufacturer, announced that he had been removed from his work in an interface.
The Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, Gibson, was released an apologist on Thursday before his fascination was made.
The differences with seven creators and an inconvenience.
"I'm sorry about the event."
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios will provide details in a future history of how a group of FBI agents will be removed from a group of characters played by a program.
A 54-year-old actor, who was located in the committee of Dharma & Greg, was in place from the first stage of 2005.
Gibson said, "I love Criminal Minds, and I tried to give him my heart and spirit for the last ten years."
I wanted to stay until the end, but that's not possible.
I just want to thank writers, manufacturers, actors, our wonderful team, and the most important one that you can have.
The program is expecting to return to the screens on September 28 for the second season.
The shock of fishing in the Banff garden
A person living in the Banff area was found in the help to define fishing in the garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that this 75 fish could be shipped with the sea.
Bain, who lived away from the sea, published in Perisco in Periscope the hope that one of them should hold light on the appearance of fishes in two lengths.
Queensferry's pass: the bridge is now connected to Fifth
1,35 billion £ of the project must be completed until May 2017
The engineers joined the north of the Queensferry Pass, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fifth.
This is a four-continent instrument between the "tail fans" between each one of the three culbs of the bridge.
The bridge is 600 meters long and 30,000 tonnes weight.
There are 10,000 tons of circle and 20,000 tonnes of 46 support boxes.
The project must be completed until May 2017 in the value of 1,35 billion £.
The Economic Director Keith Brown was one of the first people who traveled to the dark bridge today.
He said, "This is a time for Queensferry's construction.
We all witness engineering that is used on 30,000 tonnes of this project with the real meaning of this project.
Despite the overwhelming size and weight of the bridge between the bridge and the bridge, it is an unfair work that requires the last difficult tolerances for this sleep.
In general, where the top pump table is almost 79%, the first beton grain of the snake will be realized today in Rosyth, which means that it will be ready to be removed on the bridge.
Forth Pass and Bridge Mutuary Project Director Michael Martin said, "The first closure always takes an important kilometer in the bridge projects.
This wonderful project represents the pioneer in the construction engineering.
We had to close the space on the north-eastern side, after being placed by the last round table and connected to the Northern Class level.
This is being implemented by the south of 700 mile (700 mile) you're in the north.
It was very big, but at the same time it was a very weak.
It was because you were 222 meters long, about 6000 tonnes of weight, and about 3 tonnes should be taken.
The reason for being patient is that the parent’s tolerance must be accompanied was very low, and on both sides, only a few milimeters.
Well, it's all right.
Moelfre Conservation Team: Happiness for three men
Third men, after they slaughtered from the fishing machine in Anglesey, "that's lucky to stay in.
Moelfre RNLI's station after he saw the case in the Moelfre Coast, he warned on Sunday with the English Time at 13:20.
Third men tried to spend their ships on their own way.
Moelfre said, "With we saw that the man draws the right places to them, and we've covered anxiety."
And he added: "We went away with the strong winds until we went to the right way."
When two men were saved from a local fisherman ship, the three-year-old men of the age of 60 were shocked with a shock without a snack of life.
Everything was issued to the filial of the right way to the sea, and it was brought to the station.
Mr. Jones said, "He's lucky that three men falling down the water, they've been in their lives and they've never been hurted.
There was an emergency box on the engine, but when it worked, he should have cut off the person who uses the machine.
These three men were watching today.
A valuable type of cure for health and happiness, Pokemon Go
It's really wonderful to see how the world changed.
Youths and kids prefer to go out for playing, watching their white time to the screens, was a situation that most people were sorry over the past 10 years.
Pokemon Go encourages people to move out of the roof.
When you look at the screens, you've been limited to television at the beginning, at the time, video games and finally on smart phones.
It's nice to see that technology and open air movements are not anxiety.
Of course, I'm talking about a Pokemon Go application, which was created for video games in the beginning of the 1990s.
Like a lot of people's cultures, this new game, in the heads of July, grew a medium in the United States, Australia and New Zealand.
Afterward, the interests of the crowd in the servers were made in other countries.
In days, Pokémon has reached more and almost the same number of users as Twitter.
So, how do you work?
If you have to explain shortly, the players take the smart phones, goes out to call Pokemon as follows with GPS, and they're able to get the photos on the telephone, or they can 'call it'.
It's a bit of a bitch to get the game out of the shock for a age of age.
In the U.S. game, a person's "measuring" has made a valuable increase in the number of steps that a person was taken every day.
Cardiogram, who has developed an application for Apple Watch and 35 000 users, explained that in the next two days after the playing of Washington Post, 53 percent of those who have been monitored unspectacularly every 30 days.
We don't know who's playing Pokémon Go, but it's only skillless.
Most of you, who encouraged "30 minutes of time," "standing up" and "wealth to be active every day", have been seen by the reason why health message is slow, and why people appeared.
But less the importance of uncleanness is not shocked.
Regularly, people who do insufficiently reduce cancer or depression.
Without eagle, kilo control, high tank and diabetes, it provides help and has long advantages in the list of things that are not listed here.
But Pokemon Go's beauty is that they're out of the way to do something that they're worthy of people.
In this way, the three basic dimensions of health are found: movement, clean air and sunlight.
Some people can even get new friends at the time.
Like always, we've got sweet game boss that call something to be shocked.
And, of course, someone can get to the door when he walks.
What does it mean?
It was offered a great news.
If we look at the skeeper phone applications like Fitbit, we didn't have a reason to make us unreasonable as this game.
Newity will pass, and I will also reduce the use.
However, because Pokemon's success, implementing and vocabulary reality, a lot of games will help people to be more active, healthy and healthy in the real world.

Simone Biles cut the gold material in general gemnastic women
You forgot the pressure.
Forgot your heat.
Simone Biles has all this deterioration.
Dynamical about the throat.
Calm down in the dentist.
It's shocking with the earth.
At first, perfectity.
And she's now a Olympicat champion.
The 19-year-old American jimnastic, the general evaluation of the Persian day, was clearly completed the difference between the rest of the world in the Olympicats.
Aly Raisman and Russian bronz madal, a friend of the 62.198 pounds of silver madals and a friend of the "Son 5s" team, was on the top of Aliya Mustafin.
Simone Biles from the United States, Persian Day, 2016 in Brazil, Rio de Janeiro Yaz Yaz Olympiyat, was settled at the end of an artistic jamnastic evaluation.
Knows, the fourth and generally fiveth American woman who had a general evaluation reward of all the times, and it was the best name of her generation and maybe all the time.
When the last ship was released, the eyes were shocked, and the long journey that was gone to reach it.
This succeeding led to the same level as Michael Phelps, which can be seen at all new levels of sports:
Knowes, the 15th World Championship of Championship for the last three years, and the 1984 Olimpiyat Championship, Mary Lou Retton, was one of the most successful ones of Mary Lou Retton's "the best gymnastics I've seen."
The last test in Brazil was waiting for him, and it was between him and the large expectations that made up.
Teksas would seem to be a disaster of returning to the family in Spring in a higher lawyer than a madalya.
Simone Biles, solda, and Aly Raisman in Brazil, 2016 in Rio de Janeiro Yaz Olympiyat, the U.S. Olympics, which were organized by the United States, were highlighted by artistic women in the Rio de Janeiro Yaz Olympiyats in the general evaluation and in the golden madal, Persimbe, Ağu.
Knows, the Millennium Coordinator, who was the first one, wins Marta Karolyi's famous mission at the park of Martha Karolyi.
But it's not exactly true if you're not looking forward in this long course, but it's not true.
A part of the slope of the routine is prepared with the Latin music that is exactly sleeping outside the Rio Olimpiyat Arena.
It's not a counterparty.
Her grand mother and grand father had a child, and Aimee Boorman's gymnastic room, a girl found by the mother of Boorman, came to be a force.
In 2013, no one lost the general assessment of this, and it was a grain of integrity that must continue as long as he wants.
And if the leadership was on the Mostafin two rotations, it was timely.
It's the tool that Biles was up to the world's champion, and it's not yet a placeless one.
He passed up with 15,433 pounds in the degree tool, and stripped it with 15,933 pounds.
Raisman was shocked with his last shock when he was waiting for his last shock and Biles' s visions were realized in a dark shoe, and the light-shaped red, white and blue sights were defined around the shoes.
Raisman's performance was like a slaughter of the fourth part of the fourth part, but then the bronz madaly lost Mustafin four years ago.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain of the United States named "no."
Once the time, he sent the people a snake to the resurrection of a suspicious revolution.
The 19-year-old Tweet can say that the full new understanding of the Twitter, which has been divided in the beginning of this week, is now:
Police: In the case of a series murder, three victims were shot in the car.
Phoenix's first murder in the case of the first ten years, two women and a 12-year-old boy, talking in the car and listening to music.
The authorities expressed that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Elis and Ellis's daughter, Maleah, were shocked on a car in a garage in the 12th Haziran.
The report shows that weapon person's shooting on the shooting side of the car was shooted with eight hands and shooted away with another machine.
The police says that these three murders weren't shocked because the attacked victims didn't have his hands or $2,900.
Phoenix, police supporter, Jonathan Howard, explained that the investigators of the weapon attacks were able to investigate whether it had been linked to four previous attacks.
For four months, seven people died in the nine attacks in the Spanish swimming cities of the Spanish mosquitoes, and two were lost.
Howard was found at the beginning of this month in the explanation of the CBS to KPHO, "This has been in the area of a house."
A model of coffee at the end of the 1990s shows that in a correct model, Nissan, the BMW and a White Cadillac or Lincoln uses a few tools.
The researchers refused to explain the fact that the attacks were the same and the results of the same murder.
Ellis (33) was removed to the hospital and then lost his life.
Liner (31) and Ellis's daughter Maleah lost his life in the event.
Someone who had witnessed said that the police was not an extraordinary situation in the parking car that they were sitting in the park and listening to music.
At the same time, the authorities issued a police report on the fact that three murders were empty over half an hour ago, a shooting truck.
The researchers found the memi corns, cut a meme out of a ball, and reported the meme parts of the motor.
The mother of the 6-year microspheric disease said, "He's a good thing."
So, like most of the six-year-old boys, Edmund Pitchuto can't sing, players, and of course she loves her mother.
However, in response to the guards, the microspheric disorder was in Edmund, which is a genetic deterioration not known by her mother during the pregnancy of Elizabeth Piccuto.
When I came home first, I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't want it.
"It isn't true, surely you want to say."
He said to himself and her wife, Edmund could never know them and couldn't live.
Some doctors went out so far as they suggested that he's going to be in the house.
Pitchuto was found in explaining: "There's all the reactions to tell people that I'm thinking that you're doing this now."
Edmund can walk with a walking help.
Edmund couldn't sit or couldn't, and he can't talk.
But he reaches some of the turnpoints.
He's able to walk with help, and he's able to get it into the bike.
He also likes to play with two men and sisters and to sing.
Elizabeth, Edmund shows the language that he listened to means "Speak me a song."
Piccuto, he said to CBS News, "We're teaching his language."
But it's not the language that we know, but Edmund has obeyed his own marks.
Microsefali can occur with a decimal situation; a genetic situation, such as Edmund, can be found and can be sourced from the infections created by virals like pregnancy and zika.
Specifications and disease can show great differences.
More early to tell people who have zica infection how life will affect this situation.
Piccuto remembers the emotional burden created by the future's uncertainty.
I asked what's going on.
What's going on?
And he still don't know that.
In fact, I didn't ask anybody to tell me that I really wouldn't have been telling me a question about the seat of disease for a long time.
However, Piciuto can offer full advisory for the mothers of the babys who are born with reasons of Zika.
It's better.
You know it's better for you.
You're gonna love your kids, and your kids will love you.

Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
I called this name to the Olimpiyat Jimnastic team this year, and there's more reason.
First of all, since 1984, I participated in all the Script Olimpiates, and the US never had so much pressed.
Secondly, this team has three jinnists inspired by many girls with different ethnic roots: Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez.
Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian are proud of all.
I'm a team, and finally I'm going to make a look like America.
At the same time, the political and Latin root women also strengthen the existance of the sports at the top level.
In the past four years, the first woman, Jimnastic, was always a African root American.
The last year, Simone, and Gabby 1 and 2.
That's a strong thing.
In the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olimpiade Championship and supported the United States.
Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, now the world's three world's Championships, now, can be witnessed by the great practices that have been made by the gimnastic rutins.
Thursday, Simone was the fourth United States who wins gold madals in general assessment of women.
And the team's friend Aly Raisman wins the silver madal.
We know the best time of this sport, but it doesn't seem like that in the general gimpnatic courses of the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie looked the same way with Aly and Madison to get place on the Olympic teams.
The reason why you're "Son Five" is that the next Olimpiate Jimnastic team will be only four gymnastics, and that's the last year that Marta Karol's channel will make.
However, in reality, a very valuable sports and gymnastics, first works on the training of parents, roads, forms, shops, hotel loans (actors, jinnastics and families) and more special gymnastic clubs supported by more payments.
Most of these gymnastic clubs will be able to support these processes, in the existing banking parks.
These clubs need to be a valuable and long-term place for the families of Jimnastics.
Simone Biles' technician, Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez's copy of Maggie Haney, has been training these attorneys since the day they started joining.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie are not offering a more costful and enhanced gymnastic education for young girls that are affected by young girls.
I made my Jimnastic case 20 years ago.
In my training, we offered an unprecedented and low-facility jimnastic training in the city centre of Harlem, as a central city, and the national and national Championships.
In September, we will broaden the Detroit to learn this wonderful Olimpiyat sport and provide the opportunity for young people who have the right to worth the opportunity to give up.
Jimnastics, your body's strength, its inheritance and coordination, and gives a hard work, disciplin and decision-making features.
This combination provides long-term advantages from the opening of success, health, school, and work.
Thousands of young girls who will lead to jimnastis will be inspired by this team, and that's a wonderful thing.
I'm joining sports works, especially for girls.
We're really awesome times.
Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, bringing the gold material to the Olympic team, and thank you for the reason that many young girls have a healthy, strong and successful young woman.
After Jeremy Hunt's offer was rejected, the assistant doctors decided to continue on the grief.
The offices hoped that it would be the end of the agreement on the Developed Unit with the Unit, but 37.000 assistant doctors gave 58 per cent of the email play.
In July, Mr. Hunt explained the plans of implementation of NHS's "NHS isn't the government" and expressed that the personal and patient's plans would be injured.
The first assistant doctor group has been newly agreed on changes in the use of nights and weeks in order to improve views outside normal hours.
BMA assisted doctors President Dr. Ellen McCourt said last night on the scene: "Assistant doctors still have severe concerns, especially this would make the active power crisis, and they think that they are not equal to me to all doctors."
Only eight weeks of the first doctors need to be progressed in this process and to fill time.
The efforts shown by the BMA's inconvenience in the way of solving the government's influence and in some situations are faced with healthy silence.
It's not an advance that Jeremy Hunt has given the last month that the door will always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to listen to the concerns of the physicians.
Assistent doctors just tell them that they are prepared to increase their efforts to accelerate their work.
At the end of the month of Nisan, almost 1,000 rutin operations and 100,000 stations, sisters and interviews had to be considered instead of doctors in Grev.
The governments hoped that it would be the end of an unlawful agreement on the development of the UK Chiefs with the Unit.
The BMA wants to improve the final weekly payment for 54.000 assistant doctors.
NHS workers invited Daniel Mortimer the assistant doctors not to apply any grief.
Mr. Mortimer said, "Grev doesn't solve anything, but it's still a cause for sickness and pressure on the teams and services that are ready to make the diseases, careers and their families. "
In the past two months we continued our meeting with the Assistant Doctors Committee, and we have closed with the Department of Health and other authorities with the Surveillance and Interior.
The employees, the major conpulsion distribution, educational education, educational training, educational careers, and educational careers, and educational careers, reasonable permissions and sexual differences, were hoped to continue as a positive communication on those who are in the field of education, which worked as a standard of agreements with the BMA in February and May.
Medicine that can remove heart crisis from the midst of the day with 2 pounds.
Thousands of heart diseases can be offered from 2 pounds per day, as the authorities suggested to give more than a longer person.
ticagrelor, preventing depreciation, reduces the risk of crisis for people who have a heart disorder.
Medicine was being given for 12 months following the heart crisis and reduced the risk of illness or other crisis.
NHS observer suggested that it would be given to people for four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NHS observer suggested that it would be given to people for four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Each year in England, 140,000 people have a heart crisis, and one of these four is going to have another crisis or a fault.
The cause of heart crisiss and fences is to create rain materials on the walls of the rain.
If the pneumonia is cut, this may be why it's the blood tube and preventing the blood that goes in the heart.
And if it gets out of the place of blood, it is fair when the brain prevents blood.
There's a higher risk for people who have had a crisis before.
Ticagrelor, which was created by the United Kingdom company AstraZeneca, has reduced the risk of decreasing the possibility of deterioration.
Today published NICE-clamps are suggested that people are given 90 mg of shopgrelor for 12 months and that they should use 60 mg for two times aspiraine in the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, NECE Health Technology Assessment technology, said: "Only four of those who have caused heart crisis or faults, the results of these are generally devastated."
The fear of renewing is that a person can create a very implicit effect on the quality of life.
Deller shows that the use of ticagrelorum aspirin is effective for the reducing of the heart crisis and fat risk in persons previously experienced in the heart crisis.
We are glad to suggest Ticagrelorun as a timely basis, and we are pleased to increase the treatment options offered to thousands of persons who are expected to be funded by this.
Since information is limited to three years of efficacy and security - the risk of blood risk, the slaughter has not been presented in the suggestion after that period.
PC culture increased the deficiency in muslim areas
The former president of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, has taken a mission from the rule of the report last year.
As the devastating report today shows, political culture of righteousness has been seen in the Muslim communitys.
For the reasons of the "respect of ethics and religion rape" of the former Canadian Officer, Sir Eric Pickles, the police called for the sight of the election observers and the house of officers.
The former social secretariat and our journey were injured, and it was necessary to allow the elections to be held outside the police to protect the electors of the police.
The chosen ones suggested that they might be identified in the sides of those who were given their identity when they were played.
There is a enough time to tell the selection name and address.
The report also suggests that people should be switching on the foot in order to avoid playing two times.
Sir Eric said he'd have to be better protected by those who had a chance.
It has been found on the way to provide better access to the Employee on the decisions of non-official committees or on the decisions of working groups.
"This is not only to protect false oppositions, but also to protect the local government from the wickedness and striking culture."
Report was prepared with the instruction of the Downing Street after the vote in Tower Hamlets in East London.
Last year, a special election court decided to take the President Lutfur Rahman's mission after the resurrections and foreign applications.
The Court stated that Rahman's Muslim community's feelings were "what it was untruthful" and that those who condemned him with racism and convictions of Islam.
Rahman was expressed "what the Canadians believed Muslims were strongly walking in a religious mission to play themselves."
He was so suspected until 300 of the game or the false use of the identity, that was the result of playing like otherwise.
Sir Eric expressed the fact that the country was generally false.
He warned himself, especially on the paths to play with emails - here the old ones of the Muslim community were applied to the island of their own choices.
Sir Eric was found in some suggestions that people should be identified in order to demonstrate who it is.
The report stated: "True ethical minority groups have been undermined, especially in Pakistan and Bangladesh, in the right way to vote on women and youth.
"The fears that the governments have seen these acts because of the race of ethnical and religious faculty of "the justice of the law".
Sir Eric was found 50 suggestions to prevent the operation of the system with the posts of the political activists to prevent the processing of the "hoy collection."
The report from Theresa May also calls on the way the register controls to prevent the use of immigration and social assistance in the same time.
The options will be presented before the options are displayed before the player will be played.
Any person will continue to play after playing the legs for two times.
The systemic controls of the person's advisory to determine the admissibility.
3 years of limitation to requests to play with automatic mail.
It is prohibited that the political campaign officers and attorists have been sent completely by post and posts of players.
Police is authorized to switch the shoes around.
The 1983 historical Representative of the People's Republic has been changed in order to facilitate the crime of fear.
Don't play the shootings, the laws are brought to the outside.
In the people, it is the condition that it should be spoken only in English.
The training that the person chooses is strengthened by the rule that the rule has made it only.
Sir Eric, telling him that there was no offense in the Tower Hamlets case, it was "interesting".
He said, "The Court of Justice, Lutfur Rahman and the Representative, decided that there is no crime in respect of laws and laws."
In the meantime, he was sentenced in the meantime by the quality of the malicious person.
At the same time, he rolled the "service controls" not active in the registry departments.
Sir Eric said, "Tower Hamlets was a warning warning in the last year.
Although we have the honour that Parliaments have created, this is an inquiry and secret choice in respect of the paths and the rejection of certain authorities.

These were indeed the words that they were chosen, and I am sorry that they had come to it.
The CBC was at least 90 times to apologize for the Twitters as a reaction.
Scott Russel was left to apologize for the name of MacDonald.
Afterwards, CBC copied the Twitter user in 90 that reported MacDonald's bugs to the Twitter user.
The network was released an explanation by apologizing fastly.
We would like to express our appreciation for the publication of these words.
Last night, in publication, we forgive our observers, social media and our followers.
We want to explain that Byron's opinions weren't the personality of the face, but the performance.
However, these words were very suitable and unrespectively chosen, and Byron was very regretted about what he said.

"I don't have to say, I didn't want to respect, and I'm so sorry."

How can you protect yourself against weapon attacks with Krav Maga?
The outdoor world is very dangerous but it can help you to be more safe than this Dailymail.com video.
To learn how you can start with weapons at the next place, we met with the head of the New York Central Krav Maga Federation, Rhon Mizrachi.
Before you want, you're close to the back, this video will show you how you can turn the situation into the shooter.
Mizrachi, when you're close to your back, you're seeing the shock that you need to turn back to your first face, and that you're going to dismiss your fault.
Then you'll shoot your weapon with your hands with your hands.
Then when you shoot your shoes, the shock will get two times and turn the gun into this stage, and then the gun turns back to him, and you'll shoot him up on his face with the shooting of the weapon.
When weapon is near, weapon is a similar technique; you can turn your body out of the fire and turn your weapon into the fire, and the shooting can't be fired.
At the same time, you'll turn the weapon out of the sky's shooting area and turn it out of it and reverse the weapon to him.
Does it look like a shock?
Look at the video to see how Mizrachi did it.
But don't forget; if you're not a Krav Maga, it's going to give you the most safe way to shoot your money from every shooting.
Ian Wright has passed to the latest places of Europe for the travel leader.
In English, some of Europe's worst and crazy places were tested in a serious test of dignity and advisory reflection.
The server and travel writer, Ian Wright Suffolk (51), launched a euro banknote to prove the power of the distortion system, a Piccadily Sirki chain, the button of a train bathroom and a phone in Russia.
He used a pamphlet to show him and what kind of work has happened before he couldn't get any object.
However, a trial that would be converted to a film called "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" gave some surprising results.
Thousands of people think that the siphon button on a train is very slow, but in fact, there are more worse bacteria in the smooth lab.
Mr. Wright met the doctors and experts as an increase in bacteria and health during the travel in Europe.
Well, he didn't have an effect in the bad way he left anything in his mouth.
Mr. Wright identified the world to test the fairness of the midst by eating out the weird and wonderful things.
This is a wide mission between the smooth shooting buttons on the train stations, and it has certainly tested the swallowing system.
In the film on this, he said, "I haven't been careful for one of my childhood, and I'm going to smell so many things on the ground, the smell and the water. "
The movie continued, and it proved the reasons of this.
It's the only thing he refused to smoke a puzzle public in Russia.
Example of the type showed the number of glooms on the 4000 university.
If it's necessary to switch up, this number must be under 60.
But in the new hands, there was a Russian public smooth who refused to lie on the 4000 university, under 60.
The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, Fabricant Valio, showed the number of bacteria in different places like the bathrooms.
In his movie he said, "I'm close to being one of the worst things I've shooted in a bathroom."
There's nothing more than that!
I'm not gonna find anything because he's crazy.
The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, Fin sugar products were prepared with Valio.
The company gave Mr. Wright to the lactic asylum bacteria, and Valio Gefilus, which helps strengthen the bacteria and the D vitamins.
Valio's research, Meyve Water and New Categories, President-in-Chairman of the Department, Niko Montarenma said, "We really wanted to offer something new to the students.
That's an impacting exhibition, and at the same time it explains the values of probiotics.
Finally, we made a lot of stupid brain shocks that appeared in the idea of Ian.
They say that the interest in medieval health has come to a global experience.
We just wanted to put the products into a larger connection instead of talking about the products; daily, good and bad bacteria in our environment, the importance of health, and it is connected with the dignity system.
There is a global interest in medieval health, and we would be able to give more information about these smokers in a sense of interest in this situation.
At the same time, I think that the movie shows us that we have a wonderful understanding!
Tom Hakala, the leader of the film, added, "I'm saying, Ian, I want to say some things that I wanted to lie in the film, and I would lose my payment against him."
Of course, if it was easy to say some things to Ian, some were very difficult.
"I'm happy that we're saving some of these smiles."
In 2015, in Valio's analysis, the participants linked 84 per cent of the lactic asylum bacteria with the health of health and expressed that at least 58 per cent of the lactic asylum bacteria was used.

Cornwall Housing was valided for their voluntary movement for 11 weeks after her and her wife had been able to make it difficult for this week.
The event was rejoiced by the calm neighbors who said that their lives were back to the castle.
Someone said, "No one's interested."
We live with them for 20 years and the situation was always bad.
You can't believe how many times we've seen the police here.
"But morning, we didn't sleep."
We wake up because the midst was very silent, and we are not aware of it!
Finally, they're gone, everything's gonna be great now.
Cornwall Housing's neighbouring officer, Adam Fitzpatrick, explained that his family did not work with local farmers.
The family lived in this house for 20 years and was not called the police.
It was shocked and old players on the side of the social plants.
He added: "There is very honourous that the Lord does not take any responsibility for his own and his family's state; it has always been the choice of Cornwall Housing.
It was very difficult because the case was in a degree of degree and the actions of neighbors should not be witnessed.
My team, Devon and Cornwall Police Forces and Cornwall Police Forces are very worthy of the efforts of the community members who are courageous to give us information.
I hope that this development will make the neighbors a measure of calmity, and that it would not be pleasant to anti-social behaviors.
Mr. Fitzpatrick said it was three children who lived in different times, but they were 20 years old.
A slippery bed left in one of the bedrooms after the time.
The speaking workers must be cleaning the shooting shoes around their home.
In 2014, the police's civilians found over 70 grams of strikes, cuts, special pieces, and $1700.00 sterns.
When Skeldon acknowledged the crime against the drugs of Section B, he was punished to the punishment.
He told his money that Lee Skeldon's son died in a car accident in 2013.
After she stayed home, Tanya and her wife now agreed to be a special candidate at Plymouth.
Most houses were found walls on the walls of the room.
The police expressed the way they were going to work in the way they were able to impose their rules.

He said, "It is a message to those who think that they may act as they want to do without any punishment, and that they may be dispersed."
Devon and Cornwall Police Forces, who continue to work together with the media to protect the people, will never be grateful to the Swedish and Antisocial Committees.

The ITV News reported that it is considered to die in a Russian race attack in the Love Area that the group is strong in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old, and his family was dead when he flew from the country who saw the war and planned to return to Britain.
The account "We hope that this situation moves a chain for others, and that it is really dangerous to go into war areas, and that people are struggling to make this choice."
On February 2015, a bus from Sultana and the northern London two students went to Turkey and then to the border of Syria.
Sultana told his family that he married a SUD warrior in Syria and remained in months.

Senate stated that the leaders of democrats Harry Reid, who believed that President of the Hillary Clinton is elected by the Supreme Court for the Judge Merrick Garland.
The President Barack Obama in Senate was to prevent the process of approval of Garland in March until he had shown himself in the month of the President Barack Obama.

Afterward, a speaker named Reid told him that he was talking directly to Clinton about not showing Garland and showing up.
He honored Garland and explained that Clinton's team did a new choice.
Garland, Colombia's office, We are the US Court of Justice.

The Treats magazine works together with the photographer David Belmere, prepared by inspired by Pirelli's 1970 inspiration for 2017.
However, instead of famous and crazy people, they work to find new top models for the United Nations Pearl Family calendars 2017.
The president of Treats, Steve Shaw, expressed that this magazine was different from the old Playboy, because "Playboy is for men."
I do this for women.
Of course, my calendar believes that it's like that.
Shaw said in the press of my calendar, "We must return to the classical smell of women as well as women to see these appearances in the body with an inspired source of inspiration."
Women will want to be part of this project because they're a beautiful artist.
The modeller can send a photo or may be joined to the outcome in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinil goal: Who actually buys the plate?
A medium-year-old man, the only men are swinging in viral.
Let us let all of you say that the white is covered in the real date before you go into the squeeze.
According to YouGov, the Y's bird is not the result of a mid-year-old nostalgiane, which is the result of a physically creating object.
Shortly, wine album sales are mostly between 45 and 54 years of age.
If you're looking at it, it's the least likely to be the 18-24-year-old group.
At the same time, only one of the interested persons is not sourced; emotional importance is; those who love older virtue to hide their feelings (%56 and 53 %) and who are key to stay alone (%69 and %66) people.
So you gov's results right?
This blog, if a news published on the television, looked at the sight of Soho's camera, walking with a green team's swimming shoes before it stopped, and swallowed my hands, and then he said something authorized like that, "We'll take a look."
So let's look at it.
When Soho lost the slow-scale swimming swimming wheels (when the buildings found in the time are now hotels, eats, Prets and paperchases) are still able to have a number of spectacular platforms.
I probably wanted to stop the camera for the next scene, and I tried to get information about the age of different men near the hills and the emotional situations.
From sister Ray (data: two young women, three medium-year-old men) to Reckless Records (data number: eight medium-years, probably a woman in 20 years) I followed Glasgowlu Stuart (55) after dinner after a meeting in London, and looks at the sights to fill a few hours.
I'm asking that you're a collectioner.
He says, "I'm so."
I have about 3000 or 4000 pumps.
These plates that are placed above the image (and sent me with e-mail, and I didn't follow him to the house) spend the walls of the room.
The reason why the alcohol and the single collection of this number is that a result of smuggling can be made; it can get the slights that the money is not enough when it is now out, and it can return to their sales in young and unmetal times.
"The majority of the things I've got in the head of the 70s, I've been too young to take."
She joins the thinking that it's like to stay alone in the plack sales, that it's a high probability of being cutting people, and he adds: "I'm not smoking, I can't drink too much alcohol.
That's my bad smell.
Most of the customers in Wez (25) who worked at Sister Ray are thinking that you've been listening to your gov profile.
However, he also realized that those who heard the return of this model needed to purchase the old plates.
In the meeting I did, I realized that in 1998 or 1999, people's collections were cut off.
The clients first say they're going to buy CDs, and they're going to sell their CDs to get back to the plates.
This can explain the increase in a certain age of persons who lived again.
What about the emotional importance of the plagues?
It takes a few seconds to see that a peaceful community in the same personality has been offered in a swimming world in a shock like Phonica.
According to Wez, some older customers have been able to slowly paying systems.
Some vineal cuts, digest worlds, and may want to smell the smells of the platforms that are known to re-remember their calm memorys.
Wez says, "If you can see the reason to fill a space or the material components as a type of conforor."
I'm also a collectioner, and I think that's most people.
It's easy to fill your head.
"We're like social service officers."
An anxiety made in Nisan month opened that 50% of the wine albums are still not listening to the album last month.
At the same time, 41 per cent had not been used, and 7 per cent has been purchased wine.
At this stage of the story, I'm going to be very worried about the last time I'm going to see the new best in the boss.
This return is a reverse of a remarkable Johnny (42) worked in Sounds of universe.
"I want to take a radiohead blue to put it on the board."
Although this is not represented by a large percentage, it's surely remarkable.
Get more, less music.
There are those who say, "I don't have any pieces."
They're not older, youths, who are at the end of their age, who make new access to this matter.
I see, when I have almost all the shoes to Fopp, I'm going to see that the kitchen's really changed.
There are couples in the age of 70, tourists, young children, and medium-year-old women.
It's better to see the differentity between customers, though atmosphere's atmosphere's atmosphere's atmosphere's atmosphere.
No one seems particularly unlikely, but it is difficult to solve psychological traumas that are disappointed for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27), he's family in Fopp for a few minutes, and he's looking at the placks in my infidelity.
Instead of smelling, he just came out to look at the vitrins.
He says he's not a plate collection option because he's not too winned.
It's so sweet.
It's more easy to listen to music than the computer or other forms, but the beauty of the vine... is sweet like a loved person.
I don't know how to explain, it's not really like.
One of my last stands is inspired by the new injuries of the nephews: Urban Outfitters.
I'm looking at a group of Polaroid cameras assembled in a group of young girls that had a Crosley-placks-placks talking about the purchase of a Crosley plate.
Solda Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac have a full swimming space with the plates; if it's not for a medium collection; a modern and classic confusion.
Nobody looks; maybe because it's just a decoration goal, some are so high as not to touch.
It's a completely artificial vinyl.
But the wonder that the sector hears is that the sector will win more money and the less customers to the depths of Soho, and there's no more matters that can be perceived.
It is not surprising that a demographic group that has more money and more time has more than a democratic group can be more than a lot of more than a lot of more money.
But I'm finding that you gov's results are right at least in the Soho plate beaches; they're not going to calculate the collectives and associations of women in the placeholds, the reality, the place of the plate or the surrounding forums.
They probably work hard in school or offices.
These people are certainly not able to shoot their own Pershore nights in the beaches of the Berwick Chaddes, studying the plates, and studying the plates, and keeping a false 30-year-old television service on their headquarters.
Grönland dogs, the most long-term animals of the world - videolunch
Scientific people explained that Grönland has the most longest life between the skins in the planet.
When they worked on dogs, Julius Nielsen explained that the record belongs to a tenth between 272 and 512 years of age.
The French Court rejected the destruction of the gardens in Jungle camps
A court in France was rejected by Calais's authorities in Jungle's camp in Jungle, which was a thousands of governments.
When the court appeared in this week, Calais authorities were defended to be deleted by a total number of products, hair rates, or 50 cents (40p) of a total of 72 degrees of food in the country camps that were sold in the tea or in a number of euros.
The Calais State was defenced by the fact that these places should be destroyed by a paralel economic creature, which is not payable for taxes, and by the risks that we risk about the fat and sisters.
The assistant groups explained that it was not enough for the increased number of people in the country's field to be offered for the majority of their lives, supporting governments and other groups.
They defend that restaurants are barriered and swimming and unpaidly feeding.
A court found in Lille explained that those who worked with a 72-third counterparty were not legally dismissed, but that Calais Valisin's concerns could be "accepted."
Judge Jean-Francois Molla expressed that the people who lived in "the very dangerous paths" were much greater than the food.
These areas have expressed peaceful meetings for civilians and volunteers.
The book of Cafe offers 200 weeks every day food, English and French lessons, and here it provides advice for hundreds of unrelated civilians in the camp.
On the 170,000 people signed this coffee that was for kids.
In a letter sent to Guardian, this closure was expressed, "It will be a job for these children who are eight years older."
Two non-stitutes, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, Sunday, were found on the 9.000 people in Jungle camp (the highest number until today).
After the gold of the Fiji Class, Britain was satisfied with silver madalia in the seventh shirt champion.
At the end of the end of the Great Britain at Rugby's 7th Championship, Fiji and Persimm, the end of the 43-7th news of the Rio Deomor Stadium.
Fiji gave the first Olympic Matteum to take the golden material of every color, passing, step, support, swimming snake and snake.
After the new history, Britain took the third silver madal of the day as a very bad reward, and could now be proud of the efforts they showed in the opening tour of Olimpiyat's 7th Olympics.
At the beginning of the day, half of the end, the South African team could finally find them.
But, however, a Fiji that was so forming could even spend a 15-person team.
Even if it's not really incredible, it can be comfortable if you think that the Great Britain's least britannic gold's madal will be at tomorrow, that's Fiji's headquarters, Ben Ryan, a English from Wimbledon.
This was a very hard journey for the Great Britain.
Eight ways ago, when they worked with Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Championship.
This time, they've lost someone alone.
Even though this is a painful heir, it is really wonderful for the progress shown.
Fiji did a magnificent start, the players went on the top of the Great Britain.
This was like to run between a swimming bus for the team Tom Mitchell, and the World Section Championships passed 5-0 when Osea Colinisao moved.
In the fourth minute, Jerry Tuwai came toward another number from the right side.
The game was 12-0 and the Great Britain almost could touch the shoes.
Mitchell's wonderful officer pretend Leone Nakarawa's third shipping like the mountain, but it was just to late the number of Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa made a number of right shocks and slowed 17-0 back the Great Britain.
Only a minute at the first half of the end, Nakarawa came from the beginning.
Afterward, Vatemo Ravovo, flying into lines between the Great Britain advertising.
With this number, skor 29-0 reached.
When a team built to play at Fiji's seven champion, it was like that Britain still tried to learn the keys of the main work.
I'm standing down that way.
The Great Britain made great changes, and the Fiji bar closed; the first half of the minute was not a good progress until Josua Tuisova was going to the scene with the perfect Fiji game.
And Norton was found in a trial for the Great Britain and tried to make a number of left shoes to do, but the Southern Denmarks were in the hands of the Southern Coasts who sing, sing, and dance.
It was really difficult to not be incredibly surprising from the beginning of Fiji.
Maa Viliame also worshiped the last pieces on the Fiji game that mustn't be swept in the last minute.
When the Fijians were stealing, they began to celebrate, and the Great Britain stood the path of the seed room.
On the beginning of the day, Fiji, Japan, was 20-5-five-five-five-five-five-five-five, Great Britain also came towards South Africa, and the only number had passed before it.
Kyle Brown, if he had the first half of South African team, took up the numbers of Dan Norton’s head-up movements with the second half.
Anthony's brother, in the first 15th place of England, was guaranteed to the blessed chairman of Marcus Watson and silver madal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning were inspired by the cancer of the antiquities in the world.
These games will not be to a more emotional gold madal, and it also brings an important meaning.
At the end of the first pregnancy, he realized that he could be more meaningful after 220 punishment, he could have winned gold in Lagoa and Helen Glover and Heather Stanning.
There were three voices on the ship, but in the couple of women in England this year, as first women who reached this type of level back to the second Olympicyat madal of the second hole, in turn, Robin Williams' voice.
The judges were very clear, and that was the 39th half of their wife.
We're seeing two beautiful sports on the top of the coal, and it's not exactly clearing the quality of the war.
On the back of each currency of gold, there is a shuttle of the desire that makes an increased profits, and no hands have been able to see, as long as they could see this day, when there were 30 months ago.
As he said, they touched and went.
I've got the cancer in the brain that can be administered with the surgery, and they did it.
If they don't do this, they're going everywhere.
That would be a very bad situation.
This changes your view of life.
He was shocked to Williams in March 2013.
It was so lucky that he could start the treatment at the beginning of 2014, but it would be not known if in such situations, but it would be able to delay the most devastation.
I had to pay for it, so I had to get better.
It was an encouragement for me.
I was in the hospital, and I walked up to 6,9,15 meters in the garden, although I told some steps that I was shooting enough.
That's how it started.
It's a driving trip to himself, but it's a little bit growing to him.
Afterwards, he was in Williams, who talked to his own concerns in the morning, who was a gentleman morning.
Stanning, who was a hundred centuries at the Kingdom Society, said, "I was emotionally devastated this week, maybe it's a little weird but seriously great."
That's what it means for me, and Helen, I and Robin, is shooted again.
I've spent three years with Helen and Robin.
If Robin wasn't, we didn't, so I want to tell him my greatest thanks for being the best actor of the world.
I couldn't find a better person or a better actor to work.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning hadn't lost the shoes for five years.
The two were keeping a hard rituity that couldn't be reached.
The last 500 meters from New Zealand and Denmark teams, Stanning and Glover, were still not missing the power of Stanning and Glover.
We've got our own mother.
Helen's watching, watching the process.
It's really important to get out of here.
We did a good start, and we didn't work to do anything unbelievable.
We didn't wait for the planet of the air fabrics today, but we just wanted to win the end that we had been out, so we did it.
The two will give you a year before you decided what it's going to do in the future.
You have a marriage to be joined in the next month, that Steve Backshall was a television master.
Now he just wants to get out of this stage.
I didn't want to say that's my last mine.
It's going to make a lot of pressures.
She took six months to see I'm a Olimpiyat champion in London.
It was very new and I was very stressed.
Here, this is about four minutes.
"That's a better feeling."

Snapchat "animal" effect, as a Asian channel
While Snapchat tells us that it was forgotten by an animation for this filter, some observers express that it is racially unreasonable.
Snapchat makes it possible to play with an absorption level by changing the reality of 150 million users every day with the merger.
If you're aware of yourself, you can become a character shocked from a roy Lightenstein picture.
Mercedes are unfavourable, personal changing tools that have been developed on 30 million every day.
The slow steps that are shocked are slowly disappointed in the memory of the smells.
Snapchat mergers were faced with the accused accused that the political classified or white-sized tons of snacks were ideally offered to be a beauty.
Thus, this week they offered users, because of the lens that brings their eyes to the eye, the sweet dental and the sweet child, some of the employees have been cut into the direction of the "Asian mask" which we swallowed the Asians.
And they wondered that these circumstances did not mark a greater problem about the diversity of the company.
The weeks and angry, The Verge and Motherboard's news were shut up and a day later Snapchat was cut off.
The company was found in an explanation: Mercek was not prepared for the processing of Asians, but for a time.
However, for the observers who had my racism experience, they remembered the painful stereotypes.
Others generally refused to face my life.
Grace Sparaani, who was shared in a twitter about a root American student and photos, said in a email that is "the pain and disappointment with the most deceased expressions".
"Additionally, when the effects of the filter were reversed with the bad Asian slaughter, it was difficult to discuss.
This is not only a Asian mask, but also shows that it is a Asian mask at the lower level.
Snapchat, it's not the only company that has a cultural technological mechanism.
It seems that the American culture, the meeting rooms of the governments to Hollywood and all of us are in an everlasting interference with diversity and capability.
And Snapchat's root, racial diversity can be able to be in the form of a higher deterioration expectation.
When Katie Zhu, a 25-year-old report, created a small appearance for a user of Snapchat, said, "It's more difficult to see that these types of movements aren't like an older."
He decided to remove Snapchat's account and call everyone on this way.
In the media report and telephone report, it expressed that snacking in the Snapchat's applications of racism was attributed to the diversity of dimensions.
Ms. Zhu, most of the company's leader team, which was white men, ended his article with a label: #SnapchatiSilin.
A Chinese root American Ms. Zhu said, "It is not possible to make such decisions or people who work there and root different roots, if they are not safe or calm, because different races between the staff are not sufficiently different."
Other observers share the views of this Snapchat's big-scale fashion.
Enterprise does not share the numbers of staff by touching the particular company's situation.
On Thursday, Snapchat's staff refused to share the racial roots, but, according to one word, the company has raised its responsibility to be accompanied by the non-represented populations in a short time before.
Ms. Zhu said that the Snaapchat would close the account from its own open, and he added: "I wonder if you can tell us that it can't be more users like us."
Congress Panel, the military authorities told the Tahrif Officer
In a report published on Thursday, a Congress Panel report reported that the United States Headquarters, Irak and Syria have made a better report on the war against the Islamic State of America.
In a report of the Saraja's Armed Service Committee, the Governing Committee and the Defence Understanding Committee, the Officer of the High Committee has prepared a work commission prepared by the President of the National Countries, and he stated that the "respectfulness" analysts of the Office of the United States were to change their evaluation of the Islamic State of the United States.
The army's decision, which is known as Centcom, is to check the United States military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
In a newspaper on the report, "the advertising results by the Clear Centcom leaders are typically more positive than showing the realities of the EU's terrorism prevention, and are more positive than the analysis created by other stakeholders. "
Kalifornian Deputy President Ken Calvert said, "It is not accepted by those in Centcom, and it is a bad analysis of our warriors when they are offered up to the top level of decision goods".
The leadership in Centcom has reached the top level of the construction.
The 10th page report also explains and analyzes the continuing problems in 2014 and 2015 the Central Commissioner's work on training for Iraq's forces.
Everything, if it is not so clear that the reports of the State Obama Administrative Authority are commanded to change the reports, the analysts are explaining the pressure of the Centcom leaders in the report created by the Islamic State.
In the report, "In the first half of the year 2015, many Central Commanders were more positive in the recording of the filing events. "
For example, a Centcom Authority expressed that a large military attack could be made in Nisan or May 2015 soon.
The Muslim, the second largest city of Iraq, is still on the control of the Islamic State.
Mike Pompeo, Kansas's Deputy Deputy Deputy, said in a beach, "It's been clearly understood after months after research.
From the midst of 2014 to the midst of 2015, the most desperate leaders of the United States Headquarters of the United States have made the committee's advisory results, such as the unprecedented report of IZD in Iraq.
Once the civilians learned that the analists were launched by the Islamic State, they were struggled with the concerns of the Islamic State.
The report published on Persians will continue to look at more enthusiasming findings.
The Department of Defence also provides another Centcom investigation of the general advisory.
The Chairman's Democratic Committee has published its own findings, which have participated in some results of the Secretariat's workshop on the Persian day.
The President of the Committee's Democratic President, Adam B., said in a ship, "it has been a very thorough process between Centcom, DAE and Iraq's security forces between the 2014 and 2015."
According to Mr. ship, this process was "the late publication of the spectacular results", analists launched their moral deterioration and "he has not been sufficiently placed in the circumstances".
However, Mr. ships and democrats expressed that the results of the White House's Centcom analysts were not achieved by the press of the "determined or political reporting".
The main results of the conference study were announced by Daily Beast on Friday.
In our last August, New York Times reported that a Pentagon advisor who was opened after the Centcom analysts was opened by a general study.
He explained that, as a Pentagon word, the Defence Officer continued to investigate the concert report of the defence defence officer.
However, he said, "It supports a health diagram on this important thousand security issues in some situations, with the defence community, and with the defence community.”
The research, the Irak and the Syria will shoot over the issue of the bomb operations in the United States in the United States, which is a defence that has been taken by the Protection Authority every day.
However, in the past year, the crimes have revealed the question of the Central Commissioner of Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crises that can be reliable for the honest assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanian, Libya and other crisis.
The Islamic State advertising, the Centcom Assessing Analyst Gregory Hooker, President George W. Bush, has been defended by a small force in Iraq, expressing the fact that he had been thinking enough of the job in 2003, and has been discussed for a period of 10 years.
Mr. Hooker has played an important role in the resignation of the Islamic State.
The authorities have indicated that, although Mr. Hooker's team explained the way you were in the direction of Mr. Hooker's team in the past year, the air attacks in Islam's hands have been built to sell the oil of the oil of the terrorism group have not been impacted in the savings of the terrorism group.
But as The Times stated in September, this finding wasn't out of the Commander's.
Centcom's chief of the time, General Lloyd J. Austin III, remained encouraging to the explanation of Senato's laws as a very positive evaluation of war.
General Austin Nisan has been expelled in the month and the officer Joseph L. Votel, the Central Commander.
The United States Women Prepared to Communication with Britain, Chin Hockey Team at the back of the 4.
One day after Katie Bam was taken three goals against Japan, the United States took the first two goals of the Cyprus hokey team.
It seems that five goals in two games have to be sweared, but Bam (27), said that it was not sure that she did not even do the same thing before.
He said, "I don't have any idea."
I'm not the people who store their goals.
He knows that the United States are the first time in the United States who continued to share Japan on the front of the Olympic round, and after the Persian day, the first time that continues to be named in Britain.
The United States and the United States will be against the first cutting game on Saturday.
Each of the two teams had the right to get out to the end of the circle, and the game will determine who would be the first and the second end of the group.
The first team that finished his group games will not be against the strong Holland team, who is leading to another group leader.
But after the Saturday, the Americans created an extraordinary vision after the London Olympics who had come to the 12 teams.
Bam was in this team.
He was grown at Blue Bell, Pa., when he first was three years old, and he was the youngest player of the team with a 16-mill-year-old team.
Because he didn't get into the last frame, he escaped his olympics in 2008.
Afterward, he and the team were in 2012 that most of the things were gone to the way to his friends.
The next year, a British adventurer Craig Parnham was brought to the mission and began to change the work.
Bam says, "Cultural change, mental change, physical change."
We're not working as in London now.
We've been going out of my transformation.
Tonight, Bam took the first half of the first half with a shooter shooting near.
It was not yet a gallery on the Indian tour, but the team was able to protect the skoru 1-0 until the third area of Bam.
He made a long path from the side of the hill, and then he was shocked up and shocked the shooter and led the Americans to 2-0.
Melissa Gonzales took the last goal in the fourth area.
This was the first game that Jackie Briggs didn't eat a goal in the first three quarters.
It's open.
That's Bam's.
Parnham said, "We're a good place now," but it depends on the outcome of the Saturday Day.
Trambolin Dinginity in the middle of the Olympic Reactor
Whereever you're, if you're flying, the olympics continue.
The activity in Rio de Janeiro represents a full record and work, and it seems like it's never done or not.
It's like a three-third baton communicated from the Olympics in the first century to the Jimnastics.
Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or Michael Phelps and Chad Le Clos, you can't listen to the TV, you can't read a newspaper or you can't listen to your neighbors in a coffee.
And Logan Dooley.
The first time Mr. Dooley, who joined the Olimpiyat, may be one of the names of the TV advertising that you'll feel good, such as a gymnastic or an excriminator.
But Lake Forest, Mr. Dooley, from California (28) is fighting for gold madals in the trumpet.
Olympicats do not have any activity at the equivalent level.
There are sports that are not known as globally far away from the center: air shoes, octets, baminton, fat.
It will always be with us, with the word that it is long.
But if I have to tell me what I love personally, I would like to take care of the trambolin's secret magic.
Even though a Olimpiyat active has been known for all the trumbolines of Sidney games since 2000, a few people who have asked that it was a Olimpiat sport within 16 years.
It may be a regional guard.
The United States, if they sent attorneys for the seat, never wins in the trambolin and there wasn't a loading loading of the end of 2012.
In men, Chinese and Russian rewards were in the share of Chinese and Canadian women.
From China to Dong Dong and Canada, Rosie MacLenan will try to protect the golden madals they took in London this year.
However, the trambolin is a degree of attractiveness, and it may be thought that it is a slightly degree in an unrecognised Olympics instead of the school.
I have to admit that I'm not an intelligence here. I'm just interested in the matter.
There is a funny potential (such as the line that has never been created to be similar to the movie), but it also reflects the two sports of jimnastics and spectacles, which are mainly assembled.
The word "Trambolin" comes from the Spanish word "trampolin", which means "tramplen".
The champion shops strike nearly 30 feet [30 feet] in a large trumboline and stopped making a decimal move (burkma, pike, salto) before they flee on their feet.
According to the Olimpiyat program, they are evaluated according to the Ikra, difficulty and "the time of shock."
16 men from 17 countries in Rio will fight for 16 women.
The most common advancement in the olympics will be forwarded directly.
In some situations, the hope to take the Madalya must be able to go back to the point in the golden search, and in some cases, the retreat should be more speed, more faster and upward.
They're not only on finish lines or starting walls, but also on the television there's another difficult line; the world or the Olimpiyat record.
This is the least effortful asylum, implantation, and weight; it is sufficient for a observer to shoot their eyes.
But that's what I've found a sweeter when I look at the games.
Trambolin gives you all this.
The trambol moves right up.
The targets do not move forward.
On the top right, the stronot looks unlikely like astronot, get up, cut down, and swallow up, and swallow up.
Of course, it's not possible to say that it's not a recabet or difficulty, but when the rutin end is, it's not a humble work to get out of the distance, just as the dream of the time and the place.
It's so cold if it's cold.
The orders of women and the final ends of the Sun will be ordered at 13 a.m. in Eastern hour, and the men will be on Saturday 13 again.
NBC will be published at 14.00 p.m. every two days after the end.
They promise a silent and wonderful moment in the entire midst of Olimpiyat stupidity.
And knowing the Wall Street Journal says that if the United States are suggested soon before the men's gymnastics are just going to offer a man's attorney with an attorney, we can tell Mr. Dooley that he's waiting for the new imaginations.
For a long time in Ethiopya, "Bir Nesil Protest."
Protests in the Ethiopian
The demonstrators who requested political change in Ethiopia faced a violent leader of the government.
The Witnesses say that many protesters have got dead weapons in battle with the police.
To shoot the Ethiopian?
In the past 10 years, one of the most enthusiastic peoples of Africa and a rapid growth economy and the Western.
However, in the past months, the government was opposed to protests, striking the country to swallow more areas every day.
Only last week, thousands of people have found the main political call for change.
According to the groups of human rights, the government was not very painful.
The witnesses said that the police's offices shot a lot of weapons and killed them.
When the protest that we've been thinking of over the last year or this year's beginning, it appears to be the security authority that the rest of the young people who have to stop their hands against a wall.
The United Nations wants human rights authorities to make a further study at the moment.
He said a group of United Nations Criminal Group, Somalia, the project director Rashid divorce, "It has always been harder to keep this country in a place and will be more difficult to progress."
After Ethiopia, Nigeria is the highest people of Africa, and it is to be settled by the Western.
The United States Army and the Embassy Services are working closely with Ethiopians to fight the threats in the region to be Somalia, and there are many small countries that see this help from West Africa.
Ethiopia's economy is incredibly growing.
A new banking train in Addis Ababa is effectively improved.
And the streets are generally silent, safe and clean.
Although the best example of democracy in Ethiopia (the people's rights groups are continuously understood by the pressing government) the country was very limited to the warfare of the country, which was effectively supported.
Most of them were sent to the past. They were arrested, killed, or moved into the farest sides of the wilderness.
But it may change the situation.
Seyoum Teshome, a university professor from the Middle Ethiopya, said, "If you don't give them a choice other than protest, you'll take these events."
Youth is in full protest.
It's in a protest.
Many of the impressions of the coalition in the shifting force of intermediate use have been available.
After the extremely organized area of our past year, it also took the last gap of the party and the complaints, and now it is able to control the 100% of Parliament.
At the same time, hundreds of people who have lost their lives in Haziran also increased the limits of Eritre, who has been able to fight.
Analysts, Oromo Freedom Chamber or Ogaden National Freedom Conference, are afraid of the re-armed groups in the mid-year-old years.
There are some factors that explain why the painful feelings are covered under the surface for years.
It looks like the first shuttle, the smart phones.
Only a few years ago, when the Ucuz’s smart phones were communicated with the Etiopian social media.
As the government, especially in protesting times, he was often able to communicate with the Facebook and Twitter, most people who hide their positions through Internet browser servers.
Some young Ethiopians said they've gathered this way for protests.
Secondly, Oromos and Amhara, two major ethnic groups of Ethiopians, increased the enthusiasm.
Oromo and Amhara aren't normal.
For a long time, the Ethiopian press was to dismiss the most of the Oromos, which were political and operating in the political and trial regions of the Christian mountains.
But this is also changed.
A Oromo leader, Mulatu Gemechu, said, "We're going to gather and work together."
The largest protests appeared in the Amhara and Oromo regions.
Most Amhara and Oromo think that Etiopya, who created about 6 per cent of the people, has been unjustly dominated by the Tigrayan ethnic groups of Tigraians, trade and political pressure.
The third reason for the uncleanness was the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, former historical leader, served as the head of Etiopya for 17 years until the death of an unexpected disease in 2012.
Looking out that everyone couldn't see, he was thinking that it was a tactic shoe.
Analysts say that it is able to confirm his first signs of distress and to encourage and defeat the legs.
The phone analist Mr. Dick said, "I don't have this basic information."
The new chief Ethiopya Hailemariam Desalegn was chosen in uncertainty to fill the place of Mr. Meles.
Mr. Meles, who is from the Tigray region of north Ethiopya, is the south of Mr. Hailemariam.
Analysts say that they couldn't win the security services that the Tigraians controlled.
Finally, there was more blood cuts than more fear.
The last experience of Ethiopia's complication was protesting after the defense of the government's initial election of thousands of analysts in 2005.
In the precautions that were followed, even though less than the last month, many protesters were killed, and this complication period was more rapidly passed.
The experts were grateful for the planning of the visions of Etiopya's leaders, such as the new banking train, and the recording value for poverty.
However, it is clear that it does not stop the growth of the current Ethiopia government.
And this is a dangerous and ethical thing.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, a city of Amhara, attacked Tigrayan's ownership and increased the hate of Tigrayan in social media.
Analysts say that Protests have left the United States and the other people in West in a strange state.
The American government used Ethiopia to visit Somalia as an unhuman aircraft, but soon it was closed.
If we want to support the Western clear democracy, it doesn't want to be part of this ruining area.
Mr. Divid said, "It's," and he added, "It's like to walk on a lot of bits."
Donald Trump explained Obama's fund on the top of the D.O.D.
Donald J. Trump, the Sunday last week, several times the President Obama and the Hillary Clinton, tried to make sure that the Islamic State of the terrorism group is not seriously the most important cases in the environment.
This explained that the President-in-Office made new questions on clear communication with the US people.
At the same time, it was a strange point that they tried to explain the brain that they did not think it's what they're doing to defend him in the process.
Mr. Trump, after he found this proposal in a measuring night, was an inquiry of the fact that President and Mrs. Clinton really thought that Mrs. Clinton had established the DIS.
But on Saturday morning, when I sent on Twitter in the morning, Mr. Trump said that it was only a shocked expression.
The Sender showed that Mr. Trump's report showed that he was completely shocked up a day ago when he explained that he was serious about this crime.
When you remembered Mr. Obama wants to destroy the IUD, the guard radio program Hugh Hewitt said that Mr. Trump did not believe this island when he tried to help him.
Mr. Trump, after the slaughter, tried to change the campsite room.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economy in Michigan this week.
Thursday, Mr. Trump wanted to turn back to this matter.
He again explained that Mrs. Clinton's offers would increase the payment, and that she was hard to find his conversation.
Mr. Trump used the defense.
After the last month of the month, the Russians had a view that Mrs. Clinton's emails proposed to be in the slaughter of the attack, they explained:
This is near, Mr. Trump makes it difficult to strike the political lines and put back where it is necessary.
Ruth Sherman, a communicator who has used both the Language, said, "True, testing how it has reacted by those who supported this message, and a arrangement which is to make it "repeat" in a way dependent on the reaction."
However, at the same time, it gives the brain to the scene, and he knows that it is uncertain to filter it as much as when it is seen from different pieces.
After we past the last days, Mr. Trump was a lot more aggressive, instead of choosing the air for the general selection kitchen.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist contract published on Saturday showed that Mr. Trump was back in North Coraline, Virginia and Colorado, and that Mrs. Clinton was a lot of struggle in Florida.
How much Mr. Trump generally does not apologize for the adverse things that Mr. Trump say, but it is accused of cutting out or understanding his way.
But in the last few months of the presidency campaign, Mr. Trump's smile, which remains more shocked to investigate, it's hard to leave his reliable supporters, who remained faithful in the situation of supporting him.
The former New York City officer Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Mr Trump's most supporters, made the end to defend the island in the Persic Day with the CNN.
When Mr. Trump asked Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton's question of the truth in the state of Islam, Mr. Giuliani said, "Bence is a political punishment."
When he was watched at one point, ISA was an unknown, small institution before Obama, they were completely innocent months, and that was why the soldiers were taken from Iraq.
The majority of the Deputy, Mrs. Clinton, is trying to defend the failure of the Obama Deputy, who was the Foreign Department, with the Middle East, and the reason why IUDs grow.
On Saturday, before the communications in Pennsylvania, Trump continues to defeat the news media on Twitter and act against him.
He said, "They can't do this."
Some democratics said that Mr. Trump was in a way that he was not inadequate for the president.
Renewed with us in the Cafe Greenpoint, which is not the first time with the prices.
If you don't have Verb Cafe Wi-Fi connected in Williamsburg only to an old pool that worked with a kitchen, he was offering great coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, it couldn't be able to make the prices in Bedford Avenue.
In 2014, Verb's place in 2014, Soap Cherie kap sold samples in the form of the shoes.
The districts were close to expressing that the final loss of this city was struck.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote to Twitter: "New York's change, I know, but I can't believe that the CBGB is gone and that Chelsea Hotel is dismissed, and Verb is now a swimming crowd."
But New York's city is to rebuild as much as it changes.
On November last, in Greenpoint, a Verb Café was opened in northern.
New Verb Cafe Wi-Fi connects and accepts credit cards but protects some old workers and the same simple bond.
The coffee is well.
At New Verb's head, the long-term worker of the castle is a new owner and a general Cisco Rodriguez, Cisco Rodriguez.
He joined Verb in 2001 and remained until the end.
A customer said he would be grateful when he invited him to finance for this new place.
Mr. Rodriguez (36), left most of the same thing.
Verb's using the same district machine for cymits and buying an expresso machine from the same model.
Anyway, the old Verb's lights were re-used here.
But Mr. Rodriguez said he wanted to provide some changed experiences.
New places are added.
The passive-eye-e-coat sandwichs are also designed in the menu of the closed and sophisticated coat.
Esmer-Prince Caseses.
Kaffee doesn't do bird service anymore, but it offers food water.
9 months later, Mr. Rodriguez said that the former officers started to come in a decision-making way.
He said, "One former customers didn't have to head with the prices of Williamsburg."
We're on Tuesday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of these customers.
Ms. Oliveira (34) lived in Williamsburg and often went to Verb.
After we moved to Greenpoint, he never stopped walking on this way.
He said he's looking for coffee for a while after Verb closed.
"I realized what I love is that the coffee and the culture of Verb."
Now it started to drink the coffee again, but last day he chose the swimming fleet of a new sweet coffee, instead of the wonderful coffee.
He went to Verb as regularly from 2003 by another advisor Tom Rosenthal.
It's going to be there before she's worked and always gives the same bag.
"Another day, I was going to enter the seventh, without a surprise, and they were prepared for my daily smite smite."
Photos Mr. Rodriguez said he wanted to make changes and add new materials to the menu.
Even today, Mr. Rosenthal is still taking a smuggle, sometimes makes a little change with smite, eggs, and peinture.
Mr. Rodriguez said that it wasn't shocking the old mechanics in the swimming area.
If you look at it, Soap Cherie's owns offered a special sweet to Verb by using the coffee cold coffee.
Mr. Rodriguez said, "I think we can still accept this proposal."
And the traditional Polands of Greenpoint would have got this coffee.
One of the new customers didn't translate the menu to the League, and Mr. Rodriguez said he would soon find this area to make his new neighbors feel good.
I've got other advantages of the new thing.
It wants to swim and sell a frozen coffee.
The cafein's likely to expand the swimming building.
Most customers have enough to find their old favorites for a new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and he was very regretted after the mechanic was closed.
When you opened a new mechanic, Mr. Whitt said you could get the coffee into the house.
He said, "I had to do this."
The Depressive Food of Criss in the book "A Square Meal"
Soon after March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat on a dinner at Oval Ofis.
President Roosevelt, who was shooting in the pool, loved to eat the fifth Avenue, like the shooter of Maryland.
On that day, the menu was much more sweet: domates sweet eggs, patates patates sweet and sweet shoeting.
Jane Siegelman said, "It was a goal to smile with distressed people."
And her wife Andrew Coe added, "The same time it was a message to the Americans about how they had to eat."
A couple living in Brooklyn Heights, a food historian.
Mr. Coe was the last book "Chop Suey", the Chinese kitchen in America, and Mrs. Zegelman told us about the foods of life in the nights in the Eastern Area, in the book named "97 Orchard".
The new book they worked together, and the "A Square Meal", which will be published by Harper on Thursday, tells the history of the American foods during the Great Buhran era.
In 1929, the year of the crisis in the Flatiron area, which showed that they met an advertising advertising in the Sandwich Bus, was found with an advisor to eat in the Flatiron area.
Mrs. Zegelman (54), graining grain and oil sandwich, prefered to sit the patates and swimming powder.
The twice found that the rule of the murderer was able to discuss the eatings of the Crystal period.
Mrs. Zegelman said, "The people were very popular."
There was the smell of the earth, the smell of the skin, the shoes of the shoe.
These were made from a sweet thing that was sweet with a material.
Think that you've been sweet enough to eat at night.
Mr. Coe, you've got your face.
He said, "I must have sit on the side of man like a fool."
In the past years before the crisis, especially in the racial areas, the sophraes in America were open.
Women smelled food for men who worked in the farm, and were used to eat, dinner, and dinners.
1. Americans sent food to the Europeans who died from hunger in the World War. "A Square Meal" explains the history of the country 'A Square Meal', which is now being a central of the country.
Mr. Coe explained why he and her wife wanted to write about this: "It was a time for the U.S. Center for the dinner."
It was also an inquiry of the new grain, which was equally concerned: soums and sweats, which comes to the basic production of smoke, and Mrs. Zegelman said that "a wonderful way to evaluate the remaining foods" could be hidden with a slippered slippering snack of sweats.
He took the place of the grain, which was more sweet.
For years, a channel that is located in the United States food center has come to be divided into a typical way.
It was interestingly confused for the value of the calorie and the brain, and the full feeling of satisfied has passed to the front of a quiet or general complex understanding.
Mrs. Zegelman, when he investigated the tarts for the book of drinking, prepared his food in full-screen sweet smell.
Mr. Coe said, "It wasn't a part that loved her dinner tonight."
Mrs. Zegelman supported this, "This was the reality."
There's no interface point on the shooting floor.
Most of the households are a priority of this.
Among them, the Federal Economy Office responsible for Louise Stanley's home economy experts, directed the country’s food food business as never before.
They encouraged women to be "Ttarruflu" in the newspapers and magazines, and expressed their respect for the struggle of creative spagetes.
"A Square Meal" is a scene of the leizing loks in the history of the "A Square Meal".
Mr. Herbert Hoover's answers to the government's open citizens, as I'm going to eat.
On the other hand, he was able to eat the only Iowa farmers in his childhood, and he was able to make millions of intellectual foods.
Mr. Coe said, "He liked to eat the kitchen of Europe as a salt fish."
He was eaten in a golden floor room with sweet smells in their dinners.
It's the last degree of reality.
If she didn't encourage her to imitate her, President Roosevelt could have been in the same mistake.
The book tells us that Mrs. Roosevelt was just prepared in the White House until now "not to eat the most sweet, but the tables that are the most wisely prepared at the same time."
After the country retreated on his feet, most of the ways to eat at the crisis were left.
Mrs. Zegelman says that it continues to be used to smell the calorie and feed, and the science's food.
She explained that Mrs. Zegelman's mother's dinner was learning a lot of things when he wrote the book.
Mr. Coe said, "He really feared her to eat."
Mrs. Zegelman told the old memories: "There's been really sick of people."
He's got a cremative shooting time.
After the bathrooms in Eisenberg were gathered, he and Mr. Coe took a sweet in the house: the rule that the President Roosevelt had eat at the dinner.
Mrs. Zegelman said, "It's called a shocked ball," and he added the most frequent number of counts, he didn't give a warm name to this sweet tarmac.
There was no shocked snack; just a skin, a little sugar, water, and a shoe.
Everyone shocked his shock when he found the coffee in a tragic way.
It wasn't so bad.
Mr. Coe, he took the second and third.
He said to his wife, "Biraz would be well a part of the cut-off."

Red condomes are supported to protect the tyre in Tanzania.
The surrounding in Tanzania uses an uncomfortable way to prevent the tyre's inhabited areas, and they're putting them a sweet red condomes.
The government was effective and this idea was just a few months ago with the United States Central Protection Unit to identify this; it began to train volunteers in northern Tanzania in the villages, not to prevent their animals from harming their animals, but to use the four steps.

He said, "I'm just believed that friendship will be planned in the tribs and friendship."
The FETW has been handed on the funds of Gülen.
In the case of the Office of the Fiscal Technology and Organization of Criminal Discrimination, the Directorate of the Directorate-General of the terrorism Technology and of the Organizations, the non-related persons and organizations of the FIEC/PDY, the financing of the financing of the financing of the FIFE/PDY, it was opened to the Adanda 2.

The lines of the explanation of the Guerrence are:
I wrote that in my last 5-6 months, as they were going to get out of my mind, they were going to say, "I can't put them up, but they can't do it in the command chain."
I didn't know two things; first of all, respect and deepness, the eight-year-old command of the General Commissioner Jandarma, and Mr. Cumhurscan.
The man who fights the most struggle of the Countries is when he chooses his identical snakes, but the most important character of these is not.
A lot of two faces.
One of the most important evidence of the expression is that it is so deep.
The CIA's incredibly supported.
CIA, this shooting was shocked soon.
In 2014, the Court of Justice says that in 1971, the Vehbi Countries had met Fetullah Gülen in the east of the Vehbi Body.
It says that people who care for these works are the most closest time of relationships between the CIA.
Our weapon forces paid the US staff's departure, and then one man came out of it after he didn't remember it.
When we learn this in 2014.
After the court Bay's letter, it wasn't an explanation that lies.
It's just to be arrested, isn't it?
Who is it?
He went to Pennsylvania two times in the last 25 days before Adam was back two days ago.
He's been 109 times out of the universe since 2002.
When you're bringing it all together, you need to investigate it, and all of those who are now missing to the United States who have gone from March 1999 to the US, they've got to be investigated.
It seems that they went to Pennsylvania with a vessel.
But the CIA's real interviews can be identified here, and many people have been sent to the U.S. people who have to be able to switch from their intentions.
There's Wikileaks' documents; it's built a shoe, and it's working with the CIA.
It's been made works to show those connections with the CIA officially.
I said that it was an award in Avni Pennsylvania, I was two years ago.
The man who works in the headquarters works for Fuat Avni.
But that's bad, that's how this information went down to the CIA, as well as the Pennsylvania.
Gülen's destruction depends on the three-month cutting; one of us said that a friend's people was creating, well-better hypothesis, even Erdoğan's movie.
I said three feet, or a board support.
The shock of the questions, the innocentness, the slaughter of the right, the support of this smuggle.
Other two feet; support political, national support.
National support is still available.
The only thing to break political support is that Baykal and MHP's managers have been signed by the FET.
Once on July 15, he uses the Holy Spirit, and opened the eyes of all.
He says, "I'm not doing my face."
I'm saying, "Holy Lord, these girls are seeing a lot of changed dreams, they send me, I'm now lawful, because they're not right to make it with the dreams."
The one who spoke in that voice, Barbaras Kokratt, who saw the sons of his friends, and our prophet twice to two.
One cop in Nusaybin.
According to the information received, long-weapon terrorists were shooting with long-lasting nail arms in Selahaddin Iybi Mahallesi.
The first shooting was a cop, a police officer was shocked.
Two terrorists have been inevitable in the fight against the police.
The police's been removed to the State Hospital of Nusaybin.
It's operating in the area.
The thresholds have not been discarded by TV publications.
On September 15, the special television, which was importantly shared in the opening of the income, continued to publish a technical staff in Turkey.
That's the hero, Akkaya...
Akkaya, who expressed in the reading of the news in TRT, explained that they were cutting the publication into the public psychologists, said, "I've seen everything by thinking that my friends were a crowd from the helicopters."
They asked me to make a weapon and shut up the publications.
I just closed local TVs.
Then I gave them away from the building to telling us we should go to the locks.
I've been over 20 minutes in the part of the ancestors.
He said, "I've stopped some cables here, but I didn't touch the publications."
The Darbecists brought the TV experts in Turkey while they couldn't stop publishing the publications.
These terrorists were arrested by the police instead of the incident three minutes ago.
When the Darbecies returned to the building, he realized that they had continued TV publications on their phones for about a hour later, and he told Akka to whom he lived in the death's fault:
That night I was on 8:00 a.m.
That's what he called us.
My friend was an e-defence and electrical system.
We met the tea as at 21.00 a.m., we've got helicopters on the top.
There were more aircrafts in the helicopter around the helicópter.
We saw their lights.
It's probably an inhuman air machine that could be seen.
They fly from the front of the helicópters.
11 years ago, sir, I've been calling the snake for the first time I've seen so close to the flight.
Then it started no movement.
We learned that the bridge was closed when we looked at the nights.
In that case, our general officer has indicated that they would come to the unforeseen friends.
We learned that all the publications in TRT's publications were decreased.
The TRT's publications were deleted for five minutes.
I called TRT's chief, but I couldn't get it.
Our control station said that TRT publications were back and started to read the news.
Our General Assistant Assistant asked the Director-General to TRT's publications to be slowly discarded.
TRT 3 channels, we began to work on to discover the publication.
We heard that the Chief Binary star was called "this is a shooting."
The order of our department's TRT's order is to put us into a little-related psychologist.
We stopped TRT, we heard the helicopters a while later.
We went out, helikopter shooted everywhere, everybody was shocked.
We've been hidden in a building behind.
We were 12 people.
We went back to the helicópter, they entered the soldiers.
A few of our friends got soldiers.
We came out to leave them alone.
I've seen our general officer's help in that time and said they're cut off.
The soldiers talked to themselves.
"We'll shoot one of them, they're afraid."
Then they sit all in us.
Commanders began to forgive "Who's responsibilities will not ask again."
And when we heard the speech, we thought, "We don't know about the meleket, but there's an instruction to call us "TRT."
I mean, there's a circumstance.
That's what I felt that I've stopped from my own life.
I said "I'm".
I got up on my bed before I don't know what I'm going to do.
That's the only thing I thought was that my friends of the helicopters were opened fire.
I thought that the 10-15 friend was the city of the Nizamite was, and I was thinking, "I'm going to kill you at the end."
He said, "You're gonna cut all the publications out of the TRT."
We have a system that we've monstruated when we get the local channels off.
We're released 80 of 200 local channels from the room.
This is my mind room.
There was no national publication among them.
I'll stop it and tell you you're discarded, at least it's helping you get out of the outside.
Or I said he's going to the place.
We agreed that we couldn't get out of there in the Netice.
I said, "I'm gonna stop."
I've stopped out one of the local channel packages.
I stopped the power button that goes to the engines we can watch the national channels.
So all the screens were cut off the signal.
I told you I'm gonna have to go to the moment to get ready.
He sent me to the front to the two soldiers.
I opened his room, and one of the soldiers said, "Shut there."
He's able to take the gun.
And he said, "You'll cut all of you, no one will stay, I'll shoot any of you at the end, that's you.
I said, "You're gonna see all that'll be frozen, because I'm now passing out of my life, and I didn't say anything else.
We're in the station, I've stopped the local publications.
We've been on the other front.
There's a system that will be close to 20 national channels.
Once local channels were disabled by about 20 monotors.
My Lord helped us, and We did not difficulty, nor lifted them.
They believed in the answers we gave.
They weren't over.
It was quiet to us.
After they were out of the front, they asked the place of the trap.
I said, "I don't know, I'm a TV publisher," he asked, "If there's a electrical."
I said, "I don't have a electricist after the last month, and the team comes if it's shocked."
In fact, there was an electrician at that time.
I was thinking I didn't shut up the publications.
I thought I was gonna cut them off to play the soldiers.
They're a little calm for they're thinking they're shut up.
They couldn't think about them.
It's been on waiting for the group.
Only a hour later, when they opened the TV in the chamber, they saw A Haber's publication.
He entered it, soldier.
He said, "My commandant did not cut the newspaper A."
We came to the eye with the commander.
He said, "Let up."
I got it.
Then a soldier said there are publications that continued.
'The channels are published in the Republic'.
"We can't do anything to them."
And he said, "Where you sent one, you walked all of us."
The Darbezers flew from Turkey with a minibridge.
I saw the pictures that the soldier who took me into the bathroom and gave me water was shocked on the ball.
They fired three times and shooted them.
My friends also thought that they were the same soldier.
On our way, they shocked that soldier 'evlat'.
It's probably a man who made the soldiers.
They may have been able to save him.
My name tells Akatya's statements that the first police team came from the guard.
The police teams were surrounding helikopters, and they came to get the most magnificent medication when they learned that the security officers were describing.
40 minutes later they returned.
When the police teams arrived, he didn't see anybody in the Turkish outdoors.
Only 3-4 minutes later, the police told Akkaya that the experts came to the building of the Samaritan TV, "He called the police teams, we're Turkish staff, we need to get safe."
He said, "With the police's identity, four of them were cut into their phones, and they said, "We've been shocked."

Az educational, old futbolist
It was a slightly slightly slightly slightly shocked up with the popular Slovenians, whose old-educated futbolist Recep Tayip, who was leading to a dignity of Fetullah Gülen, a thousand schools from Tashkent, who were a higher educational companion of the University and the Education Institute.
On the top, the translation of a article in the Foreign Policy last week.
Erdoğan's smaller educational and former futbolist, which has been attributed as an extensive enterprises, which has been clearly honored by the Gulen museums, and similar articles are often placed in Western press.
Afterwards, they tried to explain the "Why is lowing the relationship in Turkey and/or Western America?" in the theme, "Why Erdoğan."
The Western Reaction in Turkey is possible to imagine that analists who are aware of the history of Turkey as an incredible situation in Erdoğan’s time.
In fact, if statistics take place, Erdoğan's first tenth years of time, it can be read as a time when we have reduced or mid-term western reaction in Turkey.
Zira, in this 10-year-old year, had to have a good relationship with the United States and synchronize.
"On-minute" of Erdoğan's twenty-minute Israel, some of the flags of the slaughter of the slaughter of the slaughter of the slaughter of the slaughter in Syria, the slaughter of the slaughter of the U.S., and then the President of the United States, the President of the United States, the President of the United States of the United States, who has not been able to switch up in the slaughter of the U.S.A.
Let's forget that our democracy could not be supported until we lost 247 people, as we say, to the EU countries who have been able to demonstrate the failure of the US, so we don't have a democracy in Kerry's first conversation, and that we hope that "Pace and Ethictor" will be built in Turkey, democracy and elected government.
So, because Charlie Hebdo's worker was killed in Paris, in Turkey, and many leaders from the world have been protesting, but how can it be forgotten that any of the 247 people who have been killed in the past month has been killed in Turkey's 'mutefik' for a Western country?
What do we say that a few times a year for the public question would be sent by the Presidents or the senior representatives?
How can we evaluate all the US and the US grandmasters who have been on their past and visiting the bombs in Turkey, the Great Military Meclis?
In the first two weeks of Egypt, when the EU's first representative was sent to the top-level deputy leader, if it remembers that "democracy is rebuilding" after Kerry's visit, the Western countries who are in support of the Democracy is supported by Turkey, is that they are not in a normal manner in Turkey.
Even Gülen is allowed to live freely in the United States by 95% of the people now.
If I'm on the top, I think it's clear that the West America's reaction is only a situation that could not be explained with Erdoğan.
He didn't even say that he was thinking of the US effect...
I mean, we've never thought we'd've been able to do it.
You see your own people a little, "We are condemned," those who think like him, can they steal the same strike after the 15th September night?
When they saw how this people had the government and democracy, did they finally answer the question "When we're wrong?"
But how many questions have to be asked?
The subsequents who have made a mission in various cards and the right to use their own government weapons, they now accepted how he was accepted to enter the "Hain" statue and wants to shoot from the foreign governments.
We should see how we live in a mental distress, and how distressing people are going to be disappointed.
When the bloody brain comes into the Darbe...
Does Turkey's cities have a look at being used in Syria's towns for those in this event?
Why bombs the parliamentation of your own country?
We shouldn't have fallen in an error, such as waiting for adverse acts.
Other responsibilities, but I'm sure everything's responsible is not only FET.
The political civilians, kins and hatred cards have made the necessary impacts on the traditions.
And they believed in the unbelievers that all the rules of abroad and the unbelievers were unbelievers.
When the arms of those who hate their own people were given to their hands, we finally saw how they shooted this people.
The way of democracy, the way we know
I'm saying something quite simple: on 15 July, Turkey's night, the FETF taste in the soldiers, the snares, the snares, the 250 cities, and the savings of democracy.
But on 15 July 1992-2002, 2002-2012, 2012 and later.
There are three changes prepared in these three times: economic, social, political.
Two major social changes were prepared: the neighbors and the neighbors moved to the center after the red metropolitan metropolitan.
I indicated that this movement was through the metro.
I've also shooted to the most important social changes that you don't say and pass into the metro.
The second big changes in the same correction are the bridges and ways.
It is easier to understand how the way and the bridges are modernized.
The way comes, economic and social changes.
And we've changed as political assets.
I've seen this story with the bridges cut on Boğaz in Istanbul since now.
Demirel made Boğaz's bridge.
This was the village of the village movement in the 1960s.
The second bridge we have changed as the 15th September, to walk in the same right path.
This is the relationship between the environmental center, even the pathways.
That's the sign of how you look at a social change route.
Demirel and Özal paid the big kids in the center.
The central was to have the idea of them.
The AK party hasn't done a third bridge for years.
Because he was walking with all the speeds.
People who come here have been placed in the towns.
It was created a little closed system in those areas.
Local governments from the AK Party gave people to work, social stage, and they hear the AK Party.
So the kids were not divided in the center, but wanted to get their political knowledge in the area and to come to the center after it.
The AK Party was discussed with the debates (1992-2002).
These debates accepted the hardship of the slaughter in the center of the stones, not the rest of the stones.
In 2002, I moved on the way I mentioned in the AK party, the kitchen was politically shocked, slowed into political and apparent.
Now, look at these, the building of the 3, is equal to the democratic struggle in the 15th September.
So, it's the history and the sociologs.
I'm going to add a more size: the AK Party's hamile is not limited to the Stanbul bridges I'm talking about.
There's something more interesting: AK Party now makes all the cities with the centres.
It's driving through two bridges.
One, the Osmangazi point.
Two, a 1915 bridge.
Add the ways.
Turkey's going to be reached from Trakya to Ismir now.
You know what this means, then the Shimir will be a grandfather.
Let's say, the AK Party's will now take Ismir out of the outside.
Now, Bursa's now with the Clan, Trakya's cities will turn into other five and social coasts.
That's it!
15 July, the witnesses are the stars of this great mass.
In Fernerbah, Van Persey, and incredible.
Fenerbah, Grasshoppers's game's preparations were made in the morning.
On the Cantu Tesisler, Director of Technology Vitor Pereira, who started at 10:00 a.m., a total of 1 a.m.

That man who condemned the Aziz star to Gülen...
New developments have been made on the Shik Operation, which is directed to the Fenerbah.
A program published in CNN Turkey and explained by the FET, a journalist Cheeserin Gülerce, "Sport has grown the words of Aziz stars on him."
"What do you do with your Fethullah Gülen on my planet one day?"
When he shocked this shooting, he put Fethullah Gülen to my Aziz star.
Why did Aziz's shock to my star?
The President of the Turkey's most side club, in this sense of mind, can hurt himself.
He used his expression to decrease the Aziz Star.
It's a statement from the Faik Light, the important lawyers of the Shik Case.
He came to the vision program published in the Light in Haberthurk and explained the man who was scientist of the Aziz star of the FET, the slaughter of Fethullah Gülen.
Here's the words of Faik Light:
My Aziz star says something about Fethullah Gülen to Kalkavan.
When he comes from Azerbaycan, he's in a special flight.
Aziz is a pretty man, and he tells them with the smuggles when he slaughtered.
Those shoes may be a little bloody.
Some of them can show the answer.
These clusters are grown in some place.
It's not a job to be accepted with such funerals as Hac, as he went to Umre.
That's what it's saying, it's so hard.
Of course it's not the only problem.
It's called a football team test.
Some futbolists and governments from the Galatasaray Club and Hakan Thank you...
Muharrem Master: A different matter
Trabzonsport President Muharrem Master, put his friendship to Fenerbahja.
The Master who brings Turkey to the issue of all clubs, "we are around this country with 79 million."

If he has a problem with the FET, if he was wrong, I'm going back to Fenerbahja.
"Trabzonspor and Fenerbahs are different."
The prices of injury were explained.

"We identified the life price of 17 lira, 17 lira, the living kilograms of the insect that we have cut as a second class, and 15 lira."
Karabulut told the people who had to take care of the victims of the citizens who had to take care of the animals that were not sold in the past year.
Especially animals need to be careful of the obsolete cube.
It is also important that animals are healthy.
So when our citizens get the victims, they can check the skins in the passport.
In the outer appearance, the victim must be alive and resurrected, and he cast the shoes on the ground.
It's not necessary to be salt, no signs like a ring.
We saw that animals without victims were offered to sell and sold in the past years.
We need to fill the two-year-old animals with a sacrifice.
We can see this with the dentists of the animals.
And two years old, the teeth we've been shocked as a animal's head.
But the older animals aren't out of these teeths.
It's like a great animal, but it couldn't be cutting tooths.
The shooting dentists are soon vary because they've been large as others.

Afterward, he took me and put my friend in the car's bag.
When I put the bagaja, I'm staying in the door of the bag.
I'm too swearing.
The shooter, who heard my voice, shoots the door of the shooting.
I've been able to correct my hand.
Bagaj's door closed again and brought us to the village of Narince.
He said, "I've got us out of there with the ambulances to the City State Hospital."
When he learned that his family had not first been circumcised, his children had brought their children into the bagage.

They first brought my snake.
15 minutes later, they brought my cousin.
Gerger's here, Commander Karakol.
He said you were a complainant.
I'm going to be the case everywhere.
I said I wasn't a lawyer.
Then I went and looked at the car that's my shirt and my cousin.
There's a lot of blood on the bag.
Then we learned that after we cut off the kids, each two blessed ones put into the car and brings it to the hospital.
He's putting my upstairs upstairs upstairs.
The men say I didn't put a bag.
But we're on the back of the car.
He said, "I can't do anything."
From Narince's silences in the village of Nahmet Kaya, "the shooter who brought the kids here."
The kids, the blessed ones, took out of the car's shooting.
He said, "He did what he didn't even have to do."
The grandfather Osman O. is: "How is a man who shoot these children?"
It may be a accident, but people may die in the accident.
But it's a brutal thing to keep the blessed ones and take the car in the hospital.
We're a follower until the end of this work.
One of these kids is cut off with death.
The other's weight.
He's bringing the blessed ones in the car's shock until Narince to Kahta.
God's mercy.
You don't have a such a wild event again.
We're wearing up.
We're gonna be a lawyer, and we're not gonna leave this job.

Watch your children's business.
Dr. Scientific Giray said that I need to spend with this reflection for the first age of children.
Doctor Giray, who orders the reasons why we're going to appear in the child, says, "We're a case that seems to be a 3-4-year-old."
Most kids are ordering their heads.
The child who has a need for the child is to spend his skin for rewarding his skin. 1-1.5 years later, he orders to miss his mother's ability to relax.
"When you're going to smile, when it comes to sleep, when it's injured, and when your mother's leaves, we can do not act."
Dr. Wigin Giray said that the effects of the health of this conduct were to the health of the mother and children are not sufficiently in the relationship with their children.
The leg shows a deep effect on the shape of the child’s teeth.
We don't have any pressure on the results of the dentists above, but the dentists on the bottom are shocked.
This takes the way the path of the underground, the shoes and the teeth's level.
This physics will be in the form of illness of conversation and closing.
In the age of six to seven years of age when I was not solved, Dr. Giray said, "We can protect our children from the shine and additional problems.
"But this is why children today have to be held under control, such as the eyes and ear controls of children."
New cell at nearly seeing: Trifocal Lensler
After cataract treatment, patients don't want to use their eyes naturally.
For many years, to solve this problem in our hospitals, we have already been using a lot of spectacles.
The success of the trifocal treatment in this area has been made further steps in the past periods.
Trifocal lens is the feature of a right view in the swimming trails, not only far or near, but also in the squads defined as a trace.
Distant, close or interface treatment of illnesses
In case of vision disorders, it represents a point we're often used in our daily life.
For example, we're searching for computers that we're able to move on our skin or that we're defined as a brain size of 60-70 cm.
As Trifocal lenses have been corrected, they do not need to use our patients in any way close or far away.
Another advantage of the Trifocal pieces is the decrease of the night.
Dr. Volkan Surmerier's Diseases: "The normal disaster of trifocal tri-pharmaceutical lens, which has been applied to therapy, is not a difference in the normal treatment treatment".
The trifocal medication of our patients is able to deal with the health of the eye in 7 to 10 minutes.
And the next day our patients can return to their normal life.
Specially, it is a operation of the quality of life for people who use the computer, who love the reading, and who have more active life.
You can also find eye diseases to find out that this process is not appropriate for you.
It's not useful in the heart surgery!
Varis is a disease that's often growing in the last few years.
There is a primary priority of the genetic approach; long work hours, long-term difficulty in staying in the feet, and increases the variety of seats.
Do the skins use the hearts in the surgery?
I have any, and what can I do if I get a heart crisis?
Here's the answers of these questions.
There are two types of partial systems on the leg:
There's a very deep earthquake system we've called to bring blood to the pulmonary sprays, and we're going to get the leg's skin blood.
These are the deep femoral ven and the surface femoral ven.
The problems in these groups are more vulnerable, neither closure can be closed, and drugs are applied to remain open to these diseases.
There is a path that brings blood to the legs and combines with the deep earthquake systems that we call on the surface system.
This system consists of the small-scale landmarks we've called two large and two-scale-scale-scale.
There can be no need and diversity in four of these damages.
In heart operations, the surfaces that can be used are largely safe.
There's no harm in the body of these cardiovasculars, so they can use in heart operations.
However, it must be healthy to use these cardiacs in the heart.
Because heart, it's a very important organ.
The operation of the surgery is being accompanied by the operation or by the laser place, and the deep populations also reduce the labour charge and the healthyness of the feet.
A wrong faith among the peoples, though different, can be used as eye.
I'm not going to use the snacks in the hearts!
There are other injuries that can be used in heart operations.
Eight of therapy systems that can be used in the heart surgery; under the coffee, on the side and in the brain.
As a result, waiting for the use of a variety of shadows for the heart, and it's unreasonable to worry about it.

A meaningful message from the Super Kupa from the Bed & Breakfast
Wait the president of the Galatasaray Sport Club, a explanation was published before the Super Kupa Finali playing between Galatasaray and the Virgin.
That's what he said about the unity and coherence of the Turkish futbol:
The Dutch Sports and Galatasaray, two rounds and two eye clubs, will be against the Super Kupa in Konya's Great Thursday night in the Arena.
What's the first, or the last game that leaves our two size clubs back?
But as a time, it's a reaction.
As we all know, our country was a big bathroom on September 15th night.
The Introduction of the FETÓ/PDY of the Palestinian Protection of Terrorism (FETE/PDY) which is covered to our democracy has been engaged in the unity and coherence of all the groups of society.
We paid it as a nation for the night.
We've been able to give them.
We have too many gases.
This painful importance of democracy once again remembered the need to be a judge and the importance of civilization in these lands.
That night, the representatives of Turk's sport were the only voice against the heart, and he all took place together with the democracy.
In these critical days, we need much more than always.
I'm telling you that the new stage of the Futball season, which is soon before our favorite President, Solomon Seba, and the first year of our club, was called Turgay Sheen, is the first start of the Turk spot of love and peace.
I hope that, at the end of the game to play before the half of the galassaray and the five-five-five-four tribs, it would be a scorr that wins will be our country and Turkey sports.

Rihanna's population's film frame
From Hollywood's most important film series, Ocean's people will return to the spectacular names.
In the new city of Serena, a famous Barbara songman Rihanna, Anne Hathaway, Mindy Kaling and Helena Bohnam Carter, who had been talking about his names in our future days, was aware of how Sandra Bullock and Kate Blanchett would get place on the film.
The trial starts after 2 months

When the British gold closes, Scot Callum Skinner flys home.
The Great Britain team, on three months of 2012, shocked the Skotish Callum Skinner, in the slope of Rio, on the quarter of the winter last night.
Glasgowlu, a 23-year-old employee, carried out the mission of the Skotchen Sir Chris Hoy, and he was honoured to the new Zealand clothes, which was struggling with the New Zealand.
Today's six Olympicians had five years ago, in the four-year-old activity, Britain was shocking a shock.
And despite Hoy's slaughter in March, they ended it again in the long time of the Criminal World Champion in London.
Well, the problem between London and the primary starter was that Jamie Staff was changed.
And when the Indians came out, they did it.
Today's inheritance has created a space to fill Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.
He saw the potential that Scot was now realized, and the British attractioners did not stop Skinner.
Four years ago, if the Olympic record was cut down with Hoy, India, Kenny, and Skinner, and the first tour, the New Zealand re-defined this record.
And the britannic trick went out to the golden diplom.
Inde, if he was just a little back there, Kenny took the team before it and Skinner's got it.
It was a major part of the change in this strategy by using Hind's greater tool to accelerate him, Kenny, and especially Skinner's time.
Today, as the BBC's intelligence counterparty, Skinner, Kenny and Hindes were watched when they were out of the pody.
Glasgowlu, a 23-year-old Skinner said, "This is a honorable reaction."
I'm just here to do the best thing I'm from the body and to make my name.
Finally, we cut the Olimpiyat record and we swallowed the world champions.
That was really incredible.
It can't be a better way to win this.
Inde, after we win confront with Kenny and Hoy in London in 2012, he announced that the shooting was decreased after the beginning.
Afterward, he reacted to this smile, and there was no way to ask Britain's smile.
This time, there was no such problem for an incredible confer.
India said, "We were like in London, with all the Great Britains in Stanton."
Only a team built three months ago.
It's really unbelievable that we lost a lot of world partners again in the Olympicians.
This is just an active, a madal, for a nation who wins the seventh half of the country in London.
If the progress we've been shown in the last five months, we're waiting for five days to get successful in the slope.
Kenny shows me that Hoy's only one of the Olympics is very unable to imagine that it's not possible for three golding records to get back.
It's just 12 years old from Hoy, and he also was born 23 March (which means Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister's birthday, a sanctuary of britannic sports) of Kenny's sixth madaly and a golden madalize.
This means the same level as Hoy.
Kenny, it's gonna get out of the sprint sprint, the sprint will start today and take three days.
Boltonian, a 28-year-old, said, "I'm just going to get this.
The team's actives are always the best actives.
You can win with your friends.
If you have to be honest, people feel themselves alone when you win.
And Hindu said: "If one wins more golden madal, it must be given to him a reminder."
It's just a lot of good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull completed the first time to run four miles [4 km] to the team.
Pusts 3:51.943 were completed.
World records 3:5.659 defined by gold madals in London in 2012.
First tour and end (2:42) today will be defined in the second section and you should take all the attention to the Wiggins.
Once the last time the authorities called him to spend a contract with the officers in order to spend his size.
Women will continue and have been completed tomorrow and have reached a world record from Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milgavie for the period 4.13.260.
The Great Britain team is trusting the strong bicycle team to get the Olimpiyat games in the middle of the time and to win many madals.
Well, after showing great overwhelming in London, the expectations in Rio were very low.
In the back plan, the technical director Shane Sutton has experienced a lot of bad developments in the month of Nisan, and that the major names such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton were made.
But the first night after the powder shows that the decline of the end of the Great Britain this time can be reproved again.
It's suspected that the energy agreement would be the future of Portland's zabe.
Portland's aluminum will come and hundreds of businesses in Victoria have fallen into an indefinite explanation of the fact that some of them have a treatment agreement on the product.
This movement appeared after the decision that Victoria’s government was taken on the start of this year in order to continue to work on the testing of the Victorian government.
The sabit summer of 20 years is filled in November.
Alcoa could be under the job risk until 2000.
Any closure could be caused by the fact that the work is right or indirectly understood by 2000.
And there may also be an impact on lymptomation because Victoria's entire electricity has smokeed about 10 percent.
In 2014, Alcoa Point Henry closed the snake, and this last year opened the switch of the energy santraline in England.
Alcoa lost the Portland's shipment, and it's against the shutting risk.
These developments have appeared in a few years after the speculations made for the future for Australia’s feeding, and soon before the testing of the smoke.
Loy Yang A energetic energy generated in the large aluminium zabe in the Latrobe Vadi, explained that the three other owners expected to be moved in a fascinating way to deal with their agreements.
The majority of the tests belongs to Alcoa and Aluminium's interface, and China's CITIC, Japan, has smaller feelings of Marruini Corp companies.
"AGL is expecting to continue to work at Portland tests, and that means that the swimming pool will continue to continue to the physical electricity demand."
AGL expressed that the agreements must be in the course of the "risk-related agreements" in December 2016.
They will be completed in 2017 because the agreements have been a 12-month feasibility period.
The energy company said, "But this is why AGL will continue to wait for agreements in the year 2017."
In the case of the AGL, in 2018 Mali Black and Next Powers Powers, it is limited to me to a strong cohesion for electrical prices.
AGL expressed that the value of the agreements in the accounts was decreased from 187 million to now.
Alcoa expressed the end of the agreements that the decision was: "It does not affect the ability to handle the situation of Alcoa or to enhance the electrical snake."
The US company signed a 20-year agreement in 2010, and this agreement had to be held in December, but has not yet explained why this agreement was not put into place.
The analysts argued the possibility of closing the economic disorders of Tomago in the Portland and Newcast in Victoria.
AGL's responsibilities on the beginning of this week, Stephen Mikkels said that there were about 600 megawatts every year, and Tomago uses 900 megawatt energy.
In the case of both of these costs, it will be reasoned that the [electric] price’s [electric] prices would fall in a range of values.
And as a manufacturer, this is not a good development for us."
It's not only the star of the Kardashian TV program, but Kendall, in the door of the Seventh Number of Vogue.
The model and director of the mother of Kris's Kardashian-Jenner's fourth daughter, Kendall Jenner (20), is at the door of the fourth September number waiting for the USD Vogue.
Kendall, who showed the sons of a Estee Lauder Marka Apostle and in the weeks of Milan, Paris, and New York mode, was proclaimed from the Instagram account on Pershore.
Kendall wrote, "I smile with people I loved when I looked at this door."
After the explanation of the door, all the Kardashian-Jenner family (which was a senator of Rob and Caitlyn and the most loved show world of all, Keeping Up, Ryan Seacrest), was a classic final for the castle of her sisters: they were actually preparing a surprise party.
Even though this is about all the children's television programs at the clinical ring of each "this birthday" section (Seacrest's 8's morning's a line of film box with "Do you forget you?") Kris said, the other girls should also be able to make this proof.
You know, we have entered a new kardashia period with the development of Vogue in September.
Kendall's chief, Kim, might have passed him on the door of Vogue (the head was shared with his wife Kanye West in Nisan 2014), but a success in the head of the September Head.
The number of Vogue's September, the most sample of the year.
With the remaining remaining of the coffee book of a mode (Fashionista confirmed that the post of the 832 pages of the last year's publicity was contained in 615).
The explanation of the open star is closely observed, and the pictures of the magazines have been opened before the last two years.
There is Naomi Campbell, Linda of Evangel and Kate Moss between women that were sent in the castle.
In the past few years, it's placed in the castle to the famous people who make the model.
Oscar, the rewarded Dior apostle, took place in the castle of Jennifer Lawrence 2013, the next year, was discussed with Lady Gaga.
However, in the situation of Ms. Jenner's previous category, which is defined by the magazine, it may say that the environment is very good.
These people are not the young people who are known to have a friendship or a real shov star or a good Snapchat video.
These are all women who have the talents, who are predominantly sweetting in the sector.
Beyonce, located at the door of the last year, passed one of the best times of Lemonade's carriage.
Of course, everyone's not happy for the success of Jenner.
Because the real shov's past, Jenner's mode world will always be disappointed.
In May, the original Victoria's secret model, Stephanie Seymour, Jenner and the committee Gigi Hadid, called them "the visions of mind."
When Jenner's news out that Vogue would get out of the door, it turned out again to your face.
But it seems unpleasant to be shocked.
Kendall Jenner is on the door of Vogue's September.
It's a super model with its own word.
He's out of Marc Jacobs.
Estee Lauder's got you from the foundation.
He sell his pictures in payment of the wall with your sisters.
Cindy Crawford's photos are sold in the LOVE magazine.
And in the empty times, maybe only a brother Kurtney and their children are in a real show.
The social support centres are turning to 160,000 people every year.
When the sector is prepared to create more financial decline in the operations that still are prepared, it turns back from the social support centres of 160,000 people on the most unprotected decline.
In Queensland, the three of five persons (the age of the people, the immigrants, the unprotected workers, the violence and the unjust decisions and the similarities) are turned back to the unfair legal advice and representatives.
The social support services of their children are prepared for more delays.
This legislative support centre, which is intended for the month of our previous year, is planned to be funded by more than 30 percent of the federal funding.
The Queensland Director James Farrel, Social Support Center, reported that in the last report of the National Unit, thousands of people were recovered every year.
Mr. Farrel expressed that the federal government's decisions would not be recovered.
He said, "Queensland's social law support centres are inadequate as a chronicly financially supported, that means that thousands of people do not reach the service that they need to be carried out."
Those who are fighting with the power and struggle with the power of self-related relationships, the workers from the family and the unjust way... are faced with the problems of all the law-wide, and this report does not help them to reach the needs.
The federal government, 30 percent of the financing that was funded from June 2017, is to stop starting without helping the Queensland cities.
We call the Office of Justice and Senator of Queensland to return these financial declines when people are in the case of the law.
Last year, governments, the legal support financed the national average levels of financing.
Now we should consider the Palestinian government to do this important work with the social support centres and the peoples who have served these.
After a person's weapon, Donald Trump's campaign team was sent.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign team was investigated by the reason that the North Carolina Operations's Director's operations weren't struck with a person with weapons in February.
Well, the case was opened by the Vincent Bordini, my former writer in the Premier Sea camping team, was explained in the case of the court opened by the Vincent Bordini.
Bordini explained that he was waiting for the situation for months but then he realized that he wouldn't be.
As he stated at Bordini's defense, the Director, Earl Philip, "it took a gun, put the right shooting shooting to the door of Vincent."
According to the ski, he learned that at least four people lived the same test with Phillip after he found the local and regional campaigns.

Re-committee
Turkey, which is expected to enter the largest funds of the world, has been released from a silent silent torba law.
It was decided to rediscuss the reason why the foundation was missing from the mechanism, but it was retraced in the commission without any change.
The CHP Millennial and Plan and Best Commission Commission, which was assessed by the CCP Law, said, "We are certainly reacting to the workers' deficiencies of the CHP as well as the Plan and Best Commission's Commission, "we have to be taken out of the channels of the Camuya's existences, the deficiencies of the workers, the deficiencies of the unemployment of the work."
Turk, which has been prepared for long-term sources and projects to provide long-term resources to the government, has been issued from the law of the Fund's law in the way it has to be viewed by the government.
However, today the AKP has re-elected the plan and sweet committee with the same proposal.
A member of the CHP Commission of TBMM Plan and Belarus, the former United Nations Millennium Officer, informed the CHP's concerns and concerns on the proposals of the Fund.com.tr.
He said: "When the plan of establishment of this time was in the law of the torbage Commission, our former Marine Office of the CHP was proposed to be viewed by the Deputy, the respect and the concerns of our crowd.
The government, who accepted this view, turned back to the decree.
Once last night he came to the committee.
"The Honour seems to be grateful about it to be taken out of Meclis in a week."
"We are the most inquiring of the law offering this law."
"The existances belonging to the city, the degree of the employees, the deficiency of the workers, the funds of the unemployment planned for the unemployment, will be set up without the personalization, and they are unregularly satisfied outside the meclis and the dealing with no responsibilities."
This kind of funds have been established by Russia, China and Power countries, which are the oil flows and the extent of trade and that the fund has been financed so, "We've seen opened."
That's why the fund will be made from the sources of the people's money.
The total of 100 billion in the unemployment focus is planned to switch $5 billion from the unilateral funeral funeral fund, which has been brought to workers difficult.
And he said, "But this time, that is the money of the full people, you must be in the test, and that money should not be subjected unwanted."
The Cruz, who shocked that a fund that has been identified by the government's sources, that is not acceptable to be taken outside the Meclis control, has reported its concerns and concerns about the offering of the Fundation Legal:
The works and operations of the assembly of such a large existence, the debt, the responsibilities of your name are not possible with the test of the unfavourable firms.
Happy is that you have to be the guard and you have to be a slight thing.
When the law offers, there are no governments on my guards and supervisions in the existence of the Fonu.
It was not limited to how much sources would be switched.
No one will ask how it uses.
It shows the need to finance large projects as a fund.
We don't have to make an unprotected fund outside the bubble.
Why don't you get it in the bunch?
And when it comes to the minds, it is naturally, "Why does it go away from my curse and Meclis?"
When one of them was found in Fonu, he continued to say, "If there is no need for a background."
But if the government is insured in this, then, in other countries that this type of measurement funds have been established, we must provide the current national standards in Turkey.
Good trial and responsibility mechanism should be set up.
It must be set up in a way to give the account of the money that is used by the citizens to the end of the end.
The Decreeer, which is designing the absolute reaction to the Commission's Legislative Legislature, "I'm glad that the AKP listens to our recruitment in Meclis, especially after 15 July."
In this law, we hope that ACP will listen to our manufacturers.
We are opposed to the use of millions of existences as a regulatory, the deforestation, the question of the use of those who are using it, and that they are not psychological trials.
He said, "If you want the Fondation, it may be a good thing if you're going to do these pains."

The police is looking for those who have witnessed that a number of cars in the Persian mornings in the afternoon of Pershore.
It's happening, about half a night after the Vaud box, at A1 near Morges.
The Vaud police said that in a beach, the woman had bed in the darkness of the night, and a few cars were shocked to her.
A few vehicles cut to be a sweet 49-year-old Swiss woman who wanted to kill him.
He lost his life in the event.
The police expressed that he was meeting a few of the drivers, but some didn't confirm, and asked them that everyone who was in the case would be able to find them.
The lawyer Gilles Hofstetter was explained to Le Tribune in Geneva, "It was opened for a punishment as a "faceful" name for this."
However, it is still not known that the drivers will meet any crime.
Is it possible to shoot off?
"This is what the law should be confirmed," Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the past five years show that the drivers are not responsible for them.
Each two cases in the newspaper (the two were drinking a car in darkness), the drivers were ruined at the middle of the night in the car in the middle of the night.
Last year, in August 2014, a man who was close to the Payner in A1 in a night, was not guilty about the death of a police officer, because of an intelligence of death.
In the court, the 22-year-old victim was a drinker and the way he was shocked.
The court explained that the police officer, who responded to an emergency call, was slightly used by a police officer, and that a man was in the way "issuing an inconsistent and inadvisable situation."
Their information about this event near Morges must be called the police number numbers 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus's time was suitable to live
According to the New NASA Climate Model, in Venice, there were time to live.
NASA Goddard Space Works developed a model to detect the past of Venice by the scientists in the Institute.
The model was designed to determine that Venus's hot, warm, non-water surface, and a full of CO2 atmosphere was not in the same way as the world.
Scientific people were explaning Venus's low speed in the past with the atmosphere.
But the newest ideas are that Venus's shoes can have the same world as a atmosphere, and it's suggesting that he can return to the slow.
The model also looked at the antik Venus's soilography.
Although the planet has been more than the world, there may have been a time to protect enough water and coastal change with fast-related constraints.
Ancient Venus, the same time, 30 percent of the same time, was more than a slight sun.
GISS scientist, Anthony Del Genio, said in a newspaper, "It was able to make Venus's turn to the sun on a GISS model in almost two months."
This opened to the rainy that swallowed the surface and protected the surface against the sun source of the sun.
As a result, there was only a few times more cold climate temperatures than the world today.
The model has made a similar story for Venus's planet scientists as a hypothesis.
Although Venus has a good way to live, he was swimming to the light in a few billion years of rain and ultraviole.
The oceans crossed and destroyed the water with the ultravillol light.
He's lost hydrogen, and only the mortal insect remains a permanent atmosphere of carbon dioxide, that's what we know today, Venus.
The researchers shared the results of the new Venus climate models in Jeofic Research.
Patrick Roy dismissed Abalanche's agency.
Patrick Roy, expressing that the team wasn't given the right to say in the process of decideing, he denied the office of the President's office.
Colorado Administrator/Genel Director Joe Sakic stated that this development would start looking for a new actor.
Roy, a 50-year-old age, said, "I've carried out three years of driving in Colorado Avalanche's headquarters and hokey operations with my President's missions for energy, patience and decision-making."
I thought how much longer I could improve and how much higher I could get up to the depth of this team during writing.
In order to make this, the man and the VP hokey operations must be in the vision of the vision with a perfect sleep.
Moreover, it must be the right to speak in decisions affecting his husband’s companion.
This isn't still matched in the current case.
Sakic thanked Roy for the impact made on Roy's team in the year 23 May 2013.
"Patrick told me today."
He thanks everything he's done for our establishment, and in the future we're going to give him a lot of chances.
Roy came to Jack Adams Prize in the first stage of Ligi at Abalanche and the first stage of 2013-14.
The club wined 112 pounds, and he gave the first ring to the team, but Colorado was shocked to Minnesota in the first age of play-off.
Abalanche passed the goal 39-39-4 in 2015-16 and took less than five points necessary for the second joker area in the Western Conference.
The honour list Roy, both Montreal Canadians, wins four Stanley Coppers to be for Abalanche.
The Northern Denmark workers are continuing to see their meetings.
The Northern Denmark took a grief army for the payment of the oil employees, and the heads began to discuss a new meeting tour.
The Petrol Strip Services Company is to be run on the platforms in the North Denise platforms, which operates Grev Dutch Shell against Wood Group.
In a rural beach, he said, "We decided to start restarting the process for the solution of the negotiations with the World Group and the RMT.
In the past few weeks, we'll have a new view on the start of the next week, and we'll have a number of meetings that will be held all day to make it possible.
The employee shipments expressed that this protest has been the first event of 25 years against the payment rates that can be placed by 30 percent.
Wood Group, this year, because of the unprecedented pressures in the market, it has decreased about nine percent of the payments made by North Denise.
In 2014, the company's decreasing process implemented the cost of 10 per cent of the loaders in the sea in 2014.
The company said that it would provide the area necessary in order to pass from a deterioration period in the market.
She took thousands of people out of work while the English energy company was putting operations into the BG Group in the process of joining the BG Group, and announced the plans to leave the oil and gas operations in the country to 10.
Energy enterprises are loaded by the low-energy oil prices that are born in the European Union in Hazirian.
The Spanish parliament, Dave Anderson, will discuss one of the largest employees in North Denise this week's beginning.
As he said, the North Dealer is taking the importance of life to the regional economy.
He said at a beach, "We need an effective economy for most, not for the least part of the North Deputy and the country."
Although we have been sleeping about $7 billion in the average of the past five years, in 2016, new projects in North Denise are expected to be less than 1,4 billion.
Kepler measured the speed of the stars on the Earth team.
Kepler has helped the universe telescope to create the most exciting catalogue of the planet on the Earth team.
New data helps us understand why stars on the sky-based stars have changed rapidly and how the skeletons are interested in the event of the planet.
In a newspaper, Luisa Rebull, a scientist at the Centre of Analysis of Caltech, said, "we hope to get more information about the relationship between our stars, the age and the past of the sun system."
It's a 445 light year away from the world.
Most stars of the team stars have occurred 125 million years ago and have been reached at a new level of adultity.
They're going to return to the highest speed that can be in their lives.
At the time of the turn speed, the stars in the slowness of this convergence are a large number of stars.
These flows in the magnetic areas of the stars make a slight effect on stars.
When a star is old, it starts to slow the speed.
Kepler, it depends on the speed of transformation of each star as the sun lakes between the view of the stars.
The latest changing speed is that larger stars are predicting that they return more fast than small stars.
Rebull explained that the stars were more slower than those who have turned into the leg.
Rebull said, "There is much worse than those who return in the sky, so we see that they are very slightly stars."
A cosmic laboratory is a ideal mission to meet the speed of converting with the stern features.
Rebull says, "A young and old sterling of the Earth's stern is the theory models for the transformation of stars everywhere."
There's more than we want to learn how, when and why it's dropped the stars, why they've left their skins into a wheel.
Rebull and Communicators have explained the most recent analysis of the change speed of the Earth Stars in the Astronomic Diegise in the short term.
