The social map of the Jewish area is acknowledged by electronic payment.
Amendments provide for the maintenance of rents in the public passenger transport.
From 24 September, it is changed to the organisation of the expenses of citizens with the use of the social map of the Jewish area.
According to the Press Service of the Russian Government on the Ivanian area, changes have to maintain rents to the public passenger transport and provide a schedule of mutual accounts on the social map, in accordance with the requirements of Federal Law No. 161 of the National Payment System.
The social map of the Ivanian population is recognized by electronic payment.
Consequently, the conditions of its application are changed.
Yes, the completion limit is now not on travels as previous and in the amount of money, with the maintenance of winter and summer periods, not more than 400 rubbers in the summer period, not more than 800 rubbers for the present month.
Now, the social card owners of the kitchen transport have to be monitored not the number of remaining travels, but the rest of the money.
The value of the loan passenger for citizens is of 1/2 tariffs operating in the transporter.
The remaining half of the cost of the travel is resetting the area budget.
The complement of the social map of money has remained previously - in the period from 24 of the previous month to 23 of the current month.
The new schedule of social map passenger will have a number of advantages.
Similarly, a detailed accounting of the costs of the social map is available to the copy.
Furthermore, there is a possibility of returning, but not expenditure of money.
We also add that the schedule of interactions with transporters is transparent, since the half of the cost of the travel pays the citizens, and the same amount is exactly reimbursed by the budget.
There will be no committee on the card of money.
On the other hand, Vasilie Silikin, the Representative of the Department of Trade and Transport of Ivania, reported that in 2014 there were more than 33 million travels in the region with the use of social map, almost 25 million travels in 2015.
In the area budget, more than 470 million rubbers have been provided to citizens with the use of social map.
As at 1 September, the reimbursement was more than 312 million rubbers.
At the time of the call, 911 providers are recognized in the murder of a friend
During the call at 911 votes, almost without the driving of the drone of Shannon Lamb, the police told the police that he shot his friend and that he needed staff who would have come home to them.
Lamb emphasized that the house had a pocket that was alive, but it was probably disappointed, and said that the contacts of the members of the family could be found in her phone.
The police found the body of Amy Printis and the note, which was validly written from the hands on the white letter, "I'm very sorry, I would like all back, I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me," says the note, as the representatives of the Lamb's organs signed.
Nothing indicated that Lamb, who made two online curses at the University of Delta, the Mississippi, was shocked up to 300 miles in the University Camp where, as the police, he shooted all the respected historical historian of Italy Schmidt at the midst of his office.
The police head of the State of Delta Line Baford reported that university officers had learned about the shooting at 10:18 morning.
He reported that Lamb did the true call at 911 soon after that.
At the end of the day, the victim is on one more: Lamb ended with himself when the police was surrounded.
On the next day following the shooting in the training, students and providers were still trying to hide the doors, the bodies still tried to make a model of motivation that Lamba was built.
The information shared by researchers at both ends of the State, as well as students and staff who knew it helped to compose talents, but may be worried about the teacher.
The students told them that they were inclined to wait for his occupation.
The police in Gothi, where Princis died, reported that there were no accused of violence or crime.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in the book written in which he expressed appreciation for the "beauty people" with whom he settled in his preaching life.
Both were presented to the Social Science and History Faculty, which contains 17 providers, and many students visit the lessons and others.
At the same time, there were some suggestions of problems.
One student who was well calling about Lamb, Brandon Bivers, told him that he was very nervous and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Six, reported that Lamb at the end of the 2014-15 school, told him how he was fighting with stress.
The Lamb requested the University of the Delta to give him a license for disease, said he had some health problems.
In this year, he provided only two online curses.
Recent changes in the university rules mean that a doctor's stage, whose work was so continuous, would not guarantee him the automatic receipt of the prosecutor's post.
The President of the University of William LaForge reported that he was not aware of the conflict between Lamb and Shimed, but "actually, Mr. Lamba had something in mind."
These are questions that Lamb can't answer.
The police attacked Lamba after his flying from the camp when he returned to the Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he was able to arrest, Lamb was shooted from the rear arm of 38 calibra on the back of the house, a mile south of the house of his parents in the Greenville camp, Mississippi, reported the king of Washington Metel Johnson around.
His car with the driver still standed on the road.
It was unreasonable why Lamb came to this house, although Johnson said she thought he knew the people living in him.
Lamb grows in those lands.
Lamb began working at the university, with a population of about 12000 students in 2009 and delivered geography and pedagogy.
He received the stage of the doctor's pedagogical science in the same early year.
One of the old friends of Lamba described it as a wise, charistical and fun.
Karla Haarston told her that she was 15 and 20 years old, when they met through common friends.
She and her friends were learned in older classs, and he was an older man who tried to learn to play her on a guitare for a few years.
In those years, he was successful in women.
All the girls were thief when he was close," says Hairston, who is now 40 and who lives in Jesson, the Brando's emperor.
Lamb and Princess at the moment of the events, looks like they have met some time.
During the call at 911 Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there is no record of their marriage.
A couple had a song named Lytning, who lived with them in Gotia in a surgery house, which is the side of the channel.
According to the police, the dog's all right.
The former husband of Princess, Shawn O'Stin, reported that they had been defeated 15 years ago, but they remained friends, and that they had a daughter now 19 years old.
"It's completely rewarded," told O'Stin about the daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stin said he didn't meet Lambo, but he heard from her daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and playing blues.
Lamb met Princess when he and Abigail were both talking about a summer celebration three years ago.
Then they played together from time on the ports.
O'Stin told his daughter to write music and poet.
Princess was a nursing and worked online on different companies.
Mike Shafer, barmen and jointly developer coordinators in the shocked bar The Julep Room in the front of Gotia said that he last time saw Lamba and Princess on September 5 when Lamba finished playing a guitare and a swimming warm for few visitors.
No suspect has been observed.
"There's a very happy couple," he said.
We enjoyed each other.
They both were very strict.
Schmidt, who was killed by the primary students, specialized in the history of indigenous Americans and colonial Americans, told Don Allan Mitchell, the employer of English in the same school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at the Kansas State University in Emporia and was the President of the Study Brotherhood and Study self-administration.
At the University of Delta’s university in Clyde on Tuesday at about 900 people, including universities, staff, students and community members, were attended in the memorial ceremony of ancestors.
Ms. Schmidt Liz and Brother Jeff Schmidt were also present at the ceremony, during which the Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace cold crowd.
Adoptions will be restored in the midst.
"We're trying to return our students," said Laforge.
Crisis's gone.
Today's recovery day.
Amy and Rochelio Solis reported from Clilland, Mississippi.
The report was helped to prepare the authors of Associated Press Emili Watster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi and Rebecca Santan in New Orlean.
Material was redistributed to the police statement that the call Lamba had been held in the service of 911 after the murder of Schmidt, as well as the fact that, although Lamb and talked about Printis as his wife when he called on 911, the information that they had been married was not confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to take less staff at the celebration season
Toys R. Us believes that it would not be the same staff at the holiday season as last year, with the player and the goods for children, it believes that it will provide state staff and temporary staff to work more hours.
The company reports that 40,000 people are planned to work on shops and optical bases throughout the country, less than 45,000 who were held at the 2014 festival.
Most workplaces will have a part-time employment.
The company reported that there will be meetings with the candidates in this month and will build a number of staff from October to December.
Even if there are more months before the feasts, the purchase season is still close, and the company is prepared for the most temporary staff to have enough states in shops and sales, downloads and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox is about the witnesses with the princess of Diana
The first film "Nazad in the Future" was for Michael J. J. Fox a major event.
She was still noted for personal reasons.
"We sat in the film theatre and waited for the arrival of the Queen's family members, I noticed that the place is freely close to me, and I was here to see - the princess of Diana would sit with me in the trial, "he told a documentary film "in the time".
It's starting a movie, and here I'm in my head that I'm literally on the distance of the hands cut off and in one false shooting from the testimony with the princess of Walk.
The Nazad at the time is a documentary film on the future, including the interview with Fox, Lie Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as the director Robert Earth and the executive producer Steve Spilbergom.
The first film Nazad in the future was 30 years ago.
"For me, Spilberg says, it's uncertainly the greatest movie of travels in time that has ever been cut off."
"Time's " will be available on VOD, DVD and some film theaters in October.
Head of the United Nations claims that there is no military decision in Syria
The Secretary-General, Pan Guy Mun, reaffirms that Russia's military support was made by Syria, that for almost five years of conflict " there is no decision", and the growth of weapons only increased violence and suffering for millions of people.
The Head of the United Nations reiterated all participants, including the separated United Nations Security Council, to join and support comprehensive negotiations to find political decision.
Mr. Guy Mun declared the Press Conference in the Middle East that he plans a meeting with the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France during the Ministerial Session of the General Assembly for the discussion of Syria in this month.
He regretted that the differences in the Council, as well as among the Syrians and the local authorities, were “the situation of the unreasoned”.
Mr. Guy Mun invited five permanent members to demonstrate the same solidarity and unity that they demonstrated in addressing the issue of the nuclear programme on Iran and in the consideration of the Syrian crisis.
8 Survey results show that Donald Tramp is not smiling
Some have tried to smell him a shooter.
Others were disappointed from him as a shock.
Some need scandale.
However, as some Republicns are trying to generate the high situation of Donald Trump on the results of the survey, they did not (for the time).
Decades of the last 11 national surveys have demonstrated the advantage of Donald Trumpa in two-dimensional numbers, and some have started to ask what this means for the magnifying of the possibility of receiving a namement.
Of course, it's just starting a election cycle.
Nothing does mean that Tramp has the opportunity to be appointed by the Republic of the Republic.
Experts pointed out that in 2011, Rick Perry had introduced her best-elected population in Germany Caine, who had not entered any State in the namement process.
And there are many reasons why he would like to fight general elections.
But external groups, such as the "Political Action Committee" of Jeba Bush, and the Conservation Group of the Growth Club, recognize the weaknessing force of Trampa and start to bring their dollars to prevent it.
These are some of the surveys that say that the magnets of immobility are not just a interim phase:
The symptoms of Trampa have turned back to 180 degrees.
The question in Monmouth University showed that only two of the 10 Republicns were positively treated with this magnet in the area of in movement.
It was 40 per cent in the midst of July.
It was 52 per cent at the beginning of August.
Six of the 10 Republicns are now positively related to Donald Trampo.
About three of the 10 says that they have a negative view.
And all of these indicators are obtained at the main stages.
The issue of Quinnipiac in Iawa has been identified last week that 60 per cent of the Republicns were regularly related to Trumpus.
Two thirds of the voters for the GOP would be a candidate.
In the question of the CNN/ORC last week, 67 per cent of the Republicns said that they had been "refrigerated " or " satisfaction " if the Trump would become candidate.
Only two of 10 say they would be "repressed" if he was a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates the same level as Tramp (43 per cent of them say they would be "retroduced" against 40 per cent of those who say the same thing about Tramp).
The next one at the level of relief?
Marco Rubio, who has only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of the Republicns say that they will not be "comforted" or "repressed" if the prosecution of Jeb Bush will be a candidate.
Most Republicans do not consider the temperature of Trampa.
While the Trampa is massively criticized for his joy and distress, 52 per cent of the electoral Republics throughout the country believe that the Magnate is a suitable temperature to be the President, as stated by ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number is in the first country of the closed congregation in the State of Ivoire, where the same 52 per cent of the Republicns believe that he is the one who may be the main team, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 per cent believe that he is not a person who could be effective to post, and almost six of the 10 independent electors say that his temperature is not for the White House, according to the ABC/Post message.
The Republican electioners are close to this idea.
When they're shocking their shoes, the Republican electioners think that Tramp is a stroke.
The question of whom was the most reliable winner in the GOP appointment, four out of 10 said that Trump was favorate, according to the CNN/ORC survey for the last week.
That's no longer when four of the 10 were put to Jaba Bush at the end of July.
Full discharge: GOP electioners had never had the right magic crisis.
At the same time, in the past cycle, four of the 10 Republicns elected Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 per cent were supported by the possible candidate by Mitt Romney.
However, this indicates that many GOP electors are considered to be convinced by the Trampa campaign.
Even if the Republicns were cut around the other candidate, Tramp continues to be forwarded to all the other.
Some find that such differences probably play the advantage of Trampa, and that the unable trampas are equally distributed among more than ten other candidates.
However, the question carried out by Monmouth University at the beginning of September shows that Trump almost always receives support for the majority in the hypothetical renovation between the Trump and the majority of other Republic-Russian candidates.
He encountered Carly Fiorin at 13 points, Marco Ruby on 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jaba Bush for 19 points, and, finally, Randa Pole, John Casich and Kris Christi for 33 paragraphs.
He's nothing with Ted Crewes.
The only candidate who's going to do it?
Ben Carson has shocked the businessers at the total of 19 points in the hypothetical renovation of one.
More than half of Donald Trampa's partners say they've been thinking about it.
The new CBS/NYT survey shows that only more than half of the voters who support Trampa are sure in their votes.
Of course, many may happen and change the situation, and no one can actually say that he never changes.
46 percent say they leave the door open for other candidates.
However, the most pressed competition in Trampa at this time is with the colleague-autsider of Ben Carson, but the electors who say they have thought that they would probably choose Traampa.
Six of the 10 Republicns say they agree with the Tramp on Immigration.
Since Donald Tramp had called immigrants from Mexico in their open-ended campaign, the theme of immigration became the most active in the discussions in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trampa's garage would reverse the key electioners from the Republic of America from the Republic of America and prevent rebursement.
However, in accordance with the question of ABC/Post held on Monday, six of the 10 Republicns said they agree with Trampo in immigration issues.
Thus, until the immigration focused on the general attention, it seems that Donald Trump remains at the same position.
The distress of the Government has new trafficking.
Donald Tramp and Ben Carson are now supporting almost half of the Republican electioners, mainly due to their status of authsseiders.
Six of the 10 Republicns on Monday ABC/Post claim that they wish to be a political auditor than a person with experience in the Government.
And they're also buried at Washington.
The question Des Moines Register/Bloomberg, held two weeks ago, shows that three of the four Republicns in Iwai have been disappointed by the activities of the Republicns in the Congress, with 54 per cent of "unpleased" and 21 per cent of "aging".
The Government decides to the Court of Pension Indexes in October.
Vice-Premier RF Olga Holga Gordoch said that the Government now seeks an application of the Pension Index Act in 2016 to a real inflation level.
She noted that the decision should be found at 8 October at the time of the draft budget for the next year to the Government.
In addition, Cambodia discusses the option for proliferation of the decisions on the raw pension of the Russian assaulting pension.
The head noted that the amount of pension captures were equal to 350 billion rubbers.
The amount of pension indexation is almost the same for the next year.
According to Vice-Premier, there is no final decision on the question of whom should pay contributions for non-employed citizens.
The head believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not relate to, in this case, to the socially protected categories of citizens, it is not absolutely fair that it pays society for it.
Previously, the media reported that there were two options of the guest balance in the castle.
Why are they often disappointed and corrupted?
The doctor-oftalmologist Tatiana Levashwa responds:
Our centuries are the widths that protect eye ball from many small parts that are on them.
When we forget regular cleaning, we often contribute to the development of the library.
Easy Output:
Don't three eyes of sweet hands, with a special snare of power for the sweet;
It shall not be 1 2 times a day clean the land from those covered in them for the day of harmful substances.
cleaning procedures are limited to complement and warm complaints with the disasters of milk feed (shalfey, routines), smooth secrets of salt irons, and then a mass of a shoe, which should be carried out by rounding thresholds;
As a maquillage, don't use spot-containing materials.
They smell and smell skin and contribute to further protection of the secret of salt irons.
The Phone claims that the Korean nuclears have created a atomic fighter.
North Korean authorities reported that the main nuclear reactor in the country was the nuclear complex in Yonban.
The report was held on the website of the Central Telegraph Agency of the country.
It is noted that the CNDR is ready to respond to the "agression and nuclear threat of the United States", as well as the country has improved its nuclear weapons as well as by quality.
The last test of nuclear weapons of North Korea has been carried out in 2013.
In that regard, the reactor has not been informed since then.
The Phone claims that he could create a atom board.
Also, the CDR has not performed a medium and little duration test, writes polit.ru.
The Jurinium was necessary to get out of the Russian giant the mention of the brothers.
Leader LDPR Vladimir Jillinski believes that the national guimin should take note of the unity of the brothers' folks.
In this regard, he declared during the Gospel meeting, reports the Russian News Service.
Who are these people now?
Fashisters and murderers!
"The longest jinn, the longest of the world, even the sports are not overlooked," said Jironese.
The deputy believes that it is necessary to remove all the fourths in which it is found:
In the late 2014, the Jürinus stated that the current jinn had to be replaced by the "God, the king of guards" and the Russian tricolor to replace the Imperial flag, writes polit.ru.
Asad urged all forces to join terrorism.
The President of Syria Bashaar Assad invited all forces to join terrorism.
Asad is sure that if Europe wants to address the problem of refugees, they should stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not that Europe takes or does not take refugees, but that it is necessary to eliminate the first cause of this problem.
If Europeans are concerned about the judges of refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
This is our view of this problem.
"In this matter, the question of refugees," he said in the interview.
We must continue dialogue on behalf of the consensus.
However, if we want real success, they are not possible until people die, while bloodproliferation continues and people feel fully safe.
"We can thus achieve consensus, but we can not realize anything until we won terrorism in Syria," said Asad.
Remember, some 5000,000 migrants have arrived in the European Union for this year, including Syria.
The European Union stated that the current migration crisis in the world was greater since the second World War.
It is not excluded that among the arrival of migrants in Europe, thousands of the extremist group "Islam State" might be able to be struck.
Members of the terrorism organization, prohibited in Russia, may use the situation in order to establish their cells in the EU for terrorist activities.
The people of the German city have built a festival for refugees.
In the last month, Germany became a leader for refugees' acceptance, although recently she has enhanced the border control to keep them pressed.
According to the authorities, about 8000,000 migrants will arrive in Germany until the end of this year, although some experts are called significant numbers.
Since September, more than 90,000 refugees have arrived in the country.
Correspondent Bi-bi-si Jenny Hill was located in the city of Darmstadt, whose migrants are very warm.
Jeremy Corbin addresses the questions of the Prime Minister
After elections, Mr. Corbina has been dealing with the question of the Prime Minister ' s session
The new leader of the Lebourist Party, Jeremy Corbin, will immediately take place at the meetings of the Prime Minister's first sessions, mediting with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbin will speak with the first six of the second half of the issues in the second half of the day; for his statement, the press and members of the Parliament of the Leybourist Party would probably be able to follow the press and members of the Laybourist Party.
He called " less theatre and more facts " at a weekly demonstration talk.
He also said that he could leave some meetings by leaving them to the colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corbin as a leader; it will occur after the appointment of the tennis office and his speech at the Thursday Year Congress on Monday.
As a result of the decision by the leader of the lebourists, on Monday, the national giant service, the 75-year-old Bishop of Britain expressed a criticism from a number of conservative members of the Parliament and became a subject of a number of previous articles in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbina has not been able to sing the public jinn
Mr. Corbina's secretary stated that he was "in almost silence" and acknowledged "the heroism of the Royal VS in Bitwe for Britain".
However, a member of the Tenor Office, Mr. Corbin Owen Smith, reported Newsnight to BBC 2, that he would recommend the leader of the Leaders to sing a national "independence" from his confidence in the need to cancel the monarchy.
A few ten ministers refused to play in the team, Mr. Corbin, with a difference in economic, defence and international policy, while at least one sixth members of the parliamentary party supported it as a leader.
The Political Correspondent BBC Robin Brant said that political differences are also covered in the labour party after the appointment of Mr. Corbin for posts in the European Union and the limitation of compensation payments by the Government.
Mr. Corbin declared at the Conference of Tree-Unionians that the Laybourist Party had amended the concept of restrictions in general.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, the Dark Minister of Labour and Pensions stated that the party had a "complete clarity" because it was only in opposition to the Government's plans to reduce the upper limit from 26,000 feet to 23,000 feet.
Mr. Corbin will be the fifth leader of the lebourists whom David Cameron meets in the "Corry shop" for the last ten years since he became the leader of the Conservation Party.
The leader of the lebourists, who promised another approach to policy, states that he had “approved collective resources” to take the ideas of Mr. Cameroon and received more than 30,000 proposals.
Member of the Parliament on the circle of Ilington Nort said that the questions of the Prime Minister were a extreme conflict, and that it would be able to resolve and strict answers and exchange of colleagues instead of focusing on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and problems that were faced before the youth.
Mr. Corbin stated that Angel Yegel, Minister of Economy in the Canadian Tower, would replace him on the matters of Prime Minister when he would be missing, for example, when Mr. Cameron is outside the border.
He also heard the idea to allow other colleagues to make the word possible, said he had addressed the split of the John Bercou community to discuss the question.
As a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said that he wanted to go from the political style of " maritime ballaghan " often associated with the procedure of the Prime Minister but acknowledged a few years later that it couldn't.
Since the first transmission in 1990, the Prime Minister was the key indicator of leadership, their ability to manage the Party of the Communities and the reputation to other members of the Parliament, although the critics claim that this has become a cartoon and requires a major reform.

The sterling fund increases in the increase of payment in Britain
The Front increased on the fund of payment in Britain, with the FTSE 100 index, thanks to the purchase of SABMller.
From May to June of the wages in Britain, in accordance with the Bonuss, increased by 2.9 per cent compared to the same period last year.
The growth has been the highest rate since 2009, and it was gathered as an early period of prevention on possible cotton growth.
The sterling fund increased more than 1 per cent in relation to $1.5505 and $1.84 per cent for euros, was €1.3730.
The FTSE Index 100 increased to 6229.21 per cent.
The SABMller shares were generally increased by 20 per cent through the purchase proposal from AB InBev competition.
The process would combine two larger drinking companies in the world, gathering such burdens like Budshair, Stella Artois, Butni and Grolsch.
Burberry's actions increased by 0.9 per cent on the basis of the useful news from the competitive group of trade producers of the class of Lux Richemont.
Recently, Richemont's sales data overlook all the expectations and showed that selling in China is on the key market for Burberry again starting to grow.
Glencore shares increased by 5 per cent after the guigner claimed that the amount of $2.5 billion was to be obtained by the allocation of actions under the Debt Reducing Strategy.
The world's papier production groups and packaging material shares were the leaders of the index - 4.3 per cent - after Goldman Sachs decreased the shipping group to "produce".
JD Sport shares have grown after the company of sporting clothes reported about the 83 per cent of the growth of twenty-eight million feet per year.
Head JD Sports says that higher payments may prevent expansion
The Executive Director of JD Sports Peter Kaugil said that the increased minimum payment for British workers is “more purchasing capacity in the carneys of potential consumers”.
But it is unlikely that such purchasing capacity will exceed the value of the work costs.
The costs could affect JD expansion plans and added that it could mean reducing the number of additional vaccines.
Metcash launchs the initiative to fight the Native Aldi
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA purchase from the Aldi button in South Australia and Western Australia.
The initiative-based food provider initiated a market share of IGA riders in South Australia and Western Australia, in light of the future income of Aldi 700 million dollars.
While Aldi is prepared for opening two optical components and first of 120 businesses in South and West Australia at the beginning of the next year, the Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening the relationship with local food providers and through IGA marketing in leading media and social networks and the type of "Adelaide Show".
The campaign joins ritualists and suppliers of IGA, such as the manufacturer of the Marine Simmo's from Dansboro, which proposes degustization in IGA shops, and the owners of shops that sell permanent tickets on the football League of South Australia.
It is expected that Metcash will develop more details of its protection strategy on 29 September - day when this advanced supplier of food, drinking and domestic products will take place on its annual day of investor strategies.
There is a small number of extents, since in South Australia and Western Australia, the IGA shop is almost 30 per cent of all Metcash shops and shows higher rentness than the Metcash IGA network in Eastern States.
The purchasers in South and West Australia are known as an accurate router, so the market is more favourable for IGA riders than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland states - more than 30 per cent in the United States and 24 per cent in the U.A., compared with approximately 14 per cent in Eastern States.
However, analysts, such as Morgan Stanley, believe that Aldi is 5 per cent of the food market in these two states for 12 months after the opening of its first shops, taking the number of events in all present players, but mainly in independent rituals.
In the report published this week, Tom Kirat, Morgan Stanley analysis, believes that IGA ritories can lose $360 million per year and Metcash $2,2 million to the end of 2016.
The project was based on the permission that Aldi is opening 25 shops in SA and 30 WA in the next year, purchasing $500 million and $600 million respectively on these markets.
The loss of the feed and sales of food at high-level Metcash costs may contain about 13 million income for payment and taxes, Mr. Kirat.
At the same time, Metcash lost the share of the market in Eastern States, mainly from Aldi and Coles, and this is the recent study of the Morgan Survey found that the most faithful purchasers of IGA have been in the GA.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash food sales will be 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reduced the market company rate from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent to 2020.
Last week, the manager of the Fundamental Manager Hamish Duvolus, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, noted that Metcash could " perish for a decade.
The Metcash company refused publicly to comment Mr. Duclass' comments.
But it is expected that the member of the Mecash Directors Board had linked Mr. Duclass last week.
The IGA market share was decreased from 2010 from 18 to 14 per cent, and Metcash income from food products undertaken by some 1200 IGA rhythms increased at 43 per cent compared to 2012, as a result of the operational defence and the pressure on sales and retailability rates.
However, the company does not pay more than 150 million dollars annually because of balanced prices in Coles and Woolworths for thousands of weekly positions and helping IGA rituals to rebuild trade areas, as well as proposing a rapid expansion of raw products and more wide selection of corporate food products.
The Director-General Metcash Yen Morris said that the balance of prices and restructuring of trade areas is taking traffic and hopes that the company will increase the clean arrive in 2017, first in four years.
Tanasy Cookinskis supports President Tennis Australia Steve Hile
Tanasy Cookinskis is a cash, not critical for their conduct.
Tanasy Cookinakis has recently suffered in a skandal around his friend, Nick Kirros, and is more critical than President Tennis Australian Steve Hilli.
Cookinakis, a youth in the talent and often called Special Ks, was unnecessary to the center of attention due to the shock of Kireros and Stan Wallink on the Tour of Montreal Masters.
Shortly after that, in the time of a heavy qualified shop in Cincinits, the judges had two times to discover Cokinskis and his opposer Ryan Harrison, said, "The Bavarians had to put on the Kyross shoes, and I have to put on the shootings of this guy."
As the last time that Cookinski had seen a smooth rat after Rishara Gaske saved his feet from the possible struggle against the United States, Hili was loyally protected by the Cookinakis.
Young people are currently in Glasgo, struggling with Sam Grood for the right to be second after Bernard Tommych in the single routine of Kubuc Davis against Britain.
"I'm so worried about one thing, namely that Tanasy had been in the conflict," said Hilli.
He really broke a missile when he had a feet open to the US, but he wasn't the first player who shooted a missile when the hope was shocked, and I know Tanasy's enough good enough to be sure that he wouldn't be proud of it.
But in fact, he had a very well-bearing situation in the United States, with Harrison and etc., and I'm sure he would be trusting.
He's around a good team, he's a beautiful family, and I just think he's done a little unrighteous.
He's a very nice 19-year-old man, he's working a lot, well in the team, he has never had problems with other players, he's respecting it outside the corte, he's training intensively, he's in a good shape, he's a very comprehensive and developed young man, and I think it should be assessed by dignity.
Hilli also supported the decision to forgive Kyros for the important shop that started on Thursday, thinking that it was a right way for all, but considering that the man from Canberra returns to the team as a long-term player.
"Whatever we want, we want the team to focus on the match, not on the conversation around [Krisos]," said Hills.
And I think that Nick's got a strong force that proves people like the Federer and Mareya, he grows up in the public, lets a number of serious mistakes and benefits all the critical that he gets, but we try to help him to understand the consequences of his action, and I need to take him out of the center of attention for a while to think about them, and that's better for the team and the best for it.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary announces an emergency situation, closes the border, delays migrants
In the statement of an emergency situation, Hungary has crossed the border with Serbia on the south of the border and delays those who are trying to spend illegally in the country to keep the slow inside the migratory river.
A hundred migrants were collected in the border, and the Serbian authorities were very negatively reacted.
At an uncertain time, the road between the control-up points of two countries, people flying from armed violence in their family, dismissed the palms and settled on this place.
Nevertheless, injury has been struck.
When the police helicopters circled over them, the migrants cryed to "Close the border" and cryed the distortion in the address of the venerian police.
Some protest dismissed food and water.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Serbia announced the "unacceptable" expulsion of migrants from Hungary, when they are increasingly coming from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be a part of the problem, not a co-conciliating damage.
The next days we have to take negotiations with Brussels and other countries,” said in the Dutch Prague.
Volunteers at the Venice-Serba border began on the next day after the block of 28 countries could not develop a common immigration policy at the joint meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed to provide a general responsibility for 40,000 persons who are looking for refugees in the overlaped Italy and Greece and expressed hope that in the future (in the next month or at the end of the year) will be reached an agreement that the European States will receive more than 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
The President of Germany, Angela Merckel and Austria, was required to gather a close summit of Europe at the next week to discuss the migration crisis covering the continent.
Hungary, however, is not hoped of rapid action from Brussels or neighbors.
In Friday, the emergency situation in two southern regions gave the authorities more power to act on the crisis, which allowed them to switch the road and accelerate the cases of rescue.
As a result, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Venice Peter Siyarto stated that his country plans also to switch up from the slopes of the border with Romania to switch migrators through the country when it was completed by the Serbia border.
The Correspondent CBS News Charles Dagata reported that even prisoners had been connected to an urgent work on the end of the shipment between England and Serbia.
In the past few months, Hungary became the main "fair place" and the point of movement of the border of Europe for the inhabitants, many of which are refugees, the victims of war in Syria and the Western countries.
However, Prime Minister of the State of Victor Orban insists that most people who arrive in the country are economic migrants who are looking for a better life, not refugees, but victims of military action that have the right to protect, and that point of view is closely separated with the views of other EU countries, such as Germany.
New laws entered into force in Hungary are now considered a crime of revision or damage of a 4-metre (13-foot) injury made by the Government towards the southern border with Serbia, and are also more long terms of prison for the trafficking of people.
" The Venezuelan Government announces an emergency situation due to the situation of the mass migration, " said journalists of the Government of Seltan Kovach in the southern city of Segad.
We understand clearly: the illegal transition of borders is a crime.
Regularly, the Parliament should still authorize the location of military forces that is expected for the next week, but the Associated Press reporters, which are on the border, have already seen over a few days the presence of armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs.
Dear Bacondy, the Consequent for National Security, reported about 45 persons who tried to cross the border at the border, and still 15 persons within the country.
They have crossed the border, cutting the ships, now under the police detention and condemned the manufacturing of administrative violations against new laws.
The authorities quickly restore the seat.
The Vienna authorities also closed two of the seven passengers on the border with Serbia on Sunday morning, striking to block one of the carriage vagons with a swimming shock.
The crowds switched the main passage through the border around the city of Riosco (Hungary), since the cities have placed a service place for the slope of people within the metal container, and the shoes gave each other to interrupte.
There were about 20 people inside, and thousands of people remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main car carried out from Serbia to Hungary and announced the refusal of food and water until they were transferred to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hilary Clinton's priority on Bernard Sanders has reduced two in national survey
The former secretariat Hillary Clinton continues to keep the double advantage of democracy in the country, but Mr. Bernie Sanders approve it.
Clinton is now supported by 47 per cent of the primary democratic electioners (lower 58 per cent) and Sanders is a second of 27 per cent (more than 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Bayden, who has not yet announced whether he would participate in the Presidency, receives 15 per cent of the primary democratic electioners.
Over five months prior to the beginning of the conflict on the primary elections, most democratic electioners say that it is too early to say that they have been determined with the candidate to support.
Clinton parties are more sure in their choice, except supporting other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey in the last month, Clinton lost support for some demographic groups, Sanders reached some of them.
Clinton maintains a great advantage between women and dead, but it has decreased.
Her support among men is significantly disappeared, and Sanders remains on paragraph 5 of it.
Clinton's proposal for democratic elections for 50 years has gone, and they're with Sanders at the same time.
But Clinton still has a great advantage among the older electors.
In the last month, Clinton has doubled Sanders with a double number of Liberals, but Sanders now has the advantage of 5 points in this group.
About half the primary democratic elections throughout the country say that they would support Clinton if it would be a candidate to this party.
Fourth would support her with some reservations, and 15 per cent would support her only because it was candidates.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
It may be unexpected that Clinton's current partners may probably prove more enthusiasm on her account.
Among those who do not support Clinton at this time are more contrary - only some four with an enthusiasm would support it.
While 48 per cent of the primary democratic elections say that they would have supported Clinton with enthusiasm, less than the Republican electioners say the same leader, Donald Tramp (35 per cent).
When Clinton's partners have a open question why they want to see her candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the necessary experience (16 per cent), then that the time of the Chairman (13 per cent), and that it is the best candidate to this post (10 per cent).
Clinton's partners also speak of the association linked to Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
It is also called an agreement on issues and opportunities for election.
As Vice-President considers potential participation in the elections, 57 per cent of the primary democratic elections would like to be joined to the chief, although the third believes that it should not.
When they ask who they would like to see in the second place among the candidates of the party, the primary democratic elections in most cases call Bayden.
Among Clinton's most half says they would have chosen Byden to the second, it's more than Sanders.
If Bayden decides not to put his candidate from the Democratic Party, Hilary Clinton's advantage will increase from 20 points with Bayden from 30 points without it.
Fifty-five per cent of the democratic elections are seen in Clinton with the best chances for the winning of general elections, but the number has reduced from 78 per cent in the last month.
According to the Bayden, with a large departure on the second place, but the percentage of those who believe it is the most reliable candidate has increased.
However, responding to the question that the most important thing in the candidate, democratic elections choose other options, except the opportunities to be elected.
Similarly in the last month, no candidates from democratic or potential candidates are an unacceptable nomination for these primary electors.
The candidates from democracy, or potential candidates, have shown good results on some key characteristics among the primary electors from their party.
Most believe that Clinton, Sanders and Bayden are honest and able to trust people with good leadership.
Byen of all three is leading honestity, and Clinton's strong side in its leadership.
30 per cent of the primary democratic elections do not consider Clinton a honest and rewarded trust, two times more than those who say the same about Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent have no view of it in this account.
The primary democratic elections generally consider similar ideological views of Clinton, Sanders and Bayden.
With all these measures, some four democratic electioners have no view of Sanders.
Although the issue of the personal e-mail shell and the server of Hillar Clinton continues to be slaughtered by the secretariat, most democratic electioners are satisfied with its explanation on this account and believe that this has not been negatively affected by their general view.
But it's a very different story in the American public in general.
The half of the Americans today have not been satisfied with its explanation, and only about a third.
The public's views were further divided in March, soon after the story became known.
Most Americans say that the e-mail field has not influenced their general views on Clinton, although 36 per cent say that their opinion was worse.
The Republicans, more than six of each 10 who claim that their views about Clinton have been worse.
Even though Clinton is considered honest and worthy of confidence from its party, it continues to be a problem among the registered electors in general: only 32 per cent of its honest and rewarded trust, at eight points below than the last month, and 15 compared to her mother.
Sixty-2 per cent of the electors registered does not consider its honest and rewarded trust.
At the same time, 55 registered elections throughout the country do not consider the Trumpa honest and reliable trust.
However, both Clinton and Tramp are good marks on leadership.
Of the six protested candidates of Bayden, Carson and Bush showed the best results of honestity.
Most people see in Sanders more honest man than not, but, as Carson, many have no view of it.
The error for the selection of 351 primary democratic elections is 6 per cent.
On the basis of the national survey, Ben Carson approached Donald Trampo
Ben Carson came to Donald Trumpus at the last CBS/New York Times survey
Two of these candidates made half of the electioners in the new survey, left all the other in search for opposites under the footsteps
The Republican electioners throughout the country continue to support Trampa massively, which has increased from 23 per cent in recent CBS-related discussions on Fox News in the last month, to 27 per cent in the summary conducted in Sunday.
But Carson fled the same period from 6 to 23 per cent.
The survey also showed that Carson was supported in all demographic groups, confusioning Trampa in a group of representatives with higher education.
Final candidates, except Carly Fiorin and Ogayo John Kascha, have been back together with the Governor Viscals Scott Walker, whose support has fallen from 10 per cent in the last month to 2 per cent.
Ancient Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, former Governor, Mike Hacabi, and Senator of Florida Marco Rubio, are together with the third place of 6 per cent.
The error for the election of 376 republic elections in this new investigation was 6 per cent, which was held in September.
The recent CNN/ORC survey, published last week, showed the growth of Carson in the surveys, demonstrated 19 per cent of the Republicns, with 32 per cent of the support of the Trump.
The last survey of ABC News/Washington Post also showed that Tramp was significantly infringed by Carson.
With regard to the growing support of Carson, Tramp has made a number of critical accidents in the former neurochirurg address, even when Carson regreted that the Trump's faith was doubtful.
"We need energy", said Tramp in the past Saturday during the shutting of the Ivoire campaign.
Four brothers are accused of the death of the first College of Burch
About two years later, after the loss of a college, the brotherhood in the mountains of Popono, Pennsylvania, was condemned against five persons.
"The members of the Brothers of Pie Delta Psy from New York's New York College of Burch strictly attacked Chana "Mycla" Denga during the dedication of September 2013 g and did not put him in the hospital at the time of his death," reported to the police.
Official persons say that a student with inclined eyes and a 30-foot-food sweet smell was touched several times until he tried to achieve the goal, a shock of surface.
Mr. Deng, at the end of the end, pleased that he had a head and then fell without awareness.
The members of Pie Delta Psy did not call at 911 when Dengue lost conscience and waited for a time before he was taking it to the hospital, she says to the police.
However, they found time to change the clothes of Dengue, find his symptoms in Gugla and contact with Andy Menng, the National President of Brothers, to ask the Council as he told at the press conference of Chris Wagner.
"In this moment, brotherhood members began to hide personal property, as a result of the well-being of the brotherhood of Michael Dengue's health, " said the chief Wagner.
He couldn't save, and he ended the next morning.
According to the coverage report, Dengue received a number of smells of heads, smells and poor.
“A lot of families suffered from brotherhood rhythms, since at least one student dies during them every year, starting from 1970,” said Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
Brothers and their members should be responsible, and this step by the authorities is very important.
The court boards of Monroe have been sentenced for the third stage of murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Menga, have been accused of violence against news and crime.
"We want to be responsibilities not only by individual parties, but, if there are organizations that have authorized all of that officially or informally, it is also", said Vaganer at the Press Conference on Monday.
The College Baruch prohibited the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood was excluded from its structure of the local office.
What happens when the Federal Reserve increases the rates
The rate increased, and the "float market" will be confronted, the revenue of flows increases, and the economy is declining in recession.
That's what we know.
What we don't know, how long it's going to be, and how long it's going to be.
The economy has little explanation for time.
The recession started only 11 months after the first increase of rates and totally 86 months.
The validity of the Federal Reserve for Taxes often, although not always, determines the reaction of the economy and financial assets.
The United States Central Bank is therefore so slightly emphasized that investors should not focus on the starting of taking taxes and how much the adaptation will take.
Indeed, multitude of those changed.
At the end of the end, however, the market participants may find that the whole ratio around the increase is overwhelmd.
The Federal Reserve for Global Financial Crisis will not be safely interpreted by some as a sign of the end of the EE of Deep money,” reported Julian Jessop, the main specialist for the international economy in Capital Economics, in its comments on customers.
On the contrary, we are not expecting that the progressive return of percentage rates in the United States to more normal, but still lower levels will be a semitic impulse that many are threatened.
This does not mean, but it will not be the consequences.
This is how some economies could react in depending on historical trends:
As the market has already seen in the last months or around, the expectation of increased rates may lead to uncertainty at some time.
However, in the improvement of taxes, the consequences are usually not such dramatic.
"It seems to be income from actions at 12-24 months after the first skating, which may be remarkable again in the monetary policy," said the German Bank analysis in recent studies on the increased rate of the Federal Reserve.
If specifically, the market is more slightly changed over the past 35 years - about 14 per cent of the rate increase, remains sufficiently equipped for 250 days after that (medium growth, 2,6 per cent), then, at the end of 500 days, the average income of 14.4 per cent of the last six cycles, according to the recent analysis carried out by Bob Doll, the main specialist on the trade strategies in New Asset Management, the public in Barrons.
In Germany, the results of valuable burdens have no tendency to become more expressed at the stage of increased rates, and the income from actions begins to reduce.
Recesions are the fact of economic life, but increased rates often contribute to them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve has put into conditions that have not previously existed and could accelerate the recession.
Mainly, the currency internal product will be almost in its lowest point for the existence of an increased rate.
According to the German Bank, in 118 cases, the tax increase from 1950 was only two times of the nominal annual SFB below 4,5 per cent.
Even in the second trimestre of 2015, he was 3.6 per cent, but few believe that it is long, while only 1,5 per cent of the Atlanta Fed data.
The improvement of the rates to such an instable economic fund may be risked and asks "does it be on the other time", reported in Germany.
The market participants are prepared to increase the rate of the Federal Reserve System throughout the year, with their view to the meeting of the Federal Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategic and economic experts believe that FOMC could accept increased rates at this meeting, the feast trade is only a 25 per cent possibility.
"In our 1950 study, all cycles of increased rates have been in the supermarket increased financial market in GDP, which predicted the recession, very quickly after the start of recovery, " states the report.
In contrast, it was extremely slowly recovery after the worst recession of the election period.
The current cycle at this time is the length of which the Federal Reserve System had expected from the end of the last recession; the recourse was 35 months, and it has already been 74 months and has not yet been completed.
The fixed income was also insufficient while the market expects to increase the rates, and this scenario is somewhat like the one who is implemented for actions.
The principle difference is that the effects are more fast than for actions when the Federal System changes the strategic course.
In cases, the income seems to be changed immediately after the initial increase/reduce of the cycle.
In the end of the cycle, the revenue rate is immediately falling", reports Germane.
Charles Schwab’s strategists believe that increased rates will lead to the approach to long-term and short-term revenue levels and make a more polar.
The high income conflict is often better in this climate, although "we are still threatening income", says Cathy Jones, the analysis of the fixed income analysis in Schweab.
It is interested that Johns considers that the markets have already been adapted to the expected results of the federal policy system.
" In addition to the strengthening of the dollars and the fall of inflation expectations, the market has been a more strict monetary policy", wrote it.
The percentage rates of short-term employees have been increased, with a decreased income of more polar, credit continues have increased, and the flexibility of all market features has increased when the federal system has implemented policies.
In general, the company that leads to its main business in the United States wins from increased rates, and the local product will become more attractive.
The international companies have long been worse, since the increased dollar makes their production more costly in the world market space, and their debt is more costly in financial.
"The story shows that the "case" actions demonstrate the effectiveness of the market over three months after the initial increase of the rate", said the Goldman Sachs analysis in the report for customers.
The company with a stability financial status has been insufficient with the results of each increased rate in 1994, 1999 and 2004 in a average of 5 per cent.
The company with high income of the capital and low-government shares also showed the best effectiveness than low quality shares in average 4 (per cent) and 3 (per cent) respectively.
The duration will be a great question.
The company with a high percentage of swimming debts lose more, according to Goldman.
In addition to pursuits, the consumers will benefit from an increased dollar.
The income could also be viewed by higher income, although the experts disappeared as fast as this happens.
"BBC Radio 3 - Classic FM copy", states a member of the Parliament from Andrew Bingham's containers
Member of the parliament of Andrew Bingham has discovered the station for "Reducing standards"
It demonstrates that it is less different from the commercial competition
The BBC Music Awards also stressed that the premises are just inconsistent with Brits.
The colleague on the Parliament, who violated The Voice with the same critical, was not originalized.
"BBC Radio 3 converts to classic FM", said the leaders of the parliament, encouraging telecommunication to prove that it does something that doesn't make the commercial company.
The member of the parliament from the Conservators Andrew Bingham also declared the BBC guide that it seems that the public radio "Glupeet" seems to be less different from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 looks like I don't like to use the word "forgiving" but it seems to be classic FM," he said.
He also stressed the BBC Music Awards premium in December.
BBC Music Awards, who was old in the last year, looks like The Brits in other names.
So if you're trying to do something different, this is two examples that the first ones came to me in the mind that you really just copy what's already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The Director-General of the BBC rejected the accusation, claiming that BBC Radio 3 was far forward to his commercial partner when it was related to live music and audio education.
What I know through Radio 3, I don't know anymore about classic music.
And his loyalty to the living statements and the creation of music is indeed not more compared with anyone.
"There is really very important, I think, the interest in Radio 3 in searching for a new music and promoting new events," he said.
The BBC Radio 3 Alan Dave said that radio stations had to work much more to take audience than in the past, because the Britishs were less classic music education.
However, Radio 3 was not the only child of BBC, which had been attacked by the attacks of commercial competitors during listening to the Special Committee on Cultural, Measures and Sports.
The member of the parliament by Thory Damien Collins attacked The Voice musical shooting that BBC purchased in the Dutch Talpa Media for the orientational price of 22 million feet of sterling.
See why this program is often discussed on the absence of originality and different aspects?
Lord Holl states that BBC 1 show, in which Palm Feat and Boy George participated in the typical BBC style.
He adds that the Corporation wants to be "wet in our own home chair" next time it will start a developing project.
However, it does not consider it necessary to prevent the order of the new sessions of The Voice in the future or use of money those who pay the licensing collection for other forms.
The Internet sales rose was maximumly delayed in August, and it may therefore be the Black Five
In the first three months of 2015, the increase of online sales to 7 per cent was observed
Last month, the late growth has been observed since it began to be observed in 2000.
Online sale has been actived three years ago by using mobile devices for shaping
Experts are convinced that the New York Black Five could contribute to the sustainment of expenditure
For some ten years, a vulcanic shooting has experienced a boom, transforming many central streets in Britain to a precaution city.
But experts say that there have been signs of online sales equation, after the last data shown only seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.
The general costs for the online-shooting in August have shown minimum growth since they began to fix in 2000, with only 5 per cent increased.
Experts say that there have been signs of online sales equality, after the recent data shown only seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015
“If you look at growth in the past years and return back to 2000 g, they have always been reasonable,” said Guardian Andy Malkech, editor of the IMRG sale index.
He explained that the online sale has been revised three years ago when the buyers were using their mobile phones to purchase.
This means that more people had received the opportunity to buy online, and that they could do it in any condition, for example, sit on the wall.
But now this comes to the payment, and you can see the decline (on growth).
The phenomenon of the Black Peace, which came from America, mentions as one of the reasons for the delay.
Experts believe that the purchasers could stop the purchase of an event that happens on the last Friday of November.
In the past year, purchasers have spent five times more average to computers to be able to use the benefits of the proposals, infringing the same number of sales websites.
Experts believe that the Black Five when purchasers come into the real fight for profitable purchase, they could put people to shooting.
According to the study published by British Retail Consortium, more than 1 pound of sterlings of each 5 is online.
With regard to goods such as television and natural machines, more than one third is sold through the Internet magic.
At the same time, more than four people purchase clothes and eggs online than in modern shops on central streets.
Muslims are guarded by murdered in Mexico, and Ben Laden's family sanctions
Muslims have the body of 29 deaths on the street, as the first crowds in Mexico are starting
At the same time, Saudi Arabia was a partly guilty for the accident of Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health reported that 394 persons had also been traumated after the crime of the ground.
Hundreds of Muslims were shocked on the streets so that 29 of the victims died in the main sword of Mexico.
The mainly obtained in the white part of the cemetery were designed to respect the first of the dead who had been sent to their last path on the Al-Moaissem board.
The special process passed in a sacred place where the building clan had tried the throne of the sword and slowed to the desire in a few days before.
The body was issued to the cemetery, and at the same time the king Saudiths overcome a building company belonging to the Ben Laden family, for an accident that was also arrested by 394 persons.
The body 29 deceased to be killed when the crowd was violated in the Main Sword was carried out on the streets
Among the dead were the father of four children of Kasim Akram from Bolton, the Great Manchester, who was in his first pallonic journey when he disrupted the clan.
Mr. Akram was in the Grand Sword together with his parents before the start of the annual hage.
Sauditan authorities have already promised that Haj will continue, since thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that Binladin Group should not leave the shooting of the shooting in the lack of unemployment.
In the Arab version of a decree published by the Saudi Press State Agency, Binladin Group states that it is partly guilty for crimes.
The English Addition of the News Agency did not tell this detail, but reported that the leaders of the company were prohibited to go outside the country.
Previously, in this week, Salaman promised to explain the reason for the fall of the crown in the main sword where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were shocked to be sent to Haj this month.
The Binladin Group has not made any statements on the abuse of the land, and its representatives were not available for comments.
The Kingdom Decree also condemned the company in non-use of modern security measures and inadequate agreement with the meteorological service.
Decades of crowd are around the Main Sword of Mexico, in the context of the large building work that Binladin Group leads.
The Ben Laden's family during the decades includes a number of closer legal families of Saudi Arabia and leads to larger construction projects.
The dead leader of Al-Caida Usama Ben Laden was a son of name whose family was rejected in the 1990s.
The accident occurred in strong winds and rain only a few days before the Kingdom has arrived millions of people to participate in the Palestinian, which would be obliged, even if one time in life for each working museum.
The officials reported that 158 persons remained in the hospital.
Official persons decided to pay a million rivals (approximately 174,000 feet) to the parents of the dead, and the same amount is inevitably punishable.
The final victims will receive half of this amount.
Chapter B and Q states that the train is explained by the existence of Eastern European masters working for small money
According to Veronica Larry, the Britishs are increasingly taking repair specialists
The number of qualified workers from Eastern Europe grows
Result - Opening more than 200 new Screwfix shops for specialists
At the same time Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q shops throughout the country
Author: Rupert Steiner, head of the city Correspondent Daily Mail
They say that the Britishs are put into the side of milk and malaria shoes, instead of taking qualified Eastern Europeans to carry out home work
If you can talk to a milk or a ball to red the wall, it seems that you're in minority today.
Because, according to the B&Q owner company, the UKs are increasingly taking master specialists to carry out an uncomfortable home work.
Veronel Lori, a new Director-General Kingfisher, who owns the home management network, reported that this train had a significant flow of qualified masters from Eastern Europe offering minimum price services.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open more 200 Screwfix shops that are specialized for masters and also close 60 B&Q shops.
Ms. Lari said that she would like to see more women in the composition of B & Q shops, as eight of the 10 of the purchase decisions were taken by the representatives of a weak field.
Today, most staff are men.
According to its words, it cannot be noted that the last demographic trends that characterize the increase in the number of households belonging to single women, more than in the past.
Ms. Lori said, "The man still works in our shops.
We need to take steps to achieve the balance.
In general, half of our customers are women, and 80 per cent of the decisions for the purchased products are taken by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Lari, one of the five women in the routine of British leaderships, whose actions are taken into account in the FTSE 100 index, has also changed the composition of the fuel management team, pursuant to the directors of the equal number of men and women.
Kingfisher is not the only company that is about 50 per cent of women, including the general and financial director.
Ms. Lori said: "This was a conscious decision, the diversification is a important issue for us.
There was no difficulty finding suitable women in the Board of Directors.
After the group was taken by the shopping costs, Kingfisher's company showed the reduction of arrival and sales in half a year.
As a result of the Kingfisher train, the owner of Screwfix and B&Q, opens 200 new shops
Time for decisions on the percentage rate of the United States Federal Reserve
The Peace is looking at the meeting held by the Federal Reserve Bank, which is discussed within two days of the decision to take or not a percentage rate in the first decade.
Reuters' 80 economists reported that more than half of those in the last week believed that the Federal Reserve will now believe that it still slows and keeps the rate at the current level of the diameter 0-0.25 per cent.
This is a historic event, because it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve has decreased the rate to zero.
The first time we approve is that the main bank can be accompanied with the null notes and start a normalization of percentage rates,” said Anhel Wilde, director of the International Economy Institute.
The United States economy works effective, economic flow adds trillions to the balance report and inflation is small.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision affects the world economy.
He warned the market that it should be prepared to change, but all of them said their confidence is that all the possibilities against such steps were possible.
The decision will be announced at 2000 CET on Friday.
New Balkan market: Refugees go to the EU through Croatia.
"Attention!" - Scan the hundreds of refugees in the Horgosh control point on the Serbian-Venger border.
From Tuesday, Budapesht moved the border to the residents.
Refugees have already started to suffer other route options in Europe.
One of them is through Romania in a close border with Serbia.
Another, through Croatia and Slovenia, is in Austria.
According to some data, buses that have brought refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now sent to the city of Shida to the Croatia border.
Völderi received a provision from the authorities to follow without stopping.
The Serbian Minister of Internal Affairs, Neboish Stepanovich, ensures that his country do everything to help refugees but is limited to its possibilities:
Our work is to resolve Serbia as far as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people, to ensure a huge relationship with them.
But it's already a common European problem.
It is unlikely, no country in Europe will do so alone, and a smaller country as Serbia.
Belgrade requests Budapest to open the border for refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
But Victor Orban is unprecedented:
If someone is called a refugee, he must fill the necessary documents for that document.
And if he doesn't do this, he will not be in our country, because Serbia is safe.
Hungary has already established a 175-third strip in the border with Serbia.
But Orban is not intended to stop it: he plans to make the same reimbursement on the border with Romania.
Buharov already stated that it was incompatible with European principles.
The Encyclopædia Britannica: "Europe wants to help us."
In the course of a few years, the angels of Meimarracis entered the orthodox Governments that, according to the left, were the country towards the financial crisis.
He now, as a temporary leader of the New Democracy Party, slows the calls of Cyprus.
In a few days before the election, he met a journalist Euronuz.
Mr. Meimarakis, welcome to the Euronuz!
Evangelium: Thank you for the invitation.
12 months ago, your party suffered a devastating conspiration, engaged in the SIRISA coalition, but now, in the investigation, the "New Democracy" compared with it as a popularity.
What's changed for that time?
The Encyclopædia Britannica: Greece has changed, and we too.
Mr. Cyprus had a lot in January last year.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget and economic growth perspective.
Now, the countries have re-budgetary deficit and high levels of unemployment.
The investors went out because Mr. Cyprus's spent them.
In the last nine months, Greece was able to evaluate the situation in which the country was in January and the false promises of Mr. Cyprus.
And now they can easily compare the promised thing in reality.
The daily life was significantly worse compared to January when the situation was improved, with regard to the majority of Greek citizens.
Eurowes: But you're saying that, in the case of the elections, you'll try to join the other parties, including the SIRIZ.
The Encyclopædia Britannica: The fact that, as we have understood over the past few years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
Indeed, in all other countries where the rescue programs have been acting or still operating, the political forces and all ruling parties had gathered together for the implementation of the programme on which they agreed without rejecting their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I believe that at this stage only the cooperation of political forces and institutions allows the country to go forward.
Eurowes: Your party was proclaimed in support of the agreement between Mr. Cyprus and the creditors of the country.
If you become a new prize on Monday, will you fulfill this agreement, or will you try to change it at least?
In reality, we proclaimed Greece's movement on the European road, because we are well representing what pleasant consequences the countries of the EU would result in.
Europe is now helping us by providing aid to farmers for their production, we have solidarity funds, Yunker packages and assistance in the bank sector.
All that would be lost if there was no treaty with Europe.
But the current measures of the economy were the result of the negotiations of Mr. Cyprus.
I know that Europe doesn't want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek Government in the first year wants to rule, it works rationally and understood that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue programme, so I am sure that all the obligations adopted that cannot be fulfilled because of recession may be a object of negotiations, but only a certain time.
It would be wrong to believe that in the first year of the new agreement, we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors because they are expected to completely implement agreements.
If we want to return their confidence, we must continue to break up, reform and structural changes agreed by continuing using EU funding advantages and large investment opportunities that we must open to better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, in the negotiations, the Government of Cyprus did not submit any serious arguments on many key political issues that we have explained, discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can provide an example of farmers income.
We have explained to our European partners that it is not about the fixed monthly income, and therefore it cannot be fully covered by the previous tax.
We said that the Ministers of Cyprus never spoke about it.
The Greek Ministers have not been prepared and badly informed, and therefore there were negotiations and unsuccessful agreements.
Eurojust: If you win for elections, you will soon be on one table with Mr. Yunker, Olland, Mrs. Merckel and other European leaders.
Are you going to differ what you're telling to them from what your former Antonio Samuels said to them?
The Encyclopædia Britannica: First of all, I explain to them that until the end of 2014, we have tried to comply with the 2012 agreement with the strict edges in it.
We moved forward to reforms.
Of course, we did not have the necessary determination and speed, but we have acted in emergency circumstances.
The line slowed, and it was not apparent that potential purchasers were ready to pay the price that the Greek Government was slaughtered.
At that time, I was a parliament spyster, and I could agree with the views of the three parliamentary groups that were then the majority of the government.
In spite of their serious ideological differences on key legislative projects, we had a parliamentary, and this is in the presence of popolists and extremists, as well as of massive demonstrations outside.
We could be able to make a country a normal situation that would continue to improve if the process was not stopped by the long-term elections made by the Presidential elections.
Eurones: The last week on the territory of Greece moves the mass flow of refugees.
What do you think of this situation, and of the reactions of European countries in which these people are trying?
Angels Meimarakis: Crisis with refugees is a slow-boat of action with which we should have a case after the winning of elections.
And the reason that the Syrian Government did not act in this situation as it was.
In such matters, the restraint should be taken because if the problem comes to you, there are only emergency measures.
And now we're in this situation.
Even the temporary Government of Cyprus has been made over seven days more than Mr. Cyprus for seven months.
I am sure that these actions of the provisional Government, which provides valuable assistance to the President of the Republic, inviting the EU Summit to find a decision.
We need to see how many refugees will be able to leave the country and note the illegal immigrants.
These are the victims of the war in Syria, the victims of some emergency events that have occurred with them.
This issue has a deep humanitarian aspect, and we will keep the position of the European policies to take in this new situation.
This decision should be adopted in the EU's own, and the United Nations should be involved.
We also need the best coordination of action, more effective cross-border control and refugee reception centres.
We must also use effectively the EU's economic assistance to be able to address this poor problem.
Eurourones: Mr. Meimarakis, thanks for the interview.
Evangelium: Thank you.

A man who disabled the gun at the University of the Delta, left a note with excuses
After the shot and murder of his friend in Mississippi on Monday, and before he shot and killed his colleagues later on the same day, Channon Lamb wrote a record that he said "congratulated" about the first murder and wanted to "too back", reported the authorized bodies on Monday.
The police in the city of Gothie, Mississippi, reports that the president of geographic and public science at the University of Delta, called at 911 a.m. to 10 p.m. in the service.
On Monday and told him he shot someone.
Lamb said to the supervisor that the police had to send people home.
He said, "I killed my wife last night," and he said that there's a "pocket" in the house that "no one's throne," but it probably was struck.
The police was interested in calling, but he didn't call it.
Lamb didn't explain why he opened the fire.
When the police arrived at the place of crime, there was 41 years of the body of Amy Prentis, which was written by the Lamba's record, 45 years old, and he said, "I'm sorry I would like to return everything.
I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me.
When he wrote the note, Lamb passed 300 miles to the University of Delta, where he killed Italian Schmidt, a historic publisher, and on Monday night, when he was around the police, he ended with her.
The doctor of William LaForge reported that he had not been known about any conflict between Lambo and Shimed, but "It was evidently aware of Mr. Lamba".
In spite of the Monday information that the Lamb prescribed Romans between Princess and Schmidt, official services in Monday reported "no information or evidence" of the "noise triangle".
Principes replied as a good man, Shawn O'Stin, who told her that she was married for about seven years.
They've been broken 15 years ago, but they've remained friends.
O'Stin told him and Princess had a daughter of 19, and she was "small."
He added that Princess and her daughter were the best friends.
According to Lindsey Noux, the Sun Gerald newspaper called a close friend of Princess, last time he worked out of home through the Internet.
Noulds told Princess had a pleasant snake for the Latining clip, and she met Lamba for about three years.
Noulz said, "He always wanted to help people."
According to the police, Lamb called the parents at a moment on Monday to say that he wouldn't go in prison.
On the same evening, when the police shocked him on the shoes near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, shooted out of it, fled to the forest and shooted there.
According to the summary made on the University Web, Lamb was received in the University of Delta's Pedagogic Sciences early 2015.
Stars losing their luck
Atter (left), on a photo with her son, Redmond, right, survived a few difficult years.
In 2001, he was fighting with lyquemia, and in 2009 he lost his multi-year-old life satellite Farra Foset, who died from cancer.
As reported, the actor also suffered from drug independence and arrested him in 2008.
All of this, of course, has played its role.
Luke Shaw from Manchester for a few months, because of a double break
Luke Shaw cut the right leg in two places during the Champion Champion shop, in which the United States played PSV in Andhoven.
While the safeguarder is concerned about this matter which is not able to go to the field for at least six months, Louis Van Gal hopes that Shaw can play again in this season.
The trauma occurred during the unreasonable subcondition of Hector Morno at the 15th minute when the 20-year-old Shaw was slaughtered in the PSV.
He had been helped in the field for nine minutes and gave oxygen before taking into the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double bar, and he's in the hospital."
He'll be moved to Manchester tomorrow or day later, and then operate.
This is a terrible, young man came to Manchester in 18 years of age, overcoming great difficulties and playing fantasticly, and this happened here.
It was a oxygen mask in the slaughter.
He cryed.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double bar, it's six months, and the boy can't play in a group stage.
I hope he can play again in this season.
Morno was glad he had not received a red card and was not appointed to the toolbar.
Arbitr Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish a mexican.
Van Gall believes that the Italian court had made a mistake.
Judge yourself when I say it's to be a snake and a red card.
It was a very bad shock from two feet.
In your Twitter, Shaw writes: "Thank you all for your message, don't describe how devastated I have been, my way to restore, I'm returning stronger than it was."
On the other hand, Manchester United is concerned with Luke Shaw when ISS played
The english protector will have an additional stimulation to move to Championato of Europe in France on June next.
Phillip Cook, a PSV trainer, said, "This is a very hard trauma."
When any game is elected with such a trauma, it's all very disappointed.
This was never the purpose of our players to traumate the opposite.
Morno moved his feet off when he played in Mexico against the Dutch team under the Van Gal leader in Chempionte Mira 2014.
"He's now very difficult, because he didn't have a purpose to hurt the opposite, and when you hear that it's a very heavy trauma, you're feeling wrong," said Cooke.
I couldn't see the same moment.
The only thing I could see, it was a meat that flyed in another direction, so that looked like he (Morone) was shocked, but I didn't see Luke's shock.
In a conversation with SBS6 Morno said, "I know what this is, I know how difficult it is to overcome.
I'm very hard and I'm so sorry.
Andrés Guaradad from PSV was also put to the hospital after Chris Smolling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about Lorex?
Each parent is quickly exciting one thing: if your child likes a book, it will take a little time before you get to know it almost.
Let's see if you're not David Cameron.
In response to the question of the representative of the group of children ' s disappearing company in the Canadian, on its loved child book, the Prime Minister Larhox elected a statement with a environmental circle written by Dr. Suzum in 1971.
This was a difficult choice, wrote Cameron in a comment published on the SuperCamps company, and continues to say: "This is a joyful, thrilling and unreasonable history with a strong message I love to read to your children, because it is always found in it any form or message that we are missing."
And it would be good, except the last paragraph in which Cameron is prescribed, to report the content of the book, but in fact it is a single movie that was covered in 2012, with new persons and details added to develop a very short original event.
"In the surrounded gardens of the city of Alliance, where no green and even air was sold for money, the boy, named Ted, hopes to get the heart of Audrey - the girls of his dreams to see the real tree," we read in the Description of a lovely history known by Dr. Suzu (the actual name of Teodor Susan Gazel), who died in 1991.
If this seems uncertain, Cameron's text is almost read as a short post of the Larex film, published on the Internet Movie Database website: "In the environmental high stars of the city, where everything was artistic and even air sales for money, the boy named Ted hopes to get the heart of Odry - the girls of his dreams."
It seems unreasonable that Cameron, in general recognition of an active parent, is so unconscious of the content of a book named a boy knows how it destroys the environmental shocking of trees and the "single" band, despite the protests of Loraks (which is issued in the name of the book) is a smuggling substance with the skin that speaks of the name of the trees."
It is likely that such an incomplete PR post was assigned to a executive who had never read the Laraks book 20 times.
The representative of Dunning-Strite said that the text was intended to be obtained from Cameron's office in the election circle.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was obtained from Cameroon's stage, but it did not follow further comments.
For Adam Lita, it was apparently a risk not to spend in the collection of England, but it is still a complex issue.
The winning of Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is an unfair task, but if you look at the collection that England has chosen for this tour, the recurrence of the test series on the last time, it seems not to me to be persuaded.
I wouldn't have excluded the victory on my field.
The Alistair Cook team may have been less experienced than three years ago, but there are games that are vulnerable and collective thoughts; they will not be shocked since 2012, but only a young one's position.
Monen Ali is converted to a bowl with sweet meat, and Adile Rashid, even if he is unknown for the test level, is an attacking option.
Furthermore, Adam Lit was out of England's collection on the test cricket and replaced by Alex Hayes
The decision on the exception of Adam Lita, the main trainer at New Yorkshire, is difficult to analyze me.
On his seven tests, there were two good attacks in complex conditions, but the evident but cruel reality is that cryket games are evaluated by judges.
There were no questions on John Ruth, for example, that the declaration was brought, because (and I have said it before) the games are better chosen by themselves.
A couple of fever, and Lita could wait for more long carriage, but he was in his own court.
We hope that if he gets more wounds for New Yorkshire, there's another chance.
The main trainer of the assembly of England, Trevor Baillis, was well referred to his way, even when he didn't show what he could, and that's not surprised me; he's mostly the command game, and then the rest.
The question of how much time it will take before the test cricket remains a complex issue.
Lit played in seven games like Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton was nine.
Only Compton had a chance to play in his and in the foreign field.
The only thing you could be welcomed is that England chose Jonathan Treott for the Caribbean Prime Minister when Lit was in the best form, but this lost possibility is already in the past.
It appears to be Alex Hayes, and he's a bathsman I'm appreciated.
He was an unpredictable cricketist that we saw in the New York City club at the beginning of this season when he paid 236 in a shop against us at the Trent Bridge area, which was already something.
He must be provided at least the same time as those who were before him, but it will, of course, depend on the composition of the OAS team.
The mosquito put Mona next to Cook as an open busman that would give the opportunity to introduce an additional snake, keeping four fast bottles, and I'm not right against it.
I don't see why a fool player can't shoot there, but this legend has already shown that he's a good cricketist.
Monn, maybe not exactly what it's necessary for the Wurstershire grade but was a third number for them, and there's no big difference here.
My old companion by Jastin Langer played his first 38 test machines "Third Beatsman" before going to be open in 2001.
He won three hundred immediately and didn't look.
Zaphar Annari comes to the collection of a reserve, and with my uncontinued society, he has shown me a very promising young man.
People may look at his example statistics — a mid-31 of battle and 35 of the mould — and think that it is a risked rate, but among the shoes of the voters, a little and elected youth.
He's going to learn a lot in this tour.
In addition to the collection, England plans to make a couple of practical supplements in the training composition.
The appointment of Mahera Jayawordin, Sri Lanka Butsman, could be a master path.
He is one of the best guys for the game that brings the richest experience of it in all possible conditions and any attacks.
Paul Colingwood is included in the games where the white skin is used, and is assured as energy as well as insufficient speed.
I always felt that he was born to be an international cricket, either a game or a training work, and, like Mahel, had a small intellect.
Sometimes a new voice in the dispatch, even though they say what was already stated before, can bring new team forces.
Collega Colly on the Darem Ben Stuux team left for a day, Ruth provides a similar interruption in relation to Australia, and I, for example, do not experience this problem.
Although not all of these are agreed, trains and persons who choose players do not determine the schedule.
And you have to remember how games are depending on the results.
Such decisions are never easily taken.
The Championship of Foreigners from Europe may be able to win if the economy is in the depression until 2017
The unplanned police David Cameron on the renewing of British maintenance negotiations in the EU has experienced more difficulties every day, even without the election of Jeremy's genetic "is it or not?" - the Corbine of the League League leader or TUC in Europe on Monday.
Foreigners also have their Corbines and Nigera Faragey.
The European Political diplomat explained, at the time, that the situation in which the EU is now concerned with different crises - not all of them own - is some of the participating countries on the hole of the British Economy Agenda for Sustainable Distributions and the subsequent change agreements that they are mainly not wishing.
After meeting in Briton at an annual meeting, TUC decided that he would not, in any case, want to destroy social protection.
We could even call this "Daviva and George's Style Programme".
The Prime Minister and the Finance Minister are cast on the Samita and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photographing themselves on the background of the known local memorandum, in the company of local representation or without it, and then come home and say that they join together to reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to be interested in maintaining external contacts under the tens of Europe - "Do not leave with us together with France," says Berlin - proposes that the ministers and officials in some capitals have reached the understanding when they become the same as we stay or leave.
Angela Mercelle, a very careful officer of Germany, is an unity, but she is in the power of ten years and wants to leave the office before the situation was worried for those in her place of Tatcher (11 years), Mitterran (14) and Cole (16).
Head of France France, Olland, is before the rechange or replacement in 2017.
He also lost power.
Poland may immediately receive the nationalist government of the right touch, Spain, the left.
It is hard to see them useful from the skin in there to help the " British" whose energy could be lost to prevent Skotlands out of Britain - what they do not want, because most of them have similar separatory trends.
So some of these ministers may even plan for the extradition of unnecessary reserves in the SNP style during the Referendum campaign in Britain in 2017, in order to support the EU ' s outlooking process, my friend.
"Idee fix" and "Britannia has not received anything of value from the renewed negotiations".
Europeans know what the Flight Street might be, and as skeptically as the EU's media magnets were established, unlike the time of Tony Benham launched in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 to 2.1.
They can smilely remember Boris Johnson, a shocked Europorturist who glorified their "direct bananas" by the EU of the Brussels Corporation at the beginning of the 1990s.
With all his stupidity, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a pest company from the fearing jelly taxes, phone hackers and non-residents, most of our large newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair had the same view, but gave himself a report that when you're in the cell with a bowl, you have to give her the bananas to disappear it and not give her food on the ball and again with the tea.
In fact, Millibanando was a larger commitment to Blair, as it was, in contrast to Cameron's concept of referendum, since Biller had been the principles for the elimination of the EU Constitution, the garden of French and the Dutch electioners in 2005, which gave him a winning ticket.
He didn't forgive anything from that.
But my lady Jeremy Corbin, who had a friend of me on Monday at Westminster, I told him that he had no longer time to lose him on me - it seems to be risking to repeat the "Boycot Mercoke" strategy from the 80s and then, and now.
This may take time, but he must develop a subsequent strategy for interaction with the press is not with me, but perfectly with Andrew Marrom, whose watch was on Sunday.
The official position of the Corbine for Europe is that I are depending on evolution.
He said he would want us to remain in the reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside the Ukip traditional trend and a larger circle of "lateral English" among the tori may probably say "yes".
It's the same as Hilli Benn, but not Bennett, Benn said to the radio and TV this week, with its internal boss on all its forces refused to admit that the name of the Corbine of John McDonell, the Minister of Finance, was a bad idea.
This reminded me of the 70s, when his old sister from all of the tvs slaughter because of the unfaithfulness of the Laborist Office, not being too far and lost his post in the Ministers' office.
The Bethva Hilary was more appreciative.
But fighting to remain "in any circumstances" is Ben's phrase not what, said McDonald's, and not what J. C. spoke to the parliament at a private meeting on Wednesday evening, in general.
To want to report the democracy and the "speak" of Corbine - remember, he even tried to me - the discipline of the messages remains important at the round-sized television for seven days a week, and especially in the waterway of social networks, paralysis and pregnancy.
This is wisely not to let Cameron get away from Europe, allowing him to take the support of libraries during the Referendum campaign, as McDonell said.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But the main mistake of McDonald's membership in the EU, in the context of the "bennitic" economy, is no longer a question of an ézother debate among the left dissidents whose narcism, which is born in a minor difference, is a central principle in dogmatic discussions.
With regard to his mistakes regarding Nato-Tom Watson, J.C. will not act on the outcome - foreign diplomas will have to try to bring it to their leaders home.
Why is Paris or Berlin expenditure of political capital - they also have suspicious elections - when it can be unreasonable?
The United States have already been very disappointed by the weak military action of the United States in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the Government of the Authority has slowed expenditure, which I have recalled at Monday during a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticize electronic smoke reviews from the Public Health of England
Declaration by the funded Government of the Agency that electronic smokes are less harmful than smoking at 12 people, some of which are related to the Tavian Industry, as reported by researchers.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) together with Lancet have found evidence used by the Public Health Agency in their electronic cigarette report.
PHE has published an important report, the "returning" in the last month, called it "international review of evidence".
However, some researchers made doubt of data reliability and pointed to the connection of some experts with the tabak industry.
The last month, in the draft article of the Medical Journal, Lancet discovered the “excellently shocked”, based on which PHE has built its main conclusion.
In article BMJ, more two researchers asked whether these statements were "favoured or slightly foundation".
Martin McKi, the representative of the European Health School of London ' s hygiene and tropical medicine, and Simon Caepwell, who presented clinical epidemiology at the University of Liberal University, reported: "The basic principle of health - the rules should be based on evidence of efficiency."
According to their words, publicity expects that the PHE declaration shows that the "better evaluation shows that electronic cigarettes are about 95 per cent less harmful than smoking" was based on a detailed selection of evidence and modelling.
It is actually the only meeting of 12 persons to develop a multi-critical analysis model in order to promote their views on the damage related to different nitrogen products; the results of meetings are briefly presented in the scientific publication.
MacKi and Capewell reported that one of the meeting publishers was a company called EuroSwiss Health, the Director-General, whom he had reported that it had previously been financed from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also confirmed the BAT certificates in the health report on sustainable development.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced the financing of the electronic smoke producer, not mentioned by the financing he had previously received from the tax company Philip Morris.
The election of members of the Council was not made, but there were a number of known electronic smoke parties, some of which also declared the financing of the industry in the publication.
It is unknown if other participants have experiences of management in the Taxi.
The meeting also visited the manager of the Taxi Guide in the PHE.
The study article, published by the group, "speakly agreed" with the fact that there is a lack of "excellent evidence of the harmful impact of the majority of the product in most criteria", wrote McKi and Caepwell.
However, no of these connections and limitations have been traced in the PHE report.
McKi and Caepwell told that the PHE statements “in the present time there are no evidence that electronic smokes are a road that leads to children or smoking.”
Prof. Kevin Fronton, Leader of Health and Women in the PHE, told that BMJ claims had already been answered.
He said, "Electronic smokes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One of the two smokers of the whole life died because of their injury.
All evidence understood that the health threats from electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study remote consequences.
The PHE has a clear responsibility to inform the public about what evidence and what does not prove, especially where the publications had doubts about the relative danger in comparison with the tabak.
About 80,000 people die each year from smoking diseases, and smoking is 2 billion feet per year.
It is clear that, although electronic smokes are not safe, they only have part of the damage caused by smoking - we carry out our tasks before the nation.
The former Chapter of Channel 4 believes that BBC company should stop the EastEnders series
The former chapter of Channel 4 Luke Johnson believes that BBC should stop the explanation of programs such as EastEnder and The Voice, noted that their business competitors would give a lot for successful shows, as well as a nice operation on the Albert's Programme.
Johnson noted that licensing collections should be used only to establish programmes that were not implemented by other British telecommunications.
He criticized the BBC that the company was a transfer of public advertising, which must be viewed only a small part of the audition, at a short time when the competitors go to the show with high rating, and on channels such as BBC4.
After the Director-General of BBC Tony Holl said that the company would want to cooperate with other organizations, Johnson noted that he had tried in his six-year-old effort to organize cooperation with BBC during the channel 4.
"I can't separate from the thought that BBC is ready to start and translating transfers that could show competitive companies without subsidies," told Johnson to members of the Lord's Communications Committee in the context of the explanation of the further court of BBC.
If you keep the licence collection that I do not consider a good decision in a medium and long-term perspective, the company should leave only the programs that are not issued and will not be issued by other companies.
Shoo The Voice is in the slope, because the creators want to receive maximum support for the future.
The idea that nobody more shows it, is ridicule and apparently absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why regulatory taxes should go to the financing of transfers that could be paid without subsidies.
The Voice is one of these examples, EastEnders, and it is generally known that they are their own production.
Other channels, of course, would have been given much for it.
I don't understand how this can be a public advertisement.
I don't think it would be a BBC.
A series of Johnson entrepreneur, launched by channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused BBC in shooting with "for the mobilizations of staff and because of their faith that it is the best way to support the duration of the duration".
His comments on BBC's most popular shows are called with the comments of the Executive Director Sky Tony Bolla, which in his study of McTaggart's memory in Edinburgh in 2003, suggested BBC to sell East Enders series.
Johnson noted that the lower transmission of BBC public character " continue to go to BBC4, where it is often impossible to evaluate the audit, but the company's function is fulfilled, and that may be as a argument for the Canjean preaching that justifys the revenue of the license collections in 4 billion feet: "No, of course, we do all these unbelieving transfers that no one looks."
They're putting them into the shoot where no one will never see them.
With regard to the licence collection, Johnson reported to the Committee: "I call for you to find a more registered system about whom more will be obtained from it.
Of course, you're all thinking we all think that 150 feet per year is a great amount, but for people for whom 150 feet are large money, I'm interested, because they're thinking so because they're not very much looking and listening to the BBC.
The former Executive Director of Sky and Channel 5 David Elstein, who also spoke to the Committee on Monday, said that BBC should review the mission of Rita for information, education and development.
He noted that only a small part of the BBC material is formally classified as educational, it is 1 per cent of the television content and 0.1 per cent on the radio, and that the company should be subject to the initiative of Australian and Canadian advertising companies under the nine "Information, education and development".
On the partnership, Elsten noted that BBC should make more efforts in the fields such as the Premended Contracts (e.g., in its words, 'TV') and enter the Alliances with commercial advertising companies in order to make them available to review online.
Sonogenetics allows to control the brain cells using sound weather
The video shows that nomates change the direction of movement when they have the impact of sound impulses.
Scientists have produced snakes with a genetically modified nervous system that can be managed using sound smuggles.
Increased nonmates change the direction of the movement at the time they affect sound impulses, too high that human ear can hear them.
Impuls have effects by activating neurons genetically modified to use the membrane channels that react on ultrasonal waves.
Furthermore, researchers have controlled the brain by light
Scientists said that the thread showed the possibility of a new method called "sonogenics", which is intended to use the ultrasons to recover certain brain cells, heart and muscles, whereas the source of ultrasonau exists outside the body.
Sricant Chassani, a Scientific staff at the Solka Institute, La Haya, California, told Guardian that the methodology could once replace a deep stimulation of the brain, a invasive procedure in which human brain sends electrical impulses and used for the treatment of Parkinson.
Red-Natoids are normally not reacting to the ultrasounds, but Chassani found that they were starting to react when they were placed in the liquidity containing microscopic pounds.
He found that the powders have increased the ultrasound rail that then disappeared in the body of the wool.
Enhanced ultrasonic weathers affect the structures called TRP-4 channels, found in the memorans of some corner cells.
The vulтраsc waves make the ion channels to open and get cells related to them are reported in the Nature Communications report.
In order to create nonmatees that can be managed by the ultrasony, Chassani made genetic changes to the wheel, so that their motor neurons were used by TRP-4 and TRP-4 channels.
During the use of the ultrason for the impact of the modified organisms, the sound trails have increased microscopic pushers and have been introduced into the raw organisms by intensifying modified motor neurons.
This method is similar to the new direction of the scientist to include and exclude neurons using light impulses.
Chalahani argued that, compared to this method of solidarity, there may be some advantages.
Unlike the light, which is provided to the necessary part of the brain on the ocean, the low-spot ultrashore flows unprecedentedly through the skin of the body, so it does not need to pass within the corner box.
" We believe that, in order to treat some neurological diseases in clinical conditions, the use of genothertherapy and therapeutic virus can make human nerons sensitive to the ultrasonal signal, " said Chassani.
He added that, in addition, the methodology could apply to muscle and insulin cells.

Advertising statements are issued on the British arms trade
See the role of Amnesty International with protest against arms exhibition.
Awesome drones killers!
Destructive weights of iron candals!
Damn bombs!
Electrical light-shoes, which causes an inexperienced pain, but not leaves the sequences!
A strict voice and availability are not doubtful that the advertising of the greatest international weapons exhibition is a paradise prepared by Amnesty International in order to address the goal of the British Government ' s repressive systems, using the EXCeL centre in the Docundase for defence technologies and security systems.
Another subject: DSEI arms exhibition: Authority regimes are in London
However, the special campaign has also resulted in an emergency exhibition of a number of bus stops and trains that are required to see them again.
"The important declaration on the DLR line from 15 to 18 September?" is written on one of them by the London Metro fonts with a DLR line that turns into force of the tank.
In September this year, the trafficking traders strike at the DLR line. The passengers ask for help to prevent the exploding of weapons.
300 posts are described by artists who have made their work in the "True Design Mouse" in the Bank's Desmaland Park.
The Collection, called the "Official Pattern" Group, has helped to distribute them in London using the "reclaiming camp", a 6-four host key collection, which, as it is stated, "allows about three advertising spaces in the planet's bus stopping."
London's transporters were unlawful of such "vandalism" as non-declared audience.
One of the paradox declarations issued by the Group on the Pattern.
According to Gavin Greendon, a smoker of Cruel Designs and providers at the University of Escoce, artists are more demanding and are attempting to bring political art to the audience beyond the gallery.
Many artists start to work with protests, understood that they should be in real world for their art if they want to influence society.
Another test against the exhibition of weapons that welcomes passengers in the metro.
Amnesty's video was reviewed more than 1000,000 times per 24 hours on Facebook and created a VCCP worker for bono, with the addition of graphic designer and audio artists that also work freely.
The creative director of the VCCP Matt Lever was a remarkable peace surrounding arms exhibition, with a launch in the ExCel Calendar, and thought: "Let them make a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They thought to create a more realistic and hydro-based corporate advertising, but "completing her home with light colors and animation has become more enthusiasming".
"They were incredibly helping us to focus on the sale of illegal torture equipment on exhibition," says Tom Davis from Amnesty.
Now we need to ensure that the Government of the United Kingdom has taken measures and ensured that this torture equipment will not be legally sold directly to our arm.
It may be the most creative art of arms exhibition from ExCeL, where the participants are fantastically employed.
Saab opened information on the order of "AT4CS RS to shoot shoot shooting " by the United States army.

Eight gold rules of residence in students
11 years ago, since I moved to the student as a normal 19-year-old man, who still believed in the beach and morality, but just now I remember the smile of those who I disappointed - and many long-term complaints on others.
On the basis of what I learned, I can put it on eight simple rules.
The movement to the general can be shifted from the light of the nervous to the absolutely scary.
He encourages me to tell people where you're taking an academic leave and where you're going to support the Corbine and why you're "really, no, nor I hate Marmith" because, seriously, it's just a brain extract of Hahahaha, I'm going to be on yourself."
Respirate.
And help others too - give questions and demonstrate interest.
This supports conversation and helps you to find people you like, not those with whom you wouldn't even have spoken, even if you had a race, but they would have disappeared the fires.
Let's get people out of space.
People are often converted into drinking, medium-sized films, and general smoke places, but they are also where people are sweet and controlled whitely.
Another question: Don't even think to start learning at the university, in relation
Introverty in universities is injustice.
Your room must be refugees, but many communities form a styling culture from one room to another, which contributes to friendship, society and leads to debt friendship.
This may be a goddamn for those who try to restore the power.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want to keep friends with you, but I need you to go, and I could restore the energy I lost for your communication."
You're going to feel when your companion is cut off, not to shoot him, but to send SMS.
Actually, it's the stage, do this.
One man in my community followed this principle: if the door was not closed, he was invited to enter.
He saw something.
Take friends with the kitchen.
As you start a university life at a shoe of Bake-Off's popularity show, it's going to be shocked in the door to imagine and shoot a shooting shooter, that's not so strange in the 1950s, it's not like that with their "Breat, we're neighbors, and I'm going to smile to you, and I'm going to give you personal questions."
Propose home feeding is a good way to get married.
Your neighbors will feel that you'll be sick, and maybe your face will be associated with them with a nice surprise.
You know, this depends on how good you're.
The smell smells, sofa and grain will make people sleep when you're going to smile.
Eating is a typical crime in students.
You know, the induction of some smokers is a shooting, but it's a smuggle, it's a lot of milk for the chea?
You're going to the milk's owner.
Maybe he'll suggest you're not going to smile, even if it's inside the shooting.
If someone smells your things, it's smiling, and I feel you, but try to get away from this adult than my neighbor who put in his milk skin for the shoes to find out those who took it without demand.
Now she's in prison.
You don't have to make a sound that will prevent people to sleep or learn.
Not just to be a good man, but because you are the same people from the talking about the shoot houses.
The girl in my core asked the neighbor to kill the blue and the bash-guitars as three hours in the morning, and she's in the morning.
In response to the neighbor, the volume increased.
When he was finally quiet at 5:00 a.m., she was kind to let him sleep two hours, and then slaughtered her music and closed the door and sent him to a three-time review.
Wasn't it romantic if your future mate lived in the same community as you?
On the contrary, it wouldn't be extraordinary, before the shooting, except if you're taking your neighbor for your future mate, you'd like to have a relationship, and you should see him every day, and maybe look at how he moves to your side all your common friends?
Of course, you don't get your heart - but if your cold neighbor is perfectly not your future mate, make it easier to cover your own skin.
When you understand that someone left the keys inside your own slow room, the slight between the shooter and the smell more dark than it seems.
It's fun, but it's turning into its contradiction for the seconds considered.
Precious and interesting security lesson, hide something, but never pack any of the room of a tooth pack and shampoo.
Without the foreign door and leave the keys in the stainless water that you'll then put in the shooting, but don't get the foreign things in the Blu-Tack shooting two times.
iOS 9: as to set a new iPhone operational system after Apple update
The new operational system can be requested when you enter the Settings Appendix, select General, and then software Update.
If it is ready, the phone will allow you to scan him and install it.
Some have faced problems after the installation when the error reported to them that "Annualization could not be updated".
To avoid this, users are recommended or waited until the survival is stopped or try to update through iTunes.
The phone statements will allow you to go all the process to the end.
The process may include the removal of applications to increase the freedom of place, but Apple had minimised the possibility of this action, reduced the size of update, and also facilitated implementation by a special notification that proposes to remove the applications and to re-establish them after the process end.
You should be sure that when you update your phone is loaded or is close to your loaded device so that you don't let the battery disconnection.
If the apple is too low, the update is stopped because the phone order may lead to a bad update.

Washington responded to the military activity of Russia's phone call.
The Secretary of the United States, John Carry, called his Russian colleague Sergey Lawrence to discuss the situation in Syria.
He believes that the military support provided by Moscow by President Asadu is only towards the constraint of the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House will not speak to the Russian colleague, writes PJ Media.
The Secretary of the United States, John Kerry, called the Russian Foreign Minister for Foreign Affairs in order to discuss Russia's military activity in Syria.
This reports the PJ Media publication.
" The secretariat Kerry understood clearly that the further support of the President of Assad by Russia is to create a risk of distortion and proliferation of conflict, as well as negatively to our general goal - fighting with extremism - if we do not continue to concentrate on the search for the solution of Syrian conflict through direct transmission of the force", stated the representatives of the United States Department.
They also noted that Carry had regularly emphasized the commitment to the United States to combat the “Islam State” in the framework of coalition from over 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad could never be a member of her.
Furthermore, the United States "we will join Russia's constructive role in trying to oppose the Islamic State".
The past Friday, the representatives of the White House stated that they did not exactly know what Russian armies do in Syria, but Washington will discuss this issue with Moscow.
Furthermore, the Chairman of the White House, Josh Ernst, noted that time for a phone conversation between the President of the United States Barack of Obama and the Russian leader of Wormburg Puttin, until it comes: "When the President decides that the phone conversation with President Putin will go to our interests, he will spend the pipe and try to make the call. "
Barak Obama itself believes that Russia would increase the support of the Asaida ' s "producing rate".
I remember our conversation with Mr. Puttins four or five years ago when I told him that it was a mistake that the further support of Asad will only worse the situation.
"But he did not listen to my warnings - and the situation was worse," said the President of the United States.
The aircraft shall be released from customs payments.
The mine development is intended to temporaryly release aircrafts and other swimming means to relax and sport from customs and tax payments.
The Ministry of Administration of the RF Government was prepared for the changes in the list of loan goods.
It was reported to the Assistant of Minister for Economic Development, Elena Lashina.
In June 2015, Prime Minister RF, Dmitriy Medvedev, on the results of travel in the Cloma, has appointed a number of states of mini-economic development, Ministry of RF, Minicultures, MD, IFS, FIB, Russians to prepare proposals for the establishment of favorable conditions for icelands in the coastal areas of the country.
Experts, on their part, noted that the main problem is the absence of infrastructure for safeguarding, services and ice content.
The authorities prefer to store their courts out of borders — €2,200 million per year in the complaint of European States for shipping, repair and services.
The Russian Mine Development Development draft decision of the European Economic Commission on changes in the list of goods temporaryly carried out with full conditional release from customs payments, taxes, which provide full conditional release from customs payments, taxes and other loans for aircraft and sports.
According to the Ministry, this would, of course, help the establishment of favorable conditions for the development of icelands in the coastal areas of the country, said Lashina.
This issue was addressed to the subcommission on customs and non-arrithms regulation which protected measures in the external trade of the Government Commission on Economic Development and Integration held in September and was also accepted by states.
As noted by the representative of the Mineacon Development, the measures proposed to be full of conditional freedom in the aircraft are, in its own sense.
As a result, after the adoption of the protocol of the subcommission to the Government of the Russian Federation, the European Economic Commission will propose a discussion with the EAS Member States, explained Lashina.
The list of imported products that are fully released from customs e-mails, taxes include goods required to facilitate external economic activities and international cooperation, to apply in science, culture, cinematography, sport and tourism, to provide international assistance, and to provide services (Personal computers, machinery), control and medium-sized devices, burning equipment, spectacular costims and decorations, moved laboratoris and masters, water-goods, motorcycles, machines, sports, newspapers, newspapers, newspapers and newspapers.
In the press office of the Ministers RF, Jiswers told that they had prepared compulsory arrangements on marine ports Carchi, Sevastopol, Yelta, Feodozonia and Evoporation, which provide a simplified order for the preparation of shipping and exit of small, sportive and passenger courts in the sea port.
The mining is given to the Captains of the sea ports of Cromaa to ensure the simplified operation of small, sportive and passenger courts in the sea port and the outcome of the seas port.
The Minister has also prepared projects of RF Governments on the approval of the border of the Cromae sea ports.
With regard to Yelt and the Federation, the rest of the agreement have already been adopted, noted in the press of the State.
The view of the Ministers, the supervision, classification and observance, the hospitalization of small-scale courts used in non-commercial purposes must be implemented by the Republic of Cross and Sevastopol.
The problem is that Russia has been extremely weak because of the lowly developed infrastructure.
If we look at the south of Italy and France, there is a constant development industry in which a large number of people is involved.
In Russia, it's actually all on the place.
Our neighborhood is the Black Sea in Sochi, Helengica, New Russia, Anna, the only piece where we can circumspectly exploit ships.
But the great difficulty is that the border service rules are extremely strict in this area: in order to go forward, the masses of permissions must be formed.
Moreover, in Russia you're going to be shocked anywhere.
Two days she can go with her fuel, and then stands a problem where he takes, says the director of the Northmarine Company Dennis News.
With regard to the shipping place, Moscow and St. Petersburg now have special angels for ships up to 30 hours, and the vessels are also sent to guard in Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
News pointed out that the buyers of the ice is rich, but at the beginning, the ship demand was decreased.
The World Bank has paid Ukrainian credit for $500 million.
The World Bank approved a new refunded project for Ukraine for $500 million for the development of the financial sector.
This reported the press service of the international organization.
" The new financing supports a number of priorities for reform in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine," says the report.
The Director of the World Bank on Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine had stated that the reforms of the banking sector would help to restore credits in real economy and to encourage the restoration of economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities have taken the impressioning steps to reform economics and the World Bank observed the first sign of stabilization.
However, because of the serious problems of Phany, the Government of Ukraine calls for the rapidity of reform.
Previously, the Polish Government has approved the allocation of $100 million of Ukrainian credits, providing “Ria News”.
In prisons are requested to create separate blocks for transgenders.
The General Council for the Implementation of Criminal Sanctions (FIIN) on the Protection of the Rights condemned in October 2015, including other issues, discuss the possibility of establishing individual blocks for transgenders and transferers.
In this regard, the members of the Board of Vladimir Grib told them.
It believes that, in depending on the general number of convicted in Russia, individual chambers, blocks or even (if such crimes are much) may be able to establish a special colony for trans-selective.
However, Vladimir Grub stressed that to determine the punishment of the citizens in such isolated places only after the condemnants are going to go with relevant medical experts that will prove that a criminal is a person who is a person who is identified as a representative of the anti-pollution field.
He has established that the isolation of transgenders from other prisoners will ensure the security of the punishment.
In his words, the proposed practice has successfully been carried out: the AIDS (in which the accused cases are before the court), individual cameras for transgenders and the corrective institutions are special blocks.
This is the only way to work with such criminals today.
At the same time, they must be excluded, since the presence of transferers and transgenders in ordinary cameras is dangerous for them, the suffering of their family and the marine problems for FIIN staff.
The decrease of transmissions from cocamers is guaranteed, said Vladimir Grib.
Depending on how large it is, how many criminals with unspecified fields need to be considered where to distribute them.
SIZO needs not specifically only cameras, blocks in prison.
Yes, a separate column is possible if transgenders are much.
As explained by the Group, 50 or 100 persons can be found in the block, and if one specialized corporation is established in Russia, the punishment of the prisoner transsectors will be able to be sentenced from any regions.
The citizens are in the AIDS on the place of crimes, so the income of transfers or transgenders from other actors during the investigation and judicial process is unreal, and this is the case to introduce such practices for the already convicted in a separate colony - yes, it is the Gabine.
Remember, the law enforcement officials were not able to decide in which prisoner, a man or woman, to determine the detention detained for the 24-year-old drug transsessional, Dmitri Coyukah (known under the name of Alin Davis) was not arrested.
He's gone home under the signing of the invasion.
This news has been widely discussed in social networks and media, since the transgender content mechanisms in the AIDS and the columns in Russia have really not been available.
The Russian human rights defender, LGBT Activists (LGBT - Lesbians, gee, biosexuals, transsessionals) Nicolay Alexev supported the idea of establishing special places for the punishment of transgenders, noted that the possibility of individuals in the colony, husband or woman, in depending on their own desire.
In view of the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is right.
Yes, it's a very small percentage, but there's a problem, as well as the security question for homosexuals, says Alexev.
The prisons should be safe, so individual blocks could be done on behalf of this and for homosexuals, so that they are more in prisons than transgenders.
In this regard, Alexandre is doubtful that Russia had many citizens who are willing to take place for transceptuals because they are different from the ordinary colonies.
Of course, you can introduce medical observation before placed people in a colony for transgenders, but it is not always the same.
For example, one of the prisoners in the United States seemed to be a man, and already said in prison that he wanted to change the gender, said Alexandre.
A man may feel like anyone.
But until the individual places for transgenders are safe, I doubt that prison officials will think about the security of such people and avoid their orientation or sexual identification.
At the same time, the international expert on reproductive health in the territory of the RF, Boris Lordkipanidez, noted that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of transsectional crimes in the colony could delay the start of the punishment of convicted ones.
The Commission is a sexual issue, the psychiatrists have long-guarded monitoring, it is not one test based on a high-specific conclusion.
Today, psychiatric opportunities are enabled.
Therefore, before a different field, potential patients are always expertise - they clearly show whether the field change is the necessary action,” says Lardkipanide.
However, I am difficult to imagine how this system is to be introduced in relation to the accused, because the average of this survey is a month.
The doctor also doubts that, despite the general idea of establishing individual transsessional blocks, the current economic conditions would be to provide resources for the construction of new places, medical experts, transgenders in Russia.
No official statistics are difficult, but if you consider that Russia's homosexualists are about 5 per cent, it can be said that transgenders are still less than and those who have such a rejection and are still in crime are very low, said Lordki Panidz.
Now, as a request for the administration of the Homosexuality column, transgenders, and this may be provided for individual conditions.
Mikhail Antiopus wins the Younger World Championship on Shahmat.
The Championship of the Peace on Shahmats has been completed in Hantas-Mansik by junctions until 20 years.
The first end of the convenience has been more than an enthusiasm.
The winner was determined only in the last tour, and the Russians Mikhail Antiows became a Russian, who was shocked to the Yan-Kshishitofa Dudu pool, who would certainly go to the title.
The Ukrainian shakmatist Natalia Bux was winning.
The Championship of Peace on Shamats since the beginning of September in Hanta-Mansik, which was already at the middle of the tourist distance, seemed to have perished nearly all the attraction, since the representative of the Polish Yan-Kshishetof Dud, who had issued a series of four wins (13 Switzerlandn systems), was certainly switched by the leadership.
Bearing in mind that Dud was a first-feavorite rating of the Pervention, it is, in fact, one of the most promising young shakmatists, the probability that he would leave the reception, was very low.
And even when Duda was cutting the traffic and allowing Russians Mihail Antipow to reduce the displacement of 0.5 balls, he remained obvious in the fight against the title.
The Antipoulos had to be able to win in the 13th tour immediately.
But it wouldn't even help, win Dud to your party.
In fact, this is the obligation of victory, of course, could be said to the game of the Russian shamachist and bring to uncompensed errors.
Successfully, Michael Antioch was able to avoid them.
He was certainly engaged with Francis Rambaldi, after he was deemed to wait when his party ended by Dud, who met Benji Bok.
Successfully, the Polish shakmatist was struggling with the Dutch.
Thus, Antipolis and Duda had the same number of points - by 10 of 13 possible, but Antipoulos had best additional indicators.
That is why he is the leader of the Hanty-Mansium Autocircle, whose Governor Nathania Comaru, traditionally focused on the development of shamat in the region.
And there was no enduring end in the slaughter.
The leader of the tourist Nationality Buxe (Ukrainian) was not enough to lose the title in the last ture that she had successfully done.
So the victory of the Russians, Alina, the Bible, did not let her get Bux.
The Russian sport has remained the second with the disappearance of the champion at 0.5 ball.

Artemiaev, leader of the FAAS, said that the State against indexation of 10 per cent of the shipping and providing guests, as requested by OAS RJD.
First, they wanted 17 per cent of the index, now they want 10 per cent, and even multimillional subsidies from the budget, said he.
We say, it's too much, it's too much, it's too much, it's going to make your costs learning to economicize, refusing of the cost-based specialities, football teams, own TV, stop expending money on the left and right.
He added that the FAO had its "morely strict" proposals that are now discussed in the Government.
Polymetal considers the possibility of non-related calculation with Sumeru Gold B.V. instead of implementing a total of $300 million, reported to the gold granting company.
In this case, Polymetal must be paid to $80 million (the difference between the cost of the Sumeru and the market kitchen) which may be taken from the free money flow.
Sumeru has time to 3 October to make options or needs of payments.
The details of the negotiations in Polimetal are not discovered.
Option was concluded under the purchase of the "Kusil" Polymetal project in Kazakhstan.

As a tool for the evaluation of the Russian high-ethon professional reputation, the study supports the results of the Russian Administrators for year by identifying leaders in areas and functional directions.
The initial pool of candidates consists of the last year ratings.
The winners of the past year are invited to confirm their participation as a candidate for the current year and to issue members of their management team.
In addition, each of the initial lists of candidates propose to deliver to ten new managers from other companies, which would like to be added to the general pool of candidates.
The following office leaders may be moved: financial director, commercial director, staff director, ICT Director, Director for Public and Corporative Relations, Director of Authority and Corporate Management.
Each proposed manager is sent an invitation to join the train and provides an opportunity to deliver its management team and to ten new leaders from other companies.
The application of candidates on a sectoral basis is carried out by the Association Manager Classifier: information technologies, trade banks, forest and forest manufacturing industry, machinery, medium-sized, metallurgias, multi-profile colds, professional services, communications and telecommunications, services and production of consumer products, insurance, construction, trade, financial sector, manufacture, chemical industry, energy and fuel composite.

The company names are given in accordance with the Russian language rules and the rules "e.g.".
At the time of the publication, the rail can change the status of managers and companies.
Comfort rate for investment is 10-13 per cent.
As a result of experts, small and medium-sized business credit market in January-April this year was 40 per cent.
What is your appreciation today?
After the panic plans of the end of 2014, the IFB credit rates were significantly decreased.
It is understood that the increase in percentage rates is extremely increased.
The estimation of 25-30 per cent of the year was not benefited by anyone.
If the bank could impose all its possible problems in the advanced rate, from the duration to the non-return, it is not possible to do this now: taxes and so income.
For businesses, the current rate of IFB credit is incompatible.
For a significant part of the investment projects, the current level is unacceptable to their purchaseability.
Tax level 10-13% would allow business to invest in a wide project spectrum and to form an appreciative income.
How is your estimates satisfied with the request for enterprises for credit?
After the CB reduction, the situation was a little better.
Main resources were more accessible.
However, as we observed, customers have been able to pay a lot of money.
First, businesses do not understand the prospects of their development and future income.
Today, the business is one way: we need to learn to work on the current economic situation in the country and in the region.
We need to monitor the current results and monitor the movement of money.
At the same time, new technologies should be used to modify equipment, reduce production costs and energy security.
All of this, finally, allows the company to make the production more competitive and to maintain business even in an instable economic situation.
What main trends of the ISI credit market will strengthen and will influence its development until the end of 2015?
Is the rate of percentage changed?
Medium-sized rate projects will depend on the Central Bank policies, and the regulator now demonstrates that key rates are reduced.
However, the radiological fall of credit prices for IFM should not be expected.
The current situation of the problem is, first of all, an inflation that makes the necessary increased rate of per cent to the real income.
Furthermore, the cost of money in Russia remains high even when the CIA rates are reduced.
In the case of the duration level, the traditionally small and medium-sized enterprises, limited as in the ability to complement money, as well as in the options of adjustment of the economic behavior, will certainly represent a larger risk for creditors.
I wouldn't have been waiting for a significant reduction in the share of bad credits.
The main reason is the international sanctions and their negative impact on the economy of the country.
New Mazda C-5 and a perfect mode.
That is the word Mazda by the Japanese jerome.
Red, laconic and simultaneously complex is for those who are close to the cyliline or the latin.
Like the new C-5 crystal, as well as any other brand model: without ambitiousness, technically done inside.
The Japanese simply, under its "approximity", can be able to fulfil the bonds of the Star from the sun to the state of full relief.
You can make the arguments for the use of cars from other countries and, in principle, a person agrees to these arguments, but the whole communication is divided from the finance expression: "But this is the Japanese car!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Such people probably should love not only the technician, but also all other Japanese.
To quote from the Base path, to administer youaby food, to collect your cats and to get your friends - no, no, no, no, of course, but on the canon of the Japanese modern mode: nice, creative and very unexpected.
I am glad that the Japanese school form is the only form of which girls are pleased and after the school ended.
It has wonderful properties: at the same time, feeling, and strict.
And as older girls, the sweet is shorter.
The main change in the external N-5 is the decision of the radiator with five horizontal lines.
But where the more powerful changes the box of a new pharmaceutical image and the backwards, where the car is currently recognised in the stream of the car.
As before, Mazda Z-5 seems very conciliant.
The force is harmonized, the forms of feelings, but the externalness has a stress flow.
I don't have to call the police.
Rule C-5, one of the world's most safeest, can only be experienced by the Japanese peace.
The distance engine of 2.2 l provides a high swimming moment in a wide speed.
The fuel expenditure of this engine is composed of an automatical transmission and a full device.
Black bones, black sweet, black sweet...
To add a little black humor to this image, you can choose ligs with a police legend of No Cross.
In addition, Mazda has made maximum efforts to not be found on the C-5 Rule.
In order to increase the competitiveness, with the maintenance of this excellent management, the reconstruction of front and behind amortisators was transformed, and the shape of the front markets had also optimized.
The full system is adapted under Russian conditions.
The speed level of roads and motors at high speeds is decreased by 13 per cent.
The cobaltor in the flowers or shoes is the same as the budget sedan.
Another case if a girl comes in a shopping room with an original drawing.
For example, from a computer game in a roll shooter.
Attention to her then is not less than the new C-5!
The new C-5 building improved both the front and the back seats, which provides the optimal reserve of space and for wide stages, and for long feet, who owns.
Another long-term evaluation of the faces in the front of the central tonn is now mild and not shocked by the ships in the expressions.
The most wide range of active security systems of Mazda is proposed just at N-5.
In order to identify potential threats, there are radars, laser and cameras.
There's an adaptive lighting here, and the warning of swimming from the floors, and monitoring the dead zones, and safe movement.
Mazda C-5 is one of the best baggages in the class.
The load of a minimum expenditure is loaded by 561 l. The seats are represented in proportion 4:2:4, each section has an individual output market, and increased the bath sequence to 1560 m.
The cost of the multifilm in Japan is called "cigurums".
It looks particularly nice cygurums.
We can do it!
Of course I'm sleeping.
But it is still to develop small children.
Or simply shoot such a beast on the street...
This is so nice when there is a opportunity to choose — a pleasant clothes, a manner of conduct or a car.
Thank you for the preparation of KawaICAt shopping.
Kiev disrupted the atomic opinion.
Kiev officially refused Ukraine to cooperate with Russia on the rebuilding of the EFSA.
The Supreme Council, in the midst of the second trial, still proclaimed for the distortion of the agreement with Moscow.

The ESC HELNIKA of the project was to contain four GWT energy blocks with the WWF type reactors, but only two have been able to build.
Debates with the Moscow on the establishment brought to 2010 the intergovernmental agreement, and the Council adopted relevant laws in 2011-2012.
Since the funds in the Ukrainian budget were not expected to build blocks to be paid to the Russian party, but the resources were not allocated.
After turning to Kieve in February 2014 and the follow-up to two Kiev countries, they began to organize relations with Moscow in the atomic sector, announcing that they refused to cooperate with the Hmelnik of the EFSA and on the project of construction in Ukraine.
The single area in which the relationships remained, the carburant was purchased in the Ukrainian active ECA (a half of the energy processing in the country) as the Ukrainian energy NAC was replaced by the Russian supply.
From the plans of establishment of the EFSA with another contractor in Ukraine, it was not finally rejected: in Kiev in 2014, the negotiations with the Tschech Skoda JS were declared in 2014.

At the meetings of the surrounding Commissions, all observers and members of the Commission with the right to vote had been allowed to attend.
They stopped access only when the vote was completed and the members of the committees had not yet come to pay their bullets.
This was made to prevent different insurances.

However, the mountain of the election, which has already been considered more than 124 complaints on different cases, has not found any violations of the unlearned Bulletin.
The members of the Commission and the proposal for a colleague from the St. Russian ' s Holy Law had not been supported by Mary Pool through amendments to the regional legislation to clearly establish the time to hide convergences with the volunteers of a premature vote, which will then fall in the urn.

The FedEx issue has a sweet nature, a reduction in the 2016 prognosis.
FedEx was noted that the last quarter was unexpected, and the guider of the service has reduced the annual arrival projects due to the fall of demand for carriage services and the growth of costs in its land transportation unit.
The company also said that it was planned to take about 55.000 session workers at the festivals.
At the same time, in the last year, FedEx reported that there were 500,000 temporary workers at the feast.
The share of its shares was about 2,5 per cent of the pre-related trade for 45 minutes before the opening of the complaints in the middle.
FedEx Corp stated that it was planned to pay $10.40 to $10.90 in the financial year, which ended in the next May, that at 20 fees were less than in the previous prognosis.
Analytics proposed $10.84 according to the FactSet review.
In spite of the average rates of 4.9 per cent, which will enter into force on 4 January, and the increase in land transportation of heavy or guarity goods starting in November.
The company stated that it was still planned to increase expenditure compared to the last year by reducing expenditure, increased monetary income and online trade growth.
The President and the CEO Fred Smith said that the company had worked stablely with the weaknesses compared to prognosis, economic conditions, especially in the production and world trade.
The latest workforce plans were declared on the next day following the competitive competitor, UPS, that they are planning to establish additional 95 000 staff, about the number of workers taken in the past year.
For the quarter that was completed on August 31, FedEx paid $692 million, to 6 per cent more than the year ago.
The share income was $2.42, nearly $2.44 for the share of Zacks Investment Research for 12 analytics.
Income increased by $5 per cent, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts in Zacks were $12,23 billion.
FedEx suffered in recent years from the fall in the international emergency transport sector, resulting in the lack of a valuable income in its express transport unit.
However, the purchase blue has significantly improved the results in FedEx Ground.
The last quarter of land transport increased by 29 per cent, but the operational income remained generally without changes in high-speed transport and self-training costs.
The Express Transport Unit has received a higher income because of higher basic rates, while income in the carriage sector has lost due to increased labour costs.
For previous trade, FedEx shared $3.85 or 2.5 per cent to $150.15.
They closed the Monday, slowing at 11 per cent per year and 17 per cent below the recursion of 11 June.
In the most expected few years of meeting, the Federal Reserve System will take two days this week in a 27-foot-foot table from the Gondorace red tree, decided whether the key rate for the first 10 years should be taken.
At one time, a rich shocked room for meetings at two stages will depend on the citizen image of the United States.
The map is reminded that the President of the Federal Reserve System Janet L. Ellen and its colleagues should make the economic interests of the country above all others.
The Central Bank has received a double mandate from the Congress: to increase employment in the United States and to maintain the stability prices here.
However, since the Great Recesion, the Federal System acknowledged that there was a third non-registered mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate may be an unknown factor in a almost sponsorized decision announced on the fourth day, whether the United States economy is ready to take place from an unprecedented stimulation provided by almost zero short-term rate rate since the end of 2008.
Even the majority of data shows a reliable growth in the economy, the recent stress on world financial markets can maintain and so careful leaders of the Federal System from adding validity by raising the federal funds base rates - even only four per cent.
"Certainly, the market of work and inflation will become the first and most important object of consideration", said Lindsey M. Peegu, the main economicist of the Broker Company Stiff Nicolaus & Co.
"I think that if they're looking for a reason not to take up the rates that increased the incertitude around the world market enough to justify them to wait forward," she noted.
There is no consensus on what they do in the Federal Reserve System, which itself produces the financial market smuggling.
About half of the economists, recently revised Bloomberg, predicted the increase in the rate in this week.
However, the financial markets expect that the federal system will be maintained, provided that the key indicator only shows the likelihood of fast-speed consumption by about 30 per cent.
This may lead to the market of actions if the Federal System is raising rates, provided that those who make decisions do not strike the promise that the next increase will soon be increased.
On Monday, the Dow-Jons index was at 228.89 paragraphs, or 1.4 per cent, up to 16.599.85.
The flight was made with the expectations that the persons defined by the Federal System's strategy left a rate on this week, said John Lonceki, the main economic group of Moody's Capital Markets Research.
"It will be surprised if the federal system increases the rates at this time," he noted.
If the Federal Reserve System is doing so, "we must go far in the adoption of their strategy to keep the financial markets in the hands so that they don't be packed."
Other experts pointed out that the increased rates could be enhanced by the financial markets, as it would take incertitude to how the Federal System would operate.
Every month ago the Federal System seems to have been able to spend 0.25 per cent in this month, making the first small chain in the slow reliance of financial conditions, which would be able to confirm the persistence of the United States rebuilding.
Ellen declared early and early summer that it expected to increase taxes in this year, despite the complaints from the Liberals that the economic progress is needed.
Although new workplaces were delayed in August, the growth in the labour market was stabil in this year.
The unemployment has reduced up to 5,1 per cent in the last month, which is the lowest indicator for over seven years and almost at the level of the Federal System as a full employment.
The rate of payment shows speed signs.
While inflation continues to be lowered by the yearly central bank for 2 per cent, the Federal System stated that the key cause was the temporary impact of oil prices.
The economics "we can achieve and need higher rates, taking into account the reduction in the labour market," noted Ian Sheferdson, the main economicist Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, the financial markets around the world have become shocked at the end of the last month, after China has paid their currency.
The average Dou-Jons-Index for Industry Accounts slowed to a total of 16 per cent in May with a recursive high value, as investors feared that the delay of Chinese economy could slow the world growth.
The dimension of its positions in this month has gradually restored, and the Dou-Jons index is now at about 10 per cent below the high value of May.
In order to guide the Federal Reserve System, the market restraints are further complicated in the unfair calculation of the rate of increased rate.
"In the absence of the fact that the financial markets and the news on the weakness of China's economy would have become closed on the meeting, " said Steven D. Oliner, senior researcher UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former official of the Federal Reserve System.
Now, according to him, they will expect at least a month to obtain more control of the consequences.
"There is a great incertitude of the consequences of the American economy and they have almost no reliable data after the last events in China," said Oliver.
The health of the world economy does not include the main concerns of the federal system, and its techniques should not be taken into account in the decision-making.
However, the Federal Reserve System became a world financial authority.
The impact of the Central Bank in recent years was great.
Only one mood from the then Chairman Ben S. Bernak in 2013 was that the Federal Reserve System could "speak" its money expansion, calling out the markets over the world.
In the world where markets and economic systems are increasingly overcome, it might be expected that federal reserve system leaders will not only follow the development of events throughout the world but also consult with other Central Banks and experts in order to understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process is "speed art than science", noted Zakari Karabel, leader of the Investnet Inc, company that operates in global state management strategies.
Jeffrey Laker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted in this month that "in the history of the Federal Reserve System, there were excessive reactions to the financial market movement, which seemed to be not related to economic principles."
Laker, a member with the right to vote by the Federal Deputy for the Open Market Committee, which was to improve rates, was an example of decisions 1998-99.
The Asian financial crisis has resulted in the fact that the federal system has reduced its base rate by 0.75 per cent for three meetings, "inviting the limited identification effects for growth in the United States," said Laker.
A year later, the federal system has deleted these reductions.
The Federal Reserve System should set the first place for the stability in the period of large crisis, such as the market in 2008,” said Adam S. Pozeen, former member of the Bank of England Tax.
The last panic and nearly did not approach this level, he said.
" You wouldn't, of course, want to be in the situation when you fear the growth of the rates because the markets are shocked," said Pozeen, President of the World Economic Institute of them.
The Federal Reserve System Act remains a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and, until it is not changed, I do not think that they should overcome the events.

The Hospital of Sergey Narican allows the United States to destabilize the situation in the Middle East so that refugee trails cry to Europe.
The Interfax reported that opinion to journalists in Ulan-Bator under the sixth session of the parliamentary Assembly of the OSCE.
"I'm not a conspiratory partner, but the question is asked myself: is Europe not the final purpose of those who have destabilized the situation in North Africa and the Middle East in recent years?" he asked.

The official Damaskus believes that such terrorists are a terrorist.
The President of Syria called the cause of the unconsciousness of the West to Russia.
The claims of West to countries such as Syria, Russia and Iran are in fact that they are sovereign States.

The note at Washington Post is beautiful that it's all over.
The former minister of Defence of DNA, Igor Stricky, naturally nobody had linked and had been able to go out of the Republic of Donbas in a very appealable order, without credibility, without three funds of money, which are recorded to him by different persons," he noted.

The Brazilian Pediators Riu-Grandi promotes healthy food for the grain
The Brazilian Pediatric Organisation, SPRS, has planned a skandal method to avoid women in the need for full food during the crudely dischargement: the method is to demonstrate the images of girls with grain smells swallowing the images of harmful food.
There are various whites, grains, vitamins and hydrocarbons from which children receive all nutritional substances that are required to build a strong immune system.
With respect to high energy needs, women pregnant and born are recommended to increase daily calor standards at about 500 calories in the shore.
However, recent study shows that one improvement of calibracy is not the only change in the diabetes that the mother must do.
In recent study, Robert Waterland, professor of the Bailar Medical College in Texas, has found that the healthy food of pregnant women actually affects the expression of genes in children and prevents development in them.
Unfortunately, the negative impact of the inerte nutrition on the immune system was identified.

Now, AMA recommends not to take this kind of sport, but, from its view, to prohibit it.
I understand what happens unexpectedly - said the Vice-President of Steven Pernis.
But in the way that there is now a box, such situations will always occur when the sports receive blood disorder or brain trauma that leads to death, or a serious damage.
For this reason, AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with this.

Sergey Narican invited the OBSE to derogate sanctions with respect to RF parliamentarys.
The scripture of RF Sergey Narashyn was called an invalid introduction of sanctions against parliamentarys.
In this regard, he declared, speaking at the UNOBSE session in the Ulan-Bator.
We appreciate this as an invalid action, as the value of the parliamentary diplomacy.
“It should not be repeated, because it is the manifestation of political impurity and the ignorance of the principles of an open international dialogue,” said the politician.
Furthermore, Nariashn called the OBSE participants to restore Russia and the EU's partnership.
Let's go back to policy.
Let us return dialogue and the right to the practice of international community.
Let's turn back the gumnist ideas into democratic orders.
"The two never ended good," he said.
By the Court of the Parliament of the Russian Parliament, the Spieker of the Council called by the parliamentarys to consult the inter-parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.

The Champion of the Peace on a easy atletic Sergey Suvenk.
This season can be called a triumphal for a 24-year-old lift from Barnaole Sergey SUBENKOWA.
At its coronal distance of 110 meters of barriers to win Europe's command, to establish several recursions, and to become a champion of peace, which is first in the history of a widespread barrier.
In addition, recently, the Sports wined the 2011 final stage of the Brazilian Liga, which was the third part.
New Publications requested Swedish to share the impressions from the coming season.
Sergey, does the season not end for you?
Yes, I'm going to go to World Military Games, which will go October to Core, and then I'll be thinking about relaxing.
True, I'm ready to be home now, Barnaole, and being home, it's a very different condition.
It's more easy than every week to spend peace.
You've told you that the bathroom's a loved year for you.
The end of August, the beginning of September, is a great time.
After the primary season, the load of responsibilities will not be given.
You can be joyful, "slow".
You know, and let me go right now...
Is there a slowness?
All the seasons are special, positive emotions...
The slowness to the end of the season is always shocking.
And here's no importance of what I've done more -- winning or playing.
Each race is stress.
Standing ships, movements are not all passed for the body.
You're physically and emotional.
But now the emotions have me, of course, on the floor.
I'm just happy.
To time when they finished the world champion in Peking, you're often back?
That's right.
Yeah, you, journalists, don't let me forget this.
But in fact, I think that the bad sporter who lives in old winners is inflicting his successful shoes again and again.
The winner of a couple of days, and we have to move forward.
The preparation for this wonderful season was very different from an accurate?
I can't say that there was something such special.
We've been ready to start in December, but the winter season I've missed.
It was trained first at Barnaole, then at the meetings, and then home again.
Everything's normal.
But with the trainer, I was able to try to go to a new level that I wasn't yet.
Practically, the winter costs time to put the base.
They flew a number of crews, trained together with physics, including and burden, and we hidden the snake.
Then we took the barrier training, and many were employed by the technician.
How do you follow the fighters?
I'm always trying to do this, well in the Internet's era, there's no problem.
I saw the winter champion of Europe, and there was a shock in the bar.
I thought more: I need to do something, to remove the company.
With each age in this season, you sweared and sweared the results.
Did that make sure?
I have all the last seasons that are about the same scheme.
Not what I'm going on first 13,20, and then 13,50.
I'm always slowly cutting my shape.
The main thing you wanted to do is get away from 13 seconds.
All the work was focused mainly on that result.
But paradox is that you feel that you're ready to shoot, and that you're not always ready to show up your willingness.
How was that, for example, at the Olympice in London?
I, if honestly, tried to forget it immediately.
It was very good, really it could get away from 13 seconds.
Even if you repeated your best result at that time, it would be a blonde game device.
But it wasn't lucky.
Do you remember your first world champion?
What about?
It was in Tegu.
I wanted to get out of the final, this was the Maximum program.
And he went away from the morning in the pre-spot flights.
Then I realized that smelling and smelling the head is that there's no way to fly.
Two years later, the World Championship in Moscow has already been finished with the best time.
I remember my feelings before the decisive shift: I wanted to win "good" already!
How is it possible to develop a good speed, not to lose your head, not to disable?
And this is the most complex.
We need to be very accurate, focused on the technician so that we don't get the barriers away.
I noticed that when you're not on the result, but on the process, it's much easier.
And the most chair when you feel that you're flying, and it's like yourself!
The real word, it's right.
Many of our aircrafts from the depths after the first serious success are trying to move closer to the capital.
Didn't you ever have such ideas?
The house's still better.
I don't imagine where I'm without my train, whom I need?
Maybe it would have better conditions, but I'm trying to be satisfied with what I have.
C, you've been together for a long time?
For 12 years, since the athletics came into the light.
Exactly, I first trained his wife who worked with my children, and then she brought me.
I started with a spant, and then I shooted, three.
The child's multitude was that when they put a moon, they're swimming from the place...
In 14, I tried to run with barriers, and I liked.
From the first time, the standards of the second adult group have been implemented.
That's it.
Didn't the fear of barriers ever be?
Sometimes it's possible to agree with them.
But there was always a lot of work on the technology.
It's over the one shooting!
But there's nothing to do from this routine.
The technicians have to be able to shoot me on the night, I'd get up and run through the bar.
Everyone who saw your seat in Peking claims that it was very beautiful.
Thank you.
I like myself.
Normally I don't keep my shifts, but I couldn't stay here.
But the effectiveness needs to continue to work - no preconditions of perfection.
Don't you worry now that the winning of the year before the Olympic Game is on a hard load?
As in such cases, I try to justify expectations.
Once you chose this way, it's supposed to go to the end.
My trainer likes to repeat: if you're not weak, no additional snake should feel.
And I'm absolutely agreed with him.
Lamb Kushanashville
But not so much I'm going to make me aware of the reaction to the interview that happened in Ukraine.
People are busy, I understand, their bread isn't smelling, shoot the enemies.
And even though I didn't have a fleet, and that's the same thing, a million times I spoke here, and nobody's calling anybody's right, it's a different job.
All my pseudonyms have been shocked in a second.
Pressing I'm doing is so strong that I even, a couple type, thinking that people are white.
It's going to go, go, and it's on you, and there's a smuggling shooting.
But you need to know me, I'm not a room oral, I'm sweet, I'm sweet, I'm old, guys, I'm afraid.
Another matter is no support.
I didn't have such illusions, but now...
The best in me was always self-sufficient, so you're making it.
And to give passports to such kinds like Fred Derst or Monson, they can't be shocked.
I'm better, the best journalist, I'm worried.
A week ago, in Kiev, Sara Kushanashvili, crymical events were occupied:
What they did with the Cross Mediterranean is a crime.
That's what they call an anonexy.
I believe that a reference to the extensive Crochet tried to sign anything, nor does it be inscribed in the general picture of human society.
That's how to come to the neighbor and get him home...
The war from Kremell went out, and she'll end up there only.
I have almost 100 per cent sure that, as the 2008 winter, she started from the phone of a creme shooter from Cremell.
I have proposals who could be...
It's not so long and there's been a lot of life.
I don't know, he's the biggest artist, why he's supposed to shoot his hands.
He's losing the apartment?
Well, get him a memory.
Of course, people recalled him as a distressing family.
And the reconciliation now depends only on the Lord of the Lord.

Three finalists are unique that "Holstk" Sam Wood is a perfect man, but who's going to choose?
The secret is opening?
Lana Jaon-Fellos, Sara Mackey and Snejana Marscocky may have understood who of them wins in the Holocaust.
The woman with which at the end of the end remains Sam Wood in the Horestjake, is around the western secret.
And the three of them who have arrived before the finish of the girl, they are surely keeping the silence of the one who has received him the last race.
But when we met Sarah Macey, Sleece Marscocky and Lana Jevons-Fellows on the day when three girls have to stay two, they may have given a statement about the winner.
Sam Wood slowly keeps silence to the finish that will be on Thursday.
All three women are in a liry man, telling why Wood is a perfect man mentioned on his feelings of humor, integrity, family values, livingness as reasons for each of them would be happy to become his satellite.
But their answers to the question, "If you don't, who should be the last wide race?", they could not be able to show who of them actually had the heart of the Holocaust.
Jevons-Fellows and Marscocky, uncertainly, called McKey the perfect couple for Wood.
A good relationship between Sara and Sam has been established since the first day.
"After I entered into the number of participants, I felt energy (Sala) and the energy of Sam and understood that they were very close to each other, and during the course of the show, I was not doubtful about it," said Janes-Fellos.
"Sara is a very open man, with her easier and glad," added Marcoski.
I saw them together, there's really a delay between them.
They feel beautiful and comfortable.
Sarah McKey believes that she and Sam Wood will get a nice couple.
Makkei said that by home witnesses last week she realized that Wood may have been "the one person".
"When I just saw him among my friends and parents, I realized that this is not exactly a game - I believed him with all the heart," she says.
The question who should choose Wood if it was not her, she answered wonderfully.
"I don't know if I can talk about it," she said.
I like both girls as well, and the Sunjana and Lana are perceived to this in the same way.
Shoo The Bachelor is in the middle of 1930 on the Ten channel.
Originally published as "Hara is the best choice of Sam Wood"?
Joffrey Haen had a number of options to start carriage in the NFL.
Detroit and Sittle were strongly interested in them after his movement to the United States, as well as many other clubs who sent requests after the impressed train day at the end of the last year.
But Haen chose San Francisco 49ers and train Jim Thomsula, and it seems to have been a wise decision.
Some trainers would have left Haya on the floor of all the rest of the games for the loss of the skin that the former australian line player allowed the first time to return the pants to the winning game with the "Minnesso" account of 20-3.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Haney another opportunity to return the pants, and he also joined him in the game after the rabbit of Regi Bush.
Tomsula showed himself to the good side and after the game, in the divorce.
Instead of establishing a division of news in the team's presence, he supported them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Haya at the press conference after the match.
The 49ers Club Reporter reported that Hayn also received support from the coordinator of Thomas McGoy's special team, who encouraged him to forget the lost meat and think about the next game.
Jarrid Hayen lost the shoes back to the band of the Minness Wikings team during the first fourth time.
At that point, the NHL Haen and its many Australian worshipers were clearly not calculated.
It was shown how Haen was ruined, and later he told the leader of the Hamish and Andy show at the Australian Radio Station 2DayFM 104.1, which couldn't imagine an older age for carriage in the NFL.
"So happens, you're just thinking about the next game and everything," said Hayen.
Hayen compared his debtors in the Origin game series in 2007 when the shooting shooting in his shooting area has tried to Quinsland.
Finally, this experience was very useful for the 27-year-old player.
Haine was photod with Australian flags and fanats after the game and posted a picture in Instagram.

Google launchs a double-building campaign for the collection of $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced the start of a donation campaign designed for the collection of $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping refugee countries who fled from disappeared war and dinner countries.
Google used an unharmed personal approach by an anonymous campaign of the collection of gifts in his blog.
Instead of making a statement, Google Rita Madum, who runs with the family of Kabul when she was seven years old, described his personal experience.
"We have come to doubtful trains and buses, to suffer hunger, desire, cold and fear," she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But as the crisis of refugees and migrants in Europe has increased, many such people, such as my family, are desperately needing for help.
The donations will be transferred to four non-commercial organizations employed by refugees and migrants: “Products without border”, the International Relief Committee, Save the Child and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that it would be the first $5,5 million of donations until the amount of the google.com/refugeerelief would not be reached by 11 million.

Many run away from the armed wars of Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Diabetes with small fertilizing may help surgery
A pleasant effect after the surgery of grain in persons with small fertilizers who suffer a 2-type diabetes may pass at least five years according to the new study.
However, even soon to say that the diabetes with small oxygen live more after the oxygen surgery than those receiving non-chirurgic treatment.
"The mortality statistics are not soon shown", said Dr. Robin Bleckstone, a expert on the surgery surgery surgery's new study in the JAMA editor.
The surgery of fermentation, or barritory surgery, uses various methods to reduce the size of the heavy.
They reduce hunger feeling and limit the capacity of the organizations to raise food.
In a few years, bariator surgery has proved its effectiveness for the treatment of diabetes 2 but the main studies were conducted among people with morbide oxygen with body mass index (MT) 35 or above.
IMIT, the weight measure for growth, is considered normal, from 18.5 to 24.9.
IMD 25 or above, it is said that human weight is lost, and people with ICT above 30 are considered to be gentlemen.
You can calculate your IMT here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new study of Tayban Hospital, Min-Sheng General researchers used the data collected since 2007 for comparing two types of barritory surgery - slaughtering and handling gastronomy, with the medical treatment of 2 types of diabetes with small heat.
The average value of ICTs in the surgical intervention was from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year of their participation.
At the same time, ICT those who have received non-chirurgic treatment from diabetes remains at the level 29.
Among those who moved operations were totally dissolved from the diabetes 36 per cent, and partly 28 per cent.
The medication group in comparison with the total treatment of diabetes was observed by only 1 per cent, and only about 2 per cent.
In addition, blood pressure indicators, triglicerids and " bad " LPNP " were generally better in the surgical group,” states the authors.
Studiers also controlled the blood level A1s, reflecting the blood sugar levels in dinamic blood.
Hemoglobin A1c better hold below 7 percent, writes researchers.
After the surgical interaction, the A1c average hemoglobine was decreased from about 9 per cent to about 6 per cent.
However, in the therapeutic group, he remained stable, about 8 per cent.
However, the best indicators of the fluchem control reflected by the hypoglobine A1c did not reduce mortality levels for five years, according to Dr. Chi-Heng Su and colleagues.
The research group also compared the average results of two types of surgical treatment.
For the fifth year, compared with the hand-handed gastronomy group, the slaughter group had lost more weight (18.7 km against 14.2 km), increased ICT reduction (a.4 to 5.1) and A1s (3.1 per cent against 2.1 per cent) and was closer to the full remission of diabetes (46.9 per cent against 16.7 per cent).
While a new study does not demonstrate the advantages of the surgical method in the part of the life period after five years, there is a confirmation of the results of the investigation of people with the lost body in Sweden that the surgical treatment actually leads to increase the sustainability of life, as reported by Bleckstone from the Medicine University in Finix, the University of Arizona.
According to the Swedish study for persons who elected barritory interference, the possibility of died for 15 years was around 29 per cent below compared to a group in which more traditional methods were applied.
Despite the new study has not shown increased life sustainability, Blackstone noted that it would encourage people with ICT below 35 interested in this procedure.
" The report is very important, since it claims that such surgical intervention is safe in the group with low ICT, where there is no increased risk of mortality or sexual disease, " said she.
Blakeston adds that people and their doctors should start a serious consideration of the weight, just as the patient had been in the diameter between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long to let people do this seriously," she said.
I think that when they get genetic changes that start in their body of gentleness and diabetes, it is very difficult to make it again.
In the Mitians, there were 9 million rubbers from the chair house.
In the Mitians, there were 9 million rubbers and three women's shoes.
This is the "Interfax" with the IWD Press Service.
The Inspector came on Tuesday morning.
Two unknown ones, through the open entrance doors, entered the house situated on the Garden Street, connected the 20-year-old son of the house and, threatening both feet, slaughtered 9 million rubbers and three shoes.
According to the preliminary data, the amount of the damage was 9 265.000 rubbers, as a criminal case under the Razboy article.
Fanates from Europe are risked to become homeless.
Only 23 Peterburg hotels have the right to accommodate tourists that will come in 2018 to see the Championship of the World on Flotball.
The ultimate guests are not intended to receive appropriate permission.
experts think that's a very worried sign.
In the prevention of the world's primary, the authorities should urgently consider how to divid all guests of the city.
The Rosbalt advisers believe that the cost of the coal apartment is 10-30 per cent due to the turtle, and that and after the champion of the coal housing, it must be paid.
The Championship of the Peace on Flowball has emphasized the state of Russian guests.
According to the law written under the first convention, each hotel Petersburg should be classified and prove that it corresponds to the number of stars and the level of the service.
It is now understood that this is not all: the hotels are so scared of checking that they often have not sent documents to request the Federal Antimonopolis Service for Petersburg.
As Head of the UFAS Vadim Wormlers reported, the State has studied 138 hotels and now plans 34 cases on the guests, many who simply did not respond to the anti-mono-users.
There are signs that the leadership of the three decades of companies has been inflicted by a slight or a different number of stars in the advertising, noted the Worships.
The problem is that, now on account of each number, no one can lose before 2018.
The officials suspect that during a football champion, the peppers will take all the peterbourg hotels.
Now, in the town of the tourists, 30.5.000 numbers can be calculated.
According to Smollnow, in Petersburg, 17 five-year-old hotels, 51 four-star hotels, 100-2 and 3-stars, 550 one-stars.
According to the first Vice-Chairman of the Nana Guinea Tourism Committee, only 23 guests had been classified at this time - such a verification of the company accredited in Peterburg.
And whether some of the hotels have ordered such a procedure in regional enterprises, the Smoul of the surprising situation was unknown.
I mean, the last classification may also be more, but no one knows about it.
The director of the Northwest Office of the Russian Tourist Ecatherine Shadaki, who was the last half of the hotels, recognized the head of the Northwest Office of the Russian Union.
This is explained in the high season, during which the hotels pay more money and do not want to do other matters.
Another reason is that the budgets in which the checking expenditures were not made, and the guest may depend on the status of 30 to 100 000 rules and more.
However, recently, the guest leaders have been intensified and began to make requests for classification, assured the Shadaw.
The hotels have to be paid until 1 July 2016, not only they pay the wages, but have no right to work on the world championship.
It is already known that, depending on the stars, a fixed payment in the hotel will be developed at the time of the tourism.
The terms for which the value will be calculated are numbered in the next year.
This was done to prevent the flow of prices to 200-300 per cent, for example during the Peterburg Economic Forum.
We need to have conscience and not allow up to two-third times, but the hotels must also be paid.
"I think that growth will be up to 50 percent," explained President of the Russian Host Association of Gennadei Lamshin.
In its own view, Vadim Gormimler is not convinced that the fixing of the prices corresponds to the understanding of the market economy.
I don't know how this is in the economic theory framework, but I hope this measure is justified.
"It's better to travel", he noted.
It's not clear that it will be with popular hostels.
The Members of the Hospitals have introduced a draft law which has to be prohibited in homes.
We hope that this law will not be adopted or dealed with Petersburg.
"We will leave the point of view that the hostels must be kept," says Nana Guazia.
However, it said that the mini-actor owners, in any case, should be ready to restore the Life Code.
If the Hospital's draft legislation is in Petersburg, about 80 per cent of the hostels, and at this time 1.5 thousands of numbers.
According to the President of the Federation of Re restaurants and hotels of North-Zao Ocean Leonida Harvar, in Peterburg there are no two-third hotels, which are covered by football farmers, as well as there are four and five stars.
This situation is similar when "in the 80-month stadiums are 750,000 wheels".
This can be corrected as once through mini-actors.
The expert's possible prohibition is "ideotic": "It seems to be strange that one person can live in the apartments, and that's why there is no reason."
If the guest is used as a community, I agree that it's wrong.
But if you come as a guest in which the guests come to a short time, why not?
The mini-hotels are risking to lose the champion of the world on a football and because of their irradiority.
The whole hundreds of small hotels simply have not been able to classify themselves.
To summer 2016, all the guests of the city will be assigned.
"Communities that may not take this procedure so much, therefore they will reject less paid orders from mini hotels but choose those traveling," noted Gennadei Lamshin, added that in a number of cities, such as Moscow and Volgograd, passed checks at this time significantly above the Peterburgians.
The result of Peterburg Delay is related, including the permanent stopping in the Turkish shuttle, which does not contribute to a coherent work.
Experts believe that if the Peterburger hotels are not enough, they may have to be focused on the areas hotels and the rest home.
For example, Petersburg’s 300-year-old celebration may mobilize a different fleet, which means the tourist guests will be able to live in castles.
In addition, many smugglers will be prepared for the slaughter, where they can be at night.
"It's not to make so many guests so they're wearing, "saved Gennadee Lamshine.
The large popularity of the football priest will also be used in a commodity housing.
The most likely one in the city will build a cotted apartment reservation.
Rail lines will grow up to 10 to 30 percent.
"The first place is to go near the stadium," noted a specialist for the development Agency and research in Laris Bragin's inmobility.
The price of the rail may not be returned to the previous level after Championet, especially in bed areas.
This will contribute to the construction of new transport services in the area of the city, emphasized.
It should not be forgotten by human qualities.
For example, Leonard Harvard is convinced that Petersburg was always a hospital city where people are not simplely guided by the road but may still be a mini-explosion.
There's also complications.
My father, in the 1970s, met a family from Murmanska, a father, a mother and two children.
There were some nights, and the guests and the guests were hard to sleep on the board.
"And Dad brought them to our communal apartment to sleep", remembered the cousin.
Truly, it adds that this spectrum was not left in the cities to call to her home the consequences and fears.
But may, after the lack of decisions, the hotels and the Governments have to remember in 2018?
The Julian's "Sends" of the Amuria area.
Today, with enthusiasm, he looked at the clause of the Jürinus in Goskun.
He did such things when our generation was still learning to trade newspapers, and he is still in a beautiful form.
The topic, like "the LDR protest against the results of the Amirian elections".
Protocols are not triggered - because there is nothing; other protocols, except signed by the elections, are in the LDR, judged at all.
He is the second place of Ivan Abram, and he cries something like: "This is the winner of the elections."
And there's nothing to do with Rodney, and then, after the chair, the fraction of the meeting room is cut down, "You're all with the fronts of your shoes and shoes."
The press is naturally accentuated not at Abrahamwa, but on the scandal and demarch of the fraction as a result of the scandal and distress.
Really, Volfoovic was beautiful and elegantly swimming the Amuria area together with the Abraham.
For the whole country, this is the normal journey of the Jürinus style, and it is not always protesting the political party against the results of concrete elections.
And the fraction was formally scanned, and the elections were not acknowledged, but the leaders of the subject evidently cry.
He offers the dead in Amore himself to crown his dead, and he pronounced against the only Russians in the whole and nothing that has not been sentenced to Rodney.
A great decision to not lose the face, and in the reality, but not the shown scanned.
Another thing is now that Abram itself is in a strange situation.
He did not expect anything, but no alternative protocols on the hand.
He is not in public attention, on the other hand, and on the other hand, he was formally conducted and to torment the respected champion, and, in other words, the Champagners in the ER and the ONG.
And there, of course, he must really think about what to do.
Because from the main beneficiary of the elections, policy number 2 of the region and candidate number 1 to the only area of one-handled circle, it can be converted into a couple that has been possiblely used by its own party leadership and super-speaker for the same UNFF and for the party leadership of the foreign.
That's exactly that it wouldn't be Jironic, he would have been thinking about and watching him almost.
It's still growing and growing to him.
The news showed that LDR returns to the hall during the next plenary.
That's what the bath is gone.
Only the theme of Abram is polluted.
It's really red.
"It's impossible to all come to Europe."
Europe cannot take all refugees, stated that the real decision of the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The leader of the Tibeth Buddhists called for the end of violence in refugee countries.
The continued crisis of refugee crisis was addressed in the opening of the Centre of Consulting in Oxford, dedicated to the Ethic Studies, at the beginning of its 10-day visit in Britain.
He said that in existing circumstances, human interests should be above the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, although this results in refusal, the reaction of Western European countries to the crisis of refugees is not adequate.
"It's impossible to all come to Europe," he noted in his own speech.
Although Dalai Lama highlighted the actions undertaken by Germany and Austria in relation to the crisis, he stressed that it was only a timely decision.
"The concern of thousands of refugees is beautiful, but at the same time you should think about long-term decisions how to bring real peace and development, mainly through education, in these Islamic countries," he stressed.
Finally, we should consider how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We need to deficit the use of force.
The application of the force has never solved these problems," he added.
According to violence, Dalaylama also commented on the action of George Bush after the terrorist acts 9/11, said that the US cruel reaction had started the cereals of non-controlled events.
After 9/11, I expressed my convictions in the letter of President Bush and said that the problem could be addressed by non-weapon.
I know that his purpose was good, but he applied the power, and it has caused unexpected consequences," said Daly-Lama.
Four democratic growth in the last four years
Toxicological centres in the United States reported about almost 400 per cent increase, starting since 2010, the number of children under 12 years of age that have been declined with high sperm, as reports the Toxics Centre of Georgia.
According to Dr. Galorda Lopes, director of the Toxicology Centre of Georgia, the case of the proclamation of children to 12 years of hepatitis for the declination of the hands reported in the toxicological centre increased from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
"The children are contacting these substances more and, unfortunately, some per cent of them are sent to the Headquarters", said Lopes CNN.
He said that some children have a special deficiency drinking, and some do this to make a impression on their friends, or towards social networks.
The YouTube video shows that adolescents have a declining flexibility as a decreasing drink.
As reported, adolescents have dismissed the deficiency of a spy-containing liquidity for the routine to get more stronger drinking.
Childs of a teenager may touch the pleasant lowness.
"The baby doesn't think it might hurt him," said Lopez.
Many of the most attractives (disfixing skins for hands) are aromatised.
There are deficiencious weights for the hands of clobs, wine and apples, which are very attractive for children.
The deficiency of the hand contains 45 to 95 per cent of the spurt.
In small children, in particular, only a number of disappointments can cause alcohol equality.
“ This is a high-concentration spray,” said Fox 4 in Cansas City, Dr. Steven Thornton, the principal doctor of the Toxicology Centre in Canasas University Hospital.
You wouldn't just leave the whiskey as a whiskey, but people keep these deficiencious means for your hand, and if children are taking them, it's a fast way to use a large number of alcohols.
Rassel, a six-year-old girl who recently promoted a dismissing means for the school with a cluster aroma in a number of approximately four discounts, was sent to the Headquarters.
The blood level in it was 179, two times more than an adult, which is considered in the state of alcoholism, according to Dr. Chris Ritchy, a doctor who had been treated in the Gwinnett medical centre not far from Atlanta.
He traveled the words and couldn’t walk when she was put to the office of rapid assistance.
The doctors watched her all night in a single child clinic to avoid missing any signs of brain trauma because the girl fell down and shooted the head, said Ritchie.
"It was very scared," told CNN SCOT, mother of Nazi.
That could be dead for my child.
Lopes recommended that parents and teachers use non-pilot substances or deficiencies, instead of stirling deficiencies for children ' s reaching zone.
In addition to alcohol disappearance, some deficiencious hydrocarbons are linked to deaths.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after the declination of the instrument contained in toxicly unreasoned ingredient.
Health officers suspect that the product contains metal is a death agent, not a physician that was indicated as an active substance.
In January, three four-quarter students in the north of New York condemned to compare their "resistance" teacher through the "distribution of antibactrial substances in the class", according to the police report.
The teachers made a strong allergic for desinflators for their hands, and she prohibited to keep them in their class.
The police believes that the unsuccessful plan was a " post-spread" and addresses the issues of the discipline of school district.
As the oldest child library in Barnaole became a family club.
At the slope of the castle, the N.N.K. swimming sweet snake in their shoeting library.
Young people who are looking for books are trying to fix her confeets.
A few generations have been in the library for 95 years.
The first readers in the last twenty years have been cut here with a slight piece, spectacles on the Maako’s spectacles, launched literature vectors and recorded with the wife of Lenin.
The rescription continued four years, and the 1939 newspaper The Youth Fashioner, with the "Family of the Constantine Group and the Child Library of the city of Barnaula" became more strong.
Constantine's hope even sent away from the barnaul friends a photo of her child.
And when the barnaulers asked, whether Constantine’s Hope was not influenced to bring her name, he wrote that no, he did not.
The letters are long covered in the museum, and the first readers have to explain whose bad profile steals the barrier in the library building.
In the years of rebuilding, they were often calling different people, saying: Why is the child’s library not renamed?
Please be a library of name a good child writer, without political shock!
Workers of the village library, thought and decided to leave everything.
It's the most famous and loved library in Barnaole, like "Leinki" in Moscow.
In the field of the library, the car is a strike from a helmed cyrpipea.
"The Origin of the Delicate city" is a lovely theme of the artist Oli Moscowy.
Olla was a legal manager, had been an eighth worker and was five, and all other managers were different from love for qualification.
And then there was an advertising in the Internet: "The illustrator is needed for a book."
The book wrote a little American girl, and she was called "My Cancer Mommy" - "Mother cancer in my mother."
He made his illustrations and thought that life could end at any time, and there will be no miracles in it if you don't create them.
Now she works in the library, illustrates the children’s books of the world, and its own statements.
Traditionally, children lost interest in the book that they are still living in some virtual space...
But there are children readers, and their parents understand the importance of reading -- tells the Russian Planet Director of the Tatiana Kushvid Library.
In the past few years, we have even been assured that the child's library needs, and she's going to live - kids are going here!
I think it's interested to read back.
The library is a large exhibition with updated photo exhibition.
On the quarter, new pictures of readers that are in the entire family library: mother, father and children.
The library welcomes that the pope has become more often.
If a child has been reading all the Cuchows in two years, he needs a more complex book.
But now the law under which the eighth-year-old junk has been prohibited to issue books from category 12+.
To obtain such a book, the child must bring parents to herself - they come back and then return, and the "Cruz" slowly becomes something like a family club.
In the library, a revolutionary collectioner was sweet and herms, conducted the King in the annex to the New York magazine in 1936.
Because we are now not only a conceptual booking space, we are now open to move, but we are trying to become a special place: not a house, not a job, not a school, and Tatiana Kushvid explains.
We can come here to read, play, shoot all together.
We've made a game area for a little kid's just going to play, and the hands still go to the book!
Some of our parent readers take care of their feet, and they're not going to get away.
Moms are often coming with the shoes - and we are glad that the library is the first place among all the rest of the places where they have to come with the kids.
The mother of Kushvid says: The modern children like classic kid literature as we have ever said:
"The creative matter is now developed, and a lot of attention is given to the authors who are a linking agreement between generations."
And if they talk about small children, they are important to be a hero that travels from one book to another.
Kids don't like to get up with their heroes.
The library regularly issues books for parents in which it is in the modern child literature, which books should be focused on and why.
The bottles are so encouraging and encouraging that adults are interested, but this library is not for them.
The issue of books on the front of the read room for adults is prohibited.
This magnificent privileges only has children.
...In the latest library room, there is a quarter ball with an old wooden board in the box.
The girls will shut up under your steps, that's a very old time machine.
With your childhood book you're seeing like old friends: Hello, well, we're not changed with you.
Ellie is still a joyful step on the road that was able to strike with a skilled skille, the ring of the Tolla Rijke's shoes, and the Malchish-Kibalchish did not say to the deceased shoes of the Military Taina is a strong word.
The books are like the passwords, you can know their own in any place.
There are roots in the storage and the actual books - for example, the revolutionary collectioner was with the souls and hermes.
Or to conduct King in a famous annex to New York magazine.
Or the "Morzily" in 1936.
The time was stolen, the page was cut into a tea color.
These publications are no longer issued to readers.
It's our future collection, and I'm all dreaming -- I'll go to the pension and take younger books.
But the kids aren't going to say that, and the beautifuls in old books aren't very light, and the themes... you're opening the first page, and there's Lenin, the party, the committee.
Now it seems to be: why did we all write this Pioneer Truth?
But it was still interesting - it tells Galina Elisa that was a book guarding.
Mursylsky's pages were cut off from time.
Galina Vasiliana has a book guarding all his life.
She knows the color of the cylinder in Buratino, in which Harry Potter was the captain of the Griffindor Championship at the championship, in which situations Carlson uses a motorist, and whom is the father of Alice Severine.
The library work is little paying, and everyone who can live without these lines is very fast to find another professional.
It is only the most convinced ones: the teachers, the pedagogues, the workers of the book culture.
They can also know that it's a professional child library.
If he rid you in the first minute, it's a professional.
I really love children's books: as a library I like that they should be precisely and beautifully standing on the fields, and I like to read them, says Galina Vasilivan.
I'm reading everything: military, historical behavior, statements, fantastics.
Reading modern Russian authors, traduction...
Of course, I think there was everything else in my childhood.
The books were the most interesting and inspiring of everything that happened with me then.
And as I was ridiculous to love them, I thought the library was a magnificent place.
And I wanted to work where everyone sits and read.
I hope the book will always be, despite the riders.
And I'm glad that our former readers bring children and the grandsons...
Listen: Slovenia does not have any differences
Graphits checked discussions on the disagreements in Sertica after the recognition of Dale that "Hupps" in a bad situation, but it will correct it.

The former Reyngers and the former members of the United States collected Ronald de Burr declared that the Dutch football farmers had lost interest in the Selkness because he was not covered by the Rongers' title.
Where Bour, currently the Representative of Akkos, said, "There are no longer the most appreciative moments of playing "Seltica" and why?"
That's because it's not the Rangers.
People here aren't just talking about the Reangers' return.
They're talking about the Star Company.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interesting.
The Star Company plays a lot of pressures, and not only people in Skotlandia want to see these games.
"I'm all changed," said Dale.
Ronnie Dale acknowledged that "Slect" had difficulties, but the Norwegian trainer shouted everything to change.
According to "Malma" and, as a result, the Champion League immediately afterwards the 10-footballists of "Aberdin", which now takes the top table box.
However, Dale said, "The Selitha was bad periods and before, and we will go again."
Now we want to get out of this as fast as possible.
I understand that it's very enormous, and there's a lot of people very, very bad or disappointed of what happens.
And we too, but we need to continue.
And we really need the Sertica support, because the games are much better.
Stay together now so important.
Warberton is incredibly waiting for January transfers
Despite the view that the whole few weeks ago, they suggested that he determined some of the goals of the January Transfers, the boss of the Redners Mark Warberton is incredible with regard to the January campaign, claiming that he did not want to destroy the team.
The previous attacker Brentford said, "The Yenvar transfer window is very different from the flight window."
As regards the players coming in the year, you have a period before the beginning of the season for their adjustment, which you have seen in our own group in this session.
The team's really good work.
Sometimes there is more harm to add unnecessary players to what you really need.
The thoughts that the Sletic interested, emphasized the finishment of the carriage.
The shock of Soonsy, linked to "Settick" during the transfer window, stressed that he could leave a football after the contract with "Liveds".
29-year-old player suffered from shipping problems for two years, and he couldn't leave Wells this summer.
"Charts" will oppose the SFA on Nylson's statements.

Donnelly: The Tannadis Council is confident in the "Dandy Younged" mining
Simon Donnelly claims that the Board of Directors of Danny Yunetted is still sure that the manager's team will change the situation to the best, but agrees that the deterioration of the scope should be ended.
I think Steven Thompson believes in us.
We will prepare the people to go again," said Donnelly.
MacInness is glad that he won Hamilton.
Dereck Macinez acknowledged that his "Abertin" team had been desperately fighting against Hamilton Assis to achieve the seventh winning in the first liga, which had put them up to five points above the "Seltica", above the tourist table, through Adam Runey's panels in the first time.
MacInness said, "No team that would have winned anything is a cube or a liga champion who did not win meetings like this."

In these 12 months, we have seen the further improvement of Skotlandian market situations in growth in employment and unemployment reduction.
Why I Is A Witness in Oclahom
Today, when I abandoned legal participation at the late stage, I'll see how people say it.
If this happens, and I hope it's not yet, I'm gonna sit on the guard garage of the mortality camera in the Oklakoma State when Richard Glossip will be shocked with a dead injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
The first request was made in January, through his close friend, and even though I was returned to shock, I agreed.
At the nearest time I was afraid.
So why do you do that?
I agreed, as I thought it was a good way to tell the detailed history of the death penalty.
That would propose a unique racism.
Yes, journalists are authorized to attend the courts in America, and since those wishing are often more than the place, the results of the lady lottery are decided who will be chosen.
The number of press locations were reduced from 12 to five.
Whoever was chosen, he will look at it without emotions.
I can't do that.
I'm going to sit with the closest friends Richard Glossip, and we have experienced our own relationships after a few months of phone calls and one visit over two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We're often laughing when we talk to him.
The prison administration claims that I can't be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I'm not allowed to take blocks and hands to write what I see.
I have to try to remember all the details.
One journalist in Oklakoma accused me in Twitter that I do my impartiality.
That's a lesson.
Tell him the story of the prison, as he likes, to get access.
I thanked her.
She acknowledged that she could "we could" but she still believed that I was wrong about what I do.
Richard Glossip didn't agree with what I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me that I was writing, and I wouldn't do this even if he said.
I told him that he could get me out of his list of Witnesses at any time.
But he wants the journalist of the international publication here to write it.
If he dies, he believes that it helps the movement of the death penalty.
Kim Belver, a reporter from Hafington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this, listen to the subscriptions I wrote.
I'm not going to get here in detail again.
I can't be sure that Richard Glassep is not guilty.
His acts after the murder, Barry Van Treeze, are guilty of crime.
But I believe there is a great possibility that he's not guilty of murder.
I am strongly convinced that the authority for the death condemnation was not enough.
I think his punishment is wrong.
And I'll see how he dies.
I can't say I'm a whole objection.
It will be other reporters to which it is possible.
From me you know how this is to look like a man who loves me dies without the need.
The prosecution of the Human Police has been deputed out of the Canning River
The Canning-Well Constellation has been able to talk to man out of the Canning River and to remain sweet.
The people of Perta intended to get out of the police, but they didn't know, shooting into a smooth water in a few meters from the police officer, which tried to "speak to talk to him to the beach".
The police of Canning Wail was sent on Tuesday on the unlawful pronouncement on the Foreign Territory in Baqingum.
When the police were noticed the suspected, he tried to get out of them and leave to Canning.
But he didn't have a boyfriend far away.
"He stood in the water and said, "I'm not going out, let's go, laugh me," said the old sergeant Shandel Castle.
The Laclan Perhavez constitute was not very desired to make a form, so he used a more safeer receipt - " negotiations with a good police."
"Atimes people do strange things to try to escape", says the senior sergeant Castledan.
The footballist-chumpion Ben Cassince is that and remembered.
In 2006, Cassince went to the cube to avoid meetings with the police patrol to check alcohol and tried to stop Soon.
His efforts were shocked, but the local people were shocked to discover a shooting "Batlon Ben Casinz".
Peter Mudy accuses the sports in trying to spy and threaten to get out of the end of the sport
Peter Mudy accused Racing Victoria’s stirs in trying to introduce a spy into his ship last year and threatened that the end was immediately left.
His museum became shoes and officers of Racing Victoria, whom he accused that they organized a personal campaign against him, and removed from old Lady Tatai because of the violation of the rules of use of drugs in the old day, in the middle, became the last slomb.
Musdi reported Fairfax Media that he always illustrated all the efforts in the skatings and was in a difficult situation when he was talking about the positive results of the leaderships to what he could not explain.
He held the language of suspicion in the spy for half years and did not want it to "seen as green wine."
"I wouldn't speak anything about it, and I had suffered long time, but sometimes you're so exiled from the colea that you're not going to stop," said Mudy.
They know that it's continued.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to survive the consequences and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep strongly.
I want to walk with a high-standing head and I want my owners to know - I do everything to them.
When they'll start thinking that's not true, I'll have to stop being a trainer.
Then I have to think what to do with my license.
Previously, Musdi declared sensitively during the interview at the racing.com that the Ethics Division had tried to spy in his chariot.
"A half years ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stuart sat in the room with the man I'm calling if they ask him, and they invited him to work in my chair to transmit information about what I'm doing in the chair," said Mudy at Racing.com.
They're apparently thinking I'm a smoker.
If so, all of them should, of course, make a statement because the attempt to get me out of them is not possible.
Robert Rollton, former Chairman of RVL, David Mudy, current Chairman of RVL, and Bernard Sondry, the executive director of RVL, knows about it all the time and now.
Doesn't this allow me to think that the case is personal?
Should RVL be courageous and call for reply to what is happening in this business, other people other than trainers?
Is I a Cool for this Professional?
Is that what I'm wrong for this professional?
Maybe people think it's like that.
Maybe they're gonna have to take my license and cut me out, and I don't doubt what I'm saying now, I can let them think about it.
But I came up to the point where I'm going to be, and that's me awesome.
I'm sorry for this.
I will give pressure to them and be responsible for decision-making.
I have a family support, and I can go.
The trainer was only growing during the long investigation of the case with the cobalt and the leaders, and the last cutting of the horses from the age told him to say that he could "move his license on the table".
Muddy, most well-known about preparing an unbelievable champion of Blake Kaviar, called for the application of medical instruments on the day of the "remembering" refrigeration after the legs of the horses were made compressed from the grain, which is a violation of the rules.
This is a violation of the rule on the shoes.
"I must take full responsibility for it," he said.
One of my wrong workers made her complaint on his feet.
She could get a complaint last night.
She could get him yesterday, as it was.
She was with him on the day of the walk.
Museums may be dismissed for three months in accordance with the rules for the application of medical preparations on the day of decrease for the use of the compression, which opened the investigation.
It's an anecdote.
Those who establish these rules do not know anything about horses.
"We all know that we need a rule, but that's too far," said Musdi.
Training driver and switching from the place of Cabea (Kiabam), arrested
The police was arrested by a man who was a motociclist in Kyriam on Wednesday and was hidden from the place of the event.
The motociclist was put on a helicopter in the Hospital Royal Melbourne, with serious wounds after the slaughter of the car on Murray Welle Hawaii on Saturday morning.
The police said that the driver was gone without stopping to help a fervent motorcycle.
On Monday, the 50-year-old residence of the city of Natal was the police in Sheperton.
It is expected to be sentenced to leave the location of events, non-assisting and violation of other rules of road movement.
The motociclist, a 40-year-old resident of Kyama, remains in a stable hospital.
Melbourne Storm Trainer, Craig Bellma, is part of the accused of conspirators in the use of cruel force admissions
Melbourne Storm train, Craig Bellma, called the shooting criticism of his shooting team as a "abination of the agenda" by two NRL chariot fabrics.
The Trinity Rosters train stated that the judges allowed Storm to fight with his team during the immediate winning of Storm in the end of the qualified game in Sidma on Friday night.
Brian Broncks trainer Wayne Bennet made an apparition on the Star after his team funded a qualification tournament at the Northern Quinnsland Kabujos night on Saturday, when he called this typical game for the driving line and said that two of the Queensland teams weren't successful in the leading appeal.
Bells protected the shooting of their team and claimed that they were just focused on the "contact" by shooting the skin.
Bellham added that he had the confidence of his team ' s criticism from two leading trains, since this means that they are concerned about the possible slaughter of the Ttorm.
"I didn't hear that Trent Robinson talked about heavy receptions when they played us with account 242," said Bellam in the midst.
I can ask you that we have not changed anything all year in our systems or technologies, just in the past six weeks we have given special attention to contacts with the smell, and that was a turning moment for us.
There's three years ago, and he's obviously training a good team, so he's probably not likely to play, and it's got a little tricky for him.
It's amazing how it is always shown in this year.
Bellam talked to Bennett's idea about the impressioning football, recalled his teacher that the St. Jorge-Ellavar Dregons wins in Championette 2010, showing a sweet football.
Wayne's talking about the hidden football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with our Friday night, and see how impressing their game was," noted Belize.
I remember that in 2010, Saint-Jorge was a little criticized, calling a sweet team, and Wayne said that he wasn't worried about it.
But now he has a team that can show what he is looking for as an impressionant football, especially his young half-defenders with their speed.
It's a football in which you would like to play when you have such games.
He made this observation in 2010, and now he wants to all play in a football in his style - not in each team, there are two defenders such as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, that they could play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things, because some of them are worried about playing with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when they arrived to big games.
Bellham also noted that the "Storm" and "Rosters" game was consistent with a large number of views than the Bronscope and the "Chavajos" game.
The Broncks game probably was good, I didn't see her, but what was the account? 16-12?
He was at our game 20:18, had two other trials - and what is this a impressioning football?
Or consider impressed interruptions and unexpected attempts?
It's a rutin for me.
If they mention us, it means that at some stage we can meet them there.
The "Storm" at the end of this week, as they wined the right to take Nort Quinnsland Kaubyoz, or "Cronalla Sharx" on Saturday afternoon at the AAMI Park stage, the tickets will be sold on Tuesday morning.
Prosecuted for the reserve of drugs serbs issued by $2000,000
A man who threatens the life-care prison to spend 40 kilos of cocaine in Quinsand Contract was issued by $2000,000.
Marco Maximvich, 29 years old, was one of the five arrested men last month after the federal police found 100 kilometres of drugs on Solay, who had seen from South America through the Vanuatu and slaughtered in Kumer in August.
During the entire morning, Maximuit and his messagers were watched at the stage, and later he met them in Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 km of drugs in the Toyota Echo car.
Despite the threat of the deadline of life for the purchase of drugs in the number of enough to sell, the lawyer Maximвич claims that the evidence that the last party has tried to abolish the whole party is missing, and that a man could be in the coffee without any meaning.
The Supreme Court of Justice Peter Flanagan doubted that Maximuit had to leave.
The last report has been linked to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in the court in the midst.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied the police about the place of his arrival.
The mothers and fathers of Maximvich were proposed to make a joint loan of $2000,000 for his release.
"The facts of both are apparently that the amount of $20,000 is too much financial burden for them", noted the Judge Flanagan.
But one of the measures is inadequate as a guarantee that it would not disappear, added the judge.
Maximвич was allowed to be released under the shuttle, provided that it would be held as an Australian and Serbian passport, every day to be observed in the police and to observe the comandant hour from 6 to 6 a.m. to 6 o'clock.

I talked to the trainer Dimtris Stodis several times this year, and I, once I joined the team, quotes "R-Sports". - Factly, I'd be able to make the function of Sasha Kaun, who has left the team, as well as in the attack of the three-second zone, and I think I'm going to be able to do this.
Yeah, I need some time to rebuild the center position, even though I played more forward.
But now it's going to be more to resist the big crowd, but I've already done it, so I think, and now I'm going to do it.
The last time the Army wins Eurolygu in 2008.
Since then, they got six times to Final Four, but they couldn't show their best basketbol every time.
It's the opinion that somebody's shocked.
All this game, you can't run forever.
Of course, it's complicated. I understand all the disappointment of the club and his ballers.
But we have a good team now, and if we show the best thing we can, we have a good chance to win Euroly, I really think so.
I always wanted to win this title, the mocks have run to the tourism, and I think this year will be the CSC.
With regard to the smell, I am not a sovereign man and I don't believe in any wickedness.
I believe in a hard work and decisiveness if you connect these two things, it's possible.
I don't have any certain rituals before playing. I'm just listening to music and trying to relax the way it is possible.

I returned to Rome a few years later, for which I got a certain experience.
I have a very warm memories with Rome.
This will be a special game for me, but that's not so important.
The main thing is to try champions in Liga.
The august-based meeting at Kuba Johan Gamper does not affect the team's action in the nearest match.

Despite the weakness of the shop, I can say that we have played well, it brings the official WEFA words of Cannes.
"Banfick" above the class, but in the home match, I think we can take a look at them.
It's real.
But first, we need to think about Galatazara and then about Atleticco.
In home shops, we can switch the shoes in anybody.

The main trainer Rafael Beetes expressed the satisfaction of the great victory in the 1st tour of the Championship Tower of Champions with Shahter (4:0).
The specialist gave the appointment of Cristinan Ronald, who became the author of three heads.
Matt was not easy because "Shahter" could have a shirt, it brings the official WEFA words of Bentes.
There were no few moments, but their counterparts are always in danger.
I don't say that Real played perfectly, but we were prevailing.
I'm glad that we didn't lose the mould and killed four.

This is the best game in the world, I repeat it as many times.

It is difficult to play, because they are not only unique, but also clear individuals.
To leave them, we need to smell the whole match and smell each other.
The Messiah has almost always been successful when it comes, so we need to keep compliance and organizationality.

The estimated reduction of workplaces is about 2.7 billion US$, starting from the fourth quarter, stated in the Hewlett-Packard statement.
" This restructuring provides more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise", stated Mag Whitman, Chairman and Director-General Hewlett Packard, who will launch the organization after the separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be less concentrated than now Hewlett-Packard, and business portfolio will be wide and deeply helping the company to move to the new business style," said Whitman.
As a separate company, we are in better condition than before to respond to the growing demands of our customers around the world.

Captain Arsenal, Michael Artet said his colleagues should support the traumated Jack Wilshire's game before playing "Denamo Zaw"
In the conversation with Wilshire Wenger, he also stressed that only September, and that, in the condition of the rebuilding of the Wilshire, nothing would prevent him from returning to Christmas.
With the very appreciative development of the Wilshire events, at least four of the next games in England will be clearly held and, taking into account the success, its participation in the Championship of Europe remains in the next year.
Both in this recent problem, Wilshire had certainly finished the previous season with the only trauma of the boat and had seen to return to an aggressive style of game during the pre-session preparation.
Wenger: "The trauma is not threatening his carriage."
It's just not the end of the living bone.
Nothing serious.
It's just a case.
This is not related to ships or traumas that it had happened before.
This may be related to medical point of view, but, as Wenger has allowed, there is a slight risk of additional trauma for any player returning to the middle of the season.
There is also an unpleasant train.
According to the Primier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire has fixed 23 different traumas for six years of his debt.
He also played only in 65 of 157 "Arsenal" games in the liga for the last five seasons.
If you look at the "Arsenal" schedule wide, you can note that in six of the eighth seasons, starting from 2007 to 08, the Arsenal was one of the two Premier Line clubs, which are the most delayed days.
Wenger recognizes the possibility of shocking in the portrait, but Arsenal believes that the improvement of the raw statistics will continue in the last season.
"Atimely, when you return to the trauma, you're vulnerable for some time - for that time you need to restore the power and take the competitive advantage," said Winger.
Jack's enough young, and it's going to be.
I hope he'll restore physically, I'm sure that his carriage will be the one he's worth.
The Arsenal starts the Championships in the Mediterranean with "Dinamo Zagreb" and continues to play on Saturday with Chelsey and the next environment, with the "Tethenham Hotspur", and Wenger intends to break up the composition.
Dr. Belerin and Aaron Ramzi had not come to Croatia, so they would like to play the mother of Debush and Artite.
Wenger may also enter the composition of Kiran Gibbs and Olivia Jill instead of Nacho Morella and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and to give a small preview of the games that it needs," said Winger.
Although the Arsenal is favorable in the F group, the Maximim Stadium in Zagreb refers to the most encouraging in Europe.
"Dinamo" hasn't lost any of 41 pieces since they've been able to pass the past season as "Unbelievable".
On Monday, the station was affected by the earthquake of 3,2 balls on the Ritter scale.
It was 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is sure that Arsenal has saved the lessons received in the past session when the team has suffered a shock in the League of Champions from Monaco, and remains a weak hope to bring a club to the end of the Championships.
"It's an incredible driving," said Winger.
Arsenal never did this.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but, on the other hand, I am realized with the article.
We've got an ambition, but we're not dreaming.
FriendsFest: Commodity show that offered us serious lessons of a man’s friendship
The absence of such stories is cut into the eyes, especially if you see how disappointed men have been, now more than ever, while the level of self-assault among young men is at the maximum of 15 years.
In 2013, it became the only major cause of mortality of men between 20 and 45 years in the United Kingdom, and the male is three times more than women.
In trying to deal with the question of the “Campaña against Unfortunate Life”, the Year of Man has announced a year in order to shut up the calls of culture that does not give men to help when they need it.
The friends are in the center of this battle to take the calls.
Recently, over 20,000 students of universities who show the symptoms of depression have found that if the patient had a sufficient number of friends in normal vision, the possibility of elimination is to be taken.
On the other hand, those who are not in depression, the circle of mentally healthy friends two decreases the possibility of mental disorders.
But, of course, that the friend works, first of all, that she is.
When communications are managed by social networks when the style prefers to contain, the rapid response is often more than the content of contact.
Our digital life depends on the need to be strong, loved, and successful, even if the reality has a single reign.
Such supernatural success depends on the fact that psychologists call out external values - money, edges, social status, the purpose of internal values, our internal efforts to personal growth and friendship, which influences our mental health.
And as you recently noticed one billion, a video player, you're not buying more happiness for money.
The dignity of Friends is that they focus on this.
Each person was not determined by his work, but, likely, through the personality that had been demonstrated in society with friends.
Yumor Joey and the permanent Chandler's cousin, the point of viewing a football on a pleasant steel, the slightness of the Russian Rachael -- everything comes from the understanding that men can feel that, even though they are often retained from the full study of their feelings.
As I said, Samarians: "I'm the role of listener for people who feel depressed and socidian, he stresses how even the smallest friendship can benefit. "
Often those men who treat us feel not in the power of talking to friends.
The old teaching "living with this" is strong, as well as the feeling that an open discussion on problems can be accepted as weakness.
Friends one of the shows I'm minding when I try to propose more long-term working mechanisms.
It stressed the few moments of a man’s friendship.
With regard to my task, the bilateral status of telephones helps people at the time of disappointment, and the long-term support is from the nearby family and friends.
So if you visit FriendsFest in Comedy Central in these weekends, where the party has completely restored decorations, why don't you take your friends to drink in Central Perk.
Or better, if you see a single man at Starbucks, you're smiling and say "Prive".
Before not mention the benefits of friendship.
Friends Serial shows the Comdy Central from the beginning and until the end, all 236 series, on the #FriendsFest
De Marie forgets the hole by helping the "PSJ" to roll Malma
Angel de Marie is equal to Blyth Matty and Edison Kabani's murdered stones in the Malmaw gate.
Anhel de Marie, debutiured in Liga Champion, killed a ball that lets the PsJ to make Malma's sunday easier.
This is the match report and the game reaction.
Anhel de Marie and Edinson Kabani did their business when the "Parry San Jarmen" began their game in Liga Champion, with extremely good winning 2:0 against Malmaw at the station of Park de Prens on Monday.
De Marie slaughtered a little less than four minutes after his first game in Liga Champion, as a PSJ player, to bring the Championships to France, but they left a number of opportunities before, finally, increased their advantage when Kavanoi slaughtered in the 61th minute.
With the "Real Madrid" and the "Shatter" girl in the A group, "Pari" had to start a good game against the Sweden Championships because they were not able to qualify triops, but to continue a series of successful games in the last three sessions where they arrived to the four-fillional.
They were shocked, but at the same time it was not the best decision by Loran Blan to read the Zilatan Ibrahimvich in a attack, and then replace it in the field against the team of his family city and club, in which he began his close carriage in 1999.
"It's not easy to win home or guests in Liga Champion, so to win with account 2:0, to bring to the counterparts problems and to play finely in protection, is a good start even if there are other moments that we need to work during the season", said Blan.
It's more promising.
We wanted to win, and we did it, although I regret that we didn't lose one or two more.
Ibrahimvich returned after the trauma in one of the replacement of the Paris team, which brought her no count to 2nd by "Bordo" in the first weekly, but he was on the back of the Di Maria plan for the fourth minute.
The Argentinian attacker noted as a player that could come to a new level in Europe, after he was purchased in the United States, and he proved why he fled from Marco Verratti to protect Malmay and was beautifully completed the attack, sent the shoes of Johana Willand to the next edge of the door.
But if someone waited for a simple and great victory, it was supposed to be shocked.
"Malma" who wins Slattick in the triop to reach this stage, composed of nine world level players at the beginning of the game, five protectors and two opposite defenders in the middle of the field, was a serious opponent.
But except Nicola Judgich, where the shooting shooting passed over the door of Kevin Trapp for the 34th minute, they attacked a little bit.
The " PSJ" was during the time undertaken by non-resultative transferers and weak attacks, especially by Ibrahim, which only in the first half has been able to perform five attempts, and then did not have been able to handle the cows killed by Cabani immediately after the renewing of the game.
Nevertheless, he showed himself much more humble in the precise paths, and it was the pass from Ibrahim, which was sent by De Maria to a shocked shock, which had been inclined to Vienna's midst for 52 minutes.
The second floor was finally missed after the clock mark by Kawani, the slaughter slaughter slaughtered his sixth meat in the season after Ibrahimvich sent a meat sent to the field center from the left band of Maxwell.
This ended any ideas in Malmau about the return to the game, and only overcoming the wheel Wiland with a close distance did not allow David Luis to increase the final account before the replacement of Essequiel Lavezy was not read in the most end of the match.
The Malme trainer, Age Harrede, later acknowledged that PSG was a class above his team, said that the Norwegian was the last game in the Champion League last December.
Since then, we've only played in Swedish liga, but it's not that level.
Qualification is inadequate.
"Pari" sweetheart!
It was a wonderful shop with them.

Economy - Nobel Lawreat: Globalization
Implementation of globalization processes should contribute to a reduction in the world ' s inequality.
The situation seems to be different, the difference in the income of the population in developing economy, instead, grows.
Eric Maskin.
In order to correct this, it is necessary to improve the level of education of low-educated workers, as the primary scientist of the International Analysis Lab and the choice of the NIS, the Nobel Premier for Economy 2007, Mr. Eric Maskin.
In the past twenty-years, the world has survived the unexpected growth of global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become more open.
Globalization Parties have predicted great benefits for the development of the economy.
"And these prognosis have been overcome," said Maskin.
For example, China and India have received a serious growth in the population.
But it is not so happy.
It was expected that globalization would reduce the perception of the " minors" and "minorable" in poor countries, which are expressed in a large inequality of income, and the exact payment of work.
However, this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Maskin in its article “When the global markets have not reduced inequality in the development economy” published in the World Bank Economic Review, which translated and quoted NEE WSE.
Within the economic professor of the Harvard University, Michael Cramer, Eric Maskin, has developed an alternative theory that shows why the difference in income in poor countries in globalization is increased.
The new global market has been specific processes.
To demonstrate them, Maskin sets four levels of qualification of specialists - A and B for the rich countries, C and D - for the poor.
After globalization, D specialists from poor countries have no level of qualification to cooperate with specialists A and B from rich countries.
And if employees in the P level of poor countries have increased their payment through the cooperation with the B staff from the rich, D workers do not feel that their payments are slowly slow.
A comprehensive effect of the internationalization of production will contribute to increased dispersion between two categories of specialists in poor countries and, respectively, increased in the level of inequality.
Cramer and E. Massik proposed a wonderfully beautiful model, an alternative Ricardian theory of comparison benefits.
It explains why globalization has resulted in income in inequalities,” says Foad Alskeres, a ordinary professor conducting the International Analysis Lab and Selection of Decisions, the Director of the NIS Mathematic Department.
And as any powerful theory, I'm sure she's going to lead to an empirical work in this area.
The problem addressed by Eric Maskin is to improve the level of education of low-capacized workers.
However, as the scientist notes, he does not have any means for this, but the companies to pay their training.
In such situations, governments, international agencies, NCOs and private funds may play a significant role as a Maskin.
The scientist notes that the developed theory, in any case, does not call for a stopping globalization process that brings and brings its fruit to the growth of GDP countries.

The United States government in Moscow deeply regrets the decision of the Russian Government to close the United States Office at the All Russian State Library of their M.I.Rudominino in Moscow.

The Green Tribunal was soon on the race.
typical situation: Four officials are standing before the judiciary of the Court of Justice of Kumar, listening to his claim to work.
The court is not satisfied with the quality of your work.
We didn't have given you a 110-strand order to comfort it, says Kumar.
If there's another cyrpikey, we're gonna make up all the buildings.
Kumar is engaged in the National Green Tribunal (NZT) - the judiciary authority established in 2010 to stop the intense pollution of the environment which is providing a burning economic growth in the last decades.
At that time, the Tribunal had been able to consider more than 100,000 areas related to air pollution, the collection of mushrooms, geological developments, toxic waste and the construction of dambs.
In two of the three cases, the court decides to stop the building leading to pollution.
Incredibly high: Over 60 years since the declaring the independence of the violenced industrial development, India has converted from women's jongles to one of the most popular and polluted countries of the world.
In particular, the problem is in major megapolises where the development of infrastructure is not insured for a delicate urbanization: the city's swimming pool, the rivers are filled with pesticides and households and the rest of the living mass are discovered by new housing quarters.
Despite the formal support of the green movement by the State, NZT is regularly criticized by the Government of Narendor Modedi, since it is often the main cause of the cancellation of major investment projects.
Yes, in May of this year, the Minister of Environment called the Court of Extreme and Incomplete.
Sometimes the court decision is really impossible to carry out a deadline in the court, and reaffirms the lawyers on environmental matters by the Council of Panjwani.
However, the unfulfilled departments have a positive party, and at least they put the responsible persons to be slaughtered.
"It's the main goal to overcome this system," adds the lawyer.
The Green Tribunal has already abolished large buildings, as a result of the stopping of the airport, electricity stations and hundreds of smaller equipment.
The people are also trying to not forget: for example, during the discussion of the pharmaceutical company in the State of Telagna, a polluted local fraud river.
We can close your factory, but we answer the economic consequences.
"Their people are losing their work," said Kumar's decision.
However, such explanations do not always have a understanding of simple people who can change their lives through one slaughter.
Similarly, in April, the Tribunal decided to prohibit all vehicles for more than 10 years of entering the capital than the general insurance.
Despite the extreme popularity and criticism, Svataнтер Kumar refused to reject the decision.
Instead, he stated to the Government of the Deli statistics on the incoming and exit car transport, and also proposed to purchase 10 000 additional bus, prematurely recognised the manufactures if they could comply with the same order.
As a matter of attention, the court began to deceive the sources of pollution such as waste, the quality of the fuel and even the road incidents, the public anger began to smile.
But the worst theme of the Principal Court became a programme for the Gang River, with the temporary anonymous Prime Minister of Narendro Modi in the past year.
When it comes to the Gange sacred for the river, the judges are often stopping to keep their emotions and move to cry.
You know what the word "saint"?
Someone slaughtered the water from Gang on the statue of God, and there were facelities in it, and the judge is honoured.
You're continuing to pollute the river because you think, the Gang is, he's gonna take all our sins.
This is the river we worship and see what you're doing with her every day.
The cleaning of Gang is the most ambitious and precious environmental project an anonymous new Government.
Today, the number of factual bacteria in the river exceeds the standard more than 120 times.
A year from 1,5 to 3,7 million of the infections in it have died from infectional diseases.
In February, Narendra Mody had even offered the Gang's Saving Fund for saving money from the sale of his feet, in which he met Barak Obama and 455 other objects from his personal collection.
The ecologs were accused of the polarism: the cost of $7,000 was acquired at the time that the river was cleaned for at least eight billion.
The Green Tribunal members agree that India is going to be a long way before it could be called by a developed country, but they do not think that a valuable progress should be in the environment.
" In the developing country, the discussions on the environment are often understood as an unreasonable wheel, " said the active organization of the Gang Zoe " Malika Bhannot.
The court is trying to find a golden medium between ecoology and development."
