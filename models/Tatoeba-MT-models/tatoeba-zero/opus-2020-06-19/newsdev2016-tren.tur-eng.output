Norwegian Rafishk: Is this the most funny fishing of the world?
Norwegian 5 million people are taking the highest standards of life, not only in Europe, but in the world.
Can the secret of the country's success be linked to the local work system with some slow fishing?
Take a short time-leading choice.
Put them in the midst of a smooth futbol.
Let me leave a week.
Now you have one of the big Norwegian norms to smell your smell.
I'm in the small Fagernes city, about three hours away from Oslo.
There's a chart, a magnificent manner - and this sweet is always in the air.
Rakfisk is slow and water - depending on how smooth fish you love - it is for a year.
When we're dark and frying, the Norwegians will meet here for this most magnificent evening festival.
He said, "Havard Halvarsen, you'll be blowing this flower, and then a barbecue."
People around us eat small fish cups and smell in a lot of drinks.
Havard says, "Those people love aquavit more than Rafisk."
He can kill the smell.
I'm calling a few parts.
If you can evacuate from the ground, it's not bad -- it's unlikely from a swimming language after a long bus journey.
Rakfisk Norwegian is a very different type of time in the sunnings of water and swimming water in the beaches that the fishes are unexpected.
Then when they are firmed in the depths, they will be able to get out and – the sounds that are deceived with an uncertain alcohol – are new.
Only thousands of Norwegians were difficult to leave countries, mostly flee to the United States.
Now it is expansive to the population - more than 13 jobs, high-paids, and immigrants from a powerful view system.
Ancient and very recently people are in the work of Swedish, more richer than Norwegian.
Rakfisk represents something important, and if Norwegian past is a little funny, it's a part of life.
It's between the most precious foods you can get.
But everything's precious -- you're gonna give a small barb or a sandwich 9 kg ($14).
Norwegia hasn't always come to world news, and most people like that.
We are requesting people here to be discussed in the name of Anders Brevik, a crudely healthy racial racist who killed men, women and children in the past 77 years.
Instead, it's called "the event of 22 July."
Norwegians are difficult to believe that one of them can make such a punishment and murder in peace.
Norwegians today have grown from the beginning of the 1970s by one of the largest oil and gas industries of the world.
Our garson says, "But it is not the only reason why we're so good."
We are a great people, as you say.
English, most people here are perfect.
We're not too exhibitors, we're not liked to be a chatafat.
In addition to a small percentage of the money from the industry, the Norwegian oil was very carefully managed — all of them have a special background to the benefit of the future items.
In the years of the world's global crisis, everyone else had a lot of money.
"We're happy as long as we're going out of the light and can't do the mountain."
"And raphisk eat," he swears with a calm.
I'm standing in my leg, and I'm waiting for something to eat - I'm going to eat enough.
Now, a hamburger is certainly a different thing and a more weird shoe.
But night there's more sweet fish than that sweet fish.
One of the county mechanisms that arrange the rafish night bed, here are the best ladies -- and maybe the most hardest of this is -- they're playing the fish.
There's a living television connection on a server with the Rakfisk tables.
This is like an Eurovision song.
How many points do you have for the best fish on the mountains?
"We're here, Havard."
Shalls, they've got cakes.
A man slows from the sandalist, maybe in the effect of aquavit.
Or maybe you're ridiculous of all these fishes.
The Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto faces the start of difficulty
When the new President of Mexico is ready to pass through the Enrique Pena Nieto office, it looks at the difficulties that Will Grant faced with the BBC, and the people's disagreement expectations.
It's particularly bad now in Mexico's traffic.
In the best times of a cities, a variety of major routes from Tuesday, a variety of people have been discovered in the streets of caos.
But the purpose was not to prevent people to go to work, but to prevent the reach of protesters.
On Saturday, the new President of Mexico will take the President of the President of Enrique Pena Nieto and take the task of the government of the country.
He's against a bad mission.
In the rule of Felipe Calderon, he had a good manner from Mexico's economic opening, but in six years, the control of a drug war raised to 60,000 deaths.
Mr. Pena Nono said this week, Oval Office of the United States President Barack Obama, "The Mexican people have a great word to reduce the violence of my government."
That's why I'll offer a new security strategy to help us reach.
Before the U.S. President, Mr. Pena Nono's political trial was held in the Mexican room before I was deputed.
The first group of people who are around this area, which grows, are divided into the opinions of the new leaders in the old.
He's a clear man.
For example, the Red Valle del Bravo remembers lovely in the town of Bravo.
There are people who know that he lived in a place where he lived and created my tube.
You can go from the new cars of Mr. Pena Nono to reach the city, a great development on a changed shock and all-speaked ways.
In addition, the platelets transferred from the modern sports center and the influence of the climate changes in the museum.
"We're looking at him to bring the real and permanent change," says Mr. Pena Nono's friend and political council member of the PRI party Gabriel Olvera Hernandez.
In particular, we hope that we need a very interesting and real change from our country from security and economy.
After 81 years of decline, Vicente Fox was deleted in PRI 2000.
The Congress member Olvera admits that it was very waiting for Enrique Pena Nieto for 12 years outside the Chamber of Los Pinos.
And the government rejects the new president of his own identity.
A clear man calls himself with a wonderful country vision.
It's a wonderful state man and a man who knows listening to all.
But this is not the idea that many people have about the former elections.
It was not more focused on the park streets of Valle del Bravo in Nezahualcoyotl, known as Nezahualcoyotl.
A banking area of Mexico City on the top of their cars.
And the problems in the pool are hard and urban.
This year, we were invited to help combat drugs in the armed villages, especially with violence against women.
In the two years we've been killed by a large staircase area, several of the women's body was taken.
While Mr. Pena Nono was judged, more than 1.000 women were killed in Mexico, and more than the city of Ciudad Juarez, who is known with the murders of popular women.
He said that the murderer couldn't be so able to handle the problem even when he's in the best position of Mr. Pena Nono.
The worst thing, they're accused of coming from seeing his rule.
In a typical beton house in the coast, Irina Buendia's girl's photos of Mariana Luna are trying to fight with the age of age when she showed me the pictures of Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana murdered in 2010.
But he believes his family was killed by a partner.
"When I went home, it was like the body was burned." Senora Buendia.
There was a shock showing that he was struck, and the death's smuggling began from a long time.
Once her mother tells his story again, she looks down from a picture wall of Mariana, with one word found on a word: Justice.
But that's what he said that the family was slaughtered.
The local authorities treated me as an older dictator, a problem, a murderer.
Whatever they want is to accept and closure the people's words.
"But it doesn't be true when there's so strict and illness."
The President of the Pena Noto is taking the bird on Saturday.
For the six years we past, ten thousands of families affected violent crimes in Mexico and promised to give them priority during the new President.
The first Congress member, Olvera, says, "I hope it's a president in Valle del Bravo."
But this is the most afraid of the victims in the city of Neza.
They claimed that Bradley Manning wasn't condemned to act badly.
Defenders are trying to turn to the ideas of using Bradley Manning's bad use.
Stop, Manning's staying in the prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The Defense Manning wants to close the case with the need to be imprisoned.
There are thousands of secret documents in the army.
The Defenders tried to point out that the United States's armed Army, who was accused of the biggest secret material injuries, had a chance to condemn some of the bad acts in the army of Bradley Manning.
Ft. Meade Maryland's talk in the cell, Master Ashden Fein Manning, showed that, while the officers remained in Quantico, Virginia, and the weekly visits weren't aware of the bad treatment of the records of their visits.
Once a day later, he explained the murder of Manning's case to end up the case, with the need that he had taken sufficient punishment in Celse.
The army arrested in Haziran in 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents in Iraq when he worked as a mission.
The material was later published by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never proved that Manning's information source.
In the afternoon, Fein studied the forms of the offices filled with Manning after the meeting with Maning since October 2010 to Nisan 2011, when he held an increased prison penalty.
The officers told Manning questions and reported their answers.
When he asked about the forms on the Fein Saturday, Manning reported that the acts made by the Gardens were "meaning" and all the testing acts were "so much professional."
The forms don't show the skill of conducting bad, but if they ask the officers about the treatment of Manning right, Fein.
Manning gave the answer to the matters that the visitors talked about their concerns and said that they would be ruled up.
He said: "If you don't come to mean that you have not brought anything to you."
He asked why the Court of Justice Denise Lind de Manning was not endorsing the ideas of murdering during the October 2011 meeting.
He answered that the terms of the Manning Meeting were "the prevention of the shift" would be discarded.
The army told him to protect him and others, that the murderer observer had put him into a stage of sixth stage.
"I wanted something to know what I was, and I wanted to get out of the state of the POI... to remove a quality of life from my view, "Manger said.
Manning Persimm was arrested in Iraq and expressed the transfer to Kuveyt, which was arrested for about two months before he was transferred to the Marine Base of Quantico in Virginia in June 2010.
He said he was thinking of the murderer at Kuveyt and heat, once he liked there.
He said he wouldn't let him know what's going on in the outside world.
"My dog was thrown into the camp Arafjon," said Manning Pershore.
I thought I would die the coffee.
Manning said, when he went to Quantico, most of the days, at least 21 hours and more than 23 hours, had a small cell alone.
Manning said only a bed, a bathroom, a leg, a little clothes and his eyes were given.
He said he was trying to smell in the day, and he was struggling in the rules.
Manning always said he was sleeping light out of the cell.
When the guards returned the night, he said he wouldn't see his face, and he was shocked and returned.
The lawyer of Manning was officially engaged in the acts made to Manning in October 2011.
Manning Nisan, 2011, moved to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas military prison.
At the same time, the judge Manning asked a statement on the Persian Day, which was difficult to sleep a night in Quantico, a number of guards in a morning, and the other prisons were difficult to stop shooting in a slaughter.
At my number, Manning explained that he wasn't given a chance of quartering.
On the next day, the judge asked that Manning's office had to get out of the order of the Maning garden, but no one would have ordered to shoot him.
Manning's day, he explained that it was hard to sleep a night ago to show that it was not a danger for her.
Manning told him that he could harm himself by using the smuggling smuggle or legs.
Manning explained that night the drinking snake, the fingers and the eyes were taken from the cell.
The lawyers hope that, at least, the case of the judiciary will decrease the tests of prison and that the military court expected to be executed in the beginning of the next year would be decreased.
She said that the Defence Manning plans to accept the crime in smaller crimes and fight against a lot of painful crimes.
The detention was planned to continue in the end of this week, and the defenders are waiting to discuss the matter that the situation is guaranteed.
Pentagon Manning indicated that all the maximum rules on the courts in Quantico were appropriate.
Those who are opposed to Manning, helping the enemy, publishing the public in a wrong way on the Internet, communicating national defence information, and you're inadequate or registered.
If it's a government of all the possessions, it's possible to be in prison.
Mexico's identification crisis
Many people say it's difficult to get away from Mexico because of the possibility of this place.
The Mexicans are on the shift of the disappearing; they remember difficult times to the Mexicoans,
Navarrette says that the Mexican Americans have been shocked between two worlds.
I was in the area of migration in a nearby street I made to Mexico City, and I was back to the surprise.
The workshops shown two terms: one of the "Mexicans" for the Mexicans, the other "Extranjeros" for the Germans.
I stopped there a few seconds, I didn't know where I'm going.
I was called "Myxical" for all my life because I was grown in the center of California.
This is the same way my friends in Boston say they're "Irlands" or my friends in New York say they're "Itlanian."
Then I decided in Mexico.
But, this was Mexico.
And my grandfather did not need a stenoa or a stereo.
I was a fundamental American.
I'm talking in Spanish, so I'm good to manage both sides of this language.
But I don't have local words, and I can't be able to save from my American mind.
That's why I got my US passport and I passed out for Extranjeros.
I thought that this week, when the election President of Mexico was visiting the White House to meet Enrique Pena Nono President Obama.
Like two leaders in two countries in the day, they have always been meeting: wealth, drugs, and trade.
Pena Obo and Mexico were encouraging to talk about the growth of Mexico's economics, which would also be reasonable to remain in Mexico as soon as they were trying to enter the United States.
The United States and Canada wants to build a trade flower in North America.
Pena Nono hasn't suggested anything specific, but he promised that Mexico's drug cards would continue to fight.
The United States' relations with Mexico is complicated and inconsistent.
Most Americans probably had never thought that in 1848, the United States did not work Mexico and their leaders were hard to give half of the land.
But not in minutes, but in some centuries, the Mexicans are all the place.
So, when something is a little attractive about a US authority in Mexico, you're starting to hear the expertise of the American neighbourhood between the Mexican press and the elites between the United States.
And Montezum's kids go to the war.
And yet, it is a really difficult relationship for Mexico in the United States with more than 35 million mexican Americans.
Do you want to talk about the emotions that are innocent?
There's a lot.
Those who win and loss in Mexico have people who have created the opportunity of the country and not created them.
Many of the people in Mexico have to live in towns like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, are the only reason why a person in a shooting tree is to stay out of the possibility in Mexico.
And mostly this person is sleeping a profile -- ten, less educational, a poor village.
We are their seeds, and We have rewarded them.
It's not Mexico.
And now, if we live in the American Reign, we never can escape the truth that we lived in the good schools and that we've been finding good work, not Mexico.
Our identity may sometimes be undefined, but our loyalty is clear.
It's the United States.
We also realize that most of the mexicans in the ruling class haven't loved us.
This feeling is coherent.
They're seeing us as a reminder of a sweet newness, and they're looking at us like we're a high group not enough in Mexico.
Our Spanishs will never be enough enough, our bonds and Mexico are never too strong.
Our existence is about the complete failure in their eyes.
Our family wouldn't have gone if they couldn't have done in Mexico.
And now we didn't find ourselves up behind the loss, but we could live well in the United States but yet lost spirits.
When a child in Guadalajara was a legal wife to the United States, they remembered that they were more common to me who they were the Mexicans, and that the Mexican Americans have taken this because they did not agree between the Mexican and the Mexican Americans.
Despite being an US citizen, he seems to be a part of two countries.
At the same time, most of the Mexican Americans are not feeling like the part of them.
We love the Mexican group of Los Tigres del Nord and to listen to Bruce Springsteen.
You're taking the best ones of the two worlds, but you're not in anybody.
We look like American in Mexico.
We are accepted as Mexican in the United States.
Now, as I learned at the road, some mexican leaders and some of your audiences want to connect again with Diaspora.
They want mexican Americans to show their interests in the United States as a temporary Mexico 'auditors'.
We're hard to say that it's a beautiful country to visit Americans like us, and the political leaders are to strengthen their links with Mexico.
Yeah.
It's not gonna be.
There's too many feelings of feeling.
And most of us are not sure that this is a wonderful country with equality and respect and drug violence.
I'm afraid you're alone.
It's just.
At least some Mexican people have yet been ready to forgive the United States for a half-century centuries ago for the behavior of Mexico, then some mexican Americans should still be acknowledged that they are still in a position to do with their family members.
Hmm.
Maybe it's more than I think, "We're a Mexican."
Ancient wars, New Eastern
It may be an unfair basis for the peace of the fire between Israel and Hamas.
Can an permanent peace between the Arabs and the Jews in the Middle East?
Another blood tank shows that such hope is empty.
Among the huge discussions of whom was started, many buildings turned into a county, more than 140 Philistine and six Israelites to be civilians, and the first time of Gaze, the great city of Israel, Tel Aviv, and the city of St.
However, if the Israelites and the Philippines seemed to have been struck in ancient battles, they change the Middle East around them.
The Arab garden was cut into air, and it was arrested by the Philippines and the Israelites.
Maybe this makes their fight more blood than the older.
But there are reasons for thinking that they couldn't get out of their killer.
Whatever the wins is a lost war
It seems hard to get out of right now in the first view.
Even if the fires accepted on November 21 continued, this week's war forced them both sides of the war.
Since 2007, the Islamic movement leaders of Hamas have been able to retrace the Israelites, although Gazze has been overcome.
They couldn't destroy Israel Hamas, despite killing some of Gazzeh's leaders and 1,7 million people in one of the world's most chariots and people.
Of course, the other part of Hamas Filists now managed by the biggest Philippines in Fatah in Western Sheriff wins the more medium crowd of the Philippines.
Moreover, Hamas's leaders can also take out the results of the time.
And when the Islami wins the world of the Arabs, Hamas was strong and rich.
That's the purpose of Turkey Hamas, which was resurrected by the most closest Muslims of Israel, as well as Katar, one of the most rich and most dynamic areas of the Côte d'Israq.
The joyful Hamas people say that a Islamic conspiration around Israel, Hizbullah military party toward the northern Lebnan, the Islamic slaughter, who was able to send the Fifth Esad to Syria, and that Hamas was threatened to the king of Hamas.
Over all, it changed the lowest level of the region of the Muslim brothers in Egypt, open between the Arab countries in the southern blood of Israel.
It was a few time for the Mubark Mubark's Hamas, who had been ruling in Egypt for 30 years until the hunger in 2011.
On the other hand, the cousins and leaders of the brother Hamas are more about the sight.
In the future diplomacy, Hamas, Israel and America can be defined as an actor that is not possible.
At that time, Israel's guards will get completely high results.
The soldier was put back to the Hamas box.
Israel's Demir Kubbe has proved the value of the anti-food system and most of Hamas was destroyed.
The Israelites will sleep for a while.
Diplomatically, as far as the United States did, most European countries condemned Hamas about starting their last violence.
Besides all, Israel, in particular the chief of Binyamin Netanyahu, who has not seen the peace process.
Although the rocks from Gazze since 2004 have killed about 30 Israelites, Israel was reduced from a large number of murderers in Western Sheriffs, which continued to expand the Jewish places that protect their protected places from the Philippines.
When the Likud party goes on October 22, Mr. Netanyahu, who joined Abigdor loverman with the more war group.
Why are these liar Philistines being shocked by giving their own states?
If they really control the Western Sheriff, they're not gonna shoot rocks as they do in Gazze?
It's better to be punished when we stood them behind the wall, and to punish them.
Maybe the guards win, but they can change the Arab garden accounts.
If the Islami wins power in Egypt and other places are very less loved by Israel, the priorities in their homes will be fighting.
Israel's defence race is larger than the assembly of the Arab neighbors.
The starting war with the local super power does not help the new Arab governments to correct the economy.
Mr. Musi worked together with Barack Obama, and may be able to start something.
The Israelites have to look for a long time.
While the rest of the Arab world is more democratic, the fact that the Philippines are slaughtering from the rights of disrespect, this week, like a bus in Tel Aviv, is an unexpected shooting fleet in the areas under the workplace of Israel.
The pressure in the Jewish government is already cutting democracy and the Arab people grows democracy.
Every few years, the blood missions against Gazze will be reached by a diplomatic pledge that grows against Gazze.
We need an external enthusiasm on both sides.
The answers of the two sides have been announced as most of the outdoor world and those who are in this newspaper: two governments represented the area for the security of Israel.
In short, you're going to give a little more pressure to foreigners who are difficult.
Now, the Jewish government, who has to begin to stop the weapons of Gazze, is better to convince the land change of the idea and accept the Middle Flood with the Egyptian, Turkey and Katar, in 1967.
Foreign Arabs should be hard to join Hamas and Fatah.
It's more useful to make a Philippines's approach to the BM's vocational government.
Mr. Obama plays a role in bringing Israel to the table.
At the first time, he was surprised to offer his peace plan.
It looks like he wants to get into the White House.
This pain doesn't see a real progress.
There's life-free exit in a Middle East America.
This means a peace agreement between Israel and the Philippines.
Sagara packing laws are in Australia.
Tuberculosis warnings and sick organs are placed in salt green boxes for all roof marks
Australia's first laws on smoking and smoking in the world have entered into the shooting, marking logos and colors, generally green swallowing, producing images and sigarettes of sick organs, and children who have been sick and swallowed.
The only difference between the packages, as well as various health warnings and visuals, is the same small type of mark names.
It's the biggest place for the packing of the smoke in this world.
Australia's federal government says he's stopping to drink cigarettes from shocking young people.
This is based on research that shows that people are never starting to smoking up to 26 years of age 99%.
"You can see that, even when a small age is likely, children are trying to sell the smooth company on the markets," the example of the child's work that shows that the skin logism of the age is inclined to make it swallow, Tanya Plibersek, the federal health observer.
Although Australia has one of the lower rates of smoking in the world and changes will have a very less effect on the women of many peoples, other countries think that they are similar to their steps.
They made a hard lobby against the laws of the twin industry.
He told the firms that they would support the chest trade, and that they would be more clean and more accessable to cigarettes.
From British American Tobacco Australia, Scott McIntyre said, "The results that are not seriously imprisoned to shut up."
China and Endonesia will bring more of these products to sell in Australia streets.
Others say that the laws are increased.
A small family company, Zico Import Pty Ltd, has led two months ago the silicon swords to mask cards from Sandra Ha from Sandra Ha, and the Empire Tobacco in England, Philip Morris, and Japan, almost slowly lost the laws in the high court of the laws.
Zico says he's doing more than 6,000 sales and waiting for a new stood.
That's a good job for us.
The forests say that the social media is popular in the demographic that the potential struggle plan aims.
A decimal of Australia’s blood was denied by television advertising and sport sponsors, and the majority of soldiers wanted to hide the cigarettes from the places.
Australia was prohibited local companies and websites' advertising, but it couldn't be able to slow the sea sites.
Becky Freeman, the researcher of a people's health research at Sydney University, said, "If you are on the price of the food, and if you have left this small window only to identify your products, you're a circumvent where you need to join the pool."
Freeman's markets indicated that it increases the study of "medium-human" on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
Do you have to ask this Marlboro's civil citizen who really loved the smokes and videos, or have a marketing company in this?
The British American Tobacco Australian industry said that it was inclined to take up new rules without marketing.
Indeed, in the world's Ticaret Organization, none of the countries have been struggled in an unjust way, although it was not an important amount of trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is likely to get out in the midst of 2013.
If we've been, the government said he did not meet other countries who think that they would like to pack it.
The first country in 2001 was Canada, which makes photo warnings difficult.
Now these have been cut into Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine for more than 40 countries.
England, New Zealand, South Africa and India are thinking of laws in Northern.
The majority of the sigarettes in Australia read from the shock.
Images don't affect me.
I'm coming to see them.
When he buys a package with all his legs, he said, "Please it and put it in place."
If you have to be honest, there's only one reason to leave, that's my little girl.
Sydney's center told James Yu that the king's shipping packaging was hard to shoot the packaging.
Yu said, "I've taken my delivery a hour from the time, now takes four hours."
"I should have been lawful for all things, then, well, we're done, we're gonna shut up the shops," he said, "and we've got the hands out of the air.
How bad is to be shocked in a world that is always fascinated
When we lived mechanical difficulties in this Thanksgiving Day, and we haven't been waiting for five hours when we had to wait for another flight.
That's how I've been thinking about a disappointment.
I won't lie to you.
Even if we're waiting for an aircraft half-day, it's very sweet, books, magazines, and iPhones. (I'm not even talking about sales.)
But in some way, those who are not academics and children's development experts are exciting.
They're telling us and our children, sometimes, that's normal.
The brain is hard to go to interesting tanks, and may have increased creativeness.
And most of us can't imagine the values that we're dealing with other than one screen.
So we need to open warm open to slowness?
Yeah.
And no.
But I'm going back to it.
First of all, I was thinking that it's a new chair, because it's a more empty time like a lot of people.
It is not Peter Toohey, who wrote the Greek and Roman History at Calgary University in Canada.
"You have a very long history of smiling," he said.
There's a Latin wall writing from the first century of Pompeii's walls.
Then it comes to the question how you're determined to disappoint.
The problem is that it was differently identified and discussed, John D. Eastwood, a psychologist at the University of New York in Canada.
After he looked at the research literature and put about 100 individual groups in the front, Profesor Eastwood and the colleagues were identified as a "no one to slow up, but not to be acknowledged."
He said, "The thing that divides from the poorness is that the person wouldn't be engaged."
He said, "There's no way to do anything in the malnutrition."
He said, "It's an interesting process with the feeling of slow-mode and time slow."
It's like a depression.
But Professor Eastwood, which may be, but often people see the problem in the environment or in the world, said people in depression would see the problems of themselves.
Sometimes we think we're just trying to be a concentration.
Profesor Eastwood and his associators, published in Psychologic Science Reviews on September, marked an old experiment of a person who read a magazine of a person reading a article on the work of the participants.
Some groups heard a high-level and non-related television program in the room, and others heard it very lowly, but the third group had never heard it.
Those who heard low-level television reported more harder than two other groups, they had suffered difficulty at the concentration, but they were not sure why they were not sure and had related to the difficulty.
One of the employees and one of the nervouss at the Guelph University of Ontario said, Mark J. Fenske, who tries to engage in a hard or intriguing task, is why it would be difficult to defeat the interest.
When you read something hard from the other side, "It can help you not cut your attention from the department music as to look at the bad band of one manufacturer."
In fact, it is possible to make people more physically struggle as a sign of distress, which is generally a sign of distress.
"There's showing it learning more than the children who have allowed to be moved, and have more information on them," said Professor Fenske.
We all imagine the difficulty in some points, the late of the flight, the monotone speaker, a hard film.
But some are in a more shock than others.
In 1980, researchers developed a "Death of Degradation".
It's like, "The majority of the things I need to do, and monoton, and I have a lot of interest in, I don't have to do anything."
Stephen Vodanovich, professor at the University of West Florida, said that researchers have found that I need more and more expensively for the needs of external sustainability of men, particularly for the girls.
However, mostly, it is a very poor group in the bowl of pregnancy.
In 1991, Professor Reed Larson, who had been a trial to communicate at the Illinois University of Human and Social Development, with nearly 400 boys and grandparents through the computer, through seventy eight times a day.
32 percent of men found that they were slow in schools and payments, but 23 percent were not in school.
From the other side, they told the parents that 3 percent of them were slow.
Professor Larson said that 21 years later, he didn't know that the percentage of slowers would be lower.
But he said he knew that he wasn't able to control the things they want to do with the boys.
That's why I'm back to my first question, is it good for people who are sweet?
Sometimes no, because the research shows that in a way of decreasing people can be able to cut their hair risks, to play skin or material uses.
On the other hand, Professor Vodanovich, who works more than two decades, discusses the connection between philosophs and writers.
Gary Marcus, a psychologue professor in the U.S., said, "It's the way to tell you that your brain should do something else."
But the brain doesn't know what's going on to do.
If you're disappointed, and if you're using this energy to steal and eat, it'll be happy.
But if you look at television, it can be happy in a short-term, but it's not in a long way.
That's why if your child's disappointed, you couldn't get him a iPad, but you don't know how to enjoy or do it, Prof. Fenske said.
And he said, "This will be transferred to the other."
Your kid doesn't know how to enjoy yourself, and in other areas it's more to control himself.
I don't think we'd really like to be happy.
We shouldn't have been too busy.
Instead, our goal should be constantly disappointed from stealing the shoe of ability and technologies.
Professor Eastwood was killed.
"We need to be more slower, but we want to be linked to an uncomfortable, painful thing," he said.
And he said, "It is a way that people have been looking for, and that they may take away the time of a empty.
He said, "It is hard to find the ways that you can be swallowed when we have been shut down in a circle."
No Senaryo for the New Marihuana Act in Colorado
Anthony Orozco, 19th, opposed to an university of a region in Colorado, the student and the football player nearly in the area of a lawful case: to move a few parts of marihuana and to drink it.
One day in September, Mr. Orozco said he and his friends were stopped at Lamar, near the Kansas border.
After the police's car found marihuana in the police, Mr. Orozco took a call for a copy of $100 small crimes, movement and drug tools, and he was given the date of the court.
"We were treated as a criminal," said Mr. Orozco.
But is that one?
In the uncertain weeks of the fact that Colorado's pleasant use of the small number of marihuans in law depends on the question of hundreds of small drug cases.
Hundred hundreds of criminal marihuana cases are closed here, and they're already closed in Washington, who accepts a similar event.
Police units were 21 years old and adults in the past weeks, and the laws were left to be sentenced to move a small amount to be accepted by law.
However, in Colorado, the defenders pleaded to carry out the cases of marihuana, and still called for the reason to move people.
At the same time, a number of new towns from Denver from the Western mountains are used to prevent the opening of marihuana’s license in the regions of the marihuana license.
The police chief Daniel J. Oates said, "I don't know what's going on, then, what's going on."
The editors in Washington, and they're cutting their heads.
And they're looking for the last manufacture, the imagination, the distribution, and a license system for sales.
It's like, or first, that's what Colorado says that it's mostly in front of marihuana arranging marihuana in the goal of funding.
Brian E. Smith, Washington House of Control, said, "They have a more regular price, so they'll be a better guide."
But Mr. Smith continued to do more than suggesting what's going on.
And he said, "No real example we will be given."
Washington's law, which is named I-502, will enter into the historic of 6th, and there's not yet a local license system, but a certain year of unlawfulness to be carried out.
There are difficult mechanical questions that must be solved in this time, such as the license of schools, feet parks, children's parks, or child care centres in the 1,000 feet press of the census, with the licensed marihuana directive "eternal access".
The Legal Kenevir Centre, the new research group, said, "It will not be harder than the towns of the large cities, especially Seattle's large cities."
On November 21, a e-mail sent to the chief Oates officers of Aurora, who was 21-year-old of the lawyer of the city, and who wouldn't open anybody to the small marihuana offences, and the police would leave the crimes to the police.
He said that the head of the Oates police would set up the cities laws, and he would follow the drug trade and sellers again.
Ken Buck represents a larger view in the northern Colorado area.
After playing, he said that the office would continue to observe the cases of movement to marijuana as a way to difficulty with most users.
Now, when 119 persons are sentenced to move two of us or less marihuana, many against other crimes.
Mr. Buck said, "The case of crimes in the time of our office is difficult."
Even in locations like the Red Mesa area that the players rejected the marijuana.
The biggest city in Grand Junction is no longer a case for adults.
He supported the decision by the head of the region, Pete Purzinger, but decided not to close the cases of movement at the same time.
"I don't think I'm going to get my time away until I continue to apply the law until you change."
If 55 percent of the players in Colorado supported each other, it would never be easy to rule the goal and bring them into the legal system.
And, in the area, respecting discussions, the local authorities have a deep range of green experiments.
Marihuana's advocate and marihuana laws represented the local word of the National Organization, Sean McAlister, who is "a cultural barrier."
He said, "They have passed a lot of things in the case of people, so they do not yet accept that this is legal."
As a small number, they are prepared to be national test cases for the legalization of the Colorado and Washington drugs as the first areas of marihuana to be treated as an alcohol.
The lawyers and governments are expected to direct the federal government, planning to approach their sales and production as federal crimes at the same time, while new border plans for legal sales.
The lawful marihuana lawyers hoped that the Court of Justice will be retraced.
Despite the arrest of high profiles of Tbbi marihuana diseases and sellers, the federal government, Colorado, Washington and the other 16 sections, allowed most of them to operate in twelve marihuana.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy adviser in the Obama government, said that the doors would probably be shocked to shoot a small drug torch, but it is likely to prevent marihuana's discharge that was allowed by new laws.
It doesn't expect a few federal authorities in Colorado to move.
Even before the election of the day, he accepted the debt of new marihuana, a year ago, to open some local governments.
Last week, Montrose city brought a six-month law in West, and it's likely to be accepted in the next week.
Bob Nicholson, the Congress member of the city, said, "We don't want to be licensed for a large federal problem."
Our area has used a play against changes.
We're looking at the area that it's against the movement.
There's a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: I was defeated from Oxford
It's just that the students today aren't attacking because of their views.
I can't remember when I didn't imagine to win a place at the Oxford University.
In my mind, my father and my large brother, the modern wine red, in Greek sempozium, found two pillars of freedom and tolerance that encouraged the world's best learning place.
But in the last few weeks, I collected my pieces in Worcester College, and I started the first scenario of my life.
My dad was smiling and smiling.
The friends returned to the wonder.
Evening Standard Day at my room, my license friends were going out because I was going to get out of my license.
The writer A N Wilson had heard that I was left because I'd be able to drink out of a deceased finger.
The reality was less funny.
I'm gone.
Yeah, I'm gone, because I've been against the systemic sake and fear.
It's not because I come from a little strange name or from a private school.
Only one reason I was judged, and in the fifth part of this word, it was back and barbaric: my father, mehum Woodrow Wyatt, Margaret Thatcher's high profile discussion, and I supported the Protestants.
You can ask why I opened this.

It's all doubtful because he's guarded.
It's enough bad for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be worse for you.
The majority of the first class students acts as a plot of work party.
Then, in a local bar, I tried to do a horrible track.
I told Mrs. Thatcher didn't join anything.
This tactic failure proved.
Ironicly, the first student of PPE, who was in Eton, said, "You're the daughter of a fasist dog,"
You're discovered.
Other students guarded themselves.
I was disappointed, I was crazy.
Someone asked, "How do you have sex?"

Whoever makes a moon
I'll try to make the solution or concern of the problems you have faced in such work and social security in your valuable governments, and to spend my experiences for you.
You're talking about hundreds of news in the field of social security and work.
I'll tell you the best, healthy and confidential news in the Governing Journal and in the fairness.com.tr.
First of all, I want to get the file of a piece that brings a lot of voice in the kitchen.
We'll take these letters in our sections.
In our writing, you can answer all the questions about responsibilities.
You can't find your answer, and you can send your questions that are specially interested in you from subsequence.com.tr to your address.
I'm going to be in the spirit to answer you in the shortest time.
What's malumenity?
The SSK, who has lost at least 60 per cent of the uncertain age of MALULEN, and who is not able to live in the SGK in order to store their safeguard conditions in the law of the SGK, is a hope that they can be able to resolve their recognition.
They can also be able to lose the power of assembly in situations where they are lost.
Who's going to say it's wrong?
I'm writing from the pool, my name is Mehmet Gultekin, and I have my insurance for 920 days, and I have 1460 days with military debt.
In addition, I'm a sick sick.
I'm connecting to our language machine.
I'm still working at a job.
Can I take a month?
- You're in front of the board.
You haven't shown when you've been working first on your problem.
However, let's just tell you how the currency is connected to you.
Firstly, the most important conditions specified in the law must be insured since 10 years and the primary primary day of 1800.
In addition, if you have been identified that you lost at least 60 percent of your work force or your job accident or the result of the disease.
But you can't connect monthly because you're here with dialytic diseases, you don't have a 60% conditions for your 1800 primary day.
Of course, we don't know how many years you've been working.
Your 10 years and the day you completed together in the 1800 will be connected to you in a month when you're making a disappearing of your work.
The ways of gaining the right to the month of democracy
Does nobody bear anywhere without 1800 days?
- 1800 days of primary payment must be completed.
However, there is one instance, and it is connected to a monthly recording of other cases in the case of those who are able to have a continuous consideration of others.
What illness or distress will be made in the sections of our writings to continue to take on the attention of those who have a problem.
The situation of those who are impaired before starting
I'm Ahmet Guller.
While I've moved all the paths in the SGK law, they said you can't take a month before I was sick.
I'm so busy.
Isn't it wrong?
How do I do?
- Ahmet Bey, you've written all the cases in the Law but one of the main courses, and the SSK and the Insurance Corporates who are in the law must not be engaged in the work before they lost work.
It cannot be connected to the month because you don't move this price.
However, if you move the conditions of reliability with age insurance.
I have 3980 days, I'm insured for 16 years.
The SGK has been identified by the SGK that was before my department entered.
They said you couldn't be able to do me.
What I'm going to do in this case.
I'm not going to do it.
Can you show the way?
- Yes, you've heard it.
You can't be smuggling.
However, according to the SGK law, there's also a cost-related cost.
So there are two situations before October 2008 and later.
If you started working before this history, you can take a month of age at least 15 years of safeguard period and at least 3600 days of primary time.
Therefore, we suggest you to find a request for a monthly connecting with the most closest SGK department.
Well, if you were working after October 2008, then you could have been safe for at least ten years, and at least 3960 days of age, age and death insurance, you could have been announced first.
Do you need to get out of work when you start?
I'm still working as a shooter in a job.
When I went to the hospital, he took me a cancer.
I want to be smooth.
I need to leave the job in this case?
Can't I get out of a month before it wasn't possible?
I don't want to stay unclean until the month.
- You were right.
You need to have a job away to give you a monthly connection.
But before the month, you have to be able to deal with your SGK law.
But if you're understood, it's connecting you with other conditions.
You don't mean to connect monthly, you have a risk of staying unfaithful.
It's enough for 1800 days.
When you're going to SGK, you'll be able to report my office. SGK's gonna love you with one of the hospitals.
And when you bring your health system report to SGK, the SGK will be evaluated in your own health system and your health disease will be a reason why you have to get your work force loss on 60 percent of the monthly association.
However, since you have to fill the 10-year insurance period to connect your month, it will be possible to connect you to you.
So soon, we can say that the insurances who worked in the SGK are not intelligent to make the decision before seeing the decision "less you have."
But if the insurers work any job carry all the conditions, the SGK and the state of the state can also want to detect and connect the month.
This is the case if the smell is swallowing and other conditions may be worth for the start of a month.
Should the link-Kur's responsibilities be cut off?
I'm Connect-Kur's security.
I'm stoneing all the conditions.
But they said you shouldn't be able to make it worthy because it's a duty.
What should I do.
- I'll read it.
Whoever told you is right.
You didn't write what the other conditions are, but if you think you've moved these conditions, it's difficult to pay your primary duty.
But I can give you a special tea.
I'll suggest you're paying your debt through the banks, or the same institutions.
And if you're connected so early month, you'll pay for a month.
These institutions will be easier to pay you to your debt from your moon.
What stage is connected to the malnutrition month?
I worked as the SSK and the Connect-Kur, and I'm sure you've done.
Where will you connect me from the month when I'm in the moon?
If you work in a lot of stations, you're a month of age, and the last of your security is connected, and you're going to leave your SSK as the last SSK, and you'll get switch from the SSK, and you'll get switch from the SSK.
SGK reports to the hospital
How can the Malithing Review be done?
What hospital's health report?
- You are sufficient to implement the social security officers or social security centres that you are dependent on health reports.
The SGK will love you to the military hospitals associated with the Turk Armed Forces, in addition to university hospitals.
However, in the case of the hospitals that you have dismissed, it can also be aware of the complete encouraged hospitals of the Health Department.
Isn't it possible to be loved to a special hospital?
- It's possible, but there are conditions.
In the former arrangement, only state hospitals are recorded and life can be made to the hospital's love, sleeping hospital, 01.09.2013, with the new rule that will now be agreed with SGK, and the health reports that you have received here will also be made to the special patient who see the treatment of the life of another hospital.
What are the conditions laid down for love?
The SEVK request is sufficient to make it possible for 1800 days to deal with the status of safeguards.
The hospital funds of malnutrition will be paid by SGK.
And 10 years of insurance, SGK is looking at this.
In the situation of the month of malnutrition, if a person is likely to be seen, the insurance period of 10 years before securing the security conditions is only sufficient to 1800 days, in accordance with the report of the Health System.
This is why, when the person comes to the first testing of the department, it's likely to be able to take a smooth, only in 1800 days.

This is a scientific research made by Dennis Kommsa (12)."
In the writing, the person who has a smuggle tells you where, when and how he found it.
In the shooting, it's slow to pay for a shoe and a postal payment.
On August 16, 1963, a historic swimming swimming pool was given to the past days, situated nearly 35 kilometers away from New Jersey.
Comsa, who was 12 years old in 1963, said that she was surprised to see the shoes he shocked on the ocean, "I thought they would find it, but I didn't know that the shoes would come back to me."
The sound frequencies love
I was surprised to tell Turkey's first technicians what can be done with the South Pamir sound frequencies.
As sound technologies or sound technologies, the sound systems of everyone's mind are almost in the mind of music.
So you know that you can prevent the terrorism with the voice of sound technology, that you can work perfectly with the sound frequencies, that you want to love the person who you want to love, that you can confess a secret or that you can enable the rituality of the world?
After finishing the Mimar Division of the South Pamir, he took a sound engineering diplomate from the SAE college in England, and made it master on sound technology at the University of Middlesex.
The slightest technology of the Galatasaray, which has been built in the Galatasaray, has also produced audio technology in the ITM, and has also learned music, audio technologies, performance technologies, electronic music and other recording technologies.
terrorism sub-limited message
"What's the sound technology exactly?" is the first question.
"A technology that can be used in many parts.
Our brain's swallowing everything with electric shoes.
The sound frequencies are also a kind of electric, energy.
You can enable people to move with the command you want to do with this energy.
One of the most important higher parts of the sound technology is the sub-limital message.
It places a message in a frequencies that is mentioned outside the border of the music or the song, which can't be identified by the top memory, but it's in high memory.
For example, when a terrorist attack has been taken, Pamir told a musical publication to that area.
If a message is placed as a sing frequencies changed as a "Not Do this Attachment" as a terrorist instrument, this message will be selected by the terrorist.
I don't understand what you heard, but the golden memories come to it, and a voice calls him "shooting."
And it is like a message from Allah.
However, in the world and in Turkey, there is certain law and punishment to use such messages outside the social security.
The South Pamir is a sub-lime message prepared to speak to students at a conference given only once at Istanbul Technology University.
"After the conference, I listened to the students.
I placed a sound frequencies for the music.
At the end of the Sunday, I asked the students that they didn't shut up.
They said, "It's all that they're so calm."
Pamir says that those who use sublime messages are fleet: "In our country, some radio channels have been identified, but the details are still not known.
There's a channel called "Secure Sex Radio" in Germany, a frequency of radical Islamics.
The sub-liminal method of attacking, involved by religion, computer calls, commands to use drugs hair.
"The German police and the Turkey police know that, but they're not able to make it possible because they're always changing frequencies."
It also used such dangerous messages in the music world.
Especially in the songs of some heavy metal groups...
According to these arguments, even a terrorist in the aircraft has been denied, and the subliminal commands of the direct pilots have been performed.
Current Mask
Sound technology can also be used in crimes.
In the United States, especially in banking flows from this science.
For example, when the police shooting calls the voice engineers can see where the voice person is on the phone, where it is in the bank.
A sound metal, a tasty, a plate, a wall, or any other material is different from each other.
It is also possible to detect the size of the room that has been found in the shape of the sound form, even if the room is the shape of the room, the amount of the coins.
It is therefore possible to detect what kind of parts of the wrongdoers' voice, which is in a room and in a way.
And there was a computer program that Pamir made the operational structure of Tataristan with this program, and he said, "I've just planned where the 175 holar building was placed.
It's not a bad technology, it's $4-5.000."
The sound frequencies are also used in mixing and decorations.
There's a lot of jobs about Pamir.
He made a arrangement that the sounds couldn't get out of the table.
They're just gonna hear those talking in the kitchen.
There's nothing else in two steps, no one's talking on the table.
The general system of these arrangements is, "If you want to destroy the sound, you're going to turn it into the same frequency with another sound and you're going to turn it to the river.
But nobody could get into the flight without this system.
Because the aircraft's voice is so high that it can't be shocked.
They're going to destroy themselves in the flight with each other.
You can create a peaceful environment away from your home, even if you open your windows with this system.
Is the Egyptian piramit done with a voice?
There's also other interesting things that Pamir did from the first engineer of Turkey.
He made a arrangement that couldn't hear music from outside a open air disk on Monday.
It can't get out of the random, and it can't be reacted with another sound frequency.
Even in a room, it can be silent after a certain line.
The Pamir's school's sports room, the sport and the concert.
That's what we need to use.
Because when playing basketball, there's need to be a shock, but the concerts do not need to be intact.
It is also possible to provide a sound quality that can only be heard in the clear concerts with sound technologies.
"We're using frequencies that destroy the sounds that are fairly embraced and correct people's instruments, which make the music more cleaner.
MTV's too extensive about this.
He says, "He's just arranging concerts, and he's heard like the stadyo stable under the sound."
It's been a test of Tubitak.
The sound frequencies divide two aluminiums from each other.
There were scientists who claimed that the Egyptian piramits were made with the voice.
They thought that the stones could be removed with the voice.
I ask, "Don't it be hard to use your voice with bad purposes?"
"I was so afraid when I read the New York University's work on the Internet, or if others read.
For the good workers may cause the unbelievable results, even if they do not exceed the laboratory courses.
"Dualar Arabs"
The South Pamir, who says that he would affect humanity in a sense of immorality, explains why: "There is communicated to all the voices that his servants have heard.
Sometimes people listen to the voice that's the only concentration, but other voices are communicating to the brain, and they're going to smile.
So the brain's need to disappear, so it's good to walk on the ground, to do natural walks.
I think there should be arrangements for the orders of driving in schools.
So the student's voice will be focused on the voice of the teaching alone, and it can give a concert for more long."
Pamir, who said that the sound frequencies believed that if prayers are attributed to or read from the Arabs, has a very rich frequencies of Arabia, causing that when the voice comes, the sounds in the words have a lot of mental impact.
"But you have to read your prayers soundly, but when I read it, I'll be weak."
Love Tariff Frequency
"If you can love someone with the voice frequencies?" I don't think.
The frequencies rate of love that Pamir gave, the quote to move the feelings of a more correct person is: "I think you should find the frequency of the pressure that you want to talk to someone you want to love.
You can affect it using higher frequencies of this frequency.
For example, let us consider that the person’s pressure frequency is 300.
And you want to steal a music to get your feelings with him.
If you're gonna bring the pressure to those who are cut off on 300 frequencies of the music that you're playing, it's the ability to affect the person.
Maybe it may love the one who is on that moment."
Pamir, who speaks to have special sound systems to speak more effectively on the world, is very strong, a scene artist can feel like an excellent existence of the nature.
"It's in Japan to try to make a voice that can't be heard from Mikail, and how do you think it's going to be?" Pamir answered, "I think human voice will be close to the voice because the voice of the people is close to its own voice.
Indeed, it is a wonderful thing, so that it is produced from the breath of man."
"The gold's prices will be loaded."
The Canadian Jennings Capital Inc. said that they have worked to reduce the debt of the money units by declining the value of their governments, and therefore it would continue to be the current level of gold prices, "Original and safe designer."
With the increase in the first half of the world's demand over the last week, Hrushewsky, China and India, in the first half of the year, showing that the prices are supported by Hrushewsky, China and India, "the golden costs are higher than the China's silver demand, and the Chinese producers are a large role here."
Hrushewsky, remembering that India's traditionally was the largest gold shopper, "I believe you've seen the search accounts that you've already seen so comfortable.
People will find a way in this frame."
Hrushewsky is in the direction that they do long-term expenditure on the farmers, "It will continue to serve with the role of being a safe designer.
Many Western government's debt levels are forgotten to be loaded from the "disciplinary exile".
The authorities are working to reduce the value of the money units in order to reduce their responsibilities.
Therefore, the gold prices will be burdened from the current levels."
"Ore on the swimming area is stored in the ability to reduce the price risk."
The Director-General of the World Gold Council Marcus Grubb is a physical feature of the sacred, sweet and confidence of the golden and more intensive and volatile financial prices, as it indicates, "If we slow the gold level, it is not to improve the ability to reduce the main progress and the risks of prices.
He said, "The golden portraits of small quantities showing the development of the bringing, mostly proved that it was better to be done with the uncertainties and prices.
Grubb, marking that golden breeding requirement has been laid down in the last 10 years, said, "The golden and global dimensions represent less than 1 per cent of the worldwide.
This means that the prices are still very important to grow in the golden expansion.
In this area, in the past year, 78 percent of the culture of gold and 78 percent of the powerful inputs made to the shooting are the demonstration that the counter-based dimensions are protected."
"Independence must increase national gold stories to support economic growth."
The Grubb, who answers the largest gold prices of the world to India and China, increased the increase in the smooth rates of gold prices in the second round of the year of decline, the culture of gold, and the demand of a smooth.
Grubb remembered 54 per cent of the complaint in China, and 51 per cent in India.
The Grubb, who has led them to the low price of the Chinese smokes, was a loading train, and he said, "The second half of China would normally be silent.
He said, "Well, after the prices of gold were unexpected, and he slowed the swimming shooting."
In India, Grubb states that it has taken many rules to reduce the rule of the Indian Central Bank and to reduce the outcome of the debt, "The high demand is like difficult to implement an outstanding application at the high level, and therefore it is possible to meet invalid channels.
The World High Council believes that India's policies must be viewed as a strategic existence.
Furthermore, it has been found in the evaluation of national gold stories in order to enhance economic growth in long-term political objectives.
Sustainable Gold Trends
According to the World Gold Council report last week, 856.3 tonnes of global golden demands were also 508 tonnes of global sugar and culture.
In the second round of the year, when the countries are seen an important increase in the demand of their country, the same time in the past year, 54 per cent in China, 51 per cent in India, 38 per cent in Turkey and Eastern 33 per cent.
At the time of the term, the smoking demand in China continues to increase, with the expectations of the prices to increase in the future, in the same range of the year, 87 percent increased and 276 tonnes in this year's assembly.
In India, although the government has loaded taxes in the first area, it was 310 tonnes of 71 per cent in the last year of the smoke request.
A warm Karadenz film: Airlines
Dr. Trabzon.
The players are the favorite, sweet, smiling, smiling...
Sevda Serbest
There's only 4000,000 TL films, there's no replication, a lot of naturalization and a cup.
It was the goal of the Vice-President of the Year of Sinema's Love for the Vice-West of the 1980s "We want to observe a real kardinal story."
The cinema was caused by the "Tepenn Airs of the 1980s" film, which has been made in the Middle East in the village of Acesabat and completely produced by amateur players.
Forum AVM Cinemaximum was a careful interest in the galaxy of the snares of the AVM.
They signed a wonderful night with a group of people who lived in a gallery night with horons and horns.
In the first place of Galaia, Mr. Muhammed Balta, President of Trabzon Fevzi, Dr. Orhan Fevzi Officer, Headquarters of the Employee of Industrial Affairs, Ombudsman and Tourism Office, Abdul Rauf Ulusoy, Headquarter of the Chief Turk, and a number of invitations, sponsor companies, national and local representatives.
In the film Dr. Ismet Eran has been scribed by Dr. Altooy's vision manager Samet Karasano, Measuring, Coral Chief, Selahatin, Free Hall, Adem Era, and Resurrection.
In 1980, the Tupenin aircraft in Turkey has been used for the first time to make a better understanding of the Karadenz race.
A star of the tent!
Samet Karahasano is still 18 years old from the head of the film players.
Whatever the name of Samet's player who lives in Trabzon, you're seeing the best.
A amateur theater, a film code, and a dram loading scene is successful.
Samet Karahasano, who had the right to the end of the shops, put his call on the "It's one of the struggle players that will be."
He didn't come, and it's a dragon!
The film's issue, which tells the events in Trabzon's Middle Town, which occurred in a period of 12th September 1980, is:
"Film's head character works in Germany, the youth Wikmet's father.
To continue to the Winter School, and to complete one of the greatest dreams of the Wikmet who make her shepherds in the months, and to do a doctor.
Whatever it's not much to read and work.
And when a village is the most rich family of Züleyha, the daughter of Züleyha, is still a very hard work.
This love that has been hidden for years is a hard obstacle to the Wisdom's father of Zuleyha, who decided to tell his friends to the silences of Züleyha.
Sabri Blue's daughter has other plans.
And there is one of the greatest tribulations of the villages, which they made together and gathered upon the gates, and a war against the villages on this temple.
Shortly metros of the film...
The Senator and Governor of the Galada film explained that the 1980s of the Topenite Aviation was a very small shoe of Dr.
"When we started this movie, our purpose was to make a short film.
But the first spectrums were so interested in the social media that we started to hear a lot of shocks and touched us.
When we went to Istanbul, they said to us, "Do you have a great player?"
I said, "We don't know, but I have 86 cardinal games that you can't find anywhere."
The films and smells of the films have been used very badly, and the Karadenz people were wrongly identified.
You're gonna watch the original 86th original person in the movie you're looking for.
I tried to take a cardinal movie.
I don't know if others had taken before me, but we would have watched a shockless movie.
If you weren't telling people wrong, I wouldn't have taken this movie.
We first posted a Turkish subscription on the film.
And that's gonna be the first.
We did this because you're better understood.
We also posted the English conversation scenes in the movie and turned into the cardinal snake.
When we turned this movie to whom we turned the camera to the player.
It's our first movie.
I'm wrong, I can't do my cyclings."
Don't shoot this warm movie that brings a new cell to the cardinal movies!
Watch when you choose your parfum!
Take care of your illness to show your personal views, or of those who are in your hand slow and swallowed with a sweet shoe.
It may cause your parfum diseases.
We talked about the Citte Poikloderation of Citte, which is the source of different cosmetics for the start of women, with Hisar Intercontinental Hospital Thematologist Dr. Funda Ataman.
In the Cyclothing's size of the Poikloderation, in the first and in the sky's decoration (the edge of the edge of the edge of the skin), the Usm is that the color of the colors appears in the sun. Dr. Ataman: "The slight colors of the people appear in the sun.
The coffee red legs appear in a shape.
He striketh his hands, and he is grateful, and the wheat trees are determined.
The pulse is one of the options for the treatment of laser and the protection of the sun.
Another is the use of retinoic asylum creams.
These creams must be used for a long time.
It is not an adverse or alergia that can appear during the use.
In this case, it must be continued to be treated.
In order to be family, your parents must be known about the age of Citte Poikloderation and therapy.
It's a big fall in the smoke.
In Turkey in the first six months of this year, 10% of the same period, and 41.779 million returned.
In Turkey in the first six months of this year, 10% of the same period, and 41.779.00 million, 190.560 per cent.
According to the information provided by the Commission for Alcohol Revision (TAPDK), the use of information on the product of adults in Turkey and the establishment of data on the source of data by the Turkish Statistics for adults (KYTA) has been completed by the Turkish Statistics Institute.
According to the research results, in Turkey generally slowed 31.2% (16.2 million) every day or between 2012 at 27.1% (14.8 million) and the use of the fuel was decreased by 13.4% in 2012.
41.5% of men are using 13.1% of women.
The rate of those who use the twin product is 47.9% to 41.5% in men, and the percentage of women fell by 15.2% to 13.1%.
According to the investigation, 10 persons who use the fuel product are thinking to leave 6 to smoke.
The rate of those who think to leave the product in a month was 12.9.12 per cent, and 35.4 per cent of those planned to leave.
In the review section, the following opinions were placed:
"The net result of the opening of smoking products is marking that the smoking control laws in Turkey and the National Inspection Programme and the Action Plan are actively implemented.
Thus, from 2008 to 2012, the number of smoke products has reduced 2 200 million people, the use rate of 4.1 per cent, and the most specific reduction in smoking has been the price increase in young people, such as less educational people.
The 2013 World Health Protection Report report reported that Turkey was the first and only country that has succeeded with all criteria on the basis of the control of the smoke.
In the report, other countries claimed to follow and imitate Turkey."
The cigarette law continues to show its effects.
In the first six months of this year, the smoking rate of smoking was reduced by 10 per cent in the same period, with a 10 per cent of 757 million in 190,000 per cent.
In 2012, there were 46 billion of $325 million in the same period.

Another newness to Android!
The Google patent will make it easier.
And that's the patent of a new machine technology that uses the work of the shared files with the friends, between the mobile operation systems and Android.
It's not very different from the NFC and Bluetooth functions that are incompatible with technologies, actually Android Beam and Apple Airdrop examples.
The last newness that's transferred to Google is that it's going to take the user groups instead of a partial share, and it's going to give the users easy.
The new personality comes, but it's like, like...
That's the first phone in Turkey.
Turkcell went into the smart phone work.
The manufacture of smart phones will be in Turkey.
T40 name
Turkcell identified the first smart phone in Turkey.
The TCELL design is made in Turkey and the smart phone that will be produced in Turkey on the end of September towards T40.
Turkcell General Director Süreyya Ciliv said he planned to sell in nine countries in which Turkcell worked.
He said, "T40's part of China will be started to produce in Turkey until the year 2013."
EXPIRY FYRY ORACK
Ciliv, who said they're gonna offer his phone with a suitable price, explained that he's going to sell the prices close to the sale.
Ciliv said that it would be more accessible from the sale of T40 and the computer, offering a intelligent phone to the market, to increase the use of data, to increase its costs.
Ciliv, who stated that the T-serial sales offered in Turkcell from 2010 were sold for a million of phones, stated that these sales were $500 million of libraries.
FYIATIES TO THE ALACK ON THE LIFE
Turkcell General Director Süreyya Ciliv said that T40 would be the properties of the high-resolved, sound-resolved and adjustable user device.
Ciliv said that before T40's price was out on the phone price, the phone's price would be appropriate.
FROM 5 WHAT THAT THAT FOR THE GOOD
When he said that President of Tayfun Acarer supported the local production of information technology and communications, he said, "7 percent of the phones in Turkey are smart phones.
The average cost of the phones sold because of this increase, is $300.
"There's $15 million every year, we're looking for $5 billion every year, and we're worried that it's going to get more."
Android operating systems will have 1 GB RAM features.
All my priests were in heart!
The records of students in the normal media were renewed as a secondary student.
MEB converted all student schools in Turkey, which we've seen from 4+4+4 in education, as a medium-sized, and imam heart-in-law.
After a year of education, it appeared that many schools have been signed by a new scene during the period of transformation.
This year, in Turkey, the priest's heart and care for all the publishers of all the schools that are rounded in the middle of the school, is in the scene of the "conciliation" in the Sugar Meram, which was made in the Middle Meram.
A normal year
The primary school of the sugar was round over the beginning of the year after the 4+4+4 arrangement.
In school, the system's group had to go to another school with a second school, a second school, a second, and a second class of students.
The school, which served as a normal school for a year, was transformed into a worldwide, together with the end of 2012-2013 education year.
I'm a heart-related school, and this year he accepted his students as a "Image and student".
However, in the past 5th class, students read normally, and this year, the records of the 6th class have been automatically renewed as a medium student.
"Another school that doesn't want."
The brothers who learned the situation, they were a complainant in school.
However, in the course of the instruction of the Military Education Director, the school government said to the brothers: "The children who don't want to continue in the heart of their children can take their record in another medium."
In explanation from the Military Education Department of Konya, it was interesting expressions.
In explaining, "We have made some schools again, with the preferences of students and schools, and in Konya's 15-20 schools, the priests were rounded.
Schools are in the headquarters' e-schoing system with school codes.
However, the priest's school is removed from the code of the old school in the environment.
To open a new school code, students must be stored in the system.
These schools were switching to the medium, by using the new code of the body, to make the students changed schools, and by using the new code that they could not be switched.
"Their brothers can take their children from these schools and give the other schools."
