Triumph of the legal populations in Austria, totally 29%
The first preliminary results of the election of parliamentary elections from Sunday in Austria have been a prominent weakness of both parties of the great coalition and a significant strengthening of the legal population partys.
In particular, the Austrian People ' s Party, where the position of the previous President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the chippe.
On the contrary, the election chief of the Bureau for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Counterer Countryesheader Jörg Haider, is a triumphal return to the federal policy.
As a result, social democracy (SPUE) remains with 29.8 per cent of the most strongest power in the country, but it loses 5,5 per cent of the votes in 2006.
Another bad amount of AVP losing almost nine percent of the voice.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the Austrian war history, and in particular in the People's Party, which had requested the elections, this is a real catastrophal result.
At the beginning of July, when the AVP was out of the coalition, the People's Party had a clear pretension before the SPUE.
But the electioners probably have punished the parties to disrupt the government.
In the early reactions on the results there were speculations about a possible decline of the participatory and previous vice-cancer Wilhelm Molterer.
The observer believes that this may already be on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party's position.
Such development would probably be the way to the most likely way out of the election debacle, so that it would be a renewing of the great coalition from SPÖ and OPP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-populist parties - the freedoms (FPÖ) were provisional 18 per cent, the BZÖ 11 per cent of the votes, but the social democracy had expressed their fear in 1999 when the People's Party with the People's Debates (the same time the FPUE was still unilateral, in 2005 it had taken from the BZÖ) with regard to a common government, which even sanctions were called by the European Union.
In this development, obviously Jörg Haider, who has already declared it is ready to cooperate with each party and go from return to Vienna to the Austrian federal policy.
In the European Parliament also, the Green Party, which, however, suffers slight losses and decreased from the third to the fifth place of Austrian political parties.
No other party probably has measured the four-percentage thresholds and, therefore, did not go into Parliament.
Blackzeberg: Relations with India can be discharged
If it is not possible to solve the problem with the Tschechian scientists who were complained in India because of the illicit collection of buyers, it could be viewed by the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Karel Schwarzenberg, to a certain decline of Czech-India relations.
This stressed the Minister in New York after the present meeting with his Indian official Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this is not clear, then sure, it comes to a certain decoration", he explained after a meeting which took place at a Czech initiative.
Mukholdshi said, after conversation, the executives could only be difficult to take part in legal matters.
Nevertheless, he argued that in the case of Petr Švacha, who was released by the accused, and received a casual punishment, the central government wanted to deal with the local government in Dardjiling, in which the laws are in question.
"It could be cleared," said the Minister.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced for three years of freedom penalty, it would be Mukhardshis' view the best if he would go to professionalisation at a higher instance.
He could ask for free exemplary and wait for his sentence, so the Minister.
Blackzeberg confirmed that his partner was expressed in negotiations.
"He recommends a profession at a higher court, then comes in question for him", said the Chief of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech page can be involved in all the matters is to engage the judges 'competent legal support', the Indian Minister launched.
At the same time, he said that such assistance will already be offered through the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in receiving good contacts with India who have a long-term tradition.
The Inders also give it to this," leaded the Blackzeberg.
At the same time, the Czechian Press Agency, before his partner, the Czech Republic has contributed to the problem of entomologs in Czech.
"We really hold it for a great mistake to arrest and arrest these Tschechian scientists," he explained.
An answer to the question if he has received the appeal from the Indian side to address the matter, the Minister will declare.
"I was already promised so much," he only realized.
A chest drives through the ring around the sea
It is involved in an electronic map on Australia and the border areas.
But it is not the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with her the cross-border sea ground.
The area is so large as the continent itself," says the Italian jurist Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the thirty-first employee of the United Nations Division for Oceans and Sea rights.
His head, the Director of Division, the Czech jurist Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and complements it.
This is the ruling of work and enthusiasm.
The sea ground has a little known world, which is rich of natural sources.
Here it is to find terrestrial oil, the extensive era and other non-agriculture substances, but also for a long time unknown organisms, which have, for example, the key to developing a medicine against cancer.
A sea background, greater than the Fireland
The Antarctic States today reported their right to the new marine areas.
Indeed, after a United Nations Convention, they use their rights to join in Jamaica in 1982.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelves, which is often up to a few hundred miles far from the east of a country to the sea.
This country has, according to the Convention, excluding all the sources of the continental ships.
"Otherwise expressed as a continental shield is considered the part of the sealand and its soil, which represents a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It exceeds the borders of the East Sea, often the borders of twenty-five miles of the sog-excluding economic zone," says Mikulka.
The application submitted by the Commission's respective country to establish the external borders of the continental shelf must be accompanied by a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on many cost-intensive investigations and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation.
" One of our tasks is to provide the Commission legally and specially technical support.
The Commission has already negotiated five applications, such as Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Up to now only the three latest countries have succeeded", adds Mikulka.
At a international echo recently the success of Australia, which could significantly increase its marine areas as the first country.
However, New Zealand is also a winner - the expansion of the sealand that has been made by the Commission last week is about 1,6 million square kilometers, so that about six times more than the size of the real state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the research.
The wine that is put to them in the future from the use of the sealand will have an unprecedented value.
Other States will also submit their applications slowly.
You can do this ten years since the moment they ratifie the "convention of Montego Bay".
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the oceanland that is called by the Convention as "common heritage of humanity".
There's no State any more special in here.
The right to promote in this area provides an international institution established by the Convention.
"The sealand is no golden rail," said with some transmission Director Mikulka, and adds to which "all areas are legally defined and treatedly infected by the system."
Czech in the Pacific
A part of the sea ground today belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares him with other states of the former Eastern Block in the framework of the Joint Interocean Metal Organization.
This was obtained in 1991 because of the Convention, as well as the investors of some other countries less than, the status of a "training investor".
The organization has the right to promote in the Clarion Clipperton Zone in the Style Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to investigate by the investor is something greater than the former Czechoslowakei.
The sea ground is connected there, it is a type of tatra on the sea.
"Promoting can be found on a surface of over 75,000 square kilometers there.
The area is a rich foundation centre of polymetall conventions that includes Nickel, Kupfer, Kobalt and Mangan," said another jury, the Inder Pakshi Kings.
The macedonic employee of the Rober Sandev Division brings such a concrete as a pattern.
She remembers a small cardfold or, with something phantasie, the deceasing shom that legends to the Golem lived.
German special forces were in place for discharge
The Egyptian government had requested assistance from Germany to solve the Jesel crisis - the experts came.
When seriously, the special units were ready, but they did not.
In the situations of liberation 11 in Egypt, European tourists employed in Egypt will always be informed more details.
The rescue action also participated in indirectly in German special forces according to the details of the Defence and Internal Ministry.
As a result, both federal specialists and GSG 9 were the flight staff of the Federal Policei, the Federal Criminal Labour and the logistics of the technical aid work on the place of release.
However, as the speakers of the ministers continued to share on Monday, the German forces did not need because they left their prisoners and fled when they had recognized signs for a violent release.
The Egyptian government has adopted the aid provided by Germany to connect them as local support forces.
"It has not been happy," said a speaker of the Federal Ministry.
The traveling group was divided from the five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian, and their eight Egyptian attendants in the southern Egyptians on September 19th.
After the departure in a wilderness in the south of Egypt, the beaches were entered into the border between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chaad.
The identity of the shippers remained unexpected as well as the details of the release or possible loss payments.
The devices have come to preserve in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the liberated shoes are in the obhut of the German message.
For details of the release, he did not express himself.
At first, there was no information when they return to Germany.
According to the "Image" allocation, the five holidays and the special forces should be shocked with a air bus bus of the airwaves and take place on Tuesday in Germany.
US Representative House refusal of relief package
The first chamber of the United States Congress has made the $700 billion a serious saving package for the financial markets all right.
The Dow Jones was out in the depth.
With 206 to 227 votes, the US Representative has rejected the Government's relief package for financial markets.
Despite all appliances by President George W. Bush and leaders of both parties, there was no majority for the programme that the Chaos should be deemed to the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the preferences were doubtless trying to convince the critics still a serious package of $700 billion.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiations leaders, had called the deputy, even if the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to get political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet occurred," said he.
In the course of the vote, the Dow Jones entered more than six percent or about 600 points.
It was reasonable that the investors were worried that the State saving package could disappear.
Soon before the end of the vote, he recalled himself, after the complaints of the disaster, again.
Experts now receive further severe turbulences on the international financial markets.
For the entry into force of the programme, the approval is required both of the House of Members and of the Senate.
Increased reserve numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German travel event:
In travel books for the next months, the expenditure is significantly increased in comparison with the previous year - even for winter seasons even more than 30 percent.
Despite weak conjuncture views, the German travel loss of a study remains unexpected.
Reserves for Winter Session marked a 31 per cent over the previous year, as the German Reis Group (DRV) reported at Monday in Berlin.
The GfK Market Research Institute's investigation has already been proposed for the original month of reserve numbers.
Thus, the DRV shared around 11 percent compared to 2007.
Based on these results are GfK's numbers, the monthly booking data of 1200 German travel offices and increases the total market.
The travel books were carried out until August 2008.
In particular, because of the weak dollar course, travels were asked to the United States, the DRV shared.
There is a third of the booking growth around a third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, and the home fillings in German travel objectives.
In particular, high skins in the course, President of DRV, Klaus Laepple.
In view of the increased costs for energy and food, the costs are "for customers better calculable than for individual holidays".
Consumers, among others, could escape the offers of early booking, or all-inclusive offers, explained Laepple.
The summer months were also very well booked, so that the previous year will be re-exampled - even though another study shows the number of Germans who have taken a journey in comparison with the previous year.
My first time October Festival
Ballermann-Apress-Hits in the endless bed, beer from liters and promis in designer dinners.
A Wiesn-debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I haven't really much together.
She's a blond, television modelator and brings a massed dirndl.
I've got dark hair, I'm a student and my clothes is second hand.
One thing, however, is connected to us: three minutes on the wine, the photographs are already cut up on us and cut the memory cards fully - very sweet and that at my first review visit.
That's how you get friends.
The Bill-Dirndl seems to meet its purpose.
As the Wiesn Touri and the north of the white-worn steactor, the well-being feeled in the light until date.
But once arrived in the Theresian vision, it's half that's so bad.
Fast everyone takes dirndl or leder hoss; no one looks opposed or painfully touched - everything is totally normal.
Strange views at the Scokoban City only remember my shocks.
A muncher notes me that I had been wrong linked to the shoes: "Links, free, forgive me in the middle of the youth, forgive me to the right, down there."
Homely, I'll smell my clothes from behind to left.
"Passt," said and laughed.
Others make less up to subtle flat techniques and bring smooth fibers on which "To drunk to get clothesed!" is and strike an uncomfortable swimming part of the naked shock.
The young man with the exhibitionist acts named Bob, come from England and visits first time the October Festival.
He finds it "gorgeous" with a long "ooooo".
That he tells me after he completed his predominant measure.
Right next to one of these hydraters, from which everyone thinks he's a muller.
Bob is one of the favorite "Wildbysler".
Others do not have the happiness to remove alcohol in this way.
On the eighth end, sanitators walk in shadows over the set that must care for the poor shooter.
The hospital workers are always on the roof - every four times a overwhelmed tragedy of Zelt to Zelt.
This works as with most Wiesn users: empty up, full back.
Who's in the Promille Salg under the plan isn't seen.
"These are the places in which goarnmmers are packed," one of the healthcare called to ask and disappeared in the grain.
Name of the victim known by the police
The name of a 63-year-old woman's fussman who died in the hospital after it was entered in Essex, was known.
Carole Paulson, a living in the Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday on Shenfield Road in the city mission.
She was taken to the Queen's Hospital House in Romford, but later he died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident because of the suspect on light-speed driving.
In the meantime, he was released to battle.
Turkey extends the diplomatic horizon
For a long time before Turkey aimed at joining the European Union, the European forces were interested in reducing deeply in Turkey's border.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, is one of the most deceived, caiser efforts.
The Hydarpasha Bahnhof was established by the two German Architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in Neo-Renaissance Style.
That's at least what the travellers tell you.
The building is situated at the end of the station with a tour on each edge of the front side and looks like a provincial German Council House.
The stone is crazy.
The whole building is slow
But once you have been within the disadvantaged cards, there is no doubt about the inheritance of the project, whose western access was.
The Bahnhof was opened by a German consortium, the Anatolian Bagdad Society in August 1908.
Germany, who was a past traveller in the imperialist game, had to be implemented before its ambitions to dominate the Middle East, through a trail connection to Damaskus, Bagdad, and further after what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, Germany’s imperialist projects were raised during the first world war.
His rail ships were attacked by Lawrence of Arabians and his Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, created by the unconquerable borders of the cold war, is disappeared.
The British forces turned out of Egypt and put the Turkeys and their German associates from Palestinian and Syria
And there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha Bahnhof.
In 1917, a museum in the air was destroyed by the artistic toilet.
Turkey's sources say it was Sabotage.
Since then, it has been slowly declined, slowly crossed from the history.
Today, however, this rail line, at least symbolically, serves as a door to anatolia and all the Eastern to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of the Tükei.
The Governing Justice and Development Party, the ACP, has introduced a strong new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the nearby regions, produced by the borders of the cold war, is gone.
It is now a policy of approach.
It is noted that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian flag groups Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course to the European Union and the United States.
In order to be able to judge the eck data of this new external policy, I have taken the night to the Turkish capital of Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign experts of the ACP, the Turkish deputy Suat Kiniklioglu.
On the next morning, about ten hours later, after a hot drive to Gleisen, which produced the equality of the old world in the known documentation "The Night Mail", I came to see in the Turkish capital, which was as a new city, for the new world projects, the Osmanian past.
However, the ACP, known for its Islamic reasons, represents a paradigm change in the Turkeyn unity.
This has solved some of the missiles in Western, especially in Washington.
A taxi has brought me to the main business centre of the ACP, a specially prepared, ultramoderated stone and steel construction, in a developed city, rounded by half-finished buying centres and snakes in which the average managers are in attractions, both men and women, to end the first business of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a Middle Legal Politics of almost every other political party of Europe.
Let's go, Krawatte, I'm sure he even packed a blackberry.
"The goal of the external policy of the party is now to reintegre Turkey with its immediate neighbouring countries.
The cold war was an exception," he told me.
Turkey had been divided from its inner country.
Today she must look at the East and West at the same time.
Don't give the one or the other.
You should do both.
"But surely Turkey may ever be", I asked, "do you have to decide?"
"The Turkey," he said, "I don't want to make this decision."
He then highlighted a point near everybody with whom I spoke here: the relationships of Turkey, not only to the Middle East, but also to the cupcase and around the black sea, are the benefits of Europe and the United States, as they are for Turkey.
With the Turkey on board, it seems to be the message, in the meantime, Europe can walk as a whole to the east direction of Asia and the Middle East.
Returned to the Hydarpasha Bahnhof, after another widespread night, I thought of these two German governments Mr Ritter and Mr Conu, who had seen this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they had been to learn that Europe's environments in the Middle East now, to cut parts, could be in the hands of Turkey.
And when I waited at the department, which should bring me back to the Bosporus, I remembered that Turkey was always called "the sick man Europes" in those days.
At least, it seemed not to be a lot of doubts about which continent should have an inclination to this fascinating country.
Remember Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical leader since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley was responsible for the Guildford Philharmoniker and Chor.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his magnificent young chor, Proteus in the next year.
He was thinking for youths up to 21 years, but when the Chor was the last time we sang, some of us were over the end of 20 - we simply refused to leave the Chor.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological channel) was for the preparation and ability of the chores, any musical room that was presented to him to attack, even if it was a Madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with full orchester.
The musical diversity of such a young chores was often surprising, always shocked and made it only and only thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that never lived over years.
How often the death deserved us to let music speak for himself.
He said, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in music.
So sing it!"
His type of guidance was absolutely clear and precise, but never exceeding.
As the higher was always the musical level, he always requested a further higher.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If somebody should have been shooted to the rider, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, in which he led the Guildford Philharmoniker.
In the past 40 years, I have written critics for hundreds of his concerts, and I can honestly say that I was never deceived by a single person - often I was inspired by them.
The death of Handley was that rare combination of size and personal discreetness.
He casts the people, according to his words, simply "with one or two known sheep households in the world".
So many of us will disappear him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett wrote:
In your call for William Woodruff (25 September) writes that "he re-educed the economic history in Oxford in 1946 and received a Houblon Standard for Research Session in 1950 ... while he studied a BSc, a MA and a doctor degree at the same time.
This is a conclusion from a author's comment in Woodruff's book "All of Nab End", but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a dozen of the economic history at the university of Nottingham, and during that time he wrote a doctorship on the British Cook industry under the attention of Professor J.D. Chambers, published later in 1958 as "The British Cook industry".
He was in the United States in 1950-1951 in a Houblon-Normen Stipendium, and carried the summer of 1952 to the Universitys of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to take this part of his trains.

‘I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino ‘Flamenco and Life’ because its photos are fantastic in black, in the documentary style.
They took me attention to them because of their light and for the strength that they extract, how they are always doing with respect to the protagonists.
A exhibition that shows many feelings.

Second round of the wonderful sale in Honda.
In November, Honda begins with the marketing of the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While his processing model had a large inner space, this larger space limit is still increasing.
This is also the technical fences that can evacuate even more comfortable driving and benzine.
Changes before the previous revolution.
So is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, asthetically seen, the new Jazz shows a similar line with its pre-operators, the changes that have been made at this large limit are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new space flexibility, the greater sizes of the car and the new mechanism are to be stressed.
However, before you start to analyze the new model, you must say that this new Jazz six years later after the first generation appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda created, compared to the other manufacturers, to renew this model for a shorter time.
Although Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon about its sales on the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, where Jazz is the most sales car of 2002 and also during 2008.
After Jazz appeared on the market, only in Japan was sold about a million models.
The second paragraph market was the old continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
However, Honda tries to increase the sale of the new Jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while the Japanese companies sold a total amount of 83,000 Jazz models in 2007, the expected estimates of 10,000 cars are 17% of the increase in the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has sold in total 8 000 Jazz Model Sells since 2002, which is 6,7% of the total sale in Honduras in Spain.
As regards the new generation of the model, the leaders of the branches in Spain expected to sell 2 000 Jazz models per year.
Similarly, it allows the appearance of the new Honda Jazz models to be sold in Spain.
In fact, the leaders of the Marke hope to conclude the year with total sale of 22,000 models, which are less than 4 000 cars in 2007, a decrease of 16 %.
In spite of this sales growth, Honda increased its market share in Spain with respect to the previous year (1,6%) to 1,8 %.
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this share, Honda sets out the appearance of a new model.
This is insight, a Hybridaut with 5 doors and a compact size of 4.7 m long, the Japanese company hopes to sell it about 2000,000 models per year in the world.
The Japanese manufacturer’s market assessments will be sold by 50 % of insight models in the United States while the rest of its share in the old continent and Japan.
The appearance of the insight on the market is provided for the first months of the year, for the first time its public representation will be held in Valencia in January.
With regard to the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its sizes.
His length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters ), its width is 1.69 meters (more 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, which leads to accepting that it has become the size of 5 centimeters.
The height, however, is not changed and remains 1,52 meters.
With the increased dimensions, the internal space is also increased.
This success is to give the new space flexibility program and, on the other hand, the central position of the vehicle container, a solution used in the operational model of Jazz.
The capacity of the copper space, which has a double loading area, also reaches up to 339 litres, so 19 litres greater than the capacity of the copper space of the first generation.
It should be emphasized that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4 liter benzin engine, as the capacity of the Honda Jazz's copper room with a 1.2 liter benzin engine 379 litres.
Among other improvements, except the additional equipment elements such as leder sides or the possibility of the panorama windows, will offer improved access to the sites.
The opening corner of the doors is 80 degrees, with the first Jazz had only 67 degrees.
The motors of the second generation of Jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its market, this small model 2 executions of the benzine engines has 1,2 and 1.4 liters.
Both variables have the i-VTEC system, which allows low fuel consumption and smaller CO2 exhibition, have an extraordinary technical performance and simultaneously places a round-state performance for the whole engine period.
The first variant with 1,2 liters results in the performance of 90 PS at 6 000 rates of 114 Nm to 4 900 min?1 .
This benzin engine - the operational model of Jazz reached 78 PS - has 5.3 litre gas consumption and CO2 exhibition of 125 grams.
With regard to the operating engine reached at the previous generation 83 PS, he is now able to reach 100 PS.
The Jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5.4 litre benzine consumption and 128 gram CO2 exhibition.
‘Auto-Biene’ preventing collisions
In order to advance the development of the technologies for accident prevention, Nissan was now inspired by the nature, exactly said by the beasts.
The Japanese company has developed a robot which returns to the black behavior of bees and prevents accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic car robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the technologies for accident prevention.
The engineering of the Nissan Motor Co. Technology Centre has developed this small robot in cooperation with the Research Centre for Advanced Science and Technology of the renomeed university of Tokio (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the director of Technology and R&D Brad Management, the BR23C is an extension of the fourth Nissan security distinction.
This robot is intended to ensure that the cars of these brands are able to avoid collisions.
During the flight, every bath is built on its own, oval-floor airspace, which is very similar to the Nissan security shield.
But the most important thing is the facetons of the beasts that can see over a angle of 300 degrees in all directions that allow you to fly in their personal airspace without interruption.
To illustrate the rounddum perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
It notes obstacles to the BR23C in a distance to two meters and in the radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to a marginal microprocessor which is directly translated to the signal for avoiding the collision
'In the moment when the obstacle is observed, the small robots will inject the beast flight and immediately change the direction by turning its roues around 90o or even more angles to avoid collision.
The greatest difference between other systems is that this explanatory manner is absolutely instinct.
If not so, the robot could not be able to react with sufficient speed to prevent obstacles, ' Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of the Laboratory for Mobility and Leader Ingenieur of this project.
In contrast to a bird, the robot can not go down or down, but not overwhelm; it can move only on two dimensions and in the direction that allows him to turn his roots and not to the infinite directions and to an infinite way how it makes the beasts.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function next to acceleration and delay functions so that the small robots avoid collisions.
'This device needs only a couple seconds to process the information and act according to these information.
It does not require to store the information or the intuitive logic of the subjected manure, so it can continuously work with only a couple of twin KB of the storage place.
This sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs and not even about the MBs of the storage place.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology to introduce the Nissan in the next ten years in the series of cars.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries that are easier and keep longer than the variety of lithium ione batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system via satellite to lead to the goal and thus to prevent obstacles on the road.
She's on the seat before she's kidnapped with a hypotheke.
It must be seen that the United States Finance Minister, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide support, but not without shipping.
Before the crisis and to avoid that the U.S. citizens have been confused in the history of hypothecus of the appropriate payable banks, it is developed a sustainable and informal game for the Internet Super: `Bad credit Hotel'.
Or maybe the 'hotel of the bad credit' or the intermediate.
The third aspect of this accommodation and specifically its receptionist is to consider one, two and up to three times whether it is the moment to ask no credit.
And especially where you can do it, what is probably the goal of the game.
Of course she has useful information, but without details.
This is more than one side for the youth than a place for all viewers.
What will happen when the game is expanded?
Well, if a dreaming room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley provides its capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the increase of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) in its undertakings, which would be the first bank in Japan, expending nine billion dollars and taking up 21% of their capitals, a renewing that is a strong case of its burden currency.
One week after a provisional agreement was made public, the two banks declared that MUFG 9,9% of the Morgan Stanley Stamms will be purchased for a uniform price of $25,25, which is a total amount of $3 billion.
The price accepted is less than 19% of the rate of the share of 31 August.
MUFG will invest more than six billion dollars in the purchase of conversible shares that will be safe for a profit of 10% and can be sell back to a price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global business will be accompanied on the basis of a single average price of $29, so 28 % over the current currency value.
However, Morgan Stanley's action was against 17.00 GMT by 6.79% to $23.07.
'This strategic connection is an important opportunity to accelerate the transition of Morgan Stanley to the status of a holding bank' said John Mack, Director-General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this status last week, which would allow him to extend its business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Their connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis imposes the largest name of Wall Street to take a more careful situation than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement was changed in the last days: last Monday Morgan had simply explained that it would sell up to 20% of its shares for about 8,5 billion dollars to Japan.
For a week, in Tokio Toshihide Mizuno, MUFG's business leader, we thought that the participation would be full of stammakers.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and ensure us. '
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay for its Morgan Stanley shares 7% under its currency value.
And the business will go from about 20% per share with a reduction of the profit.
The agreement suggests that MUFG can change half of its prior shares in stammaking in a year when the last calling is exceeded 50% over the sales value, so about 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the money provided by MUFG will allow him to use investment opportunities, strengthen their balance and increase their sales.
However, a publisher of the group refused to make more details on the strategic projects of the two new partners.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should be able to make a payability rate of approximately 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan explained that his balance had been seen since the end of August `deutly'.
The last weeks were hard for the group who had to look at how their burner course returned around half, while the price for insurance against payment invalidity was fast to the height.
This price returned on Monday, but remained at a high level, about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only new "living" of the large investment banks at Wall Street after the competition of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced last week, $15 billion in Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffet.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
The Republic renews the socialism of the 21th century.
Thus, the joint project of the Venezolaner Hugo Chávez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Equatorian Rafael Correa.
That third was that this Sunday, the example of his equality and friends, made the plan for a new Constitution.
The mission is fulfilled, as 80% of the public results in election votes were 64% of the people's vote.
As a result, 28% with "No", 7% of the selection place was invalid and 0.7% were empty.
In order to adopt the Constitution project, a vote must be achieved more than half of all votes issued.

On Sunday night, Rafael Correa also requested the winning of his constitutional project.
The Constitution has triumphated overwhelmingly, and he was assured in Guayaquil, the Government's Site of 280 km south-west of Quito and welcomed the Equatorians.

The election held under the Observer Regulation of the United States (OAS) in the style of the United States (OAS) refers to a text that exists from 444 points to the safeguard of the 'new socialism' for which the President is in place.
The Constitutional Project is transferred to the economy by transposing the single right to the 'Evolution Plan' in a country which is most widely from the earth-food promoting by foreign companies and the bonds that are shipped to the country.
The project chosen by Correa will also be more comprehensive to the Head of State that will be enabled to perform up to two joint mandates from each four years, and will have the opportunity to resolve the national Assembly.
Correa already announced that he would use this power and engage a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also ensures the principle of free medical care and education which the President has already started to introduce with 13.9 million inhabitants in this country, in which 50% of the population lives under the poverty limit.
Last end, it also intends to prohibit the presence of foreign troops, which will prepare the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an equatorial support point as the starting station for American anti-drogen.
The 19 Jewels were released in Chaad
A Egyptian command started the attack against the 11 tourists and their eight accompanying attendants captured ten days ago.
You're in Cairo.
The 11 European tourists and their eight Egyptian students, held in the desert for 11 days, were healthy and unreasonable to the main city of Egypt.
Tomorrow, they were released from a Egyptian command in the Cshad.
It seems to be good, the helmets reached the military basepoint al-Maza directly next to the international airport of Kairo at 15.30 p.m.

They enjoy all 'better health' and the departments 'no delivery', explained the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism Zoheir Garanna on the Rollfield.
After she was captured on September 19, at a footstep of the mountain Ouanat in the border of Egypt, the Sudan and Libyan, the group of the gissels was always returned to 35 unknown residents from a hide.
It is about 11 Tourists - five Italians, five Germans and a Romanian - and more than eight Egyptian leaders: two leaders, four chauffors, one border manager and the Director of Agirus, Safari.

letters - The silent majority of the culture
A debate on the financing of the culture makes slaughter lines and is a central issue of the current election campaign.
It's better.
But a field of our cultural life remains still forgotten.
Who will stand up and approve the natural sums that are granted to the small museums, the archives, the archaeological expansions or national historical places that are quietly hungry?
What political politicians will the Federal Government remember that they degrad their thinkers and their culturally important buildings?
What does not exist in Quebec, as well as in Canada, true laws protect effectively our culturals?
Do you know that the French government only provides 3,5 million euros for the restoration of China's closure in Loiretal?
Our American neighbors are written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of the culture of the American culture and that this cultural person must be protected by all citizens, all Members and all government areas, in mutual vote.
In Quebec, in the association of the creative companies of Quebecs, at least 40,000 privacy officials who are assembled in 211 creatures, are trying to deal intensively with the history, to save the numerous privacy archives, and to obtain the archaeological rests.
They are also often the guards of our cultural servants that protest with the power of dismissing when promotors and decision-makers leave their burdozers on our old stones and forgotten peace heights.
When will it be a shock for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments State parts of the Fortis Bank
In part, the Benelux States want to enter the Belgian and Dutch Fortis Bank, which has been covered by the US financial crisis in Turbulence: the three states are available to the Bank and Insurance Institute, which is also available in Hungary, total EUR 11,2 billion.
The Governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have consulted the European Competitive Authority at the highest level at the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Director of the European Commission's Competition Authority.
In the Euro Zone, the Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been held for a year, so it could have decisions taken with regard to the bank.
In view of the decision taken on Sunday, all three States purchase the bank share of about 49 per cent.
The bank will probably sell a part of its shares, all of the insurance activities bought by the Dutch ABN Amro in the last year.
Fortis' shares have started a steel talent in the second half of the weeks, serious crisis scenarios have already been decreased.
However, analysts agree that the bank with its 85,000 employees is too large for a pledge.
The value papers of the Institute have fallen to 12% on Friday at a 14-year speech.
From the boys the value of the shares is over two thirds.
In view of the current share rates, the market value of the group is of EUR 14 billion, but is unrealistic.
According to the management, the USD is 700 billion teore American salvation package and the insecurity of the markets debt to the flow of the Fortis actions.
However, on Monday, the courses are easy to increase.
On Friday, Philip Derrckx was appointed to the new director of the bank.
The currency institute was also on the search for a private buyer, but it did not find interest in a private offer.
The Belgian government was trying to raise it - no investor is going to settle its money, said it.
Among the customers, there is no panic, the branches of the bank have not been formed.
In Hungary, the Fortis has own branches, but it also calls her own Leasing companies.
Fuchs in Hahnerstall
On the basis of the medical consumption of a person in the United States, a contract with a customer is often rejected.
Data protection experts are afraid that the data market could be uncontrolled.
"In any case, data protection programs are linked to the use of medicinal data to the approval of the concerned.
These should be in independent hand, at least we trust in the flights" - quotes the Washington Post Dick, developer of the program for follow-up of recording data.
Insurance shall be determined by the expenditure, as well as in the case of damage, in depending on the health status of the customer, and the risk should be estimated too high, the insurance will not yet be completed.
Before the customer was sent to a medical investigation, and the contract was only informed of the results of the investigation.
10 years ago, Dick found an amazing method: based on the identification number of the customer, he refers to the data of the last half of the year from the pharmaceuticals, speaking about which preparations were bought, and the program calculates the disease of the customer and how his health condition is.
For example, if it regularly purchases large quantities of cholesterin-sensitive medications, it would result that its blood feed level is unlikely, which would be automatically resolved in a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in the round - some even define a risk multiplicator, so the insurances must only be achieved by the paper chronics, however, there are smaller difficulties.
One of the depths is that many medicines can be taken for various purposes, such as migration and heat warnings, but also against depression.
The latter is a high risk factor, while not mentioned above.
For the investigation and processing of the data, individual companies have formed themselves, which, before they relate to the data, request the patients for their approval.
In the meantime, they must do this by law, although submissions have not been raised for a while.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory investigations and connect them to the data on the medical consumption, which provides a more accurate image on the health status of patients.
More companies have access to data, and the control of their use will be difficult at the same time.
Although there is a personal data protection law for healthy data, its impact is only on health services and insurance services.
The draft legislation was already presented to the Congress, which could also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard considers that this is too little, so he wants to develop its programme, so that the data can only be forwarded with the understanding of the interested person.
Another question is, of course, that the interested person may probably not submit access to its data, since the insurances are not completed with him.
And so the chickens are left just like the grace of the fire.
Global Food Plan of Marseille
The European Union and India double the trade
After the European Union and India are both leading trade partners of each other, this was the main issue in addition to other global problems at the nineth meeting.
Today, the French and Indian summit is also in place, which is mainly discussed on the cooperation in the Atomic Energy Sector.
However, the European Union recognizes that India is an encouraging, democratic power that should be given in international concerns more votes and communication laws, but the Member States could not even be able to support the continuing membership of New Delhi in the United Nations Security Council, or not.
This question was not discussed last night in Marseille when the nine meetings were held.
The French President and the current EU President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as President José Manuel Barroso and Chiefdiplomat Javier Solana welcomed the Indian Minister Manmohan Singh. It has been taken a duplication of the trade in the next five years, that is to be increased by 100 billion euros.
In view of the fact that the trade of goods was increased between 2000 and 2007 from 25 to 55 billion, this goal is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 civil flight agreements with India have also been legally collected to an agreement so that the air transport will be inflicted in the future.
By 2009, India wants to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to accelerate the package.
The objective is to create an unreasonable relationship between the EU and India: while the Union's partner number is one India, New Delhi is only nine among EU partners.
The Summit was devoted to the global concerns.
The situation in Afghan and Pakistan, with regard to terrorism, both were condemned on the strongest sides, and the introduction of an UNO conference was also urgent.
The Doha round should also be closed, with both sides of the slaughter.
The EU emphasized that it was fixed to its energy and climate programme, which means that the emissions of fuel should be reduced at least 20% until 2020.
This also agreed to India, as well as the proposal to close a global compromise in the future climate, and to reduce the gas production by 2050 to 50 per cent.
The price increase in food should also be combated, so both supports the integration of a international conference on the financial crisis.
The Indian government head visits today the French capital where it will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, it is hoped that contracts to French undertakings are worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of atomic reactors in India.
According to the Agency's notifications, the Agreement should be decided for 15 years.

The disappeared small fleet of the Milliardaire Steve Fossett a year ago
The small aircraft of Steve Fossett, who disappeared on September 3, 2007 on a Milliardary flight over the wilderness of Nevada, was found.
The details are found on a high plateau of 3000 m, in the area of Sierra Nevada Mamoth Lakes between California and Nevada.
However, in the aircraft there was no human rest.
The Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, completed the last doubts during a press conference: "The aircraft has been localized to which a troop was sent. Now we have been safe that it is about the airport with Steve Fossett on the day of his loss."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human rest was found in the airport or near it.
The 63-year-old milliarder was declared to be declared in February.
The American Transport Security Office (Ntsb)gab noted that a number of hours after the vision of the flight was issued a manage that identified the machine: it is the Bellanca 8kcab who lost on September 3, 2007 after Fossett in Yerington in Nevada was started to a 3-style flight.
Last night, some of the personal objects of Fossett from a couple close to their house in the Mamoth Lakes were found in California.
This is two statements with the name Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, Bargeld and a Jacke.
The search for Fossett was established a month after its loss.
The Milliardary had been a place in the history through a long result of records.
In 2002, he was the sixth beginning, as the first man turned the world's ball into a home-slaughterball: a two-week, one-week flight.
Three years later, he turned the world into a single flight without interim with a flight.
Under his own rear, 15445 m is also a height flight over the Anden, but this is a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A Suv that takes from its original design and the special line management, the downloading surface and its clear angles from the squemate scene.
Mercedes-Benz has tried to visit the new breast sector.
As a result of its extraordinary properties, the idea of the Suv Glk will also be unconventional, which will be seen from 17 October in the showroom of Mercedes.
Thus the advertising throat that will be accompanied by the appearance of the new model, also in a new clothing, or in a 3D campaign – this will be a new news in the car sector in Italy rewarding.
A project with a maximum shift which is taken in different phases, which will take the central shopping mile of Maylands, is to be implemented by Corso Como until 15 November.
The first phase will be made from the presentation of the car, where 3D bridges that are distributed near the Corso Como are to give all a special optic: the new suite will appear in its nearly real sizes as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car is so likely to be appeared from the placet on which it is formed.
This will be viewed through the Elumina8 technology of the new glk in different moments in all its details to restore itself as a whole.
Nevertheless, the concern of Mercedes with this advertising is to introduce a new type of authorclame in this most stereotype field.
But will it be possible to travel the interest of the future buyers?
Now it's clear who the Italian hooligans are
You come from the Triveneto – now they risk the stadium ban
Who are only those 150-200 boys and girls, for whom all Italy is angry now? They are part of the grouping "Other Italia", which travels back from the Italian nationality for years and sincerely said that there are no serious problems that have been caused until recently.
There was never one way to counteract with opposite fans.
The origin of the group is in the right environment.
The promotors are out of the Triveneto.
From Verona, Patva, Trieste and Udine.
For these in Sofia, there were other smaller groups from Kampania and Apulia.
They take the tricolori, on which the cities of the militarys appear, but they were distant on Saturday to avoid identity.
Your examples are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, it has now come to the convergence of a truly legal radiical fans, that of Levski.
From the Figc, the Italian fans 144 cards were available for the game: all were issued on name and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were also controlled by the Viminal: no one was under the sofia pathing with a stadium prohibition procedure.
Four fans of the Italian manity, which were already predicted in this regard, were also rejected the Ticket and the travel to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to lead further steps: in this case, the arrested or identified Tifosi may receive a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban which prevents access to stages throughout Europe.
So our hooligans will not put one foot in a stadium.
Good luck.
But now there is, of course, fear of the natives who could follow these fewer than 150.
"This burden must be spent immediately, and that does not give such a behavior the possibility of justifying", says the Viminal.
Therefore, "before focusing on the game of the nationality on midnight in Lecce."
Because in Apulia it is actually a small nuclear of the Italian Ultra.
Tomorrow the Oxford (Sports Oversight), on Tuesday, the cases that can be accompanied by a part of the Asian Asian, such as the secret services that are employed with the problem of the Stadium Authority.
"Duce-Duce calls and the higher right arm during the hymne of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a criminal..."
This is the gratitude of Domenico Mazzilli (especially expressed in no joy), which has been the director of the Observatory for a few weeks (he overcome the posts of Francensco Tagliente and Felice Ferlizzi).
First of all, Mazzilli was the President of Trieste, where Ultras Italy was founded in 2002.
It is true, Mazzilli says that it is not against the law to glorify the duce, but, of course, the conduct of these 150-200 people was a damage.
"I am no sociologue – adds No. 1 of the Observatory – the crimes are raised in the country of their acts.
Before this group had been held in the area, however, it must be considered over what happened and what happened.
But we also talk about the efficiency during the Hymne Mamelis: even if this isn't a crime, they let me, where there is no education."
