Last minute: Our Kozmic visitor Dev Asteroit 2014 JO25
When the sun system's headquarters are shocked and shocked, billions may have more shocks.
The way of these shoes that can be locked or open from the existence of the sun is sometimes able to pass from the world.
The asterist of 650 meters in 2014 JO25 is going to be such a visitor and is going through the world at 14:24 p.m.
We've been talking about these types of news in the past day.
This is not the most important reason for monitoring and monitoring technologies.
We also have the possibility to determine smaller asterotics that aren't previously defined.
For example, in October last month, a astronomy of the World and Month Summit was passed through a quarter of 250,000 km.
And more interesting asterists could only be defined just a few days ago.
So there may be other cosmic bus that we're upstairs.
Think, what do you do if you're gonna tell you that you're going to fall in the entire middle of a asteroid in 20 meters?
In fact, these astronomies don't destroy your store, but they'll probably shoot all the buildings.
This will be because of the shock shocking shocks that are shocking in the atmosphere.
For example, in 2013, astrologed down to Russia was in these sizes and took part of the windows in several cities.
But if you have an asteroid target on 100 meters, you're going up at least 50 miles away from your recommended park.
It is a factor that determines the depth and damage of the claters that will cause the size of the asteroid and the opening of the brain.
Let's look at a few scenarios, according to the symbolization of the European Space Agency.
If a astronaut is a 45-distance degree in seconds, 60 km speed to the Earth, about 250 meters of depth and 1200 meters of clatters.
According to Tarpma Richter, it is equivalent to 6 depressives, and even if you are 10 km away from your body, you're 3 degrees of answer.
The over 50 km is going to wait for the window trails that are cut off.
If a astronaut is over 1 km, the situation will be more decisive.
With the same edge and speed value, a astronomic world is about 600 meters depth and a clatter of 12 km.
I mean, he's turning a seed to a snake, and he'll be destroyed.
If you're 100 km away from the race that has been the results of the brain, you're in your body at 3 degrees of response.
According to Tarpma Richter, it's equivalent to depression in eight massive violence.
The damage to the asteroid depends also on the scope of the area that is not the chemical part of the asteroid.
The values above are given from the senary, which appears in a areas of struggle of a asteroid.
If astrologs are mostly shocked, there will also be a 3 times increased scratch that appears in the refrigeration of the lakes.
66 million years ago, there was something better to the dinosaurs, and there was a disaster of an asteroid over 10 miles.
Asteroit has destroyed 75 percent of the sea and dark lives.
If you have targeted this extremely large asteroide world that destroys the dinosaurs, it will be the most healthy choice to leave the planet.
It's cut into material every day from the universe to the world.
Most of these are in the atmosphere.
Some great heavens in the atmosphere are caused by the slights that are known as a sculpture between the people.
Let's finish our letter with another news.
The work shows that in the past 300-400 years, an asteroid is not expected to swallow asteroid to the world.
I'm sure I'm sure you've lived as a medium 70 years of life.
A flash idea for the medal: 10 million euros!
Gary Medel, who wants to stop the area in the day of the black-whites, sweetly looked out of the name of the Inter.
The 30-year-old futbolist who had been clothing in the Confederation Corporation pub and began to work with Inter in the past days, waits for his future offers.
The Italian pre-style newspapers reported the Journal of the Sport, and stopped, and Visiktash made a 10 million euro offer for the primary free area.
The black-white men who offered the Medel offered were expected to live with the family in Istanbul, as they were expected to answer both sides.
It's very difficult to pay a $10 million to the Medel, Kara Kartal, which has the FFP restricted this idea.
The black-whites first have the probability of the star player to the castle, as they are in Caner Erkin transfer, to the Medel or to a serious shipping service.
He reported the transfer of Negredo in the Fifth Center.
Human rights group published a travel warning for Missouri.
A warning for the people who are traveling to Missouri for the National Colour People's Progress, for the reasons for the separation policy and the racial attacks.
The group reports: "The missionary position of the NAACP Seahat Station, on 28 August 2017, provides special attention to African travels, visitors and Missouris at the last time, with the reason why race-based events come to the area, as indicated in the end of the administration, as well as there is indicated.
NAACCP said that a new Missouri law had difficulty gaining people's discrepancy cases, and at the same time the administration's legal applications would be limited to government, and that the group was active to publish this passenger warning.
"The human rights of men are injured.
They're stopped because of the color of their hands, they're kicked and killed." Kansan City Star said to Missouri NAACP President Rod Chapel.
"We hear the race we have heard before."
Dernek, the first time for an U.S. area, this warning is published.
The group showed the death of Tory Sanders, a political man in Tennessee, against the political students of Missouri University.
Sanders had been taken in the beginning of this year, after the end of the slaughter, with a Missouri police offended, and died under suspicious conditions.
In addition, a new report shows that Missouri Headquarters Darii shows that the whiters of the area are more likely to stop over 75 percent.
Chapel said, "It's been reporting to people to be disappointed and to warn their family, friends and work friends in Missouri."
"Those should be ready to bring the casual money together, tell their friends about what they will pass in this area."
In Missouri, the latest figures of the FBI's reporting of hate crimes were in 2015, which placed the 16th term in the country from the opening of the rape of similar crimes.
The travel advertising answers a new Missouri law that was more difficult to do a case when a employee was purchased, a job or a job.
For texts and Arizona, the United States Civil Freedoms (ACLU) had previously issued a travel advisory after order to arrest local icratics from immigration disorders; ACLU says that it would increase their applications.
Rail warnings are generally published for other countries by the Foreign Office, but in recent times the advisory groups are engaged in the application of the laws and actions in the United States.
Demba Ba's in the Fifth.
13 million euros before the Chinese team transferred to Shenhua and returns back to the Demba Ba, which was slowly transferred to the Shanghai Shenhua and the last period's deployment to the Black Whiteers.
The Kara Kartal, who wanted a detailed health report from the Senegal player last week, was moved from the report from the star futbol.
The black-white manager, who started working for 32-year-old players who thought about the next season of the Chinese representative, stealed the door of the Shanghai team.
Unsubscribed to list
He told the Demba Ba that he wanted to return back to the Black-Blacks because he wasn't written to the list of foreign stages in China.
The Chinese team accepted the 32-year-old player.
The Senegal Futballer is expecting to come to Turkey in the coming days of its official agreement.
Castillo was operated in Trabzonspor.
In explaining the site on the Bordo-Mailli Club, Castillo has passed an artscopical museum operation from the Liv Hospital on the left box, "Professor Dr. Uur Hakler has been proposed the starting of a team together in 4 weeks."
Castillo was defeated from the right backward court in the Dutch team in the Slovakia camp in Heenveen.
The Colombian player, who explained the reason for the treatment, was decided to operate on the basis of the menâ€™s problems that had previously been living.
I'm referring to Barzan!
Barzani, the terrorism organization, was conducted a conversation in the three-year-old period of the Duhok city, which was attacked by the Muslims in Sinkar.
When I was talking, Barzani, who was grateful to arrange IKBY on 25th September, said: "I have no hope that I would be a right and honest country."
We tried all the ways to Iraq, but we remained unforeseen and hopeless.
The past experiences we lived with Iraq have brought us into this situation and we have no guarantee that we can protect.
This is why we must show that we all can fix our goal in the whole world in order to ensure life and security.
I need to draw gold, not a goal for us, but a tool to reach a greater target.
Once Baas Rejimi was destroyed in 2003, Barzani said that the Iraqi government's government had found many promises to the Cuban government, and that he had taken a direct reference to the devastation in Sincar, and he had taken the decision to refer to the USA.
The Barzani, who wants to make a peaceful and democratic framework for the protection and development of the people of the IKBY, said, "It appears with the people that did not want to protect us or protect us like an Iraqi government."
"He doesn't want us to move." He defended his view.
In the fight with the terrorism organization, the Iraqi government did not weapons himself, but a short time with a phenomenon, who was soon established by Chabi, was soon legalized and identified all of the weapons:
Peshmerge wasn't under Iraq's defence system.
He didn't do the Peshmerge that he offered the Baptist Chabi.
Pesmerge, according to the idea, accepts an part of Iraq's defence system.
But when there was no existence in the Holy Chabi, the laws were turned away with all the possibilities.
We don't tell us we're against the age of Zabi.
The Pesherge and Heritage Chabi, the same war in the duty, the law of the Lamb, the existence of the Pharisees and the fight against the terrorism.
These are our deep wounds with our bond.
Terrorism organization, in the history of August 3, 2014, the Muslim was attacked and killed many women and children.
He returned back in 10 minutes.
According to the location in BBC, the airlines of Boeing 777 types of flight in North Korea were in the west of Hokkaido, northern Japan.
The fleet recorded that the fleet was declined 10 minutes ago, and that the aircraft was estimated that it was near to 100-150 miles (100-150 km) away from the flight.
In explanation from Air France, it was recorded that it was not cut off with the flight route and that the word was not a problem in the flight.
When it explained, "Information that we have at this stage shows that the flight is over 100 kilometers away from the flight."
Isn't nothing sacred?
Trump's White House is now being targeted to the Freedom Hall.
They start to attack the most powerful sign of the change.
The Americans know that any of them is so much, that the court, the Saddam Heseyin, who was encouraging in 2003 in the Firdos area in Bagdad...
Stephen Miller, one of the keys of the Trump Regime, knew exactly what he did when CNN destroyed a symbolic form of freedom of law with the President of Jim Acosta.
If you'd be fair, Miller didn't attack him.
And if he did so, he was owner of a full boat, and the Freedom Countries lifted him.
But he attacked his way, and especially 17 years after his memory was completed in 1903, Emma Lazarus's magnificent snake was shocked with him.
"I don't want to talk about the story from here from the beginning, but I don't want to talk to the world of American freedom.
And then you have been added later, and it is not part of the Real Freedom.
Miller's reality is right, but as he said, it's not really about the story.
This seems to be the case of Lazarus's prominent words, but only in these states, some old immigrants are not only invited by some of them, but by the same time: "Yeah, squirre, and/or the distress of the swimming clouds,
There's never been so much on our screens.
Miller wasn't bringing a currency, and they explained that Trump was not welcomed in the United States.
The larger political and cultural war struggle of a heavy shape: this is actually a struggle on the part of the United States.
Lazarus and his death were well aware that the friends who walked in the campaign to put his words into the shore of a very political action.
Heake, French and American council were in a position to celebrate the connections between the United States, representing the development of women in the form of freedom.
Lazarus changed the way: the vision of the woman was no longer slaughtered, and there was a voice.
And it's a very changed name: the mother of those who are forgiving.
A devastating attack against the African Aboriginal is a pheminist pheminist.
And the same Lazarus changed the line of heavy health for a long time and they wanted to change her back.
The great word of the Baptist John for Trump was that in 2010, Rush Limbaugh, was an early neocon of the United States's fire in the darkness of the world, which said, "The freedom of the United States is predicting.
He's got a free chair to move the rest of the world from the United States to the rest of the world.
It's not because you're not going to make a way to the United States."
In a shape that we've been able to buy, Limbaugh actually found something.
It was about the entire shooting opening of the shooting.
He saw Lazarus's magnificent Creator, that is like it was lost in the ships, but the hopeful people were long and most of them appeared after disastrous journeys.
It was really about seeing people who want to see the world to find a place to be shocked and to improve their lives.
He responded to them with the warm response that they needed to hear.
Of course, that's not a perspective that Miller and Trump will find any right.
It is not for them to guide them, but to reduce their hate with the only source of power.
World Champion 2017: Neil Black Great Britain's members of the Slovenia team
Ilidh Doyle remembers the time he can enter two Skots in the Great Britain team.
The United Kingdom Atletismo Athletics Director Neil Black says that 16 personality in the World Champion will lead to the Slow Scotch group to "the strike".
The Slow Attack in Rekor was selected for London for the Sunday 2017.
Black believes that the United Kingdom advisory had to learn from this.
Black said, "We're here and we're trying to understand it, and we're going to work until we're out of your job."
"I'm talking to people in the School Sport Institute, and they're thinking about it.
The Slovenian Atletics think he's about it.
Britain's athlete: I think it's about what they do.
That's the man on the street on the board.
Whatever the combination of the charts is, it's definitely wonderful."
The Laura Mur and the 5000 meters from Sir Mo Fara, Andrew Butchart are struggling for many Skot Athlete Madals, Illidh Doyle was selected as a frame.
"Elidh is a little volunteer.
The captain was incredible to talk." Black.
"If they live, or where they are, or where they are, or where they are, they are, they were very proud and really motivated.
Ilidh's guard was naturally aware, and it was a real fantasy."
The golden madal at the Fifth World Champion, the United Nations, which will strike 400 meters [400 m] in the Fifth World Summit, says it's not known that it's in the British team of 16.
The best world championships in Skotlandia had seven success in 1983 and 2015.
Last year, five British and two European race records are the leader of the Mother Muir.
It's going to be 1500 meters and 5000 m.
The British team tests and the events of the Year's Year's Day are very good, and a other Scotland that runs at 1500 miles.
Doyle remembers the first champion of Lee McConnell in the team.
The team captain says that many of the associates are not only in the team but in some cases, they will be struggling for the madal and struggle with the ends.
"It's been the special part of the captain that the team had been with the other members of the team, so it was a great honor, but your team's friends have played for you and knowing that you chose it was very special for me."
"I'm proud of all the Skots in the team.
This shows how much we're taking.
And they're here as proofed attorneys, and they're here as attorneys that run out of the pody.
When the Captain comes to talk?
Yeah, I think it's okay.
I benefited from the truth that we're so lucky in this case, from my view that there's a World Champion in our house.
So, in reality, we're successful with the reality that we're returning to the Olimpik Stadium.
"I'm taking a second chance to get out there and fight, and there's a wonderful atmosphere."
To prevent the advertisers from Facebook: if you're gonna remove the selectioners, you're not going to do it to the government.
The father of your country had a lot of knowledge about taking a place in a slightly sludge.
Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers did not have a long time to deal with her with the political principles of drinking.
Of course, it was worried.
But they did not support him.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "We can be removed from the middle of the freedom of speaking and we can move to a stupid and silent shock."
This brings me to Larry Hogan, a member of Maryland who has to work more to be like Washington.
Hogan's staff prevented at least 450 persons who make their ideas on his official Facebook page.
The American Civil Freedoms, and the United States, was the case at the beginning of this week.
The government staff did not worry about the need that the case was insecure, and the surrounding orders were fulfild with the answers "Why do you care?".
Many say, "This is just Facebook."
But that's important.
It's particularly important when you're like a Hogan.
This is a Countriesian election, which is very surprisingly popular in a areas in most of the democratics.
It has a second higher rate between 50 country choices.
Hogan isn't a bitch.
He showed the leadership of his home and the princess in a dependance.
It was very skilled to use Facebook as an unique tool to connect with elections when I tried to swallow his head after the chemotherapy.
So it's an unnecessary and most dangerous to prevent people who are managed by the members of the frame, who are officially qualified and paying the dollars of the people.
In a report with the Washington Post, Hogan's woman's word, Amelia Chasse, defended his choice by claiming that it was not more than ordering them.
But it's easy to use the images of trollery or spams or hatred people to attack round words.
The Post talked to some of the real ones prevented by Hogan.
And these are just true people who are talking to the chosen leaders: a teacher, a worker, and a priest; not a trol.
He said he wasn't respectful, thoughtful, and angry.
Popez put a trace of the Gogh's Catholic faith in my share.
Maryland Bowie's lawyer, Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, was not full of hate but asked about his hatred crimes.
The Post's news section writes, "I've made a disappointment of being unreasonable of his hatred crimes and other recent news."
"I don't like to see the idea that, when I do a lot of people in the same matter, soon some of the great cities of a great group of people are a collective effort from my word."
The government's staff will probably be called "spam attack" as "ideal defence".
The Facebook age, the prevention of an advisor, or the removal of an unexpected message, makes it easier to make it easy for a message.
It is more clean than in the old days that the person needs to collect, catch, or arrest and support protesters.
But if it's digital, it's exactly happening.
Hogan, Facebook and other social media are not the first workshop.
President Trump has been sentenced by Twitter users who have been prevented by Twitter.
One of the decisions to be referring to the future was from Virginia last week.
Loudouan Office Administrative Directorate, James C. Cacheris, in Alexandria, has acted as a change in a Facebook election.
In Kentucky, Vali Matt Bevin was visited by ACLU by Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so hard.
In Washington's time, the internet was very similar to the internet's smuggling e-mail.
Among the 1775 and 1800, the number of newspapers was cut into four and the unknown letter writers turned out his leadership.
Even then, Washington had an unknown trol.
"Juricola", "Valerius", "Bellisarius" and "Portius" all the people written letters that were placed under Washington's decisions.
The surveyer George Washington's project, who collected historic documentation, launched the office of the offices on friendship, Ticaret and Seyrusefer Agreements, which were launched in Britain.
But he didn't hold them up.
Indeed, the freedom of warning is the main part of our nation.
The real leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes that the house will be in the Renaissance Club.
The former number of Europe, Ronan Rafferty, is hoped that in the next three days, the Renaissance Club of South Lothian, the Scottish Senior Open, would be in trouble with the 25th building.
Archerfield Links, the Northern Irelandn, who finally gets the leader of Paul Eaux, feels depending on a new mechanical, and the consumer's manufacturer and the CEO's turning apostle to Jerry Sarvadi.
Rafferty said, "I've seen Renaissance Club's building, and we've seen that with this organization I've seen."
The players will see the shooter's best.
Jerry's got a job in the shooting place.
He's proud of a yearly defender of this game, and he's proud of the success of this game.
It's a great show for this wheel."
The English Eals and the European Tour will be struggling to protect a champion in the 32-year-old carriage, although it won Europe and the European Challenge Tour.
He said, "This really feels special."
"I didn't have a chance to protect Extremadura Open because the next year I won was removed from my calendar.
It's nice to return to this part of the world.
It's a great place to play golf.
It's been very special for my wife and my wife Sharon last year.
"It was a time for us to understand the past's special and always with love."
On the start of this year, Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour, turns back to his own game.
This organization will be the first stage to Skotland from the Asset Management Scotish Open since 2013.
Helensburgh man Orr said, "When you fight, it's always a little more understanding."
"You want to do food, but you're also feeling much pressure.
I really got the key to play again, and I played a sweet golf.
"I'm happy to go until that."
These three parties are in the country; the former Masters Championship Ian Woosnam and the senior major Championships Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and the old captain Ryder Coup are located between 6 schools in the village of Sam Torrance, and others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAlister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
There's no payment and a car park; a person's 5 pounds and two or more persons are through one person.

I found the answer.
A "colum" thinks that, with 6 billion, 867 million Turkey Lirhuania, between economists, crowds, energy and, of course, sources, science and technology, environment and urbanity, health, culture, and tourism governments, and more than one of them!
Personal number 117.000.378.
The biggest "propaganda" of Turkey!
Yes, I'm talking about the presidential!
Yes, I'm going to talk about the President of the Diyana!
I'm looking for the questions in my head.
I wonder the real reason why the intelligence has not seen...
I read every article about the message.
No.
I can't find any kind of answer to the problem I'm looking for.
In the beginning of this year...
Indeed, Dianet's work was prepared by the President of 2017-2021 Strategic Plan.
One million library S 600 Mercedes was drawn under the Cyclopedia of ErdoÄŸan.
So there was no problem with Erdozen.
What happened?
You can say, "It's not enough for seven years."
Mr. RÃ¼fat BÃ¶rke, Prime Minister. 17 years ago.
The 11-year-old Navy, who you all know, sat in that quarter.
I mean, the president's mission is open.
I'm back to the question, why did he leave from the shooting?
The job has fallen down...
Kii's closer
And he said: 'Indeed, according to the Glenees, there was no sign of the unbelievers.'
This is the code of the quote: it doesn't have a sense!
"The modernist was found by the Graenex pleasant."
I mean, it seemed unseen innovative.
What does that mean?
The answer was hidden in a round-out shooting journey.
Date: 27th January 2015.
It's not seen, it's going to be done in Taran, and he's going to Iran to join the 29th Protection Conference.
The religious leader of Iran met Ali Hamaney.
And it was a name for the sacred with the believers.
And in the conference he said, "The Messengers are the Fifth Messengers who represent the different ideas and the visions of the Islamic religion."
The purpose of all of them is to determine what Allah has.
Everyone is in a strike way, but they will be the same place.
It is not acceptable to shut up or see the slaughter of the Israeli aid.
A strong investigation, a strike, and a struggle is a reluctance of the substance and the divorce.
In the face of the religion, he was the most harmful behaviour of the religion...
I want to draw the gold here again.
The skins and the sins are the only hope...
"Nobody else can't declare that I'm not able to live as Ishmael understood."
A year later...
The thirty-fourth Selahattin's headquarters from Turkey were cut off.
I mean...
It's not sensitive.
He was going to Iran and the talk that he had done at the conference, bringing him to the goal of "If healing".
The next Talean Conference represented the Turk State - again - was to not join anybody.
He wasn't invited four times since he came to his mission.
The reason was for it, and the Fire of the Dynamics replied: "Don't shut up!"
From the start of 2016 on the Iranian journey, it was started to shoot the shooting of the Invisible Force.
This was the head of the DYB's responsibilities of the headquarters Numan!
He was so angry that he asked: "You're connecting to the Holy Spirit."
I'm sorry...
In the state, there was a difference in the vision of the Senegal.
Theocratic worlds were created in the Swedish Arab and Egyptian Mediterraneans, and they were excited with the Vehhabi-Seleficity in the Aboriginal desert!
Those were the opposites of Iran, even unbelievers.
It was not surprising the words of the crowd Ahmet's unbelievers: "There isn't the danger of Dianet."
"My Lord, you are in the nation of the nation, and you will have a good reist in the Holy Spirit."
"Shere", they used as a symbol of Iran's enemy.
A time of the FETUR, the CIA supported Iran's reaction now runs new names.
The supervisory of the FET...
The photo of a whiskey's photograph was served with a lie with a lie!
Oh, my God!
Who made the biggest warfare in the Mediterranean: twenty-first lighters in my US silver newspaper in Turkey!
In the end...
- The sense is to not bring the suudi Vehhabi-selefi line...
- I don't know what's going on.
Modernist... a religious man has been destroyed by the "Freely Age" of the Full War...
The US cultural imperialism continues to slowly swallow Turkey (behhabi-selefi).
You don't hear the future Dianet works, because the President of Vehhabi-Selefi will be a representative!
"We support the protection of the sovereignty of Turkey."
The Foreign Office came to China to visit the official office of the Office.
The Chief's headquarters arranged the Meeting Meeting with the Chinese Foreign Officer Vang Yi.
Vang, "We hope to participate more actively in the national issues of Turkey."

As regards Chanchay Working Association, the officer said, "In close-scale-research with the civilian, regional and national organizations, the United Nations organizations are not an alternative to one another, the completer."

"Nobody's going to be in the village after the five night."
A remarkable referendum after a 1026-year-old report, which was difficult to play after 1969, was a former Dutch colony that appears to live daily in the mountains of Papua.
The Government of Jakarta, who also protected the strict control of foreign journalists or supervising the organizations of the right to observe, has organized an existing act of independence against the Dutch government.
In 2003, the area was officially abandoned as Papua and Western Papua as a part of the island of New Guinea.

The most important lessons in Osmans, and the thoughts of the world's realities were finally slow and dominated by the government's life, the imparatorship was slow, and the poor.
The most important lesson that we had been cut into the Soviet Union was that the world's conjonement and changes were so fast, that an unexpected precaution to stay in legs.
Because of this lesson, we have made the example of the country's unity from the First World War until today, all your integrity, the integrity in peace.
In order to switch up the global changes in a different approach, we need to leave the clusters back and act in reality.
On the other hand, in the past, the unreasonable campaigns and blood cases will not come to anyone because our democracy is gathering.
Moreover, the smallest mistakes in the world today lead to great and dramatic crisis.
It's the most problematic counterparty that we're within.

Turkey Rhino
World governments that trusted in the future of Turkey have struggled the race of the sacred sacred behaviour last night.
The world's models have been decreased by a model that has been designed in order to ensure the externity of milliar energy.
It's a million of dollars to cut the energy resources of Turkey, and it's been opened by 40,000.
I'm going to be rolled into the system until 2019.
The United States, Chinese, German and Denmark governments have also been renewed by the source areas (YEKA) which have been renewed through the sanitary licenses of energy and natural sources.
In the same case, the subsequent proposal was made to determine the five offerers, first in order to determine the lowest offer.
The first offer was the lowest offer of $4.19.
The explicit dimension is 0.0.1 cents.
After the starting time, Energy, Gold Wind, GE, Senvion and Vestas decided to join the groups to open up-up.
The groups of Siemens, Northex and Mingyang in the open shift.
After the Northex consortium, MingYang-Ilk construction and Siemens-Turkerler-Kalyon remained the last two years.
MingYang-Ilk was 11 times.
The Siemens-Turkers-Kalyon Energy Consolidation has never been used.
Energy and Natural Source Officer Berat Albayrak: The day of record for Turkey.
He's still on a 30-th tour.
The gallery of swimming between two consortiums was the most lowest input group of Siemens-Turkers-Kalyon, which offers $3.48 sent/kg.
In the event of consortium $3.49 at the request of the President of Alparslan Bayraktar, the Minister's Assistant Assistant requested 3.48.
The result of the two hours of E.C.A. has been a world recording in Turkey.
It was a time for $3.48 per cent to the kilowatt offered in this area as the least lowest of the world.
It was located in the previous kilowatt, with $3.84 per cent, and Mexico.
When we look at the 200-year-old workshop of Turkey and Germany, the German company will have a significant impact on the relationships of Turkey and Germany.
Our goals are great.
The net economy and energy costs today appeared to have been able and secured by steps.
I was so honoured that, if there were regional crises in the world, Turkey's most safest region and the world's most safest dimensions of countries.
"In this image we're honouring for 80 million, we're the largest part of Turkey in the last 15th and leadership of Turkey."
Albayrak, who expressed a new period in which she was recasting to the shepherd and the beach, said: "The one of the most important steps of this is one of the ones of the most important steps, the local dimensions of $10,3 per cent, a historical record of $3,48/cent, was achieved with a world record prices at the same time."
I am proud of the name of my country.
The Baptist Albayrak said that the first local production panels were aimed at depressing the year 2018 before they ended up, "We're going to go back to the system of our rainy forms until 2019."
Turbines will be established in five areas.
The company who wins this 5 area will take a thousand megaviating system to build at least 50 megabytes of a refrigerator power in every region.
Semens-Turkers-Kalyon-Chalyon will be over a million dollars.
Each year, with the income of the local rail sanctuarys, the electrical energy will produce about 1.1 million houses annually from the refrigerator.

When the Ar-Ge works a total of $5 million every year, 50 technical staff will work with 80 percent of local engineers.
The manufacture will be set up for 21 months after the manufacture's signed agreement.

Turkers, who won the consortium, said that the Officer of the Administration of the Fund will be 64% of the local production in the project, and 35% will be funded, "We are planned to deliver the financing of the funds from foreign sources, the remaining part of the local banks."
Turker stated that it was a reliable confidence in the Turkish economy.
Kalion Holding Energy Group Murtaza Ata was a more lower idea of the debt from Turkey to thousands of megawatts.
He said, "You're happy from the sweet."
The Siemens Gamesa Turkish Supreme Administrator has shown the operations shown in Turkey for 160 years.

Moore's Ford's murder: Actors have renewed the Irish Line
A 1948 model of Ford Mercury was conducted between a group of monitorers in Monroe Georgia roots and moved to the Moore small Ford Bridge.
Four black drivers and a white driver car came forward to lock a weapon white man's way before they reached the bridge.
He took a long breath from a man with a medium-year-old ringing band, with a man with a swimming snake, and looked carefully in the front.
In the meantime, those who sit down were shocked with fear.
"With, we want it, Roger."
"Let him out of the ground!"
When a young black man shocked through the front shoot, the smells shouted the darkness.
Well, it's not just a rebuilding of this crazy scene that plays on 22th of Haziran.
But when "Roger" was shocked on the dimension of the dimension, soon all of the spectacles strike a very real strike.
Since 2005, human rights defenders return to the Ford Ford pool of Moore, two political couples (Roger and Dorothy Malcom and Mae Murray Dorsey) in 1946 to restore their license by Klux Klan.
There's no one's been sentenced for murder until now.
Tyrone Brooks, who helped to organize a new life, said, "If we see them in our people, we don't know who they were, but one person is not arrested for all these years."
"A leke in this history, but we're loading in our soul."
Brooks 71 years old Georgia was a member of the Congress and a majority of human rights.
It's a re-animation, a dramatic action, and a yearly reminder of injustice to the Monroe community.
He said, "We want to conquer us, we want the results, we want the slaughter, we want to interrupt but we have to first be justified."
"We shall not have the punishment of the legs, and we shall have the righteousness, until he does not have any one."
In the courtyard, on 27 July 1946, one of the victims of Ford's first priests in Moore was put a castle on the body of the victims.
According to the FBI files provided by NBC News, Monroe and its area was more than 50 men's lines suspected.
But one person has never been investigated.
The suspects say that the human rights defenders, both lines, are always well known in all the cities: political and sex.
In Nisan 1946, a Supreme Court of Justice was possible to play before the political citizens in Georgia at the first time at the end of the letter.
According to the FBI, immediately on the same time, the political interlocutor Roger Malcom shooting Barnett Hester, a white landowner, appeared in a wargage of a woman.
Brooks explained that Hester's wife of Malcom was sleeping with Dorothy and that her baby was not his husband.
According to the FBI, Loy Harrison, a white landowner on 25 September 1946, paid $600 to take Malcom to prison.
Dorothy and his cousins went in prison with Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when he came to the Ford Bridge in Moore, he was a line circle in the car.
A FBI report says, "He's understood that Harrison was ordered to set the murders."
"Indeed, there was a secret agreement between the land and the local powers of the land that they hadn't remained in the murder, there was no evidence and hid the identity of their witnesses."
Brooks told me to be slower and sorry.
He said, "I was the right to kill it."
And all of them were killed to send a message to the political people of this people, and they said, "If you have been given a record, and that's it."
About ten years ago, Cassandra Greene has managed the Ford Bridges in Moore, to rebuild the lines.
It's a deep kind of race that many believed that there is no longer in America.
It's harder to turn your views back, and it's harder, but Greene says that's the purpose.
He said, "We don't want to talk about the lies, because this is with all of our hearts.
"I can't develop a relationship with you if you don't listen to me or if you don't listen to what's going on to my head."
The tests of this year began to be held in the hospital, and the first day they filled in a white room (of one side of white and left) and requested the good tested general errors of the Greene game, listened.
Wade Marbaugh works as the help manager of Greene.
The president Klansman played his role for years, but he says it's never easy.
Marbaugh said, "I feel disappointed because it's not me."
"I think it's very important to keep this past alive because we don't want to go back to the time."
The actors who played Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester during the room tried to do their own lines.
Malcom's starting to play with Hester, who was very angry because her wife was sleeping with Dorothy.
"Z...i, out of my people, I said!"
Rascona reacts.
There's a voice to shoot.
And then everyone (also black actors) is cut into the castle.
The green's laughing.
Rascona asked, "What?"
It was, it was surprised.
I'm so sweet?
Greene said, "No, no."
"I'm not thinking of white people's "z" at that time."
One of the black players shocked a stone with "Yes."
"You need to press R."
So it changes the energy in the room and takes a variety of vulnerability.
Everyone's got to do that right, not only for the fault of the game, but for the time of four people killed at the same time.
It's starting again.
This time, the word starting with Rascona N is central and shock.
Nobody's laughing.
Resurrection is a violent and fast end.
Weapon, weapon, and then silence.
A woman shooting at the cenaze stands on the legs of the actors and reads the thickness of Billie Holiday's "Gary Meyva".
One of the two words shrinks the voice.
In the middle of the midst, there are four cents of a voice group that spends out of the eyes and looks at them.
The spectator was almost divided into the level for being black and white.
One pair, he came from New York to see the workshop, a lot of ways.
Brooks took them into the holy journeys of Malcoms and Dorsey, all of them were able to be loaded by Georgia for almost eight hours.
To this point, the murders remained anekdote, but it means stopping the same place as the first one.
The last note of the song is weak, Greene invites people to investigate the approach and the body.
Childs shut up on their hands, false blood and unmovable bodys, and flying each other.
A little kid seems like he remembered himself, "They aren't dead."
A few minutes later, Greene's thanks to the people and'll end up.
The actors strike the line and shut up their eyes.
Bradshaw's playing President Klansman on Marbaugh.
Nick Rascona's player's kissing two of the friends, and the age of their eyes is divorced, the end of your emotional money is on her.
One of the women is fleeting to say "No question."
"We know that's not the one you have in your heart.
You did this for a reason."
Afterwards the guards sit down with the actors.
A white pair from Atlanta is strictly talking about rescue with a black couple.
Deese Duplenski, you're a degree to find words about how she feels.
He said, "This is fearful, hearing evil words, and conducting them out of the people who seem to you, and do so because they seem to you."
"It's what it's done to me, that it's thinking that the lines are still continued," he added, "he calls them only a weapon attack.
It's an interesting room when he eats at the Tyrone Brooks table and tells us the human rights.
He said he started planning the next year.
He said, "It is inspired to see you, because it indicates what we've been covered, but at the same time a teacher."
"On, if you don't get a lesson out of this, it's like it could be again.
Those who do not investigate their past, and those who know their past shall be sentenced to him again.

Child, the games interrupt communication with many people.
There's a debtor, or maybe it wasn't injured.

NEBIL: Family needs to know the impact of children
We can't tell plays that it's harmful.
Scientific research says that the games are useful for the development of children.
What the mothers and parents are playing here, and how they talk to players online.
The family should know how the children have affected and predicted.
There's only two kids in the five years that she said he died from the game in Turkey.
This also shows that the effect of a child's life is not only the effect of the games.
What did this kid have to do with this?
We need to learn it first.
We need to look at the socioology and psychology of the child.
Borsa's 8-month delivery in Istanbul was 50%.
BIST 100 finally continued to continue in December 2016 and moved up the eighth upstairs on September 2016.
So this is the first time that we stored up over 8 months from September 2007, in that period 45.3%.
The 100th end of BIST, which was left back to the world's primary debts in Germany, Germany, England, Japan, and the end of this year, had not left the leadership in some of the months.
On September 7,06% of the BIST 100%, 2.54% increased in the US, Dow Jones ended by 0.81% in England and 0.81%.
In Albania, with the DAX finished in Japan, Nikkei finished the month with the value of the month.
When we looked at the time of the 18th-year period, BIST 100 ends seemed to have an high-comparison rate of the world's debts and developing countries.
According to this year 2016, the BIST 100 index of 37.6 per cent, 10.76% increased by Dow Jones, 5.55% finally with the winner of DAX, 4.55% at the end of Nikkei, 3.21% of the FTSE 100 ends.
The MSCI EM EM, in fact, has produced 23 per cent of the relationship with developing countries.
When BIST 100 ends were seen in historic period, it appeared that similar performances were shown in past.
By the end of the last September 2006 and September 2007, BIST 100, which was completed by the overall value, was 38.3 per cent in this period.
Furthermore, BIST 100 ended between August 1996 and March 1997, in May 1997 and October 9, 1998.
The Mexican Research Director Eren Can Summut, which explained that BIST 100 ends continued in 8 months, recorded this burden by the beginning of the year 37%.
Instead, MSCI prices (EM) have stored 23% of the loading end, and even when we looked at these dimensions, they recorded the following positive differences:
This continues from the beginning of the year of fund in developing countries.
In particular, they prefer countries who have higher fashion in higher search.
Consequently, there is a positive impact on the prices of drink.
Of course, it's a worldwide risking system, too.
This means that the feelings of the risk stage of existing are rare in the index.
In the U.S., we see that in the end of S&P 500, this is a parallel test of the new levels of records that are stored by 11 per cent to the nearest growing.
In the beginning of the year, the US Central Centre (Fed) has a three-face increase in the costs of stress, but the Summut recorded that Fed's vocabulary management policy was very well cut off the midst of uncertainty, and that Fed's price was unreasonable to increase the facility.
In the meantime, inflation in the United States is not still in a degree, it expressed that Fed's expectations would not be slow towards the feed increase, and that the expectations of radiological smuggling would also be very effective in the high prices.
The United States President Donald Trump said that it does not strengthen the wide range of health reforms that would be known as "Obamacare" by Donald Trump, who said, "If you feel that the US economy's expectations are more rapidly increased in the EU's costs for a year, even if it increases the growth of the promises, and the response to the response to Fed's response to a more faster inflation, and in this membership is to strengthen the slightness of the prices of their prices. "
On the other hand, after the opening of Turkey prices, he said that it was a year of inevitableness in 2016, which was in the switch of negative differences and slow sales of BIST 100.
The Summit, who reported that they had seen a strong gap with the source of the news, recorded that the increase in the risk of the slippering of the earliest view could be designed in the form of closing the difference between the other prices.
In addition, he recorded that the BIST 100, testing new records with the levels of 108.600, the following:
In particular, 109.500-110,000 regions are critical in the short-term.
It's normal that the sales of coal will be reached at these levels.
We're thinking that there should be a local or global new story for the prices of $10,000.000.
Now it can make sure the sales of 107.500 supports are passed downwardly.
In this case, if we follow 107.000 supports, I think that you might be able to shoot up to 106.000-105.500.
In particular, it can bring back to the 104.300 level of cutting up 105.500 support, which is 50 per cent of the fibo higher levels of 108.600.
Hem Fed and the European Central Bank (ECB) had indicated that the EU's decisions would be at the world price rate, and that the expectations of government to Fed are clear now, but if they are not waiting for the fair expansion of the public program, it could be possible to make it possible for the US$F.
On the other hand, let's say that this situation is a short-term decline in the lake of the developing country (GOW) that has been able to sell their sales in the decades, "It's going to say what the ECB's originally important."
The President of the ECB, President Mario Draghi, said that the money policy would be discussed in the afternoon, and that it declared that it was up to the 1,1700 levels of the Avro/Dolar Party.
The explanation of the relationship with the monthly 60 billion abroad of the programme would be reduced or ended by the ECB in global terms.
"Original prices can be shown in the name of the country prices that are difficult to access the external background, such as Turkey."
On November 2016, Erol GÃ¼rcan, President of Trump in the United States, stated that the world's feelings were a very serious reality in the opening of the prices of seven years.
The GÃ¼rcan recorded the possibility that the fundamental hope that this racial movement is dealt with is that Trumpâ€™s initial expectations of global growth are increased in the expectations of global growth to make promises of taxes in the first place:
Borsa Istanbul also took place on the head of the wages of worldwide.
Although one of the most important reasons for BIST 100 finances has remained extremely uncontaminated in the country prices that have developed in the past few years, it is important to say that political producers have played a serious role in the way of supporting economic and financial prices.
In particular, we can say that it is a serious impact on the extent of the credit Garanti Fund (KGF), which is active in Mart with the arbitrary shift.
In the remaining part of the year, GÃ¼rcan expressed that positive developments continued to be a major rate of prices and that KGF, which has a significant role in this extent, has a significant role to slow-scale, the BIST 100, even though, continues to be slow towards similar countries prices, but a new channel can also be slowly planned for the rest of the year.
In particular, the 180-day action plan, expected to share details, recorded that credit guarantee funds can increase the limits of the corporate women, such as tax transfers in recent times.
In spite of the significantly developed country centres, such as GÃ¼rcan, Fed, ECB and England Central Bank (BoE), the fact that it continues to slowly slowly decline the extents of the political costs, and that it will start a remarkable time for the countries in developing, the ECB's programme will be financed and increased by BOE and Fed's funds.
The GÃ¼rcan reported that in the event of the independence movement in the course of this year, which was very critical, could continue to the levels of support of 101,700, 100,000, 99, 200, 99,200 at the time of the decrease of this region.
In the state of the 108.605 degree of the 108.605 degrees, which is the degradation of the existing higher shift, it explained that there could be a decrease between 110,000-112.000.

In the month of the presidency, the EPA has explained that the Ozone decisions were delayed until October 2018, and that these decisions are decreased in various areas of the country and that it is difficult to resolve the standards of air quality.
A case was opened by most of the 15 areas of Democratic Democracy and the Columbia Division on Friday that this effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump's government continues to call for the re-education of Trump's economic growth as part of a larger day by the former President Barack Obama.
However, these efforts were towards the impact of democratics and more employees in the health of the people.
The EPA's website says that the ozon's air cell can "batter the functions and can increase the cell symptoms like a skin."
He gave the Golden Message...
Shut up and transfer!
The Vice-President of Fikret Orman, the Dutch footballist Jeremain Lens and the stopping transfer of Bein Sports.
The idea of the Goldman said these...
There's no surprise on the transfer.
We don't have a lot of transfers, it's shooting.
Now we're gonna stop, and we're going to make a transfer.
Championships have Ligi games, we're taking a good rule.
We're gonna have to transfer the bridge.
10 million euro is very easy, but we don't have such a bunch.
If we come to the wheels we say we're gonna transfer, we're not going to die.
I'm not possible to make information about Lens.
We're an open company.
Welcome to the end of peace.
Is there only 30 August's a swimming sight for a festival?
The Ankara State has continued to reassure the need for "reconciliation" in August, and the conferences continue to prohibit all the activities of the community.
When the law entitled "true Activities" is placed in Ankara 7.
The Great Ankara Festival continues.
The CHP Group Chairman and Ankara Military Levent sky, explaining the SOUCE, said: "The word of the influence of the laws of August 30" and said:
It's seriously complicated.
Even when the options were to apply what decisions...
The government's mission is to create areas to celebrate the ladies.
CHP Ankara Military Murrat Emir said, "You have the security problem of the Ankara, but there's no security problem for the organizations of the heavens."
The Millennium Unlawful League, Ivan Nazliaka, moved the law to Meclis.
Nazliaaka, who proposed the answer, said, "It's not clearly appearing to the council of the ACP and the Ataturk enemy? How do you think to stop the millions who will be blessed in the areas of August 30?
"I learned from Edwina.
The Deputy Shener, who continued the case of divorce with Abraham, was in the first day of the Prosecutor, the Ancient of the Honour.
She offered the case to Edwina Sponza, who was shocking the shooting case, to judge the photos taken together with Sponza and Kutluay.
Sositic Sponza was heard in the crime of Reese Shener, "Demit, I took my special photos into law."
"YES ON THE WORK ON THE WORKS"
Shenner, who met the Nice Delicatessen, after this last development lawyer, came out of the mechanic when he saw the journalists.
Shener, who was so excited, was remembered about the photos of Edwina Sponza, "God has entered the house."
The original error is about the Sponza's complaint, but it's not true.
He said, "We've got everything in our hands, we've offered to court."
Shenner, the journalists, "It's been aware of the relationship with your wife, Sponza."
"Why do you know?" was a great surprise on the question.
What?
How?
Shener, who said, "I don't know." He said, "I would believe in my head or in my hands."
And before the journalists asked, "Do you not hear?", Shener continued to say, "No."
But I didn't believe anything like that.
It was normal, he was there, there was nothing to doubt.
Madam, when I sent everything to my hand, I've learned everything, I mean...
"What was the man who sent his digest Sponza?", Shener, who answered the question "Yes"; the photos and the writings offered to the court were well confused with the heads that Sponza sent to him.
Sponza told Abraham that they were mounting with the Kutrusians before.

Sayer: We stolen in Turkey within the hours of Ambargoya
Katar Economi and Ticaret Director Ahmed Bin Jassim Al Thani indicated that they wanted to thank the people of Turkey.
Al Thani: "I thank you for your gratefulness and for your support."
My brother's cousin Recep Tayy and ErdoÄŸan's welcome to the Catherine Embassy.
Catastro-economic has dismissed.
In many countries, economics are safely influenced by our economy.
We need to work with our power to have Katar's debt and strength.
We've been cut in a large range because of Turkey within the hour of ambargo against us.
We don't have any precaution about it now.
Natural sources in us have supported the economy of Katar.
We did not have an impact on Turkey, which was slaughtered against us, and which was contrary to the laws.
Today, Katar is still natural and LNG continues to make my production worldwide.
And he said, "We lived a 30% increase in our injury, not in our natural weapons."
Al Thani, who states that fraternal relations between Katar and Turkey continued to work in all areas, said, "In our business case, a $554 million was the first part of $554 million."
The decisions that were taken at the last time have played an important role.
In all sectors of Turkey's products, the outcome of the catar market is very important for us to accelerate the access of the resources from Turkey, which makes a lot of substances.
And he said, "I thank you very much for your fair attitudes against us."
The rate of the last events is 300 million TL.
The Chairman of the Can Aks, who had made 116 million TL insurance firms on September 18th, has been reported about 12 million library 800 deficiencies in GÃ¶kova on 21 July, and which 22,8 million library circumstances were found in Istanbul on 27 July, and that the last three cases were found 300 million libraries.
The calls "30,000 lira injuries in the aircraft that the Kasko has created full insurance, is the shock of $10,000.500 lira, the shock of the camera is on the shock of thousand lira."
"Depressedly, it was a problem for medium-sized matters, that is 6 000 lira."
The economic loss sectors, which are shocked as a sector of economic expenditure, claims that every four person's 3 is not the insurance of the truth, that anyone who has not been insured, and that each three is not the insurance of the case of 2 persons, said, "The cause of climate change increases the natural risk."
As a result of the low insurance rate in our country, our citizens and governments are increasing the risk of faceing serious problems.
It should not be left over the government.
The insurance policy is not so valuable as it is, but the security is not only a sector that is harmful, and it is also a risk management.
It is very important for our humans and our country to increase knowledge and insurance.
The Blood Game's calls "writes the insurance in general conditions in the 5th workday, and it's finished last night."
"It's gonna be safe?" she said, "If the general conditions so long, it's two years of time at Ticaret Act."
"I don't have to do a panic with the insurance, I can't pay any company."
That's what the German mechanics looked like!
In a period of increased disasters between Turkey and Germany, Turkey was concerned about the winning of the German Siemens company of the first Rhine Energy Renewed Areas (YEKA).
The German media announced the words "Alman Siemens wins in Turkey."
DWelle Turkey said that YEKA's imagination was made by Siemens-Turkerler-Kalyon Consortium, "Consortium is going to make an advertisement of winding tests on a million of dollars."
In the news of the news, the number of firms that have been cut from 8 to 2 of the Chinese Mingyang Consortium, which has remained against the Chinese Mingyangs consortium, was reported on the occasion of starting the 30th tour of the 30th anniversary.
After the explanation, energy and natural sources have been found in a decisive explanation of Turkey and Germany's relationships.
Indeed, the German company was aimed at the winning of Siemens, and we can tell that this image is a major message to the world.
And when we look at Turkey and Germany's historical work in 200 years, I think that this result would have an important impact on the relations with Turkey and Germany.
I was very proud to putting the start of countries that could be made by Turkey and the most safeest expansion of the world if they were in the world.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko are first meetings, maybe seeing a crowd.
For six pounds, Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia found the first day of the day with each other in the nearest future.
The unnewed World Boks Championship, Garcia, walked in cordoru, and the World Boks Organization was in the rooms of Lomachenko, as long as they welcomed Lomachenko.
On Saturday at Showtime, with four old world championships on Tuesday, after Adrian Bronner, the best five members of Garcia's slaughter, and every two slaughters.
Garcia turned his right hand and said, "What's going on, champion?
Good luck to you."
Lomachenko will defense his head against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. in ESPN.
On the other hand, when the photos were posted, the adviser of the Egyptian Climate would be the potential museum between the fighters.
Garcia recalls: "I'm a old shooter."
"I went to the burner load (140 pounds) but I'm not so big.
For 140.
I want to get back to the kitchen.
He's got to pass on the shooter (135 pounds) then we can fight.
That's what he wants to do.
Let them give it."
Lomachenko.
"You need this battle."
Climates asked whether it should be in 'to where and where'; with Garcia' (37-0, 30 nakavt) to set a history in a further writing, and to fight 135 pounds in this year with his strategy; Garcia is interested in fighting Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell with the gallery of Jorge Linares-Luke.
Garcia said, "It may be in the fight and watch because all the sides want it." And then he explained what the best channel offers.
We're such names.
No other names do not create this very interest.
When they are ready...
Garcia Lomachenko said that he was able to join the Saturday.
But Lomachenko was struggling to Garcia in a lot of joy, and he thought that Rioside's three champions looked like a "more late" champion, "I'm sorry, Mikey... you wanted to be incarcerated."
Garcia said he was boks after showing your shooting power before the room.
Everybody said he felt the moment was created for his own meetings.
"It's a fight to be done.
Another fight will not create so interesting and telling.
Garcia said, "I'm so happy to work with this."
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best fighters and that's Mikey.
It will be a great battle."
Turk remains from Russia to America
White Saray is not thinking of the facts to affect the Moscow's bug buildings, but I do rule to Russia, they can increase the quality of these people.
That's why the debt increases.
Kremlin, who worried about the fact that I made the Western dimensions, was thinking of being drawn from the projects, rather than the building of the bonds.
Swiss company allseas Group, which planned to reach Turkey under the Karadeniz, has built its error on the request of Gazprom.
Reuters Gazprom also wrote that a paralel second bond is started to the Turk Corporation to make more gas to Europe.
The new results of Sweden's current age evaluation were explained
The latest results of the evaluation tests in Swedish age, of course, were that over 80 percent of those who participated in the tests were over 18 years old, but everyone does not believe the truth.
Sweden's Military Court of Justice and Medicine Dairesi began to do the tests early this year.
The tests were scheduled to make the age more correctly evaluated after the age of Swedish Dairesi (Migrationsverket) after the age of age.
He sent the 6880 case test until today and explained the outcome of 2481 individuals from the midst of March to March 31, 2017.
In 25 cases, the Adli Td and the Medical Daires trial was "possibly on 18 and probably on the 18."
In 432 cases, a person was "probably under 18."
Tests were made only in cases where a person's age is suspected.
Judge Tj and the Medical Dariat, John GÃ¶ransson, has been guarded by the results last months.
The local said, "We don't see a great difference in statistics, we have to keep the figures very much."
It doesn't mean that those cases who aren't judged to have a 18-year-old age are very lie about the age of the civilians.
In May, he explained the outcome of 581 tests and said that 442 situations were shown that those incumbents were 18 or even larger.
When he examined the results of the 581 times of the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper, 243 times were clearly engaged in this year.
In some environments, the ill-educated method of evaluation of the 20-year-old teeths and to make the MRI ranges, and then analyze the dentists and radiologs.
One of the birds, the Carolinska Institute, who evaluates the biodiversity of people who have been able to do so, is more premature than normally or passing on the slope, is also the carolinska Institute, and Claude Marcus.
"I have reasons for thinking about this, and I think that's not the one that uses a kind of measurement.
It's a doubt to make a decision of biological life so.
If we don't say it, we should do it like it."
Whatever, the Court of Justice and the Medical Dairesi defended the truth of the Pantsson tests: "You can say the risk that a child isn't injured as an adult.
The largest risk person is under the age of 18, and in this case 10 per cent of the risk."

So we've done this with your own hands, and we've got information in the form that it's counted here.
They're still gonna stop here with the reality.
The war said that Recep Tayy and ErdoÄŸan were waiting for my joy.
It's Pantic at the watch.
The Ukrainian fish writes that a 25-year-old Shrp futballer, who does not enter the castle in Dinome Kiev, could be bought in the red club.
In the Futbola country, Pantic, Spain, was shocking the forms of Villarreal, Cordoba, Eibar and Alaves.

A total of $1,59 billion.
On the evening, the Soviet National Congress was a statement to the Democratic Party, who was a different democracy instead of renewing the country of the changing party, instead of trying to stop it.
The RNC woman said in the beach that Ronna McDaniel CBS was born, "The only 15-year-old control of the legislative mechanism is only the last refusal of the Vali Justice's hearing and positive party who has not found an unilateral message."
I'll do the best for Turkey.
It's the third of the Olympics, the Turkish recursion.
She was born in Cuba, but she called Turkey to the F.Bache.
In 2013, Turkey was a civilian, and he was putting a mile-million...
First, Europe's Championship, and then the threeth of the Olimpiade...
Now one of the most important hopes of Turkey in the World Atletics Championship.
Jasmani Capello, a 400-metre-fellowship, talked to SABAH before the champion starting today.
When you were young, they didn't want you that they don't like their degrees in Cuba.
You've developed your anti-training.
Then they called, but this time you didn't go.
A smuggle thinks he chose Turkey for your money.
What are you talking about?
The latest thing I remembered to the Cuba is that I was out of my thousand team.
I couldn't say that the events that I've lived were a line that I've lived.
Then I came to Turkey with the invitation of the Fenerbah Club.
I'm coming to the Milli team, and it's in the Fenerbage.
I'm offering an offer for the calendar.
I opened a new page with Turkey.
I lived in my youth, but after the possibilities offered to me in Turkey, I signed the important success in Rio and Amsterdam.
I'm not suffering to do the best in the World Atletics Champion, and to win a different memory.
You've been crying at a press meeting last days.
Do you tell us why?
Whenever Turkey has a question about having me, I'm thinking about my childhood, I'm not going to get out of the Cuban Military team of 23 years.
And of course, people in Turkey are close to me.
When I win a golden madal in the Europe Championship in Amsterdam, I felt the same thing.
I didn't have my eyes.
I'll thank Turkey for the opportunity to realize my dreams.
I'm so happy that you belong to the Turk Million team.
I'll be here until my legs run.
You said you could be Turkey's love before.
You're with a Turkey now, and you're going to Cuba together.
Do you want to share them alive?
The greatest number of quietness to be with a Turkey...
When I face cows, I'm peaceful...
Turk girls have relationships.
Your girlfriend's helper at the same time.
You're together all the day, are you confused with the matter?
He eats more sweet than me.
(He's laughing) I haven't said it's very hard, but when I eat, it's confused.
My anti-trainor, Massim Matrone, is often in the warnings, but I know that these are for my goodness.
How do you want Turkey to eat you with your friend?
Turk women eat so nice, but my friend's doing better.
(Laughter)
ANNEX TO THE EXPIRATION
My antrainer in the Cuba wasn't believed to me.
He took other young people in my place.
After we wind the madals in Turkey, we met in Cuba.
He looked at my face and showed me to the young sportor with me, and said, "I'm here, I've grown him."
I'm just laughing to her.
SINIRM SUBJECTS
It's a wonderful matter of your eyes in the morning...
I'm just going to use for concentrations.
When I saw my relationship with the world, I'm going to spend the wall on both sides.
I'm just on the finish line and I don't see anything else.
WHY WHAT THAT THE HYECANY Tokio 2020, what is the first thing to think?
Felix Sanchez...
In 2012, in London's Olympicats, he wins the golden madal of the 35-year-old age.
And I can do 33 years old in Tokyo, not why.
TURKCLE DESTEC
"We believe that Yasman will represent our best representation in this champion and in the best way."
We're talking about all our actors in London.
He said, "We will continue to support the development of the treasure attorney, and we will continue to make greater success to our country."
Coe, it's for Russia for the doping scandal.
Sebastian Coe, a civil athletic leader, regretted the Russians as a skandal, but he shocked that the time was not right to reconcile the spora country.
The Russian Atlantic Boss, Dmitry Shylakhtin, said that it was right to the IAF Congress that the country had been sporded and that he had decided to fight with a doping.
He said, "I'm sorry of the golden and golden madals of all the attorneys who have hardly taken them in the fight."
The IAAF Congress against his evaluation was used in the course of the law after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) reported on September 2015, following the proof of state-related doping relations in Russia.
The President of the IAAF said to the representatives of Coe, "I think it's a very great answer today, a very pleasant presentation."
"The Congress and all the Congress has been glad that Russian Federation has accepted her, that he has shooted a lot of shooting days, and he did everything possible to make the Federation again."
Coe said that Russia would accept his re-accepted criteria.
"I think that it's a very fascinating day, and I think that you're taking the way, but the Congress supports the suggestion that Russia's rights are not right to be put."
"In the next few months we have to do everything to normalize this situation.
Our guideline has always wanted to divide clean actors from the perfect system."
The eighth Russian attorney that meets the IAAF criteria will be able to strike in the World Atletics Championship that starts on Tuesday in London.
The IAAF's mission's head of the Rune Andersen market said that Russia still did not meet many criteria on the part of the rights.
After a presentation made in London in the IAAF, he said that the medicine test was still inadequate, and the illegal antagonists still worked freely.
Don't lie from the US to the JPG tank.
The United States Ankara Majority explained that the war in Syria wasn't a tank.
It was lied to the JPG tanks and weapons that hundreds of dragons were sent to the YPG.
The apostle said, "Explain of the relationship with the wrong news about the rings of the Suriye":
In the last few days, in an unreasonable newspaper, the US, the Syrian tanks, and a hundreds of weapons are sent to support the YPG to support the JPG.
These news are when some of the basic realities of the situation in Syria are not seeing.
The United States did not have any group that fights against Deasha in Syria.
The United States, firstly, supports the Syrian Arab Coalition (SAK) unions of Syrian Democratic Forces (SDG).
The SAK is fighting to purify and rebuild their homes from the Syrian Arabs.
President TDTA Ermut: the year before the foreign switch will be over
The President, Arda Ermut, told him that 55 percent of all the amounts of the last year came after the month.
For the 15th September, Ermut, who said, "It would have been increasing, shooted, shooted."
Maybe if these conditions weren't there, we could see more increase in the regional developments.
We're more hopeless of it for the next year.
It's gonna be a more brilliant year in terms of sweating.
In the first 5 months, we're going to increase 11 percent according to the first five months of the last year.
But we don't find it enough.
"We hope it's too much." He used his expressions.
Ermut, who said, "With global, it does not love us, if the regional developments are necessary, but not to love us with an inquiry."
Ermut continued to remember that 75 percent of Europe's estimates were normally from 2010 to 2010, and it continued to say:
This figure has dropped by 66 percent.
At the same time, Asia's age went to 7,8 per cent of 2 per cent.
Russia has grown.
When we tried to do this, the United States took some problems between themselves.
There are good relationships with all Turkey; especially Swedish Arab and Katar two important actors.
But the problems between these two countries are worried about us, and they also enable the factors to take a little more to their decisions.
Not only in Turkey, but in this way we may live some late.
Arda Ermut remembered that last week some events were experienced in Germany, but the government, especially the Cumhuristan Recep Tayip ErdoÄŸan, had shown the real reaction to this situation.
When we talked about the employees of countries in the most serious political crisis, the Sudan's reaction of ErdoÄŸan was: "It will be between governments, not exactly among the peoples."
Twoth, these people came and made a shooting in my country.
It's not a difference between the Turkish companies for us.
Only when we have a smaller problem, they'll come to us, we'll solve.
"We will not allow them to be able to be astray."
Ermut: "We can give it security at our time."
You will see that no German enterprises, nor some of the countries we live in a political manner will experience a challenge.
Instead, we're going to do what we're going to do on the point to increase the rates from these countries.
We think it's gonna continue to increase the amounts from here.
Of course, political progress may sometimes affect environmental aspects.
"We will make our hands down on this point, and we will do what our manufacturer will do with the goal that it does not affect the media."
President Ermut told that after the only swimming road strategy, Turkey began to see a big interest in China, but if the problems in the Purfez were resolved, it was expected to be the biggest increase from Kurfez.
"In the relationships with Germany, we've been depressed by this relationship, we had a deal because of this event, we're fleeting." Ermut, who used his statements, recorded that the company that came and followed.
Ermut: "There is 10 percent of the German company in our portfolio."
So the company that we've seen from all the world is almost 10 percent from German companies.
Some of these companies that are still prepared for me in Turkey.
The man's going to grow or have a matter, and he's open to us as a project.
"The German companies, therefore, are still a major part of our daily work."
Ermut, who had to be careful of all the government authorities during the time that Turkey has been made, said that the matter was inevitable and that it could affect the smallest bad communication.
Ermut told them that the ones who had experienced in the last 2-3 week were a good lesson:
It's always different on the day of the politicians.
We've always seen this, economic relations always makes political progress a way to go on.
Germany will continue to remain as our important partner and a important dimension.
Because it's still ready for a lot of expenses in Turkey.
The election day in Germany also increases this kind of degree.
And when they pass, I think they're going to be a little bit more.
In particular, the Swedish Arabs takes attention to not explaining the negative two countries.
In Netice, a manufacturer in Turkey makes an allocation to the world's markets with targets.
So it isn't the Swedish Arabian, but it's been processes to slow up the slowness of the area.
But yet we're still talking to these manufacturers.
My charity view, the manufacturers are waiting for a decision that they can take more faster.
We don't have a Swedish dictator, saying, "I see indefiniteness of the crisis between Turkey and Swedish Arabia, and I'm out of here."
On the other hand, we have a Swedish manufacturer who continues to live in Turkey when we are doing the tatian here, and we have a seeing with us, all the processes we have followed.
Arda Ermut, remembering that the United Nations coming to Turkey the last year is $12,3 billion, "I'm sure we're going to pass it this year.
"When we're going to pass, these regional developments will affect global uncertainties."
When Ermut, who states that the effects of the skin could be more limited, has been increased by 11% in the first 5 months of the first 5-month period, which is possible to protect it, "If it doesn't make a bad progress, I'm surely going to close it better in the last few years."
Ermut, logos, health, fintechs, science, petro-chems, food, energy and implants showed new information that can be made available in the fields of gender.
For the next months, Ermud, who struggle that they will make his hearing, said, "We may be an anonymous in terms of the time."
It's not a million dollars, but I'm a big amount.
"Introesan may be estimated."

How will Futbol's original rules affect Neymar's way to Paris?
The rules that European football clubs prevent unlimited strikes will not prevent the world's transfer from Spain to Paris-South Germain from Barcelona.
Pre-style Championships can result from the EUFA, the EU, which has the power to lose the Ligi tournament teams, which controls European games.
In 2011, the EUFA Financial Judge Rules will mean that it will be necessary to demonstrate that Neymar's transfer is deeply funded in life.
It paid 222 million avro (262 million) to purchase the secret Brazilian contract in Nepal, and he will judge ten million dollars in Nepal in the year.
A few ways of Neymar's way to France are:
When my team is taking the look at the money from the catalogue family, he can sign the PSG Neymar and obviously pay him to the other stars.
It allows the clubs to take the player a lot of money, but they have to prevent it with the sources that they are able to save.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after the EUFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that the clubs who had a success have been actively inquired and that if banks or owners take their support, they were under the false risk.
In 2011, FFP began to observe their damage instead of swallowing the responsibilities of the clubs.
My change means that Roman Abramovic's first models used in Chelsea in 2003 would be more difficult to make a club, make high-speed and create a global market.
During the three years of FFP evaluation by 2018, the clubs can damage 30 million April.
Although the Platinum was unlikely removed from the President in 2015, he still decided to dismiss the EUFA's position by Aleksander Cefer.
Andrea Traverso, who took FFP in EUFA, said last week to the Association Press: "It is sure that FFP is not dead and we will strong the rules to move."
Whatever the PSG Neymar's purchase will be paid as a collective collect, but it can be able to spend the contract on the contractual basis.
Neymar signed a 5-year agreement, so that transfers can be shown as a total of 44.4 million April.
In 2014, the first FFP museums, PSG and Abu Dabi, saw the application of the most weakest museums in Manchester City.
The PSG was then decreased to the punishment of 20 million April 60 million (when 82 million dollars for time) and the Championships were ordered to limit the Ligi team with 21 players instead of 25 normally.
The EUFA is encouraging to fund editors in the way that they are able to swallow their income with the clubs.
Although a catalogue company can be able to sponsor, if the value of the sponsor is decreased by the standard prices of the value, EUFA will not allow it to be valid.
In 2014, the EUFA was judged that the Katar Turizm Authority was shocked by the PSG sponsority.
One of the winners from Neymar's PSG was reported to be paid by the 2022 World Coast Organization Committee.
But PSG and Katar 2022, Neymar would be a apostle of the World Summit, which could be evident by the EUFA editors.
I have done in the past PSG, and it means that EUFA will be more careful for the testing of the rules.
They said that the sacred day of the people who have been engaged in the EUFA is not in a prestigious meeting with the PSG on the transfer of Neymar.
Because they weren't allowed to talk about the situation of PSG, they talked to The Associated Press.
The last posted account shows that in PSG 2015-16, 542,4 million avoids were more than 10 million avros.
The last year's accounts aren't still released.
PSG hopes that Neymar's development will increase their sponsorship agreements, donations and shape sales.
The club is expected to increase at least 30% of the cycle after it was signed.
He tried to prevent the Spanish license that Neymar's path of the PSG was hindered by one of the biggest players.
The president of La Liga said to the Spanish newspaper Javier Tebas, in August that Katar's PSG's owners, "This is a clear "small doping" with the club and the government.
Arsene Wenger, who belongs to a American sport club, shares the concerns of the funded by a state of La Liga.
Wenger's finger said, "It's been a result of the ownership, and in the last 15 years, the futbol has completely changed all the plants."
"If you have a country club once, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the Financial Fair Play, because a large player may have different ways to represent a country or to be interested in different areas.
Insurance's prices' prices
According to TSB's data, insurance sector has been damaged since 2006.
In 2015, 2,35 billion TL in 2016, only 19 million TL was loaded.
Borsa Istanbul sees the work of Axigorta, Anadolu security and sun security.
The teams speaking at the meeting of the first six months of 2017, which was evaluated by the TSB, suggested that the 11-year damage in traffic insurance was reached by 7.3 million TL, and that the sector had been implemented by 2.3 million TL in this year.
In this year, the teams who say that the 2015 figure would be shocked, and they took attention to the injury of other branches in 2012 and 2015, "This means that it means that we also increase the cost of the citizens' matters.
"In the sector, 75 percent of the foreigners have been financed in a sense of bad driver."
The calls continued:
We don't have an expectation from the trail, but when we look at the last 11 years, we're not showing that we're cut off any year.
"We accept it, but we're going to keep our hope that we can be able to move with other politicians."
When the damage of other products in the trail has led to maritality, the teams said that dramatic price increases were: "In the financial security in 2012, 30 percent increased prices, almost two in 2015, we wrote the greatest damage of our history."
"In a world that the prices were so increased by the end of 2016, our wife was only 19 million TL."
The teams who said that the next year they expected to pass the free tariff, "We're going to cut the price of the good driving in the Serbiest tariff and apply high prices to the bad drive."
"He's generally looking at the Hazine, at the last time he's going to be."
The Hazine Municipality indicated that the majority of the maintenance of the raw traffic insurances in 2015 was a major impact on the sum of the population of 12 Nisan's slow prize (tavan price).
In this regard, all the tool groups in relation to the difficult traffic insurance policy have been defined as the priority of the relationship with the difficult traffic insurance in the face of some groups.
On the other hand, the "Risky Securities Aviation" has been implemented for the high-scale frequencies or for the groups of tools.
The primary and dangers that are related to traffic insurance policy on the aircraft are shared between the security companies.
These insurers will be identified by the first Hazine Deputy.
In the first 6 months of 2017, the calls said that the first year of the primary production was 11,5% decreased in the same period in 2017, and the number of Polish increased by 4.9% to 8.6 million, the inflation also had been expected by about 30% of the traffic policy.
The teams say that the traffic will bring the women in other branches again this year, "It's not possible to cause this damage with this tasting price.
He said, "Why more can it be able to move this sector?"
The teams who say that all the companies of the sector have been financed by 9 billion TL, only two million TL traffics have been financed in three years, "What is the financing of a bad driver, why do I feel that my thousands of people finance the bad drivers in Turkey?"
"We're trying to tell Hazine, on this point."
On a direct question that foreigners came to the Turk security sector and come to the point of deterioration, they said, "They have not yet come to that point."
They're expecting to make more expenses to Turkey, because when they slow down six polices in the Netherlands, this is in Turkey.
"In fact, there's a place where Turkey must grow in real meaning." and he continued to say:
That's why they're not dismissed from here.
However, every year the company has a smooth inheritance, although it uses to increase the company by leaveing the whole shooting.
According to TSB data, in 2016 the primary production in the sector was 40.5 billion TL, in the first half of this year, 12 percent increased as 23.1 billion TL.
The calls said that it wouldn't be completed by 15 percent in the primary production of the sector.

Notalji is loved with the "There's Heat American Scriptures" and "One Detective"
So for 80 blue days, for the time of the characters in the 1990s, for the age of the gate in the 1990s (It wasn't the MTV-time of the State) and the stars of Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, before they continue to do more things, the story's version for all.
As a cultural product, this is that we're still remembering Facebook's age, and that we're swearing the theory.
But as a series, it's like it's lost.
"The First Year of the Camp" was unexpectedly, and it wasn't just because of the absorption.
As a result of the mixture, it was impossible to recover the past section of the age of the age (the playing of the abusive kids of the second age) in the past.
A adult playing adults now is less emotionally, and the 90s of the "Food Salanta El" films are more rastic, the paradise paradise.
On one point, a Apple Powerbook, some of the only counting patents, and "more of anything else from 1991."
It's the same as most of the storys.
He still forgot Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still didn't lose the guard.
And now, George H. W. Bush has another plan to be able to do with Ronald Reagan (which Mr. Showalter).
They call the best part of the sweet like always.
Especially, it's very nice to see Mr. Rudd, who has the six-doers of Matt Dillon's sweet smells, that he now seems to be a mood of Andy, who is the oldest popular son of the school.
It may be a rastic racist, which makes it powerful, ( "Seven Up!" series, which I'm thinking that I've been a fantastic outcome: "The Slow American Scriptures: the Year of the Year" that the friends in the last scene, "The North American Hot Scriptures" are enabled to see the galaxy of the film.
This is a different kind of nostalgia in Amazon, the "The Americans" resurrections, the movie "Strong Bom" and the East and the "GLOW" iconography against the Western Great.
Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, who did not have Rhys Thomas's code, looks like a TV found: two British police officers are the real, ateism and the Marksist-Leninist drama of Roman police friends in the 1980s.
He plays Gregor curt and idealist Iosef, Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Diploms, is made by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, English Dictionary Channing Tatum.
That's a very light idea.
But it's not too much than a idea.
There's some nice visual misconditions.
The artist's channel is that between these are Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny, which is a good way for playing "seseas who knows."
But it's so named that a prostitute is like the reality of a prostitute that (Reagan's mask), mostly it plays like him.
I don't know how to pass six long sections, and it's not enough fast or often.
When Gregor and IÃ³sef continued to visit the American largest men who had a hamburger, like a skin on the lobby, and they could make it slower to a more long time in the propaganda.
The fantastic communist's message may turn to the Western culture to eat as a series of things.
Instead, Roman creators were unrighteous: We do this in our past and indeed to them.
The FETUR's horse.
The English government has seen that our family is blessed and offered by the experiences of the yearly experience.
The Supreme Ombudsman has accepted that the British Government has been fully dependent on this family, and that it has been in great services.
I'm sorry that the English government acts intelligent and carefully about this offer that he has covered with his own hands, to investigate and to take care of everything.
As we try to understand the FETOM, the initial point of the Hashachi organization is to be a difference in the United Nations that appears in the emperorist era and moves with shocks.
When I have to take care of the first movement in this mine, the women are women.
In the English Blessing of the Introduction, a person who identified him as the fund of the British Government, is Mirza Gullam Ahmet Kadiyanei.
Gullam Ahmed, the Kadiyan of India, a small city of Pencap, said: "In the 1th March 1888, Allah has given the bonds of a congregation and ordered to create another congregation."
In 1891, when Gullam Ahmed was a little more advanced, he said that Mary had died in a death like other nephews, and God sent himself to Christians and Muslims as a messenger.
This is the same person that Muslims are expected to be, and that is Mirza Gullam Ahmed KaduyanÃ®.
(Islam Ansiclopedia, TDV)
In India, in 1857, after the footage, Gullam Ahmed, who wrote the books against the Indians and Christians, which were completely established with the firms of the British Court, which later appeared in the Communist Communist War and the President of the Republic of Islam against the Independence.
As Gullam Ahmed is the most favorite idea that the "first" is only a fight against his own power and that if you can live freely in the religion of the Emperor, it's not a dimension that will be struggled.
If you remember, Gulen goes a step further, he rejoiced in a 'reasonment' year, in which we had even openly attacks of the Democratics, which we have been attacking: "There is not very dangerous to defeat the country of the poor.
For you and them have red lines.
Once they will not spend your wife and your daughter.
They're not grown in the house, they're not interested!
The ESF and the Communication thinking that it was joined in himself, the idea that the Islamic congregation would be the savior, and that the cluster's crowd was only in the slightness of the FET, but generally the form of education and civil society.
The number of Kadiyanians in the world's population centres, called "Humanity First", declared that 23 countries are officially stored as the "Humanity First", which are officially reserved.
In 12 countries, 36 hospitals, 650 dispanser in 55 countries, only 8 tonnes in Africa; in 11 countries, 505 training systems and about 16,000 cars on the world.
In the Nobel reward, "Christ of Muslims of Science" Prof. Abdusselam, President of the United Nations Justice Division, Sir Zaferullah Han, "the Muslim Actor of the Oxur Rewards" and the Kadiyanite of the World Powers, we can see the depth of the deepest depth of the responsibilities of the World Powers.
Let's say that the women's meeting was talked to 30,000 people in England last week.
One of the slogans is a short look enough to understand the historys that she wants to say, "Your enemy, don't hate anybody."
It is possible to continue the outcome and motivation of such as the FETOM or the Tahir-est Kadri, and all of these organizations are actually engaged in the imperialization and supporting the civilians as a way to submit.

Bank of England's faiz costs will be guarded in 0.25%
The Bank of England is waiting for explanation that the slow-economic growth and movement of inflation will be increased in the speculation, soon after it explains that the facility rates will not change.
Bank of England warned that the economic growth will continue to continue "below" with the reason to maintain its fair rates together with their family income.
The decision-makers in the Bank's Paralel Policy Committee (MPC) used to keep the facility at 0.25% to 2 hours to make up, so that, after decreasing the low-economic growth, they wanted to increase the increase in the month.
Banka warned its estimates of growth in the three-month inflation report in 2017 to %1.7 in 2018 and warned that inflation still continues to increase in 3.
However, in the past few years, the facility increases gave the mark that the Brexit was needed to defeat the inflation and said that the responsibilities could remain more likely to be expected in the financial prices.
The countries also used a part of the weak economic improvement package, which was started a year ago, on the part of the packaging.
The bank said to finish the Danish Fund plan, which is fully financed by banks from Tuesday next month, but expected to provide more than 15 billion Â£ in the plan frame.
The bank told them a few minutes after taking the fair decision: "In the centre of the MPC, the smooth safi yurt (GSYH) continues to slowly slowly slowly, and continues to slowly slowly slow down the slowness of real profits."
On Fazis, he stressed that it could be necessary to defeat the inflation in the money policy and expected that the price would be "one more higher."
Piyasaers still believe that the first increase of the next year will be in the third area of the coming year, and one elder will be in 2020.
But any infant on the bank is shocked to be "I'm name" and "limited".
According to the estimates of May, the bank's reduced growth in this year and the next year is compared as %1, 9 and %1,7.
Banka protects the estimation of %1.8 in 2018.
Sterlin lost the value for the news's dollar and abro.
The pound was slowed by 1.1.31 US dollars and 1.4 down in 1,11 abbreviation.
The decision to change is that GSYH's second area is 0.3% of the three months ago, as a result of 0.2% of the latest growth figures, which were created by an increase in the expectations of increase in the number of expectations.
Probably 0.3% in the third circle will remain, but the bank will start to show a proper increase in the year's end.
When the bank says that it would be worse before the drought, the latest inflation report, the increased inflation and the slightly increased populations will be less pleased.
Banka said that in the past few years the money politician would be shocked, but he expected to correct the three-year terms on the end of the three-year terms.
In a weak-pound result, the increase in the British resources will support the economy with a number of smoking smokeers.
Karar comes after a year after the EU's shock reporting shock was decreased by 0.25% in August.
Banks are estimated that it would have four years likely to affect the prices and the economy.
Before the latest decision of the bank, the increase in inflation pressure on the difficult peoples and the increase in the three policy producers was loaded by 0.5 per cent of increased calls.
Inflation returned from the last month of the second,9th month, but the bank said that it was expected and that the next month would increase again.
The bank said he was about the powerless pound of my shift, according to his targets of %2.
And Andrew Montlake, director of the Mortgage Brokers, said, "When the last falls in the sight of the shocks, the job of the responsibilities and the slightly closing the sequence will be more hypothetic price.
Thursday; re-hypothesis seems to be good for those who are close to the end of their legal arrangements, many unbelieving options and low-standing facilitys are still more popular than always."
The NHS will write the anti-virus drug for 100,000 people.
In the Supreme Court, the patients can reach therapy of HIV prevention month after a fighting partner in the NHS.
NHS, England, has announced that the risk of infection in high risks was decreased by 86 per cent of the infection risk, would be delivered by 100,000 health services for a year before sex.
We agreed that the Supreme Court's decision last year had been financed after the Court's approval, and he said that the NHS was able to pay for the PrEP.
At this age, the NHS British President, Simon Stevens, was called "yeen and a serious advisor", identified the National Aids Trust (NAT) as a 'Defense point'.
Londra, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be first clinics of sexual health, which will be implemented in the UK by 2018 to Nisan.
Before Maruz remaining, a decade of HIV capture risks were reduced before sex (PrEP).
Experiences showed that among PrEP's infection risk, HIV affection was significantly reduced.
It means that a person taking PrEP is sufficient to predict HIV infection in the body of a person before seventh.
These types of medicines can be obtained every day or day until two hours before they do sex.
Those who are appropriate for treatment may not be successfully treated by gay or biological men, transexual people, and HIV-positive partners.
Clinics will determine the rational parts of those not known that the HIV situations of men, women, and partners are controlled by anti-retroviral treatment.
Those who live in England and who have a practical skill can be recorded for potential participation in local sexual health clinics.
The program will hold 10 million Â£ and signed an agreement with the NHS of the NHS for the delivery of drugs this week.
Probably, PrEP was designed to evaluate the total potential of PrEP because it was targeted, operated and implemented in large ranges.
Mr. Stevens said, "This new and serious advisory will affect the wide and slowly successful styles of HIV prevention.
This is transported to another kilometer to address one of the important health problems of humanity in the past thirty years.
The President of NAT (National AIDS Trust) Deborah Gold said, "This is a turnpoint with HIV.
If it is necessary, and if it's a right target, it's likely to make the HIV attack of PrEP in England.
Those who take high HIV risks from September will be a new and strong way to reach a new way that is actually funded by the NHS in England, which is really controlled by a person and that is not clear to a couple, which will lead to the improvement of many people's lives.
We're so warm to meet this proclamation."
Terrence Higgins Trust's Chairman, Ian Green, said: "The first thing that the experiment is now to be provided rapidly in the country and that no one who has HIV risk should be left behind.
According to the PREP experimental medicine, we're on the right way to protect more than 10,000 people with HIV risks.
Shadow's health observer Sharon Hodgson said, "We welcome the start of the PrEP trial, and for months it's been late and then the government's footstep.
Proofs show that this medicine can be transformed as a part of HIV prevention, and that it changes life.
Deney's going to get us a step closer to understand the PrEP's money.
It's important now that it's possible to protect the rest of HIV and end HIV in the community so fast as soon as possible in the country to bring us closer to a step.

Two Secrets of Death
The former art and Ticaret Officer Ayhan CirclingiroÄŸ, born in Washington, hoped to be a 19th-year-old job center in Istanbul Leven, decreased the life of a 19th-year-old business center.
A couple of students, Melis Saliho, a 24 - year - old student, found death in the house.
The Salihow's slaughter was shocked.
There were two secrets of death that were evaluated by the police's murder.
"DePRESE FOR WARDI"
In 1971, the first art of Turkey in the Nihat Erim government and the Chicaret Officer Ayhan CirclingiroÄŸ, born in Washington, was in 1966, a daughter of Ãœmit Mahbule Circlinge, which entered the Le Meridien Hotel at 17.00 a.m. in Etiler.
On the 19th of the 19th, a Northern Tourist instead of reporting an ambulance and police team.
The health team determined that the 19-year-old circle was lost his life.
Mother, who expressed the police, said, "Then was a depressive thing."
He came from Ankara to Istanbul on 31 July.
I've got a bunch of dissolve from my other daughter.
"He was interested in my neck, and he was inevitably affected by my skin disease."
The Cyril Road, who was cut from the Court of Justice, is expected to be disfellowshipped in Ankara.
He's investigating whether he's been shooted by someone or killed.
"Canina Kidi" INDEX
Another suspicious death in Istanbul lived in the Sweryer Zekeriya village.
Melis Salihoh, who reads at the Foot University, was found dead in the house of 24.
According to the newspapers, the young girl's father went to the school where she didn't get a news, and she went to the school where she didn't reach her phone.
Dad met her in the house with the dead body of her daughter.
Her family, who loved me alone in the house of Melis, who loved the closest environment and friends.
Melis Salihohlu's death was the law of his family and his neighbor.
After Melis's social media, a friend was shooted in our face.
The green wings under our feet, the best friends Jack and her sister Ishan, were on our hand when we walked through the small plastic toast.
"What was needed that now he shared his message to death."
Life life: Asma's counts have turned out the small Earls Court's home to a disaster.
In 2014, the former banker Joanne Leigh went to a large house in Knightsbridge at the Earls Court.
The showing Queen Mother's show was a proof of the new design that has convinced Joanne's balls without collecting the balls.
"I lived in a larger land in Knightsbridge before my old friend, Joanne."
"I thought I was looking for something.
Earl Court's room was shown to me and there were the same high-scale bathrooms.
I loved him, and I made a offer that day."
After the first meeting, it was renewed from the start of the carriage of 1000 feet.
It was the only room planned, and you had to pass into the bedroom, and Joanne wanted to add a hidden area and a rise for the maximum value of my snake.
"I wanted the shoes, the large windows and a lot of light.
That's my way."
For this purpose, notting Hill Central Miratory and Design Studio, Duck & Shed, was able to use Erfan Azadi from 12.5 ft and not only create a place where Joanne lives.
Tavan wasn't enough to add two areas above, so the difficulty was to create a shoe that could be able to keep in the legs.
He had to think about a creative way to solve her problems.
He explains: "The skin is very easy."
"We should have set up the strikes so that they could be able to smile without they need to be shocked down on each other.
This was not just to build a simple platform, but at the same time the circles would be so shocked that they would be right according to the upper or upper function."
This schedule also brought many teams to Erfan's two large rooms on each other.
The old type of look from Retrouvius for asma looks at the area of life below.
It defines the style of the style of silver, silver shoes, and old Serge Mouille.
It plays a role in the use of the moon, the field and the light.
Short cordomine is able to appear to be more long.
The protective pane feels a window opening in another room.
The monthly universities in the antitrust provide Joanne's shooting in all the shooting shooting teams and snakes.
The beauty of the sit room that creates a more beautiful area can close the kitchen when it's not used.
It's not new.
That's an unfortunate one of the doors that can be removed above.
Erphan explains the slight MDF door, "We've been using an intelligence."
"The weight of the dense, so when you shoot the door, it's really easy to lose."
Joanne wins more than 16 meters with wise use of the house and hiding area, a bedroom and a well-bearing seat plan.
"There is what you're going to sell the seat area, or it's defined the value of your people."
"It's going to enter a seat, and it's going to make a account for some of the seats."
They managed to use the qualified material that gives the vision of the area when they increased the plant area.
Erphan says, "The things you've touched is that we're gonna help you to build a emotional link at home."
"You don't love the electric shoes on the wall.
This is important, but your hearts do not strive.
It's a good design and an increased metrometer. It's supposed to turn a very wonderful thing from something that's standard.
In fact, you can choose not to leave like Joanne.
On the 5th of the Jeremain Lens,
1,5 months' meetings were transferred to the Lens Bond Service, which was thought at the end of the weekend.
After the last week's meetings, Lens agreed with a black-white team of $5 million.
The Dutch player, which has been understood for five years, has learned to get 2.5 million euros annually.

Nine photos of the native couples
For about four years, a long-term relationship with the Skikel and the singer Emre AltuÄŸ went to the world home in Sortie.
"There was the most special moment of our breakfast." He died with a photo taken by the box.
He decided to differ about two and seven years later.
Brothers are struggling for $500 million for the civil imparatorship.
Two men brothers are in war for one of the largest Victorian imparators, more than $500 million, than the Italian families.
The former Carlton Futbol Club director and artist Colin De Lutis lives away from three doors from a small brother Paul, who gave himself to the Supreme Court, in a packaging in Toorak, as well as how people and jobs are shared.
Paul wanted to go out of his family since 2014, but he continued to discuss on the high court on the part.
Mothers and their mothers with their brothers, Smith Street, in Collingwood in 1973, are 38 officials who have more than a half billion of people.
There, the Westco Jeans family set up and growed up a chain in the sale center of 160.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money was covered and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes the city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento artistic guests, the Gold Coast and the Mt Buller apartments and the sales centers in the bank.
In the head of an agreement with the fathers who have been made with, Colin (of Paul as a "excellent power and dominant personality" in the De Lutis family), Paul has a third.
A court file says that Colin's $316 million, and Paul's $176 million in the value of $176 million.
Paul's civilians and skills appear to be a matter of dealing with.
In 2015, he wrote the first promised statement: "The divisions proposed by Corin had left him with the people I have always added as the best."
The first Supreme Court was held after the past trial of numerous deficiencies.
Both brothers are also in the sight of whom they're going to control, and Paul says that Colin left him out of his work.
Colin defends that it's not right, but Paul is accused of controlling some of them.
Colin says he hoped to solve an unconvention in a promised statement that he gave on his heads.
"Itlanian trees give me the most important priority of the family."
Deloite, Pitcher partners and Charter Keck Cramer's firms have stored hundreds of valid expressions, e-mails, and Allan Myers, and the best lawyers of both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her husband, Luigi, was an Italian citizen family in the end of the 1950s, and in the early 1970s they bought a sell in Brunswick.
Colin's fingered the Collingwood people who opened his family's first pants to buy the Collingwood government.
Colin says, "In my last few years, Paul was a boy of a 10-year-old boy."
Anna De Lutis tells him and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to leave his own resources to his sons.
"Luigi often said to me that the brothers never wanted to fall in the court."
Other two brothers Mark and Luke are not a part of the group of De Lutis companies, but when Colin said he left his job, he paid $26 million to Luke.
Paul said that Luke and Mark were unfortunate about the terms of financial identities.
In 2015, Eddi McGuire, the best friend of the television star, tried not to take care of Colin, although he was a member of the former AFL governance club.
Fairfax Media, Colin and Paul De Lutis and the lawyers were on Sunday.
Only Colin answered, "I can't say anything."
"My brother Paul was very regretted that he prefers me to take a case, and that our family's name was to courts."
In the middle of 2016, Colin wrote that he tried to comply with his brother's requests in a court.
"Our grandmother Paul and I don't want to cut down with an unfair agreement." He added that it was still hopeful about my sweet."
It looks like this hope's lost.
Colin wrote, "The government will be solved by the courts in the near future."
Trump plans to defeat the new special castle of the President's media.
Others tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do this.
That's the first thing.
Politicals reports that the new White House's special calendar will spend information to the President Trump (not even the haber med reports) with the hope of maintaining his boss more delicate hope.
Small information from the murder Josh Dawsey:
"When the White Saray had come to a meeting on the first day of the work, John F. Kelly forgot a major problem planned to solve President Donald Trump about the White Saray: the wicked information would be on the other hand.
Kelly's persons, on the paper or on the papers, told him that the information should be made on him, because the President would be able to make better decisions when he was given good information.
Kelly's identity seems very important, but they tried to spend Trump, and they did not.
President Trump's relationship with the television has been ten years ago, and she's still good to watch TV at White House.
On Saturday Monday, a former campaign, Sam Nunberg, said, "If Aday Trump was sorry to show him the fair place in the medications that he could be convinced."
From the Politico Tara Palmeri, he wrote: "Only the six missionary campaign, Trump has made the key to keep the Twitter shopping under control. "
Okay.
But Trump's idea that Twitter's counter-control is always in any time.
Maybe this campaign knows something we don't know about the rest of our missionarys, and it's going to be more confusing if Trump's Twitters are not their own advisors.
Probably we never know anything about the Twitters that Trump hasn't sent.
If the experts were removed it several times from danger, then the efforts were valuable.
But no one could prevent Trump's continuous discussion.
Some of the hypsys with the White Saray, which everywhere tried to advance their agents to Trump's materials (they could be trusted or uncertain,) and were not the people who made up their world views.
In the month of the Political House, all of this story reported the communication of information to the President as strategic.
A example of the murderer Shane Goldmacher's details was:
"Trump's former and old-trump missionaries say that they have reacted hiddenly to disfellowshipping disorders and finding where they're sourced.
In the end of February, the president of one of the Internet Promotors Charles C. Johnson's website, GotNews.com, was condemned by a copy of this article that was the "the source of a devastation" in the White House of Katie.
Johnson, in terms of the fact that it wasn't lawful for Twitter, or that it was not important for any evidence or that it had been sentenced in the past, and that it was not important to come back from them.
He read the Trump article and began to ask people about Walsh."
Goldmacher adds that the time-time private Reince Priebus and White Saray staff secreter Rob Porter tried to place a system that put the Trump's e-mails and documented.
How did that result?
Kelly wants to do the same three months later.
Maybe it's going to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump still works in its own fashion and helps.
These unchanged factors will make Kelly's mission very difficult.
The script FETSCH series appeared with a special template

The CHP General Secretariat Kamil Okyay and the President-in-Office of General Assistant BÃ¼lent Tezcan, wrote: "It is unlawful and unlawful, the justice is unexpected to the order of nowhere except law."

Michelle Carter was sent to a punishment for the reasons why Conrad Roy encouraged me to kill.
A Massachusetts woman was arrested for two and a half years because he encouraged her friends to kill their friends and telephone talks.
Michelle Carter, a 20-year-old age, is going to take up the 15-month section of the crime, and five-year-old.
In July 13, 2014, the government was charged by the crime that Conrad Roy was killed by the taxi of his life in the history of Carter.
"Mr. Roy's father said, "I'm my family's heart broken.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to be free to open the way.
If he remained against a 20-year-old punishment, his law team and Mr. Roy defended that he and Mr. Roy's mental disease.
The red pantalonia and the color of a blue, Carter, when he was cut into punishment, looked like the hands of the old eyes, and the hands were sweet and the eyes.
The Defender said to judge, "He killed Conrad Roy."
He ended his life to improve his own.
He didn't accept the question."
"No, he didn't show that he was kind of disappointment."
But Carter's lawyer said, "It was a horrible situation that the city was struggling."
Whatever, the judge Lawrence Moniz said that he saw "it did any important effect on the events of mental disease."
A defender, Mr. Roy's mother, explained Lynn Roy: "Another day I'm not going to keep my loved son's loss.
I want to be proud of the way I came up with me and with me, and I will try to be with her sisters.
Mr. Roy's sister Camdy Roy told his statement that he would never be involved with her brother or the reality that he wouldn't ever be with her children.
"There's a pain that the rest of my life will always be with me since I bird every day."
It looks like it's gonna make a case, because the crime has not found a Massachusetts law.
Mr. Roy was 17-year-old when he died of carbon monoxy in a machine in 2014.
The case was interested in national interest when Carter's short messages showed that he encouraged him to end his life.
When he was in the house of his family, she said to many messages that she sent two weeks before his death, "I don't know a lot of ways."
In the moments before his murder, he wrote, "You must do this, Conrad" and "Open the general that you need to see."
Judge Moniz said he wanted Carter to interest Mr. Roy on the way to die.
The case was denied by legal opinions.
Amanda Knox was offensive for murdering a British room friend in Italy in 2007, two years before his defense.

When I talked, he said:
The 12-month criticism in the deterioration of uncertainties.
The greatest encouraging is the reducing of uncertainties.
There's a powerful government.
There's no political incertitude.
I hope we're indefinite uncertainties in our nearby neighborhood.
I believe that, with a quantity of reforms, we're sending Turkey in a shock trend of 5%.
I told you a few months ago.
That's the worst thing you're back.
Slow-speak energy is now not in those areas, but in reforms that make our energy slowly growing, and slowly increased...
That's why it's critical in our 12 months.
On the one hand, reform has reduced uncertainty from one side, no political indefinition already.
Our chance, and our swimming slows the difficulties in our nearby covenant.
And if we don't want it, we've got a lot of classical markets.
Libya, like Irak.
We don't lose only a day for 3,5 million people.
When we looked at the last 15 years, Turkey grew over 5,7 percent, despite all these shocks.
Turkey, that is, we have a problem with our fundamentals.
Now, with a major reform, we are seen in Turkey's policy to grow again by 5% by increasing our leaders against shocks.
I'm telling you I'm here, we've got so grateful systems.
If I'm telling our enterprises that we're not going to show enough effort, I think it's gonna be crazy.
One time I'm going to join a car will be strong.
Why?
Because we've been able to do it.
They don't have to go to the signs and try to make a firm.
In monitoring these distresss, we made a skilled skilledness in the form of how we can spend global systems in the form of the dimensions of those who are in the world.
You know what's going on.
It's going to be the 25 percent that the government has given it netly.
The rest of the slaughter and their slaughter papers are generally low in risk.
When we look at the big picture, I think it's interesting to grow in the next time.

We've been waiting for a disaster on 10 percent.
That means that we were so good.
It works at a time.

SABAH saved the snake.
Buergerâ€™s illness appeared from a premature age, but today women have become often appearing.
One of these women is the 36-year-old Mestap.
Two years ago, the pain was cronicated in the footsteps.
When a young woman who was difficult to walk, she went to the hospital when he was in the risk of losing his bread.
A friend offered Dr. Joseph Kalko.
The news showed the "Azerbaijan Forest Haller Officer's life" in SABAH.
That's why Dustin, who went to Kalko, came to fight Buerger's disease.
Dr. Kalko took a young woman in an emergency surgery.
Hold out of the pain, now seeing the oxygen treatment.
When the car manufacturers turn to the Ters Template, Audi 850,000 regions will modify
One day before Audi's hearing, BMW said I was going to offer a load of more than 350,000 machines.
The BMW Officer said that the BMW's Centre (which believed that the instruments are illegal or limited) also Munich, cutting Europe's cities, and believed that the company's company is more intelligent than the restrictions.
Thirty million Mercedes drivers in Europe on Saturday said that he would modify the division missions to cut down.
No signs could be identified as calling them back.
It encouraged European car manufacturers, Europe and the United States to help carbon dioxide emissions in Europe and in the United States.
But the oxygen that disazel engines open up is added to cancer, and it can be reasoned for the skin.
It also increases the capacity of the team to neutralize the swimming pool that the automobile firms get out of the skilled machines, and it makes it difficult to keep the car rental prices.
When the German car manufacturers faced research, Angela Merkel's government was accused of struggling the strong car companies and dealing with the orders of the problem.
The signatures are trying to hide the computer that has been known as an incorrect computer, and at the time, the auto-tested testing of emissions, and to avoid the errors of the Volkswagen, which is shocked.
Many of the Volkswagen directors were accused of the U.S. and others are under investigation on both sides of Atlantic.
Last month, in Audi's motor development section, the former president of the termodinamy was arrested in Germany.
The former Prime Minister Zacheo Giovanni Pamio is not protected by a Italian, and therefore it is possible to be judged in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi has been investigating a German criminal investigation, and the authorities were accused of a system to save Audi from the Emissions Rules in Europe after the United States was a central investigation.
Audi's investigation can be weighted to Volkswagen: the LÃ¼ks car manufacturer has a weak payment on the Volkswagen.
Don't fish all you see
The President of the Uruguayn National Officer Dr. Joseph's Thanksgiving Countries warned not to be sure of the depth, but 2 meters away from the light.
Each year, thousands of people face the root and omurity risk because they are slowing the light waters.
The majority's growing up at least five or six.
The personality of the skins in this level affects cell skins and skins.
Prof. Dr. Huglers, "It's the area of the size of our most vulnerable organs, it's stopped by a ruined warrior, or it's shocked by the function. "
"Only the first help is wrong in the blessure, it can also lead to death to the cause of the accidents."
Water fishing is in the fourth time of oururism.
The 20-29-year-old age of beds, and most of the men.
Prof. Dr. Colds, "Do not have to shoot the water fishing without appearance."
And he said, "If you're so good, you can have a painful wound."
Prof. Dr. Dr. Call recalls the following:
The degree of oururity in the area that is infected by fishing may be flown in changing degrees in legs.
You can know it's my face, but it's like a smooth water.
It may be a place that looks like you deeply.
The warnings in the U.S. and Australia were decreased in 70 percent of the states of water fishing in the oceans.
Prof. Dr. Calls, "If in Turkey has 28 degrees, it's unfortunately that there's no single warning table. "
"All of the writings on this type of accidents before they should be taken carefully in the scenarios and shoes of information on the shoes or on the information panes, under their project health, schools and social understanding."
The President-in-Office of the NGO Spinal and the Periferic Officer, Prof. Kardir Kotil, suggested that this would be done in the sense of fertility:
At the time of the case, 112 must be set.
The majority must be arrested, not moved, be confirmed by a hard shock when possible.
The airway must be firmed and the patient must be decreased for the escape of the water.
It should be shocked from legs, and it should be shocked to disappear water.
It must be trying to correct the form of the patient's size.
Maybe we're broken.
However, if the omurism is not still injured, it may cause an inadequate position that will be given to the first aid and sickness during the movement of the patient, to make the ourism of the corn chemistry pieces, and to decline.
The Provence Lab is under climate change
It turned Provence to a symbol in Southern France, but there's an advertising that he has been under the climate change.
The Lavanta is a smooth lavanta, a smooth smell of diseases, and it is caused by scientists and farmers who try to find this situation to find a solution.
Eric Chaisse, a CRIEPAM scientist in Provence, said, "In the last few years, the climate change in the Provence has become less smaller and most of its rainy.
This affects the life of the lavanda.
And there is also a small authorist, with a micro bacteria to shoot, and there are many of them in the air."
And many things are in danger.
As far as the tattlers have taken, the smooth and the cosmetics are cut down into a dream of the lavage.
Eric Chaisse said, "When we have to be very long-food heads, we have smaller, smaller or less developed or no weak heads.
So we have less presumable rain parts."
It includes slower distribution of water and soil between the solutions that have been made from the eyes, but it also has a protective slipper and water swimming shape and develop more slightly on the conditions of the slope.
Journalist murder designs the wealthy counterparty in Mexico.
The weekly newspaper Riodoce generally finds the latest routines issued by organized crimes in the Sinaloa of the Sinaloa, traveling officers and unfinished drug wars in the newspapers.
But on this day, they came to have a meeting to talk about their security on the sea of their tragics.
He told them that it was important to change their routines.
Two public journalists see what they feel safeer, whether they're bringing their children to the office that targets a arm bomb in 2009 or leave them home.
The security experts wrote three words on the dark stage of the room: ladies, unfairs, fairs.
They want to make their names for every tablet; no proof is necessary, no signs, no sounds, no sounds.
Drugs, politicians, business people, government or cards are suspected that a list of a list is a dangerous man who makes a dangerous job to write the cup of Mexico in the newspaper.
There's no payment in the country, the number of bodies increased in the country is more journalists than these: According to the Protection Committee of Journals, at least 25 persons since President Enrique Pena Noto Branch in 2012, at least seven years after attacks and threats, and at least seven years died.
There's also Javier Valdez Cardenas, directors and inspired sources among the last dead.
Valdez wrote: "It's the greatest error to be a journalist in Mexico." In a many books on drug violence.
He feels that he's disappearing everywhere, a large picture showing the midst of Valdez's "Adalet" in the building of Riodoce, with the words of the "Adalet" in the house of Riodoce; the two of the opposites, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, who showed his laugh, his eyes and direction.
When he worked, he has been able to pass on two months of his death, and the crowds talk about their midst traumas, their sleeves, their sleeplessness, and paranoia.
In 2010, although a federal defence was created to take the newspaper cases, the journalists were struck only two of them according to the Protection Committee.
Each year, thousands of drug evacuation and organized water-related murders have been deleted to the law of the murderers of journalists, as well as most of their murderers.
In Riodoce, although the hearts are broken, the seed is still more droughting in the violence of Sinaloa.
Ibarra says not to be aware of the killers, without justice, it's a little bit to see security.
"It's so stupid to get my time in this work."
"If we don't know what it is, you're not trusting anybody."
On May 15th morning, Valdez left the office of Riodoce in Culiacan.
The Red Toyota Corolla was able to take a few blocks before it was stopped by two men, and it was shocked with his car and was shot 12 times, for the name of the newspaper that was not translated as the Once River.
The weapon man went to his car and shooted in his nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
Her wife and two adult children remain.
In Culiacan, I'm free to agree.
But there's nothing more than the silence of Valdez immediately.
Last year, after the arrest of Guzman and the eighth-seventh time of the United States, we warned to fill the white-level groups in Sinaloa as one of the most bloody wars of the country.
Be empty every day on the street in Sinaloa, or a lot of people are shooted, or the drug kings are filled with more mozoles that have been shooted, two-fold houses.
For a minute, forgot the situation of the single cartel's valuable limits and controlling the drug traffic routes in the US.
However, while Valdez realized that the risks of the work were deep, Riodoce's manufacturer and director, Ismail Bojorquez (60), were disrupted from the crime because he failed to protect his friends.
He believes that two mistakes have been a cause of murder.
First, in a letter made in February, Guzman had a report on Damaso Lopez, a leader of the card group who was fighting with the sons of Guzman.
The letter may have been angry; the most likely members of the ship have been purchased unexpectedly for the children in the newspaper.
The second error was not difficult to leave Valdez for his own security after the other newspaper in the same story.
Valdez and Yurt were a phenomenon outside the Valdez Mexico and the Yurt, and it appeared to be a round point of violence against the journalists.
He was alive for a long time, and his friends and business friends had always been there.
When Riodoce sold $50 in 2013 in Noroeste, his five working friends were an experiencing advisor.
In Sinaloa, "It was impossible to make journalists unnoticed to deal with the narcotic matter," said Bojorquez.
In time, he wins the newspapers, courage and honest news and increased advertising.
The Proverbs tried to investigate, without fear, and reading, they were able to read the stories that no one could be encouraged to tell them.
Riodoce wins the premises of Maria Moors Cabot for advertising in Latin America eight years later.
In the same year, Valdez wins the National Freedom of the Protection Committee, because if the Mexican Drug story was on the top of the Mexican drug story.
He clearly accepted that she was afraid.
"I want to continue to stay on" at the time of the CPJ reward.
In a Rompevento TV report, the drug fleet in Sinaloa was "earnest life."
"You must accept your mission as a journalist, or you're playing a little bit.
I don't want to ask me, "What did you do with so much death... why didn't you tell me what it was and ended?"
Riodoce's staff misses Valdez, the teachers who know how you can live in your life...
They trusted in his rutin.
He's always shocked the shooting.
He went to the bar called El Guayabo in the office, and he was always sit on the same table.
Now they ask: "Have the love of his ruin been slaughtered?
He tried to ask them how his death was best doing their jobs and remaining in life.
"If you're not grateful if you're working with their women, with their children, with their clean works, with the secret aircraft pists that they used for drugs."
Bojorquez said, "It was swearing things."
Finally, even in the best time, it was a very high autonomy and was not to protect himself.
To trust in your own beverages.
If the smells come, go away.
Andres Villarreal, director of the Riodoce, said, "It's a hearing that can't be heard, and it happened to Javier."
He and others say that old rules are not applicable in Sinaloa, as Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and the other areas that are not in the other areas that have the home of the ruler of the government.
The ship is continuously changed.
Riodoce is not allowed in the room to meet the security training of the staff; it appears that only one day ago, it appears to be used to monitor journalists and activistas in Mexico.
On the outside, two police officers wanted to save from the heat of 104 degrees (40 santigrat) in the dark of a tree.
Riodoce was sent by the local government to protect the offices found in a mid-class of Culiacan.
Some of these officers wondered that they were 50 percent of the police in the contents that they said that they were not confidence.
The lawyers have been several months in the white-wheel-wheel, which controlled drugs as a filling.
In the number of this week, Riodoce has three major storys.
The old bokser Julio Cesar Chavez was murdered in Sinaloa's brother.
In addition, the rule of the rule of the rule of his choice was the slaughter of the government.
And in a block of defence, a group of Culiacan was slaughtered in the most precious restaurant of the Culiacan.
There was no official explanation of whom he was fled or how it was, so when he was required to write to the time that everyone in the city knows: the restaurant and the drug drivers were in the eyes of the authorities.
An adviser learned that the official records were registered under the name of a political party in the Governing Party (PRI) in almost all the centuries of the government of the restaurant.
In recent times, many PRI elections are injured by injury in sinasonal events.
Villareal, a murderer, asked one of the sons of "El Chapo" Guzman to write about the events that had happened before.
Only months ago, they were reading the valdez's bridge for the best information about the fugitive.
For the reason he said "El Flaco" lacapan Villareal (46), "We already knew what's going on."
"There's all our communication channels now with our sources."
Someone who's never expected is re-used as a pancart that protests and extracts in Valdez's office for the murders of journalists.
Muhabir Miriam Ramirez took a few cards and took place for another journalist in the office of the local defence next morning.
Salvador Adame was lost in the west Michoacan area three days after he was killed in Valdez.
There was a wrong body found, and the official officials say that it's that.
In the country, journalists, organized protests and buildings expressed their thoughts with higher voice.
Today, Prime Minister Bojorquez is trying to support the government for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting on the afternoon of Valdez's murder, Ramirez accused the authorities to punish the journalists and to kill them because they told them the truth.
After that day, he wanted to set up another mission to think that he was inflicted by his wrath and to make his government news.
The newspapers in Mexico continued to say that they were "circled by an uncertain society."
In the latter book called Narko-Gazetetics, the journalists wrote that they were killed by the command of the security forces contained in cooperation with politicians and organizational crimes.
The Medya Monitoring Group Art. 19, most of the attacks made by journalists last year joined police and official official officials.
Ramirez said, "You're dead in Mexico, because they want to support you."
The murders clearly made cold dark effects.
Nobody forgets the death in Tamaulipas, the northern border of Maria Elizabeth Macias six years ago.
His body was found together with a note signed by Zeta card: "I'm here because of my news."
A computer clause and an obscene, with a coated head.
The northern border site in Chihuahua was preferable to close some publications like El North after the murder of Miroslava Breach in March.
After their officers were killed in 2004, others continue to do it, as El Manana did from Nuevo Laredo.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez voted on the title of drug cards on the page: "What do you want to do?"
Some journalists flew from their own locations, or from the country.
This is a decision.
They're looking for streets when they're still waiting for risks.
Sometimes, three months after flying from Veracruz, four women in 2015 and four of them are being killed by Ruben Espinoza, an apartment murderer in Mexico City.
This high-risk dance is made every day for those who are back and continue to work.
Ibarra, who ever wants to be shocked, said he was afraid of noting the drug trade.
He said, "I'm going to the hell, and I'm being angry for this."
On the past Saturday last night, half of the last number, Riodoce's writers started stealing out in my office and drinking a blue, and the phones were on the same time.
In the nearby Mazatlan, a strike, and security forces, a weapon-weapon battle, 19 deaths were justified.
Like he was promised in the cartel message in the area, she continued to fight her.
On my rest, they've posted the phones through the Riodoce's website.
The front page would be changed next day.
Sirens began to shoot close, and there's a struggle with another weapon around.
Bojorquez shocked the police officers to see that they weren't.
If they're afraid, they didn't even show.
The newspapers were under the snake of the portraits of the newspapers, and his midst park was shocked to see the whole Sinaloa, and Riodoce's box followed his feet.
"How can you think about the castle?" Bojorquez said, "When Javier was killed, I want to send him out for me to make me a news in the street?"
Dinozor was used to escape the enemy.
It looks like a shock in the first sight, but it's a terrible one.
Scientists now explained that the first findings of an incredible creature from a Canadian wooder were very goodly protected, and the experts explained that it was â€œthe dinosaurs of Mona Lisa.
It was so good that they could understand that pull powder's red is, and they could say that it's a sweet pass.
The Current Biology report identified this as one of the best-bearing dinosaurs and the best dinosaurs in the world.
Fosil is 110 million in the midst of the Kretase DÃ¶nemi, 112 million years ago, a new type of nodozor.
The slightly well-confirmed situation turned researchers to the wonder that he was identified as 'to the truth'.
Bitki's eating smell, the best preserved fosil, according to the National Geographic reports.
Shawn Funk, on March 21, 2011, found the accident of Suncor Millennium Madeni near Fort McMurray in Northern Alberta Canada.
He shot something strange and decided to look closer.
Fosil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontoology Museum.
In the next sixth year, the animals carried out with a wild animal of 2500 pounds (1100 kg).
The results completed after that work are ready to get out of here.
Caleb Brown, a scientist of the Royal Tyrell Museum who you're swearing, said, "If you can believe you're almost sleeping."
"On one of the most beautiful and the best protected dinosaurs, the dinosaurs will be as Mona Lisa."
Scientists found that if they were all cut down and a tank that walks like this vegetable eating might be a serious threat against the dinosaurs of food.
He used the red and white shoes to hide the weight of the dinosaurs, which was so weighty, and known as the contrast-generation, has used a protective technology that has also been used in many days.
As long as the major dinosaurs have been slaughtered, the expansions say that it would be better confusing and shooting their enemies.
The first time the creature of the 110 million-year-old nodozor family came in May, and it is now in the Royal Tyrrell Paleontologia Museum.
Scientists now finished their work and gave Mark Mitchell a musical name of a animal animal name for Borealopella for more than 7000 hours.
Dr. Mitchell and the United Nations scientists have made it possible to document the paintings and the shape of the body.
The animals have discovered the contractual defence, which means that the above of the weakest part of the fertilizing part is more likely to be able to protect the animals.
Even if the contract is respected, the findings are surprised because Borealopelta's size grows much to be shocked by the animals that live in our day.
This means that dinosaur, eating dinosaurs, have seen enough pressure to be shocked, and that the evolution is shut up as a way of remaining in life.
But the most smaller animals that use the counterworm wood (e.g. gym, zebras, or snakes) are more clear to be a smaller and a shoe; it means that this nodozor faced a serious difficulty to remain in life.
Brown said, "Devasa shows how dangerous the dinosaurs in Kretase could be to be for a heavy crush animal.
The organic parts of the powder also found that the dinosaur dynozorum bleeding is the red coffee.
To find the scientists what they eat at the last dinner, they continue to investigate the animals for the beasts of their life.
When Dinozor died, they believe that he slowed to a river and slowed down, and that it was shooted to the top ocean surface.
At that time, Alberta was so warm as today, and probably the rivers and the oceans were far more than now.
Brown said, "Nodozor was cut and protected with a complete snake, and at the same time the original shape of the animal has been protected in three ways."
Sounds, how the animal looks early at Kretase today's soon.
You have no imagination to rebuild him. If you strike your eyes a little, you can believe that you are almost sleeping.
Kretase was when they were familied in the earthquake of the dinosaurs, which standed up on two feet, and the oven dinosaurs.
Even though all of the kings, Tyrannosaurus rex lived over millions of years after a team's heavy dinosaur Borealopelta.
There are 38 feet (11,5 m) lengths of Acrocanthosaurus, with a heat of 6 tonnes of weight.
The latest findings in the Current Biology magazine believed that the scientists have shooted a deep decline after Borealopelta died.
It was found by Shawn Funk on 21 March 2011, in North Alberta Canada, Suncor Millennium Madeni near Fort McMurray.
According to the museum, we're experiencing the skin and the most predicted dynozor of this and the rest of the beach.
As a medium of 18 feet (5 meters) in the circle and up to 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
It's the size of the two floors that get out of the shoes.
Scientists believe that there is a fatal hammer in the Western Canada until this shooting stone flows from an open stone.
But the dinosaur was defended with the perfect details of the grain under the sea.
This particular type of fosilized remains so good that the pigs are still covering skins during the head of the dinosaur.
As Michael Greshko wrote for the National Geographic, it's a literature, "to win the piyano.
How much I'm looking at her, it's incredible.
Fosiled tissue still covers the cuts of the point in the head of the dinozour.
He's shocking with his right leg, he's shooting up the top of 5 feet.
"I can see the legs on the footside."
Don't be from your teeth when I say white.
All humans are in the mind of white dentists and a strict laugh.
When people go to white-levels, the Oral Lazer applications are warned that the President of Nbukhet Berk, Nbukhet Berk, is required to keep away from products sold on the market or on the Internet.
NÃ¼khet Berk, who indicates that these materials have drawn the surface of my surface and that the dentists can be colored as no more returning, say, "It can be able to swallow the whiteness, the chemical materials used by the dentists or the dentists, which can be able to swallow into the porsical surfaces."
Berk, when recording the importance of dentist health prevents many diseases, the  esthetic applications, the dentist and the health of the teeth, and the spirit of a good laughing possibility, shares the following information:
The teeth of young people usually is white while they are not a depression or a genetic factor.
Aging, dentist designing dentists, and smoking, smoking or sweet coloring often takes more color for the smoke in years.
The whiteness of dentists, the chemical materials used by the dentists, or the dentists, may be provided by the porcell surfaces, which are made as a skin ring.
Dentists must never be white-scale with products sold on the market or on the Internet.
Because these materials are drawing my surface, and dentists are colored in a way that I can't be back.
Keacorn Beledier 2011 gives the age, intimidating and foreign citizens "Home Dentists and Life Health Service" to this point.
The 65-year-old russman, who was sentenced in the Kidderen's Air Magazine for a 24-year-old bed, said, "My wife's office was known about the service of the Beledience."
We've been calling the house, and they're here.
"I'm not listening to my dentist if I'm not in this service."
The 72-year-old daughter of Kezban, who was 95-year-old in Macedonia, said, "Mommy lives in bed for 7.5 years."
When I came to the house, I saw this service's backs and I called it right now.
We take this service regularly for four years.
I've got a problem in my teeth, and they're looking at me when the doctors come.
He used his expressions "You're so happy."
There is no health security difficulties for the full-payment service.
It's a "who" in the Turkish army.
My lovely readers, the High Army, which was made previously, took very interesting decisions from opening the sea forces.
This isn't the commander of the Kuvvet. It's brought a cormiral.
It's an unexpected application in our army.
And how did that happen?
The Force Commander had completed the time of the BÃ¼lent Bostanote, and he'd be able to...
And it happened.
Now the commander came to the Weysel Embassy, the only operator.
The Veysel Pasha, who was on the past, had to be commanded in normal shocking.
But the government didn't want him.
I'm trying to tell you very sorry, and if we start out of the late 1,3,4 and 5.
In this case, the Marine Forces remained one of them.
He was supposed to be brought to the slaughter: the Commander of Donanma in two numbers, with the Office of the Officer.
And what happened then?
The Corinth Corinthian Adnan Ezbal was designated by the government of that piece.
Now look at this table!
He's staying there with the Veysel Office, but instead of him, he's a higher commander!
He's insured to the order of uncleanness.
What's going on after that?
It's not possible to do the order of an unbelievable coregeneral.
He doesn't take order, he doesn't.
This is the case with the Veysel Power will not be deceived by this incitative situation, if it's not loved by the slaughter today or tomorrow.
And this is the encouragement message that he has given by the government, and it is: "Go on, Weysel Pasha."
Last night, after I wrote this letter, the news was denied in hours, but the situation was still not explained.
Now let's see what's happening again!
He brought a colonial instead of the sixth time of our army to make the traditional "Khodem" understanding.
There's a real political in the work, but we don't know the back.
Maybe if someone is near, we'll always learn together!
My loved readers, I tried to tell you so slowly above, especially the Turkish army is very important.
It's not just a bitch.
For example, the underlying of the Harp School at 10th time is more expensive than the end of the 11th time.
The general of the first time is more desperate than the second time.
We lived in the Sstiklale Harbint, the smuggling examples of this smile event.
The name of the Garp Cephere Commander...
There are two soldiers in the order.
Army and 2.
We're coming in 1922, our army will make the great crowd and shoot the Greek army.
There are valuable names for the army commander in this stage.
Someone Refet (Bele) Pasha.
He offers the army commander to himself, but he says, "I can't enter his order."
Another name is Jacob Shavki.
It's the Attatork at Harp Academy...
He's so loved, valuable, a valuable and worthy command that he shocked "hocam" in various wars.
In 1919, with the soldiers and civil Turkeys, they shocked into the Malta Island by the Englishs.
And when he turned into Judah, he calls for the army commander and said the same thing: "The Western commander is unclean from me, and I will not command him."
However, Atatirk convinced her to be rich, and he accepts the commander of one of the two troops.
The third is a very colorful name...
Ali Ihsan (Sabis).
He's a soldier who's talking about it. He's a swimming soldier.
Irak, Kafkas, Iran, and a commander struggled in various defects.
And by the Englishs he's going to Malta, and he's going to Ankara from there to the Coast.
"I can't fight in the order of Ismmet, who is unclean." Ali Shit said, "I can't fight the same thing when he was offered to his army command."
But he's convinced...
But it seems that after the mission started, Garp Cephere, who entered the command, continues to discuss with Ismet Pasha, brings the events out and smiling the army...
And he loves the slaughter's assignment, instead of a calm Nuttith.
And then, Ali's Hospital isn't ever corrected with the Attirk.
The Turkish army's problem is not only in war, but also in peace.
Of course it's supposed to be out.
It's the last example of the Original Power.
How was a aktivist "Chocks who are?" remained in the position to learn the question.
In the history of August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was cut off.
One day after he came to New York City, St. Louis was sit at the bed, and he began to get a family on his phone on Facebook.
I'm thinking about the part of someone from the school.
"Police killed a 18-year-old boy and still sleeps on the street."
When he found that nobody else didn't share this information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
@TheePharoah was continued to tweet again in his content shock.
The rabbit from St. Louis's area was twice the death of Michael Brown, 18 years old, an unarmed black, a white police officer killed by Ferguson Missouri.
There he shared the photo of the unreliable body on the street of Brown, four hours to stay.
Ferrell thinked himself, "It's a beast."
But death was nothing new for her or my people.
He left his phone back the same night on Canfield Drive to go back to the Twitters about the people's collection.
The police bands, the smuggling people and the brewn's father, said, "Ferguson's police killed my unarmed son a few times ago."
A police officer watched a lively publishing dog in front of a group of protesters.
Another cop in another video, said he set up the tea the tea, and lifted, "I'll kill you all... animals."
Ferrell remembered he said, "It'sn't been done."
"This is not a kind of murder we've been able to say."
That's what I feel.
I was angry and I smile."
He disappeared a ticket, and the next day he went home.
On the 11th night, she took her six-year-old daughter from his father's house and decided to go to Ferguson with her in the morning.
It comes to Ferrell and Ferguson for the following three years in August 11, "Who's Scooks?", a new documentary called.
This is a story that tells people who live in their lives and protest, love and loss, strength and vision, and the answers of the streets.
Ferrell, swearing a flowering snake, and talking about the experiences of the shoes and the political situations of her girls back in the morning.
"Remember, you remember I've taught the black people to fight for their faith?"
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that's not true.
I couldn't help him."
"Here they're here... a result of those in the past.
He must know, see, and he's got to get up in it.
Only activation and organization should be aware of what we should do in order to make ourselves free.
If I'm so lucky to live in a trial that couldn't imagine racism as personally, there's no difference between any black women and young people.
"I feel that I will make him evil from these things."
When they were to Ferguson, they were waiting for talking about the matters resulting from the police center and afterwards, Darren Wilson, who turned into a neighbouring camp for the aktivists.
There Ferrell and her daughter were connected with local workers that were prepared to eat.
They've been prepared and helped the protesters.
For Ferrell, he was a long-term new activity shape.
As a student at the Missouri State University, he said that he was a member of the Headquarters and that the justice and eating in the political society would be injured in the unjustness in the health, he said, "My Activist has become completely converted from August 9."
"I didn't have a triumph of organizing you.
He came from himself."
After weeks, Ferrell met one of the film managers, Sabaah Folayan.
Folayan said he and his manager, Lucas Alvarado-Farrar, were being and finished.
There was a question of Ferrell's mind, "Do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"
This suspicious generally was announced by a person in a countless place to be white, and a community comes to get out of his pain and skin...
As Folayan explained in a report nearby: "We heard that the voice of people who were grown could not get up and we decided to do a different way."
Folayan has already been linked to Damon Davis, a member of the area, who is known for the acts of the death penalty.
He took her join to the Ferrell's project, and in the other six-area-level, "Who's Scooks?", he saw this in the years after Brown's shot.
David said, "This is not a documentation, nor a person speaks to us, but we are the one who speaks to us."
"This is what I'm doing, how to represent these people because this is how I'm being represented."
Fondan, when he said, "If the Ferrell's trials weren't shocked, he said, "It was the most open of the world's leader, it's not a real leader."
Finally, "Who's Scooks?" is a wonderful way that Ferrell's life's personal way to marry, love and wife.
Ferrell, who laughed his Bitin's first view, said, "I feel like a swimming."
"I understood that when I did this work, and I realized that it could be a lot of harm when political people make people humans."
Moreover, Ferrell's story is playing a role in the Black Lives Matter's Black Lives' movement and put it back to the center.
In 2012, after the murder of the young young Trayvon Martin, they can both recognize the slogan of the #BlackLivesMatter in social media.
"The political equal women in the leadership generally moved in the footsteps," said Ferrell, "and this is not our continuing battle in many castles.
Black women have to take all the weight of this."
Fowan said: "Thereket is really shocked by political women and many similar political women."
However, Ferrell says, "If this isn't something in the shape of my act" and he's not selected with his identities.
He said, "He was the one who moved this energy."
"Fakat wasn't a rastic that was in front safe, because it's a lot of things that you're gonna lose life as a political equal woman in these circles.
You can feel his energy from the screen."
On the other hand, Ferguson's news cameras have been a lot, but it's a lot of worried racial connections between the police.
Ferrell's closing the car in an exhibition under the supervision of more than 2,5 years.
It is not defined by the sociopolitical atmosphere in the area that I have said in my home.
However, he holds the song that he was on the Ferguson streets just three years ago.
"We are our mission to fight for our freedom.
Residing is our task.
We need to love each other and support each other.
We have nothing else to lose from our skin."
Kyria Irving: It's not the world!
Irving, who talks to NBC Sports, "It's not a swift."
The world's seeds.
They're getting such things with fear of people.
Oh, man, don't worry about it.
Because, as much information you solve, there's some more information.
That's a ridiculous.
The world's seven?
Or is it turning around?
I think you should investigate this.
I'm telling you they're lying against our face.
They lie to us!
Irving, "I believed I wanted to believe for years."
I thought the world's soon and returned.
Do you really think we're back in the sun system?
Nothing they're sent to come back.
He's not back!
The information that you gave to us is too slow.
The reality is here.
You just have to call this truth.
"Do you understand what I'm saying?" she said.

The artist used to create the DNA of Chelsea Manning.
There are many figures that show the white, black and coffee shocked on the boxes in the middle of the New York Fridman Galerie, almost certainly unspecific.
This 30-portre artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg was created by him from the ears and hairs sent by Chelsea Manning.
After the WikiLeaks' channel was cut into the WikiLeaks, the former journalist Manning sent his cutting hair from the Fort Leavenworth prison for 35 years.
The new snake opened in August 2 is the Municipality.
This is a record of two-year-old periods between the two-year-old Barack Obama and the two-year-old posts between the task of Dewey-Hagborg, which joined the discipline in technology, computer sciences and arts.
The Dewey-Hagborg, which created 30 portres, is only the ability of the DNA data (which is many ways that can be shocked and the definition of the slogans) at the same time, it may have a little brain slightly resulted in a brain.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but more genius, clearly identified her as a woman, was in 2013, 20 criminal governments from the High Cause Act, to become a crime from computer falseness and innocentness.
He was taken from the prison press, so he was only one photo: he was sit in the shock of Manning, a shooting plate that was shocked with him, a black snake, a white snake.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborb, the 2012 project was to be successfully successful with the strike of Garip Insectors.
In this way, the artist has produced portraits from the DNA of just parts that can be swallowed by a picture of what these people could look like.
He got an email from the Magazine Magazine at that time.
"When Chelsea Manning was in prison, they did a report, and they wanted a variety of ports to be equal to this letter."
He wasn't visiting, and the photo wasn't taken, so they reached Chelsea and asked that they were interested in making a DNA portrait.
Artists and his inspired inspired friends were not expected to make a number of letters changed in two years.
Indeed, it was made by Shoili Kanungo the illustration, forgiving President Chelsea's punishment, and exhibited the imagination of a future that he was able to see.
A few days after Obama went to the book, he wanted the State of Manning, a war prisoner in Kansas, a good neighbor in the Kansas for seven injury years.
When we find new, twitterable ways, and there's a deep and strong thing about the current opening seat.
When all of these things were asked to be strange time, Dewey-Hagborg said, "Dewey-Hagborg will take place for a reason."
A artificial brain in the wall of their gates, that the sign of the dimensions of the Manning's dimensions, is under this (the heart of the "i" in the soil was placed with the heart of the harfied point), "the sexuality, the race, the sexuality and the culture's final "automatic dignity".
There's a metocondrial DNA scene against the wall: many C's, G'lers and A's...
200 harfi (and the sophisticated artist's science, the nuclear-leotides), and he wanted to tell us, at least all of us, how wonderful we look like each other.
"I hoped that people will get out of this, that the question of who we are, and how clear the genetic data is that we are, and how much it's not interesting in how sophisticated it is." In 2007, Dewey-Hagborg, the video work that we did to leave the Years.
"DNA data can tell many different stories, and that's 30 of these storys."
A page of the last part of the room in a room before the slow row that has been spoken from Rome.
Here, Manning, King Kong style, is shown when the United States gets out of the Disciplin Foreigners.
"If they've been able to swallow your swift."
"Don't ever cry with it."
Philadelphia's artist said, "This comes directly as a letter written to me."
"When I'm talking about this, it's just the way I'm going to kill."
Manning has still not seen a license personally (as it was very predominantly shocked from the Catholic book), but when he saw, the mass of its own genetic group protesters in the middle of the room will be welcomed.
Like everything in the seller, it was particularly made to the size of Manning (5"2, Manning's size).
Dewey-Hagborg said, "I've been able to put them to the wall, but I wanted to feel like a people."
"I wanted this to be seen as a worldwide, like his move behind the freedom, with Chelsea's shape. "
Northwestern Education Officer and Oxford University Employee
Police said, after a man was shocked to death in a skikago apartment, the Northwestern University of Education, who was shocked, and a person's worker was started in the country for the Oxford University.

Futballer comes to the footstep of the President.
Of course they're seeing, and they're gonna want to open your hand...
But whose player is, the President doesn't go to his feet.
You give 9 million euros to the player who took Osmansport to 300 thousand euros...
It's gonna be 9 million with a bonus.
You've done a big amount, of course you're gonna play and 7.5 will be 9...
I don't want to shut up.

Start-ups will help your company not be the next Uber.
Amy Errett wanted to deal with the happiness of working on the e-commerce start-up, but the ankets did not benefit.
The answers were generally undefined, without help or worse.
The anonymity wasn't confidence, even though some workers weren't trusted.
Errett, directed by Madison Reed, an e-commerce company in San Francisco, on his hair, says, "It wasn't no time or objection."
And he called someone out of the way to help.
A new kind of human resources appears to make sure how they feel about those who work in the company.
This is a letter which makes specific purposes to deal with those employees by licensing it with the licensing to make firms optional anchors, specific teams and demographic groups targets, Anonymous and psychological help for workers, and in some situations, and allows the employees to make up awareness towards the direct government.
My writer told Redwood City start-up and President Jim Barnett: "The tools that look for your health, such as Strava and Fitbit, but where's your company Fitbit?"
Errett, he says he's better understanding what he's thinking and feeling about three years after his workers.
Specific specific attractions and optional ankets are shown by a amount of view that the company has the most grateful parts of the company with which it is shown to be low-reliance rates, so it can make reasons for them.
The company's need to be aware of the culture of the workers to be the next Uber, and it has been a skandal in an exemplary of what the former employee has been thinking of.
It means a very rare job for start-ups like Glint.
Financial technologies website Let's Talk Payments may be $118.7 billion by 2020.
The interest and activity of Denver Colorado, the centre of start-up Convercent, which has helped the company to confirm and prevent the bad behaviors of the company, increased the discussions of Uber's disadvantage in the beginning of this year.
Convercent has some 600 customers close to Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has been registered as clients in recent times.
And Convercent, like Glint, allows them to make personalized firms detruition, to collect real-time secret answers and to get the maps of the problem areas.
It also provides a help error that can be found in the anonymous message that the workers can tell the bad behavior.
If the President is sentenced, the crimes are directly in the government.
Covercent's manufacturer and President Patrick Quinlan said, "The officers have taken place."
Quinlan said: "If a company does badly or echo its employees, the editors may remain against the smooth smoke, the worker's seat, or the reasons for the cases.
In 500 positions, Ruby Tuesday, restaurant chain that is more than 25,000 employees, is used for more than a year to provide a way to reach the company centre.
When you wanted to report a problem that worked before, the company had to find a phone number or e-mail, she was found in a official complaint and hoped that he would get seriously.
Ruby Tuesday's chief client James Vitrano said that most of these were fearful and unfortunate trials were not a good way to follow the scenarios working.
But now the company's use of Convercent, the hiding of the governments who are sit in offices, city or space, can be identified and resolved.
Vitrano, who managed Ruby Tuesday's risk leadership, said, "I can draw closer to this experiment with a 360 degrees of view."
"We protect our feelings against the cases of work."
In 2002, the defence firm Arthur Andersen's Ethical Scanda was more seriously engaged in 2002, because of the moral skandal of Ethical values, the firms, the values and the workers' relations with them, Quinlan.
But when they came to the social media, they noticed that the companies would not prevent the virus of the slaughter.
"Before you use technologies to check it, people used hope as a strategy."
He's got Glint and Convercent's writings as a service, and they get repayments to use their products.
This is a job model and opportunities that deserves the risk manufacturers who support each start-up.
Convercent; Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital funded $10 million, and led the total payment to $47 million.
Glint paid $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners and funded $60 million.
When the company's nature, cultures and risk flows are not very surprised, it's not really surprised.
Research shows that today's employees are expecting more than their workers.
The high wages and interesting projects, such as the Silico Valley, are just minimum needs.
They want to feel that they are accepted, that they are given valuable and that they give their time to a positive mission.
Hem Convercent and LinkedIn's global values and workers' experience assistant Nina McQueen said, "If people have been happy to be a company, when they feel that they have heard their voices, and if they have done a good job, they're more busy to smile that company."
The producers make good profits when their portrait companies have been making good jobs; the company, the workers, the feeling of the company, and the feeling of good work.
If the third party analysis machines are going to increase the integrity and identity of those working, it is not surprised to find support.
It is important to have data on the dependance of the workers, according to their cultures.
But data, if the company's responsibilities don't move, it's not useful.
In fact, a company can create an expectation that if he wants to reverse the employees.
And if the waiting isn't enough, or if it's not coming, it's able to generate a disaster, and it can feel like the workers have cut off.
Russell Raath said, "You're going to ask for 4000 proposals, you'll be ready to prepare for 4000 conversations."
"Why if you don't follow, the workers will think, 'Do you really hear me?
Are you worried?
And if you don't care, why do I care?
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who worked for a month, has been reported about a problem in Glint.
And after re-encoding the mechanism of decision-making and communication quality, it was reorganized by various teams in the company and added communication training to solve problems.
In Ruby Tuesday, the company takes new drinkers on his own workers, and in a long time this is expected to be able to make more employees in a higher number of workers in this industry.
Vitro said, "If you don't depend on creating a cult, you'll lose people."
"or if you lose people, you'll lose customers.
And when you lost your customers, you'll lose your company."
It's a long day for Bruins to remove NCAA's two adventures every day.
They're coming to 11 a.m. and they're going to discuss a new squad of a UCLA football player in the village of the team.
Some have shocked their shape, showing the shocked secrets of the first day in the education camp.
For some of the important parts of the team, these white minutes have a swimming molla.
After three hours, he'll return to the record classs to the players, and he's going back to the final tests of waterman to the Futbol Centre next morning.
Bruines' cousin said soon before Jim Mora came back to the market, he said, "On the three days, a complaint for these men."
Those who ordered to remove the burden on the players, the NCAA was removed two adventures on the day, at least until the end of the Sunday was completed.
That's why the first three UCLA players were programed to start at 715 nights, as they could be able to spend on the hard program.
It's more than a day's repercussion for two attractions on the day, and Bruins is taking close to one week at the beginning of the camp, and he's working at the school during Mora's sixth season in Westwood.
In September, they planned to make a 18-augmentation until 20 August before they start their official game preparations against texts A and M.
Mora said that even though the players were added to the work programme, NCAA supported the changes in the rules.
And Mora said, "We are wearing the loads for three or four days, and this is very hard."
"And they have passed soon from that; they work, great kids.
"I think we'll be more time when we come to the Saturday, it's really wonderful."
The UCLA will stop when he ends the camp; the Luskin Center is thinking that it was used in the swimming park and swimming floor in the rain of the football and the back of the swimming snake with a safe network.
Bruins' hotels are planned to get places from the beginning of this week, but Mora accepts that these rooms can be a problem in the season.
Mora said, "We will be our maturity."
"It's not too much to think that you're going to get somebody in a room and sit there and putting a video to the video.
If there's a video of an audience, this lady's a good thing.
But there's gonna be our security and the park's gonna be at eight.
We'll do the best of our hands.
I'm not too worried about it.
We have a plan."
Facebook's false news has increased the power of checking the story to fight.
The third party's story will send more potential false articles to checkers and show their findings under their original share; it tells them that the world's largest social weight has been struggling to fight as false news on the day afternoon.
In an explanation made on the signature website, it said that it would show the results of the story under the original article.
Facebook, which many believed that the presidential election was influenced by 2016 by a false news, is one of the mainly distributed points.
In the month before presidential elections, the French elections were held a false news and the German elections in the first century, in the case of the failure to defeat their social media, became a major policy in Europe.
On a different explanation of Facebook, Germany said that a test of verification is not starting in the United States, France, Holland and Germany.
Facebook news officer Sara Su said in a blog: "The threeth party stories want people to read and share more about what the storys are being discussed, as well as to see that people want to read and share. "
He added the words that Facebook would continue to test the "intrigent article" properties and work on other changes to reduce false news.
Number of Romans: The story of a Kale in England
In the past, the fascinant Scotney Calesi took place in a Squeeze Club, and Margaret Thatcher became a shoe in 1970 and 1980.
But now, sweetheart hair, a sweetheart, by Jamie Rhodes, who inspired a Roman line, inspired by a New Yorkshire document, was a 700-year-old witness at the Bewl Neri in Kent.
"I'm so nice to look at someone who died for 300 years."
"Why's a personal link to keep this letter with you."
A Kale in the British, a Kale, who was launched to the Middle Tower, describes a different artist in Scotney's name of the United Kingdom (Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg) for remitting the family.
This is not the first book of Rhodes: he also wrote the dentists of the Dead Mans and other stories in the British Library in 2014 that was unexpectedly found in an unexpectedly emotional project.
"A two-five agent, who worked for the sides of the Klar James, was fully filled with my eyes to leave the legs of a letter written in 1700."
"It was his head ring!
The letters are always shocking because then you shooted a fire for light.
For somebody in the future for 300 years, this sweet seems he's in there.
Oh, I like the archives."
As a loved man to the old papers, I've been able to support the National Trust and English Art Council and to spend nearly four months in a kitchen.
The Rhodes' days were detected the "yeen" of the Viktor, launching the archives and striving the walls of the patch, and the shodes of the shodes, as well as the shodes of the centuries, worked with many shoes and antiquities.
He talked to the artists who worked on the illustrations of the book with fears, gardens, and sometimes with their old land and remains.
Then the nights were "beating a visa and writing."
National Trust's complete access but it's not known to the detailed history of Scotney because he was able to reach the last award in 2006 when Elizabeth Hussey died.
When Rhodes arrived over a decade, the officer began to take the copy, and he said, "Hither centuries the aristocrats said, "Oh, take him in the tent."
Days, the letters from the British Imparatority Day defined the borders of whom it has: "Do you think that the uncontracts would be hard." Rhodes says, "The tree that was struggled on two families.
Go on, man!
The Labourer, who abandoned the new castle to participate in the village of 1381, uses some of the storys of the collection as a shock to make an enlargement in the English history.
"In this book, Ken and Sussex's family named the Covenant Family, there's a record that was revocated in 1380 in the kitchen."
"Islaughter started in this circle, and I thought it could be a good starting point.
Maybe these two are connected?"
The Priest, the story of Darrell's family, who has seven years to hide an English priest during the slaughter, is slightly connected with the history of the other stories.
Or the Smuggler, who has been filled with a stone, has thought that the 18th century fleeting of the Arthut Darrell was placed in the 18th century.
Darrells at the most eyes of Rhodes' Scotney's family: "That men seemed like widespread, they're always paying for things that they didn't face.
In other things, Darrell men decided to marry their responsibilities with rich old women, and I imagine them as a group of attractive men who are in a position to build women's varieties."
Rhodes, who finished the mission in the kitchen, searched for other machines.
In Fin's illicit life, a two-week line on the Rom of Life, which was covered in the beginning of the 20th century.
But Scotney's holding a different place on his own side.
"I'm sorry that I'm so sorry."
"Oh, now I'm going to go, and I have to face the real life."

The Greatman, the Social Media and the "The Old Marksists' Bridges" by means of the MHP's "kin" expression, "in order to prevent the MHP's existence in the next 12th September."
Grandma said:
"There is how weakening that does not know the history of the Trust People, how weakening the Turkish's state, the crime file, the ideology, the smoothness of the mind, the hands of the smuggle."
"These are now out of the MHP, 410 members and 215 of the new history of MHP Bursa."
250 infringements are wrongly controlled by uncommon news, such as 300 advertisements.
The newspaper was lied in the newspapers. It was deeply angry.
The number of men in the past is not going to pass the number of incentives in our hands, as they are not talking about.
The Greatman, who was in the "sweethe" quality of the suggestions, said that he was still in the "sweet" and that he was still working to be wrongly dominated and to do the instrumental governance.
The grandma said, "They will prefer the propaganda and the campaigns that have returned to the MHP."
MHP, who brought MHP to say that the Turkish government was an important and unforgettable actor, said:
The former Marksists are not enough to defeat MHP's conscience of the Turkish people.
All the circumstances that are done are a smooth count behind the methods of application.
Because political and medicals have seen your eyes to the MHP table.
When we are among us, no good work and no ambitiousness of the party does not mean anything in us now.
What's the game of those who don't have to make the account of our hearts?
In their lives, the MHP did not touch the MHP, our memory did not share, our people did not understand, did not participate in the fight, even when he has always been shocked, his heart stoned, and his heart must find other integrity.
The United Nations's Unity and Alliance of the Party is an effort in the brain to spend a conversation and hip out.
And he will turn back and shoot his own.
The U.S. Hareket is the last cast of the Turkish nation, despite the heavy strikes.
In explanation, the Greatman, "Peace-Carters" and "Peace-in-laws" for those who have made MHP targets, "It's not unlike the military movement."
And he said: "There will not be able to reach their purposes.
The MHP's Greatman, who used the swimmingness of the snake, explaining the defence partys and the terrorist organizations, was found in the arguments: "The CHP's HDP, who would do so until the PKK's FET, will not be able to operate on its own framework. "
Last night, we called for the new tactics and games of those planned MHP without Turkey, and we struggled to the end of MHP ungodliness, without MHP Meclis.
Now we're gonna break the games, we're gonna cut the players off.
"The capital of the country is in the MHP," Meral Akshener, said, "I'm going to bring Maho villages to Germany, and after he's walking in the trail camp a day, how if it leaves it on the mountain of Istanbul's hill, it's the roots of their legs that I'm going to take you to the junction, and I'm going to leave you to the board."
It is their matter, but the only desires of these men are the new places.
Kjaer took a sign to Sevilla.
He signed the official agreement of Kjaer, which was transferred to Sevilla from the heat-based team, and which was the most precious transfer of the Spanish team.
The Danish star will shoot for four numbers in Sevilla.
The great easierness of THY's expected families
According to the explaining of the THY Pusin Museum, travellers continue to develop new ideas for my perfect travel experience.
In this way, the age of 0-2 has been prepared for a childâ€™s needs in the study of the needs of children and their family, and the streets in Austria have been launched by the travellers.
The kit prepared with a specially designed kit; the low changing terms, the single use of the mamma, the skin cream, the sweet lesion and the skill, the swimming smuggle and the swimming snack.
Parababy, alcohol, and smell chemistry were produced in front of the injury of the babe citizens.
Washington changes Green Card Rules
According to the medya, President Donald Trump said that a new US Migration plan would be a change in the Green Card rules.
Legal immigrants are offering a decrease of 50,000 per cents per year, a more seventh rules and a family management visa for temporary work permits.
The new rules were offered by the Deputy and supported by the President.
The law of the Congress will be discussed on both sides.
"This law will reduce the fairness of the law, increase the payment and call for thousands of dollars for tax winners, and will make it changed by the form of the Green Card to change its people in other US citizens.
The law will reduce the cinth of the citizens, and take the place of my rule.
It will benefit from the talents that will be able to have the financial resources and our economic value to those who are able to speak in English."
The writers joined the Fenerbrood-Storm Graz game
Two years ago, I didn't find, and I didn't see, and I've seen it again. Women...
It was a shooting team that Kocaman was shocking to make a "speak heart-sharing" agreement with the side.
We can bring the game to positions or practices, but I didn't see a game that works so long.
He realized in the first game, but last night his apostles were on his own side, and the commander of the Fenerbahja's head now.
It was a problem when it was transferred, but Kocaman said, "Only unexpected character."
30 years ago, we gave the name of the atomic woman's name to RÄ±za Schalimbay.
If you get out of your head, the French player's going to be the most closest.
He was in all places of the coast, joined all the passing organizations, was always responsibilities, and shooted a slow-scale dimension.
The playing before Alper left the Storm Graz team for a long time.
When he was shocked and closed, he was continuously calling a form to shoot a hard wall without shooting the carriage.
They're judged, but they're not gonna produce a kind of smooth and punishment.
This painting can bring the "santrfor needs", but we're opposing the only santrfor play that doesn't go to the position of Ahmethan.
Or the team doesn't trust youth player, or the trainer needs to get up a little bit more.
After Skor 1-1, they didn't benefit from two net chances.
Towers were important, but it would be better for the night to shoot the player's shooting in the legs of the shooting.
Maybe 1-2 new transfer will come to the market.
But the reality is that the biggest need for Phenerbaches is 12...
We're on the side of this game that's a very brilliant and charming session of the hearts of those in the trib that try to play before.
It's the Kocaman's machine, and he needs a little more time.
They're good as physical quality.
The quality of the game will be developed.
You're so clean that all footballers in the back of the shooting have increased their freedom.
You need a lot of shocks last night for a new page.
And we need to be worried about sex robots.
It's a new report about the technological developments in the sector when you think that you can't even be surprised by 2017.
Yeah.
Sex robots are now a great event.
In the past five-10 years, the questionnaire Robot Scientific Institute (FRR) published a report of the headquarters of the sex robots.
We must take them seriously, according to Noel Sharkey, a robotic and intelligent professor who is in the University of Sheffield.
The customers can choose the eyes color of the robot, the shape and the ring type.
Mr. Sharkey said about the publication of the new report: "Those are laughing to them, but the companies actually love a lot more and we will see them more."
Modern sex babys have a warm silicon grain that can touch the like, specially made by humans.
Users can also personalize their robots from the eye color, the slightly shape and the skin type, or the color of their own blood.
But as many robots have "persons" to show a Stepford woman innovative, that's an unfortunate one.
The modern sex kids have been obtained by the silk-deck robots.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows users to personalize the character of the character that they found their own robots.
Then True Company has Roxxy Gold Sex robots, who have been developed by the "Friti Farrah" and the "Free Farrah" personality of the "Vachi Wendy".
True Companion's website says, "The Roxxy Gold has a reliable personality when your personality is possible."
So what you love, you love her, what you don't like, vb.
Also, there are spirits in the day like the true people.
He can sleep, he can want to talk, or he can be "this is in mode".
There are many disappointed sides of sex robots: not only take the place of real human relations but also obedient women's personality, the most delicate shocks when they close to Friit Farah.
True Companion on the website, I'm putting Roxxy to a vibrator, but it's for men.
"If the woman can be a vibrator, why don't men be Roxxy?"
Whatever these sex robots aren't just a fashion or sex players.
Their exhibition and deterioration of their culture marks the more darkness and deepest things, the equality of sexual equality from the ideal dimension of a optional dimension of the sex.
Many men naturally do not find sex robots, and the FRR is taking place in the outside of the smoke culture.
But those who escape the flights can be a high-scale teacher about the time we live.
Many people are not strange or attacked until they give them the right to be such.
In White Saray, this sophisticated sex robots would not appear in a period that threatened women's rights in the world.
The Handmaid's Tale TV's most tights of the tubercular side, the stables that show all details of the details, the scientific body or the played eyes, but the reality of the appearance.
There is a change in the Gilead Conference, but it isn't feeling like a great change now.
A lot of physical similarity to women (tabii, porno film stars) is possible in terms of technology that these sex robots are possible.
The Creators want to give human feelings when they touch, and they want to follow the movements of a real body.
But when the work comes to their personality, robots could not be clearly represented by the real women.
They can't leave their husbands or they can't leave them.
There's no business or history of past, no one's going to put out their debts, no one's total slave fantasy.
Another means they are the slaves who are inherited.
Or with the count of 2017: charitable.
Attaching the American Army Convoi: the dead and the blessed...
Afghanistan's chief attack in the Caribbean's murder was targeted by foreign military forces in the country.
1 NATO soldiers and three civilians were shocked, 5' American soldiers on the convocation, and 1's operating with NATO forces.
In explaining its NATO support force (resolute support) in Afghanistan, the NATO forces were declared that in the course of a mid-range mission with the Afghan National Army, the killing bombs was slaughtered.
The lawyer's Bagram aircraft was explained that he had been treated under the U.S. Military Hospital.
It's not the danger of the wicked ones.
The killer is the Taliban menu in the local bag.
Trump's great castle?
To show Mitt Romney's health as a team.
The reality of the Trump era is the micro-scale of the political section of the US choices.
The Christmas and Thanksgiving newspapers in the United States were filled with how the friends who played to Trump would be successful.
We're all trying to filter our own filters in my word.
The least talking about it is the power to bring Trump's family together.
This is because my neighbor who lives in Chicago and who is in our family, is visiting us in New York this week.
He remembered me that the association could have a strong impact on a interface enemy.
Everyone who has known the Sovereign Lord Trump about the political in the White House for ten years has been found in the same way, a strange way.
Of course, that's a good thing in the evening table, but it's like me that it's going to bring these important risks in a wide connection.
The left, which was created by Trump, but the impact of the presidency was made on the right mind for everybody.
When we talked about "Norming" and Trump, we're talking about his strange behaviors a day, we're afraid that it couldn't be shocked anymore.
There's a more thrilling senator that Trump's healthy civilians are "normalized" and they seem to be the symbol you're able to do.
I'm looking at Mit Romney's disappointment about the ridiculous version of the driving version, and I'm going to say, that the dog in the car's car, %14's fellowship (but at least we knew what it looks like, at least, like his payment, and that both of them are very nice crimes to Trump.
When Trump goes, the next Deputy Chairman must be in mind only to assess the progress that the next Deputy Chairman has made.
When my neighbor was in the city, we brought our kids to the fleet at Central Park, New York Parks need the most magic and coffee, or you can get the best role in the city.
The horses are slightly large, centrally swimming, (all strange shocks and animals have returned to the fear of their own owls) and a shocked musical swimming.
In other words, many clinics of a city can be imagined: high buildings start to come swimmingly, and they start to know how to create a lot of delicate lines, and they do not reach the reality of the city.
It's been thirty-five years, and I still don't have a Swiss cottage red home, but I couldn't come out of the day that I realized that I was a large return in North London.
Whatever it's, I still have an extraordinarily magic experience when I'm shooting at Central Park, so two people two years old, a 11-year-old person and two women in the 40s can go here, and all can take a very good time.
If I couldn't give him a shooting, I would've given him completely, but nobody's grateful.
On the other hand, I was requested to be evaluated between 1 and 5 stars before I passed my credit card in a bunch this week.
The same thing is on the coffee box on my street board, the choice of combined with 15% of the coffee; for the buying from the...
This effect is not only to accelerate the need to be an unrelated trade, but also to make the pressure to win an unnecessary personality on the server.
When a sweet woman shocked on his legs like the languages, I tried to try to make her credit card.
When heat passed 41 degrees, they closed myories.
The people who lived from one of the warmest days of my friends in Tunzur's places.
With the good pressing of the nighttimes, youths, kids, old, women and men were trying to protect the warmths, such as waters, and the warmths.
In particular, German, Dutch, French, and England, the Tunsel citizens, who live in countries such as Germany, the Dutch, the Dutch, the French and the United Kingdom, were filled with the stones of the Munzur Tea in the area.
Suna Tosun, a place among those in the Punzur Beach, has been used instead of the west instead of the Tunceli, "I didn't want to pass my rent in the west, and the family was more correct to stay in our own land."
And he said: "The water of the Moon is not in any place of the world, and the Sovereign is forgiving us in these temperatures.
The Hasan Ulu from Germany was that we prefer the Munzur Lake in Tunisia instead of shocking or bodrum clouds, and therefore he said that they didn't worry.
Oscar Pistorius was carried out in the hospital with pains of pain.
This is the second time to visit Pistorius's prison in the hospital.
Last year, after the decline in the prison officials, he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of the cyclopedia that he had come to the cardiovascular cell.
Pistorius was put in the murder after the murder of the murderer's murder.
In the early hour of 2013, the Love Game killed Steen Camp at the house of Pretoria once on the door of a toilet kitchen.
Pistorius told her that she was confusing someone who was in the night hiding her friend in the castle.
The Defenders explained that they were thinking that Pistorius's six-year-old punishment was once again.
The National Countries Thanksgiving, he said he would take care of the South African High Court and could be assessed this year.
Pistorius, if the defenders are successful, they will remain against the punishment of 15 years of punishment.
There is no death punishment in South Africa.

Two Bulgarian law fighters were arrested in Greece with the truth
Foreign works are explained by the Department and by the BTV, two Bulgarian law camps were arrested in Greece with the need to do a illegal camp.
Two illegal groups were arrested by the police in Sitonia, 1 August.
They were left on the same day when they continued to investigate.
The Foreign Office reported that the Bulgarians were left later.
The Greek authorities slowed their controls on a slow camp, and even though they have severe punishment to those who weren't left for that purpose.
It's going to be controlled during my office.
The government said that the court could stop the crime.
We won't go back to Holland before we find him.
JOEY Hoffman (22) went to Turkey to travel with two friends on Monday.
With their skills Adana and Mersin, Joey Hoffman lost in Silifke on September 8th.
The friends came to Beraber, noting the situation in the Netherlands, despite all the searches.
When the police moved to find a lost turisti, Brother Robin Hoffman and his friends, Angelo DurÃ© and Jaimy Gewald Adana.
BASTIRIP DASTITIES
Robin Hoffman, who was here at the police office, had lost declares for his brother's finding him and cut off in Adana and Mersin.
Robin Hoffman's brother's reports on the last 8th July, "We've been in the police in Holland."
Then we came to Turkey with my two friends, and we'd get the police here.
We didn't find any news until that.
"We'll stay in Turkey until my brother is found."

The last word: "I'm dead, I'm the mother."
"I don't want to say, it's never just."
"Thank everything you've done for me, and it's explained that it's the Italian Gloria Trevisan and the love of me."
Some of them who hadn't been known after the wine were also placed by the 26-year-old Gloria Trevisan and Italian boyfriend Marco Godardi, who sits on the 23th 24th age of the building.
The lawyer of the Trevisan family in the north of Italy, Maria Christina Sandri, said that they received the information from the English authorities that two gentlemen were able to win their lives.
He also asked the lawyers that the young people say that their families are a great painful life, not to explain the newspapers about this.
I think I'm dead, my mother.
The lawyer Sandri, Gloria, soon after his outcome, told her mother that she had called Emanuela Trevisan with a phone telephone, and listening to the last conversation that his mother had stored.
It says that Gloria Trevisan had talked to her mother for a few hours from the starting time at 1.00 p.m. at local time.
Trevisan, who was more quiet in the first conversation, said, "Mama, it's going to happen bad things here, that's out."
We've been struggling, we can't get out of here.
There's a little stop, but we're waiting for being saved.
"We tried to get out of the door, but there was a lot of silence, and he wasn't working too much."
The last words of Gloria Trevisan, who were concerned about the following calls, were the following:
Mom, my whole life's coming out of front of my eyes.
I think I'm dead.
There was a life that I could live before me, that's not just.
I don't want to die and I want to help you as a material.
I'm sorry I can't get you anymore.
Thank you for everything you've done for me. Of course, Mom.
I'm going to the Paradise now and I'm gonna help you from there.
This is an Italian government error
Each of them, Gloria Trevisan and his friend, Marco Godar, were difficult to find work after the last year's feast, moved from the northern Veneto area to London in March.
In the country only 300 euros, Gloria Trevisan, was started to work in London for a short month of 1800 sterlins (e.g. 2060 euros).
Avocat Sandri, Gloria Trevisan, said that his family had a difficult day from the opening of the material, "Gloria went to London to help his family."
Unfortunately, our young people have to leave their country to save their futures and find their jobs.
He said, "I must find my solution to this problem."
It's the dragon of Italy that can't make their young people a job.
Gloria's father, Loris Trevisan, also said, "This is our government's fault that is difficult to escape our youth to find our job."
When the unemployment rate in Italy reached to 12 percent, the rate between young people is 40 percent.
According to the increase in this problem, many Italian youths began to turn into many European countries to start in English for the last few years.
Only last year, the number of young people who have to leave Italy because of the unemployment has passed 110.000.
Gloria Trevisan and Marco Godardi, in the Italian press of the death news, also stated that a country that couldn't make their young people jobs.
Red, milk products and chycorta IBH
Red and chocolate voice can come like a shirt for your system.
However, a new work is called a complete action: the basic protein and milk products can help to defeat the indications of those who are smuggled from the skin disease.
In the United States, 1.3 million and the United States are because of the health situation that affects 300,000 people in the United Kingdom, or the disease of craps and browns, again or blood, the loss of kg and lower weight.
In general, if it is suggested that the diseases are able to defeat their milk products, researchers at the University of Washington have found that protein late aminoazide tritofa is helped to develop the deterioration cells that develop a deteriorational deterioration.
The first researcher Dr. Marco Colonna explained that the infringement of microscopes in the body would not be secretly entered in the body.
Cells, which are likely to strive to plan up, are encouraged by cells to protect harmful documents by protecting them.
If Denge's planning is too much, it can result in illness if it's injury.
In the experiments, a variety of skin cells that encourage a specific bacteria in skins have been shocked in a variety of skin cells.
And bacteria needs a triptophana of one of the stones of protein to detect the appearance of cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have connected the bacteria, which is part of a microbiology of Lactobacillus, between the development of the cell-based population. "
"The works that were more tritographic in the dry were more than those cells."
If the same thing happens in people, L. Reuters and Tritophans continued to make it more fair than a rich food, less interested, and less interested.
After the doctor, researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas found that a group of experiments had these cells but was the same as a group that had a different place.
It was suspected that the bacteria, viral and skin bacteria were normally living in the mid-graduate channels of bacteria, virus and skin.
Fare was made to the DNA scenario and that six types of bacteria were discovered, but in the cases that were not.
In a steriil environment, L. has been reutered in the works that do not develop depression cells and appeared in grain cells.
For researchers to understand how the bacteria has affected the depression system, they increased the reuter in the heat, and then switched less than those bacterium-free cells that were insufficient on the bacteria.
The cells that encouraged the depression of the cells have turned into the pathway.
At the time of the active part, it appears that indol-3-style, known tritophan metabolism, was a result.
Scientists increased the number of cells at 50% in the circle, but when the tritophin levels were sent to half of the cells.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan expressed that there were cells that encouraged people to shoot, and most of them were shuttled in the channel of L. Reuteri.
It is not known that tritophans from L. Reutter and products have been developed in people's faces, but in the state of disorders of the genes that have a deterioration of the disease.
He said, "It's something we'd like to encourage the development of these cells because these cells control the communication on the surface of the skin.
Possiblely, L. Reuter's tritophin on high levels is due to the expansion of this popularity."
Jose Mourinho thinks that Manchester United has been signed with Nemanja Matic
After the mid-spot player came to the first shop against Sanmpdoria, Jose Mourinho, Matthew United signed a "the dawn" with Nemanja Matic.
The transfer of 40 million Â£ from Chelsea began with the 2-1 helmet of Dublin in the EUFA Super Kupa, which was held on the last session before the United Nations, and was able to be in the entire position when Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were engaged in the whole position.
What's the fact that the Matic was a degree of slight conception, which was left out in Asia before, and only 45 minutes ago, and Mourinho Premier Lig was pronounced that it should be improved before the beginning of the session.
Mourinho said, "I need a vaccine, but my experience, my skill, my thinking way... is thinking that futbola."
"We'll help him to be ready early."
When Mourinho started sharing the first 11th stage, like Matic, new transfer friends Victor Lindelof and Roman Lukaku went to Aviva Stadi.
The Independent showed that this week Mourinho still wants to transfer three more, but the club has already pursued the three of its four priority transfers by claiming that he had issued "a great job."
He added, "Thank you to the club because you took the fourth."
"I'll be more happy if they take four out of four, but they've made great effort for me."
Last year, 197 people were sent to the hospital.
The SUVIS Social Relief Court reported that in 2005, hundreds of thousands of persons were slowed to 8 per cent in 2015.
Astrid Lindgren Child Hassan in the last year, most of the injuries of the child and 197 young people were observed.
In the same hospital, a missionary child psychiatrist Lousise Frissen said that it could be a source of a more open society, "that may be a general development in the public of the explicit psycho-sexuality community.
There is no connection with sexual inadequacy.

Transfer to New Malatyaspor
The super Lig's new team Emkur New Malatyaspor connected to the colors of the Turgut DoÄŸan Chahin in the last season.
According to the explanation made by the heat club, transfer workers were signed two years of agreement with a 29-year-old channel player.
When it was explained, "The player has been made a two-year agreement with the Turgut Orthoan Witness, which was dressed in the country.
Be good for my new Malatyaspor." It was used for expressions.

The White House's Show was cut down to thousands
According to the military records explained to TIME, a helicopter decision was to be made up to $24,000 for a United States manufacture of White Saray last month.
When the President was shipping, the organization was also known as a green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, the United States building programs in White Saray on 17 July.
President Donald Trump, President-in-law Mike Pence and the Chief White House officers, moved the products produced on the whole 50th.
Helikopter made in Connecticut, a main bed, a swimming truck from Wisconsin, and a Mississippi for a fork.
Helikopters are responsible for the work of the marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1): White Saray Harp Dairesi requested the Helikopter's expertise (FRAGO) only 36 hours before helicopters couldn't be able to switch on the south for the "all-speaking" organization.
HMX-1's commander, one day ago, from the organization of the best marine aircraft commander, said, "I wanted to be sure that you'd be aware that you're aware of it because that's an extraordinary high-speed organization."
The message indicated that helicopters would come on to the 3th organization after helicopters on Tuesday 17th morning, and there would be 6 to 9th, until he was cleaned.
Not, if we're late out of the White House, he'd need a second flight team to turn up the mission-time limits.
One of the security personnel was in helicopters during the original aircraft organisation when he stopped in the air transportation.
It's not clear that the reports for TIME have not been necessary for a second flight departure.
The Hatch Law prohibits the use of the government's assets with political purposes.
The record shows that HMX-1 is investigating that the organization does not interfere with this requirement.
Commander said, "The question we asked was that Hatch Law wasn't abolished, and it was announced that he didn't have us."
"It seems to be sweet." Commander Vekili.
The "Made in America" organization was defined as a official organization by the White House and does not enter the Hatch Law.
But official organizations' political ideas.
The President of the Organization then expressed the efforts to reform the health services that continued in the senate and encouraging their government arrangements.
The use of the marine One or Air Force One is not a new event.
The presidents need to use this to travel.
But it's amazing that it's only the official way to use a photo to be taken.
Trump looked at the point when the president of the president in Melbourne Florida was shocked back to the first stage camp in October, and the Twitter account was fully able to see the message about the use of the President's aircraft.
White Saray's helper Lindsay Walters said, "Black Saray is grateful to the "Made in America's 50-earth workers' products that are made by American employees."
HMX-1, we're often training flights in the Washington area, and it's going to leave the President of the United States in the south of the United States with a position to the White Saray.
