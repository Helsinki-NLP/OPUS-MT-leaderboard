What's going on? CSSD didn't know Voldemort or pasture in Prague.
The new CSSD elections at the capital's master must apparently overcome a real language barrier to understand at the level of the municipal advisory with their old and new ODS colleagues.
Actual.cz has "test" the new members of the CSSD municipal council, to know if they know the argot that has been born over the past few years to Mayor, when they were partners of the current coalition in Prague.
The vocabulary coded that the Prague's political cream has moved through the previous era of Master Pavel Well describes some of the personalities, situations and causes of the metropole.
It is surprised that it was found that the new elections do not understand well the known terms.
They say it at least.
"Who is Valdemort."
"I don't really know."
"I'm a youth in the Prague policy reacted Lukas Kaucky, the election to culture at the test of the word "parrain".
And with regard to the political veteran, the election Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example, the sense of "golf triumph".
"It's the only expression among those you propose I use."
I don't use the argument.
From the vocabulary, which was published in June of this year before the Pre-ectoral Congress of the ODS, the edition chose 6 examples, in priority those related to Prague's mastership.
Socialists had to explain the sense of "Voldemort", "the largest golf troop in Prague", alliancing to the patience, "boouf nerve", "Traison of Capital" and "onyler".
Three elections were agreed for the quiz, the fourth Antonin Weinert, who must lead to the education in Prague in the future - promised first, but then did not decrease the phone.
The fifth election Petr Dolinek carefully refused the test.
"I'm not worried about all these things here and how the representatives of the citizen democracy are pleasing: I will not give my opinion."
"I now care about the way we will understand in the framework of our programmes," he reacted.
As we have heard, the elu Lukas Kaucky apparently did not recognize in the above legend, that it is Janosek's influence on the entrepreneurs and friends of the former Roman Wel.
"Voldemort" doesn't say anything to Kuucky, and the only expression he has come to the test is "the largest golf strike in Prague".
"This is the Blanka tunnel," said Kucky immediately, "I know newspapers."
"I'm going to pay me a language course," pleasing it.
Not only murderer Karel Brezina but also Lukas Plachy, who is elected for the environment, know that the golf troop is the tunnel of Blanko.
The two social-democratics know who really is Voldemort and Lukas Plachy knows the place where he finds personality - he thinks about "to the pasture."
"I think it's going to go to a company," Plachy is ready to consider that it's Janosek's company seat.
On your same Brezina recalls that he takes his knowledge instead of newspapers, not from any vocabulary he would use.
According to the test candidates, there is no luxury in the social democracy.
"I took advice with colleagues and it seems that we really have nothing like this."
"We say the names are sometimes used for abreviations and symbols," said Peter Hlynsky, President of the Social-Democratic Party, calls the members of the Party Hulda.
"We called Briza at the school, but I don't know if my colleagues call me like this, says Karel Brezina about the surnames.
The current daily.cz tested the name and it walks.
The El Lu Weinert is Papy for the members of the Party or the least older Petit, the representative Miroslav Poche, who attracted his attention before the elections during the sponsoring of the party, is called "the small game".
The surnames are also the only ones who allow to employ within the Party the social-democratics.
It seems not much like Hulinsky listening to Hulda, but the newspaper Kutel.cz recorded another name for this Prague President.
"Doctor in Matraque Law" seems to have Petr Hulinsky's title in law JUDr. At the Bratislava Police Academia.
The Government wants to reduce the torture of "sourders" has edited a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, widow women declared have common trafficking.
They are instead part of old generation, for example they can not work for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one who becomes "sorci√®re" is isolated to not threaten the rest of the village.
"The man has this destiny very rarely."
"We do not judge young women healthy because they participate in the work and accept children," said a sister who is employed in the capital of this West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special establishment of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to act against this inhabited "social measure".
He edited a brochure that should help limit the chase to her sisters.
The case is a hic.
"Besides 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso do not know read," reported the daily The Standard on the inconvenience of written education.
In other African countries, the accused of sorcellery is common.
In Ghana, the neighbor of Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman, was deceived after being tortured by three women, and a man then burned with the oil they asperged her.
This is the BBC server that has transmitted this information.
Criminals claim that it was a bad eye.
According to their version, the oil that serves to ritual onions was fled in the contact of the woman.
The oil was flamed, like him, when the team wanted "Cut the bad spirit" of the woman.
The isolation of "social" is approved by people of all levels of education.
The newspaper The Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur of Burkina Faso: "The eating of human spirit has always represented a danger," he says.
While Burkina Faso seeks to reduce the chase to hersters, the Gambia is not later than last year saw the President himself.
"The President of Gambien Dzami, after the death of his tea, launched a large chase to her sisters who, like he, would have participated in his death and would be efforted by the black magic to also kill the President."
"The calls from Guinea nearly came to the rescue, they brought to the strong president in Kavali, under the protection of police and personal guards of the President, men and women elected in the villages of Gambie," reported the International Amnesty.
The injury had to drink a plant base on hallucinogen effects that caused other effects on the nests and intestins.
Two prisoners haven't survived.
On international pressure, it is about a thousand people who were released in freedom.
The localist of Bakal: The pools are heating, he signed a higher lounge.
A old man implanted is out of the door of the client centre of the RPG Byty company of the "carbon bar" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments to be lodged in the Czech Republic.
He brought a file with three new location contracts for three apartments: the sien, the daughter of his daughter and his son who came to purify a punishment.
Deregulation has increased the loan to these three people.
Instead of paying 3500, the son must regulate from the next year for a 2+1 apartment of second category 4100 corners.
"And there is no warm water and heat functions with solid fuel," shows the doigt on the new contract of his son, the man who has the power of signing.
"But I ever signed," he explained not to reason for anger and half resigned.
The civilian association of BytyOKD.cz apartments that described the new location conditions as "immoral and indecent", recommends the localists not signing and waiting until 7 December, date to which a notice will be published to explain the method to follow.
But the man reacts to this by a man's gesture.
"The one says this, the other says something else," frozen the smells.
The Ostrava region is the laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, this is what is expected by most apartments in the Czech Republic whose loans do not correspond to the market price.
Update.cz has therefore decided to visit the "laboratory".
The RPG waiting room on the Havirovska Street is one of the four of the Ostrava region and it is already filled on Monday at 09 a.m.
Just next to the door, a security company is guarded with a device to call customers.
A special button, "location 2011" is cut on the tactil screen.
One pressure and a paper with a number out of the device.
You don't have the time to read your number "157" that your number starts to light on the large screen under the top of the waiting room.
In a second fraction, it's your tour.
After a short moment, a old couple arrives to teach himself on the lounge, but new loans seem to not relate to people in the waiting room.
Most people have come to resolve current problems as requesting repairs, insurance events and others.
In the Ostrava region, people with more than 44,000 apartments from the RPG portfolio receive emails with new dance contracts in their box for letters from half November.
RPG Byty proposes increases in loans from 15 to 38 per cent.
the special guide for new loans is open to the public since November 18th.
"He works for almost one week, so it's still at the test," said the employee behind the guest when the client is present as a journalist.
Deraguation and older apartments of Bakal smaller apartments are a very sensitive local subject.
The Vice-President of the Parliament and originate of the region of Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek of Social-Democrats has made sufficient support before the elections, and this is now filled with local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor."
"They haven't even changed me a pocket... no wc plate in the wc, the men mentioned.
However, these are particularly, according to employees, retraditions that come to be sure that they will receive a resort on the new loan price if they are now signed as the RPG promised in a special offer.
It is a resort of half of the loan amount that will receive the other loans that will have signed their new contract before 15 December.
But the "deregulation" guide of the Havirovaska Street is not really accrued by questions.
"Other 360 customers who have come here, only 40 to 50 have come to the home", says the employee at the guichet.
However, RPG puts both on its website as well as in the vitrines of individual rentals on loans when it is necessary.
If the two parties do not hear on the loan, it is an independent court that takes the decision.
'This is not threats but only to inform the unique and legal way to act legally,' states RPG on its website.
"Here no one goes to the court" thinks one of RPG Byty employees and the man on the street before the customer center gives him right.
"I have 13,000 retreat kings and there's 5000 corones to eat, I don't have enough to go to the court," he said.
The employee feels very bad at the eye.
"We're seeing."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that no one signs and therefore waits for the people," says not.
The regularity of loans ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and the increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic need.
"And moreover, the current loans do not always reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of housing funds," says Pavel Klimes, director of RPG Byty's residential portfolio, which is just the fund for housing that makes a wrathful placer, is the main reason for the increase of loan.
However, in 5 years between 2005 and 2010, RPG was able to invest 4 billion apartments, in four years 2011 to 2014, with 5.2 billion.
However, the large screen increased on the platform faced by the rear-related bugs from the Havirosvka Street Chamber, repeats some of the information specified in red.
"The increase in the household in 2011 is 15 per cent and is not less than 31200 apartments than 90 per cent of RPG apartments."
"And it will always be at least 7.50 Czech Koreans the m2 per month," states the screen.
38 per cent is only 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio.
"In these cases, it is an increase in a very low amount of 19.66 Czech Koreans to m2", adds RPG.
The next year the loan will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause radical but progressive increase in 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money of loans increase (cf. the graph) is made to apartments in the form of heating economy - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the loan increase agreement are priority.
The maternal school is part of the offices also included architects.
The Adriopoint Adriopoint building is the new seat of the Arch. Design company.
No one could expect that it also opens a small maternal school with everything that needs - color walls, imaginative furbs, games and finally a miniature field on the terrace.
Since October of the last year, the children of the employees of Arch design can be made there.
The company of Architective Projects, whose workshops have produced a large number of buildings in Brno, imagine its minimum company school since the first buildings of the Avriopoint building.
She employed about 90 people, especially the age to make children, and it was important that architects and project leaders could quickly return to work.
Similarly, as labour contracts, the maternal school is a good idea for its employees by the Arch. Design society.
Constructors and architects thus have the possibility to move to work with child care.
These are the employees of Arch.Design.It's people who imagine this mother school and with the support of the guideline they could get a donation from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The maternal school is financed by the means of the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme of Human Resources and the State Budget of the Republic of Czech.
Thanks to funding donations (a higher than 2.8.000 Czech corones), they were able to purchase equipment and equipment and after two years to ensure a qualified staff as well as to the movement.
After the use of the funding donation (2 years), the company Arch. Design. has the obligation after 3 years to make the minimum maternal school functioning on its own funds.
The preparation of the project has longed a year and is the Economy Rating company that helped to make the request for donation.
Child care is provided by a qualified staff, a nursing and a mother-institute take care of children, and children can go to maternal school without a age limit but have more than three years old.
As this is a "matter school" may only have 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more people who are replaced.
The work of the school is summary in accordance with the needs of parents and children of all employees, they have the same right to use this school without regard to the herarchical position.
While it is a care and individual education, the maternal mini school program is comparable to that for pre-scolary education.
The children do not play but a quality education there is also assured - from the beginning to the preparation of school banks are taught in English.
The class is equipped not only of imaginative games and games but also of a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents may at any time control their children and do not have the stress of a delay to go looking for children in a remote school from the home of work of parents.
Parents therefore use their work time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that a natural relationship of loyalty is created between employee and employee.
Arch.Design. is thus registered among companies offering a bonus choice for the recruitment of new employees and who are friendly towards the family and through this programme enhance the marketing of RHs.
The house in fascinates still 100 years later. Get a look in Gaudi's interiors.
The toilet is similar to two of a prehistorical saurine, the scalar to a verteer column of dinosaur and the balcones with open fish shoes.
This is the house of Casa Battlo in Barcelona, Architect Antoni Gaudi.
As a result of its organic forms, the house received the name of House in os from the locals.
Organic forms, wild colors, inhabitable stone use, carreal fragments and mosaics, recording sketches and sketchs, this is all that is sweet for the New Art of Antoni Gaudi.
The front fa√ßade of the house runs its dream lines, colors and pleasant textures that remember the nature and animals.
During a more detailed observation, you see geometry, rythm and order with precision.
In the night the house's fa√ßade becomes more dramatic and is slowed in such a way that the printing of colours is strengthened.
The rotation and torment of forms appear in the interiors with the same measure.
The wood copies the window frameworks, the ballasts, the decorative elements of the doors, the oilton and the lamps.
The Battlo house that is located in the Eixample district on the market street Passeig de Gracia at the number 43, was born from the construction of a house of 1877 from the architect Emilio Sala Courts.
Reconstruction has been made for two years and the house finished in 1906.
The investor Joseph Battlo, a rich entrepreneur, first emphasized the demolition of old construction and the construction of any other new but quickly accepted the idea of Gaudi's inhabited and better market reconstruction.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a house in multiple housing was not thought by Gaudi alone.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It's just about his project that decorations are born for a apartment representing the owner of the building and the use of the mosaica for the fa√ßade.
For the fa√ßade also worked with other artists and creators.
The joint work for Casa Battlo house plans began with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudi Casa Mila house and Guell Park where there are other works of Gaudi.
The locals named the hot house just after his end, because of its organic forms "the House in os".
Others, with regard to the specific window opening mechanism, they called it "the bath house."
It is said that there is a sword like that of Saint Georges the patron of the Catalogue.
Other elements of construction sculpture contain hidden religious motivations.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system in his central heating time, with typical pathways and pathways.
Their inclination of 45 degrees seems strange.
During Gaudi's establishment, it has not absolutely respected the value construction directives and has not been left to prevent them.
At the beginning of the construction, he obtained the permission to build, of course, that the reconstruction plans was so slow that two years after the end, the municipal Council was horrible and requested for changes.
For example, it was not pleased to members of the municipal Council that the pillars of the building were impeded on the public trotry.
There was no change, but only 15 days after the call of the city Josep Battlo requested (and receive satisfaction) the authorisation to locate the two highest stages.
The owner moves to the lower floors.
In the gallery at the second floor there was a common room and third room and a private part of the apartment.
The shooter was shocked to a biwstery.
The whole house of six floors is shared by a scalar by which it is accessed to an independent toilet terrace.
All right angles and right lines were cancelled by the basic elements of reconstruction and replaced them by curves walls.
Gaudi also worked with the modern concept of space connection.
The common party can be fully linked by opening the doors of salons and high society can communicate confortably or by limiting the private space for more interim enterprises.
The house with Gaudi's rebuilding has also received new fa√ßades a non-traditional stone and two floors on the other.
Gaudi game with light is also impressive, blue and white shoes with which the internal court is decorated and with the shoes of light.
The two color game gives a maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was just enough to look at the principle than the white reflects more than the dark that, on the other hand, absorbs the sun radiations.
The Casa Battlo House that was registered in 2005 in the World Patrimonial Fund of Unesco may be visited by each.
At the first floor of the house there is the most spacious and most beautiful apartment available to the public.
The owners decided to franchise this step in 2002 at the 150th anniversary of the famous Creator's birth.
They continued visits because they found that this is a lucrative company and they extended the field of visits to the common spaces and the greenhouse, including the terraces of the toilet.
The monument is not really frozen and costs 16.50 euros; students, retreats, groups and tourist card holders have 20 per cent of rabais.
The sum is even above the entrance price in the other buildings of Gaudi in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic tours, you'll need to quickly find a cabin among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mature and a sum: women have other criteria than men.
Not a hospital frame, but instead the quality of the surrounded on the bed, so the matles and the sumser give a real base for a good bed.
They must certainly complement themselves in harmony to enjoy a concrete user.
During the choice several things are determined: weight, size, age, health status and gender of the owner.
The type of internal in which we will place the matlas and summar is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the camping house where the late mats are not permanently suitable because they "hire" calmly.
They have, overwhelming, a weight exceeding the standard polyurethane mats.
It is necessary to often return them.
If they do not have enough ventilation channels in the heart and, in addition, stay on a solid floor, they keep humidity. The sweet can also form it.
The habit is also determined in the choice.
The one who passes the light of time in the foreign, where it is often used very slowly with a swimming skin, would feel hard on a low and hard surface.
"It's how all the Hockeyists who come back from NHL are regretting that they can't sleep there."
"For their fatigued shoes, the feet and the coasts, they needed mats with a widespread sweet shoeting shoes."
"They are also recommended for people who have a problem of the nervous system that makes "information" of articulations and skin", explains Sylva Adamczikova, who specializes in the refunded furniture.
That's why, just a few years ago, the mats with the mouse has conquished the hockeyists and other customers.
"Actually, Timpur, the Italian Magnifex, but also Tropico, for example, has appropriate masses.
You don't need to be a NHL guy to be able to appreciate a likely mouse.
This "micro" just works.
It optimizes its strictness and shape according to the absorpted heat or well adapts to the heat of your body.
No pressure on you and you will not return to the night as after a difficult game.
You're just sleeping better.
The like museum also works as a protection against square.
For the selection of the matlas on your size, add the length of your feet, or about 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman of a 180cm size need a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each for a bed to two places should be 90 cm or at all 180 cm.
For beds at one place, for example, the only ones are recommended to take at least 120 /140 cm.
It's fair for visits.
'Indeed, it is a simple rules for the width of the bed: when you are sleeping on the side, you should put your hands in a comfortable way with slightly increased skins. Helena Prokopova, Chairman of the Association of the Bourrelers and Decorators, who has been dedicated to a healthy sleep and the heromic of the mobilist and taught it in specialized schools.
For a bed to two places, each needs its own sum and mats, so attention during the purchase to select the height of the matlas.
Unless it will remain you only to mount the sum of different heights and this is not realize on all bed frameworks.
Mouse mats should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the resort mats at least 15 cm, which contain for the form and action switch at least three centimeters.
"Under to touch or sit down on the matles you should not feel the resorts," says Helena Prokopova.
Each matles requests a well-determined type to summon.
The summer bed, when the matlas and the summer are united as wedding sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The matles were very bad; we don't have to laver it, what makes up today.
And since the night is normally transpired from 0.2 to 0.75 the sweet is clear that after 5/7 years, the matles start to remember a large (and sweet) Tamis.
For this reason, specialists refuse to make the claim for a lifetime of 25 years for a mats or a life guarantee.
But it's his only.
For this reason, a experience counsel from the salers: for a 120/140cm mats, resign, for the revaluation of the mats, the hygi√®ne or the lavage, but add a protective mats that you can easily remove and laver.
And even if in today it is often used to produce grain closure for all, it is to say that after opening there are two parties (for the lavage and size of the laver machine is very important!) Unless the manipulation for the big models (and for one person) becomes when a struggle between light weight and a weight weight on a ring.
You've got a strict floor in your bed instead of summer?
No one!
Maximum for a bed for visitors for one night.
However, equip the plate (if there is no) of availations and use resort mats with a minimum height of 15cm with sacket resorts (Germany Taschenfederken) and a cocktail.
A polyurethane mats should not be part of this type's bed.
For single lame smells with 14/18 lamps, the latex mats or say sandwichs (which the combination of latex and coco nuts), they are ideal but it will always be better for you to have more mats with lamps, 28 and above, where the lamps are dubbed in the bottom of the kings and so it is possible to regulate strideness.
For several positions, no resort masses must be taken because it does not respond to position changes.
On the side of the strideness of the lamps, you can also install what is called a sleeve.
This is a special connection of the lamps that allows to make pressure even to pull the lamp so that the sleeper's eye "complete" well.
For men who have the "shoes as large as the dust" is a very important thing.
This is already considered by the masses manufacturers that for the "maculins" have started to use a reducing area at the level of the floors.
But they also think about women - they're offering them again a more slightly surface at the level of the gangs.
For the most difficult customer there are somms for families or platforms with what is called a multi-force suspension.
The pressure is designed in more points and decline pressure.
But of course, attention, when you use a bad ear (grand and air ring) on good mats and sums, the "more" was gone.
The basic rule is a very simple earner: the ear must support the head and its points only to reach the edges, so that the muscles of the ears can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that Scandinaves prefer.
When it is longed on the side, the earler must put at level (with the sleeves' s shoe or the sleeves' s sleeves in the mats) the height of the edges.
The modern masses have something more common with the first balls and herbs.
Manufacturers also use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also biomatala.
The first materials of oil, from which polyurethane is made, are replaced by natural oils, such as soya oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use soja.
"The Bio qualified for maths means that the heart is made on the basis of natural products", explains Petr Vasicek of the Tropico Plus Society.
Natural materials are also used for matlas revestments; one of the firsts was the true ball.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop forest or lavande parfums.
There are differences between men and women.
While the extract of ball plants so that the breast revealing of the matles absorps the heat and refrigerate the body, "refroidit" the man, the "flood" revues the women.
The red pearl extract accelerates the blood movement and therefore is warmer for the weak sex.
Current preferences?
The matles made from cold mouss (this has more pores with a cellular structure that is more respiratory than the standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different strictness of cold moulds gives polyzonal mats that know exactly where the head is found, the low of the dust and the feet.
You will pay a quality mats from 7000 corones and more.
Those who are characterized by their health parameters are less than TVA and are taken as health instruments.
In Czech Republic, Gumotex has reached the first place.
Economize for mathematics and summar is not simple.
A time may be made in the framework of special actions from manufacturers or manufacturers for the price of one single.
For example, the Magniflex company that offers Duofreeze masses with the Mouse to Memory Cooked in the refrigeration for 11990 corones.
Of course, the second can be taken free.
The era of glass or viscolelastic moulds with an open cell structure and a large wide range has been started with Temppur material at a "cosmic rythm".
This began as a material for the NASA because the astronoms were subject to the starting of the major load factors.
The Temple turns to heat and dry, on the other hand, to the cold.
So it is perfectly adapted to the warm human body and distributes a optimal pressure.
It is ideal for this toward the painful sleep and for an increase in comfort during the sleep.
Viscolelastic moulds are used not only for maths but also for health products, such as special cossins for feet that highlight the feet and the veinary system.
Czech manufacturers, for example, use EucathermC or Twinsaver mouse or the same type.
People are increasingly requested by parents who want to monitor their children.
The fear for their children brings more people to think to monitor them through a GPS.
The system, set at the beginning to search for cars, can also be used to trace people and help for some cases, such as the small Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is now so large as a box of alluests but will be soon from the size of a clock.
The case of the small Anicka embraced a lot of people and began looking for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to trouble their private life.
"We strive to tell everyone that it's not a sponsoring but only another way to reduce the probability that there is another tragedy," says Peter Pilin of the macro Weil society, who is one of the trace equipment suppliers in the Czech market.
"I acknowledged that there may be cases of bad employment of such devices, such as put it into a person who isn't knowing, but I have not yet met such cases."
"The majority of people are customers who actually buy the product for security reasons, adds Pilin.
He said that children should always know what purposes the "boat" is used and how to use it in an emergency case.
The psychologist for kids, Dana Bockova, attracts the attention that if the child does not want to put on him something of this kind, he's going to be disappointed.
"And even the smaller may show a great creativeness when it is to dismiss from something when they do not want to be under control."
"The portable phones, which may be cut as these trace devices, have already brought their parents to long wait", says Bockova.
According to it, the fact that this type of instrument may help in case of aggression is very discussable.
"If it is a prepared rat, the author will do everything so that the child has no electronic device that could locate it."
"This is the phone today."
"When the trace devices will be developed, they (the criminals) will look for them too because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign."
"In such cases, criminals will always be advanced on the police," says psychologist.
It declares as well as such devices can help during an aggression not prepared by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of the RC Monitoring company, which offers transport services for both cars and persons, claims that this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the case of aggression.
"The device may be parametered so that it is in regular emission after a determinated period."
"In the case of the device is destroyed, the last position of the person concerned remains."
'The cherous devices also have an inclinometer that immediately reports the position of the person who slowed and finds in a long position without movement," says Cech.
According to the portable telephones that are equipped with a navigation system, they can propose a comparable service after training with a special prologic.
The problem of the current trace systems is that it is a similar device to those carried out in the pendentry size of an alluent boot or to the smallest phone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to the Macro Weil company Pilina, this is why tests are currently conducted to make devices similar to common numerical clocks.
"Cela will be the advantage that the possible aggressor will not recognise the trace device."
"But it will take account of it after a certain time, which will give the police a little more time," he adds.
If the trace device is developed under the form of bracelet or pendentry, it will always use the same technology as to drive cars.
This is a combination of acquiring systems of a GPS position (which is used in autonavigation) and a portable phone function that warns the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many delicate stones that it could make the round of the Czech Republic with, but it can have only two years.
The army purchased 445 km of stones used for explosives.
Over the last year the Defence Minister has purchased 224 km.
The army has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the life period of shoes is between two and four years.
The army purchased shoes to the STV Group anonymous company for 40 million corones.
The General State has given a large amount of DNES shooting shoes that soldiers use the yearly 60 km.
According to the reserve calculations made by the army pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES has contacted, it is that even the generals, the officers who have orders, secret or household staff should have an exemption for explosives each year.
Alexandre Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, the army commander does not exceed.
Only to argue the annual consumption of the army of detonants of 60 km.
This distance matches 25 000 explosions.
And even if it was true, the army reserves could be subsidied for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals, it is sufficient to more than 2 m of detoning cordes, as the experts say, it means that the army with its new purchase has assured - with the consumption of special units and genes - of reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
However, the soldiers of the rapid intervention band have recently been complained to the Minister Vondra that they have not almost munitions for their powder weapons and that the torment meetings are limited because of money needs.
We're not talking about the lack of body lingery.
"And I don't take my head if they buy in our home so many detoning shoes."
"It's their decision and they really know what they do."
"For us the army is a good customer we're working as a commerciant to satisfy", says the director of STV Group Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, the porter of the Ministry of Defence, argus about the purchase of hundreds of miles of shoes that the army will be reserved for 10 years.
However, Jan Decky of STV Group was only four years of life of the detoning shoes and the pyrotechnicians of the police and the army of only two years of life.
"If they are perfectly in the deposits, it may even go up to four years," said one of them who do not want to be published in respect of the military criticism.
The past life period, each munition must be tested to see if it remains incomplete and does not threaten soldiers' life.
However, these tests are not free and are still costing money.
The other argument of the Ministry is a rabai due to the amount of 445 km of detonants.
"They costed 60% less than the delivery of the last year of 245 km," states the Pejsek speaker, which is the interpretation of the opinion of buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Only to compare: Annual consumption of pyrotechnicians that neutralize the munitions of the Second World War or after the Soviet Army, is not exceeding 1500 meters.
And the police always commands the amount of munitions necessary to be used before the end of their life.
This has been established for pyrotechnician security reasons and to enhance more softly the types of more modern and more reliable shoes.
the Defence Ministry has today great problems for the neutralization of tens of tons of munitions from the Warsovie Pact when the strong Czechslovac army was prepared to move, heading on the Rhin.
What is expected in a few years by this Czech army that MF DNES has contacted: neutralizing hundreds of miles of old shoes that she buys today "a good market".
Together, I will benefit from contacts I have received thanks to the competitions.
The sale under franchise of his hotel was well helped by Lukas Pytloun for the place of winner of the best individual entrepreneur.
The winner of the best individual entrepreneur for the last year was Lukas Pytloun, a 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His adventure to success is like in a film.
Lucas Pytloun liked to travel.
And in the foreign, he realized that in Liberec he lacked a quality accommodation site at a reasonable price.
From his economy about what he had winned when he worked for the foreign and with the help of a banking loan he purchased a small building of 5 apartments in half demoli.
It was a courageous action when he was still studied in the thirteenth year of higher studies.
"The relationship between the quality and the price of a guest in our region gave me the wish to do something," said Lucas Pytloun.
It started to loache the first apartment rebuilt for foreign workers.
He re-invested the benefit of the building that he transformed in pension with 54 beds.
Since that time, his entrepreneur's action allowed him to open in Lib√©rec 4 pensions, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of about 300 beds of all categories of hotels.
The most comfortable among them was until recently the four stars of Pytloun design hotel.
This year he came to another identical quality.
"We just come to sign a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise, where we sold our concept of franchise and other candidates to the franchise of the Pytloun hotels," the number 1 of the entrepreneurs of the last year.
"And for the sale of the license for the operation of a large-scale hotel the victory of the entrepreneur has well served, adds Pitloun with appreciation.
The victory has brought him more popularity and to be known in Liberec and its surroundings.
"The people recognized me in the streets, often welcomed me and, I have to say, that it was very pleasant," remembers him.
It recommends the participation in this competition to all those who are trying to do something.
It is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He said he uses his contacts and knowledge until today that he would not have been able to get another way.
"Besides those I met thanks to the competition, I started to hold regular commercial relations.
According to him, the success-related rename has also affected employees.
And there's about 70.
"I observe their homes in particular the loyalty and pride of being involved in something that has been generally recognised."
"This is not, and from far, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work together.
"It's only put my name in front," said Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I want my successor a better year than what we had in Farmet.
The victory euphory was slowly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the goal of the winner Farmet has the worst moments behind me.
The one who came to search for the price in Slovansky for the first place of competition for the year's company organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky owner of the Farmet company.
The jury rewarded the efforts he transformed a workshop in Ceska Skalice in a firm number of businesses of 100 million corones.
"I can say that reward has not only encouraged my collaborators and have increased our confidence in the fight against competition," says today the winning of the competition of the last year.
At the beginning of the history of Farmet society there was the desire to do something of use.
And so when the state suggested to the father of Karel Zdrasky to lodge the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of goods by the communists, he did not hesitate long, rejected a carri√®re in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with a few chairs in the construction of his father for the manufacturing of plastic bathrooms.
Not very long after they began to specialize themselves in vegetable oil presses.
It has become the largest manufacturer of automatic presss in Central Europe after 10-8 years.
The company was even known in the non-specialized public after the success of the competition through media.
" Not only our customers began to really know the Farmet Mark but also the foreign partners who began to realize that they cooperate with a company who has received the most successful success in their country of origin," says Karel Zdarsky.
But the last year wasn't passing in Farmet only in the euphory of the victory.
The company's evaluation was made from 2008 economic results and in 2009.
And just in 2009 this was the hardest year for the sale of engineering machines.
Under the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, companies were obliged to stop their investment projects and start to limit their purchase of new materials and technologies.
"We have not obviously escaped this situation."
"The business figures have fallen 40 percent, and we should limit our production and even license," Karel Zdarsky explains.
A viable society must know that in time, impunity measures must be taken.
But they managed the situation correctly and maintained profitable results even if they were less than those they had before the crisis.
However, in Farmet, they continued without commitment to invest in research and development.
"We have built with donations a training and research centre, strengthened the presentation of society in international exposure salons and won the main rewards in national exposures," said Zdarsky.
Everything lets us think that the crisis is behind them.
The numbers of businesses are back and with them also the number of employees.
"A new winner I want this pleasant feeling of the victory but in a calm atmosphere," said Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation which deletes the insensitive regulations.
The year's absurdity investigation is for the fourth time part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations have been removed.
The little glorious winner of this year of the Absurdity Investigation of the Year was the obligation to deliver documents into the offices that officers can get online.
More than 4000 voters have voted for this.
For instance, social business administrations requested an extract paper from the trade register while the official can obtain it in two mouse clicks.
This changes through the investigation.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer request the extraction of the trade register for insurance payment controls," said Jana Buranova, a speaking port of the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
Against all regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must fill in the Czech Republic and remove those who are assured is the sense of this support of the year's absurdness.
This investigation is still this year for the fourth time a part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has a larger popularity.
If the last year 3000 voters have occurred, at least 4000 voters have voted this year.
And that is not wonderful, there are the most various legal obligations in our country, which are only free of the company, and that is, more.
"We may be in the number of documents to be filled for fiscal statements in the first places in the world", says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Employers of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurship is a proclaimed goal of all governments in the past few years.
In comparison with all the world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not better.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is at the 74th place for the conditions for the company, it is 8 places more than the last year.
The support of the Year Absurdity was established for the first time in 2006 and continued every year according to the same scenario.
Any who can take note of the administrative and bureaucratic absurdities each year of April at the end of September, last time before the concours closure.
To take account of the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the competitor chooses seven candidates for "the antiprix" and allows the public to vote in October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurd and on www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdity that has received the largest number of voices is declared winner.
Until last year's investigation, it's a hundred, or more exactly 105 regulations and decreases that have lost their sense of existence.
The comments are sent by entrepreneurs, but also the professional units and teachers.
Among the "finists" of the competition, therefore, among the names are the obligation to pay the swimming vehicles and fast roads, or the entrepreneurs with twenty employees, repay two offices and two toilets every two years.
the list of the seven proposals is published on the concours site.
The proclamation of the competition, which is always starting at the beginning of November on the Place Venceslas in Prague, is part of a event that regularly participates in the personalities of political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, Director of the Association for the Small and Medium Employees of Czech Republic or Petr Kuzel, President of the Trade Chamber of the Czech Republic, attended the competitive time.
'Economic prosperity cannot work when the State puts acts into the legs of entrepreneurs, and therefore my goal is to remove at least three decades of paragraphs today that are just to compromise the company' said Martin Kokurek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to remove absurd decrees is not a sword sword in the water.
In 2007, it was not the obligation of entrepreneurs to declare the office three days before the office for the individual company where the company was found, the intention of go to an exhibition or pending.
This obligation was deleted with the recognition of the Act on the individual undertakings.
The second most satisfied obligation in 2007, which was to declare a service journey for foreign employer over 30 days, was deleted by the Act on what the green map is called.
And it's all right until the third session of the competition.
The Absurdity of 2009 was the decree for physiotherapeutes to have a great look in their office, a refrigerator and two automatic balances.
This was changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year the obligation to have a refrigerator was deleted.
A new category rewards the socially responsible firms.
It is assessed by environmental, humanitarian, training or sportive projects.
The newness of this year of Hospodarske Noviny concours, which has been already 5 years old, is the category called the Responsable Company of 2010.
The eject of this competition is the support for the reasonable and fair company.
"We want to support companies that monitor the impact of their environmental enterprises and make socially responsible activity", states Patrick Bartholdy, the regional telephone operator, the strong Vodaphone, which is the guarantee and promoter of this competition, as in the case of competition for the revolt of the year.
For this first year of the subcategory of the strong concours of 2010, organized by the Future Vodaphone, companies who have not successfully successfully with a single long-term goal for the company were registered.
The adventure of each of them is rich of inspirations and an independent article would be edited.
Although the object of their undertakings is different from one of the other can be considered their support and prevision activities as the designator of their efforts.
For one of the cases, this concerns persons with disabilities and personal or health issues of their employees.
Among the fourty finalists for the whole Czech Republic, there is no example of the society of pragmatic prologicials and Netera who supports the creation of informal sports teams from their employees who then participate in a number of tourists in various sportive disciplines.
Another firm example of the Pardubice region is the Isolit-Bravo company, who has been the main contribution to the donation fund that sponsorizes disabled children for 17 years.
In order to care for employees with health problems, the old publishing factory of Potbrad, which is employed by more than 70 per cent and thus obtained the firm responsible for the Central Boheme region, which was the third in the region in the concurrent of the Employee of the year organized by Vodaphone.
In Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial company who wins to introduce work hours and even reduced up to 35 hours per week and without proportionally reducing payment.
The jury also deferred the title to him because it purchases priority to the Czech manufacturers, supports a diocean activity in the nearby and care for the environment.
"We strive to recycle the best possible to ensure that our business activities and our administration have the least impact on the environment," explains Millenes Ryznarova, the executive director of society.
the responsible company IT Logit of the Usti Region also thinks about the health of its employees and established them for each portable computer a chair and a ergonomic key, encourages their homework and uses local protected plant services for its actions.
"We also support the foundation The man in the darkness that helps the local Roman community," Ondrej Seeks the representative of the society.
The latter is also for its activities, a Lavage and cleaning company in the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the retraiting insurance of its employees in the form of bonus above standards.
"In our society we contribute to food, transport, qualifications and lawyers," said Joseph Strapac of the Bruntal Czasch building company, winner for the region of Moravie-Silesia.
It was automatically registered in the relevant company category, all regional finalists for the support of the Vodaphone Task Force of the year, which had responded to the joint questionnaire of the document for registration and sent it to the organizer before August 15.
Incomplete or incomplete responses in the questionnaire were removed from the contribution by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the firms in license had not answered to questions, they could not participate in the concours of the Responsable Responsable but were not disqualificated by the "principal Concourse" of the Vodaphone year company."
"Independent registrations are not possible because it is a sub-category of the main concours of the company of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the Organizing Agency Bison & Rose.
In the Territories Fund in Plzen, the police held arrests during public concours
In the Earth Fund building in Plzen, the anti-corruption police has conducted arrests in the last few days.
Detectives have led to the local entrepreneur and traded in real estate Lubos. G.
This was aimed at managing just a public appeal for the regulation of a refund request so that the proposed field was obtained by a determinated candidate.
That should be paid to Lubos G. a half million corones.
"For the moment, I can only confirm that the police continues a person for a crime in the context of an appeal of offers and a public concours." Pravo reported the head of the Plzen Antonie Zelena Park, who knows that it is forbidden to explain more explanations because the investigation is in place.
Police officers released this 46-year-old entrepreneur in freedom after 24 hours.
In order to know how it could affect public competition, it can only be shown to such a few official information.
On a question of Pravo, the Chamber of the Lubomira Territories Fund stated that the police had actually conducted a arrest in Plzen on a separate job place and, so, during the public competition.
"He acted of a customer and in no case of a employee, it was specified.
The public competition according to Cerna was a real name "Applause to propose land transfer rights under the Land Act" and is established when a number of candidates are manifested in law.
"They propose, in the context of the call, a higher value of their refund rights which must be regulated before the value of the field is announced."
"Depending on the rights proposed for a purchaser classification is established and the Terrain Fund then transfers the field to the person who has proposed the highest rights", explained the Fund ' s parliament.
Lubos G. had clearly provided information on those who were registered to the call and as it is also a beneficiary person because he had purchased a large number of refund rights, he had proposed candidates to do not participate in the competition.
And he certainly tried to turn away.
What would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his interpulsion.
Lubos G. had broadly above standards at the FdT ( Terrains Funds).
He was in the case of the former FdT Vaclav Sankot, who was continued to have edited fields for which the decision to establish a construction was already established.
Just Lubos G. had, for example, received fields for the construction of public communications, specifically in place and place where the access to the industrial area of Borske Pole was to be built.
Afterwards he exchanged it with the mairy for a building in the historical center of the city with the value is very high.
The matrix was obliged to accept because, unless it was risked to put the building in danger by a field blocking.
The households will pay an additional of a hundred corones monthly for the accommodation.
The households must be paid not only for all types of energy, but also for water and heating, heating supply and certain locations will also increase.
Thus, families will have to shoot from January to a hundred corones monthly more than now.
The electricity increases 4.6 per cent, the gas of almost 2 per cent more cherous, in some locations you will have to pay up to a tenth more water supply, and in many places the central heating supply will also be more cheap.
The increase of electricity should be used for the apartment households for more than 100 krones annually than currently.
However, all suppliers have reduced electricity prices because of the sensitive development to encourage the production of renewable energy, including photovoltaic pillars.
Gas increased moderately, but of course at the time when people have the most necessary to heat and therefore have the largest consumption.
So there can also be hundreds of corones.
Although electricity and gas increase in the whole Czech Republic, the change of the price of central heating is different from the city.
These are mainly the largest communities that plan to increase prices.
For example, the households in Pardubice or Hradec Kingoce are derived from January for the central heating of almost 50 krones per month, and the Lib√©rec families perpetrated more than 1,000 krones annually.
For the people of Prague, there is an increase of 9 per cent for water and healing in cases where the city increases infrastructure loans.
If the loans do not change the pragoians, the additional of 6.8 per cent.
The price in Prague will be part of the lowest comparison with the whole country.
In North Boheme, where prices are already part of the highest, water and sanitation increased by 7.4 per cent.
The prices of loans will, for example, increase sensitively in 450 000 apartments from January to the end of the regulation.
For example, the CPI Byty company who has Usti nad Labem nearly 2500 apartments has decided to increase up to 100 percent.
Those who will not agree with the new increase of loans will be translated before the courts by society.
Regular loans that pay people in about 300 000 apartments could increase the next year of 10 per cent.
Czech children are sweet to the rhum and the fernet. Bird is no longer mode and acts quietly.
Ferrenet, rhum, vodka, and in exceptional way also the best whisky mark is stolen to parents.
It is a drink that brings most often those who are saubering, who have not yet 15 years of age, among the doctor's hands.
Childs who are in the hospital for recycling do not exemption.
This results in the experience of doctors who meet cases similar to the admissions of hospital children.
"The birds or wines are no longer mode, because there is time to be sa√∫l."
"The tendency is really to strong alcohols," says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Chief of the Horovice Hospital Division in Central Boheme.
"When they have succeeded to shut a pape bottle in the silver, it's some time of wisky, but it's the fernet and vodka that prevail.
"The vodka has this advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and so do not feel it", explains the Head of the Division.
Eva Jurinova, the portal of the Motol Hospital, also gives him right.
"In general, it's rhum or fernet."
"This is today the alcohol to mode, in particular in primary schools."
"In some cases, he acted with slavery they returned from the house," added Jurinova.
According to the Pelikan Division Chief, you see children from 30 to 14 years of age at hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol where he spent ten years just in a pediatric where the ambulances carried out large schools fullly swimming around.
"A young girl was hospitalized so four times
"He accompanied his 12-year career when it was administered with 3.5 per thousand of alcohol in the blood with more than a mixture with extasy," describes the doctor this specially important case.
"He was at the Holesovice Park at a party."
"What's interesting is that it's not strange to the mother that his daughter is abstaining 48 hours," said the Director of the Department.
It is just the destination of parents or their tolerance outside the common face, because their rejections are the main cause of the development of children's alcoholism.
The specialists, however, do not speak of dependance, in its strict sense, for children.
"Another alcoholic vocabulary is heard a chronic dependance in alcohol for several years with all phenomena that develop it, but that children do not find it."
"They who use the recycling appeal, rather than a social-familial-familial back-round", explained the Pelikan Department Chief.
According to Jurinova's portal, about 40 children were hospitalized this year until mid- November in the pediatry clinic in Motol.
It is not included in statistics only cases with gravity intoxication that require hospitalization.
The children who are after emergency care raised home by their parents or by the police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of the children who sit and drink a drinking bottle after the school, he exists according to Pelikan's three seasonal vagues with which they can be counted: the day of the sisters, the Holy Sylvestre and the end of the school year.
"If they drink even after bad results or on the other hand they celebrate the start of holidays."
"I've certainly lived at the day of the sisters a admission of seven children from one piece," said P√©likan.
The child who had been in the hospital in desinintoxion under medical control is paradoxally better than the one who has returned to him and suffers the "wood ring" next day.
The headbreaks of the morning caused by dishydration and lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion of glucose and nutrient elements that the body needs.
"They are better lotis because they pass a great evening then wake up and nothing makes them bad."
"They are only surprised from the place where they find themselves", adds P√©likan, who knows that in time this makes the good humor of patients at least with the note to pay for their care.
The transport by ambulance and the hospitalization on intensive care bed may go up to tens of thousands of corones.
"After time, I applied this as an educational means by accounting for these children how much their sweet costs and that they could pass all the summer in college work to repay one night," added P√©likan.
However, he said that health insurance companies in their regression management, which should be restored from the parents ' s care charges, do not deal with the cases of ill children.
Two L-159 flights are first in foreign hands in Spain.
Two aircraft L-159 of five in all, against which the Defence Minister has changed aircrafts in Casa C-295M, set out mardi for Seville in Spain where the manufacturer of Casa-EADS was settled.
It's the first time that devices of this type become the property of someone else than the Czech Army.
However, they have been in the foreign area of exercises or demonstration flights.
These are biplace versions of L-159T1, which were until now service in the Czech Army and were in the state of flight.
Lestroys remaining devices are monoplate versions of L-159.
These stations are now at Aero Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - the vast Omnipol - took into account the last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the Department of Defence, Vodochody‚Äôs physical department is for the moment unknown.
The L-159 Monopy Aviation planned for exchange has been taken on long-term aircraft without that it causes additional charges or investments for the Ministry of Defence.
"The L-159 T1 biplaces have been changed in the state", said Pravo Pejsek.
He played that the army will not stay without biplace because the Ministry signed Aero Vodochody in May 2009 a 200 million corons value for the transformation of four monoplaces L-159 unused in two biplaces.
The army took the first device in July, the second was planned for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS, the aircraft was forced to introduce some of the Alliance countries.
"In the contract, it is clear that those who take into account L-159 are EADS and that they will serve for the training of NATO pilots."
"This is why the case of the one who takes into account the way to achieve this", said Pejsek.
Hospodarske Noviny announced, some time ago, that the Spanish army is not interested in L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion corones has been completed last year by the Government of Mirac Topomanek.
The Defence Department has not started offers and contacted EADS directly.
the defence direction argued that the exchange guarantees a future export of L-159 to the foreign.
The Czech Army purchased 72 devices at the Vodochody A√©ro and uses only 24, they want to sell the rest.
The Acquisition of Aviation Casa will probably have judicial implications.
However, the European Commission has complained to the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice as aircrafts had to be chosen in the framework of an appeal for offers at European level and in any case by contacting directly a manufacturer.
The army has already delivered three Casa aircrafts, the last should arrive on the Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
A longer index than the annul is a low-risk sign of cancer
Men who have the longest index than the annulary are exposed to a less risk of having prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a mercredied study by the British Cancer magazine.
This may depend on the level of mood hormone the stereoon.
"Our conclusions show that the relative length of the doigt serves simple risk testing for prostate cancer, especially for men 60 years ago," announced the co-auteur of the Ros Eeles study, Professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
The duty could thus help to determine what men should be subjected to the prostate cancer test, in particular by combined with the genetic risk or other aggressive factors such as family health care, adds Eeles.
During the 1994-2009 period, she followed colleagues in Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the students had the right hand index than the annul.
For them, as for the 19% of those who had the teeths of the same length, the same probability was found as a prostate cancer.
However, in the case of those who had the longest index than the annual risk was 33 per cent, for men for 60 years the risk reduction has reached 87 per cent.
The length report of the two quoted dogs, formed during the prenatal period, indicates, in particular, the different levels of sexual hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterius.
Unless textsterron matches a longer index.
Recent research showed that this is just the textsteron that helps the development of a prostate cancer.
Profesor Vacla Paces, who was renomeed and former President of the Scientific Academy, said for CTK it is aware of this study, but it seems not to be that the relationship between dogs and cancer is "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under the snow, the D1 and D5 authorisations are closed.
Czech as most of Europe is this Thursday morning by the neighbor.
On the roads and throats, most of the time of the compact snow, the swimming worked all night in many places.
The D5 car is closed between the 89th and the 93th kilometer direction of Rozvadov because of several trucks and car accidents, and the D1-hour to Brno in the direction of Prague is the same type.
The Central Automobile Club Dispatcher (UAMK) told it to the information
At the 91th kilometer, a truck was accidented, and at the 93th century two large weights were lost, the accident was blessed.
several cars were also found in the store.
The problems are also on the D1 road from 185 km from Prague.
Two trucks have been lost there
The drivers should be out just after Brino at 190 km or go to Brno and then enter the 182th kilometer to Kyvalka.
A car file of several kilometers was formed in this place.
Equally on the D11 car, there's a accident and this is just at Prague's arrival.
In Prague, there is a neighborhood of several centimeters, the thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
Car files are created, for example, in Prosek, Sterboholska Street is also cut.
The most secure transport means is the metro.
Tramways, for example, take a delay on the line between the Place Charles (Kalove Namesti) and the Peace Place (Namesti Miru).
At eight hours of the morning, the major crisis state of Prague must still be gathered.
Railways and airports also face problems.
The Czech iceways had to be removed because of the neighbouring of seven short links.
For example, Prague lines in Kingupy or well Prague in Beroun have problems
Travellers should control the current situation.
Ruzyne Airport was closed from Tuesday 11 a.m. in the night until 5 p.m.
The majority of the roads in South Moravia is already robust but renewed by monitoring.
On the road of Viskov, three late routes are impratory, on the road of Brno it starts to have swimming places and on the road of Blansko, the chains are obliged to pass some ways of communication in the top places.
The Vyskov region was part of the most touched places.
Until now, the ass are closed: Rusinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and Saratice-Milesovice
In order to clean them, it may be necessary to send swimming pools and swimming feeds.
We can't evaluate when they'll be rolled.
On the road of Hodonin, prudence is rigorous in the white carpaths region.
On the roads that are, regarding the protection of nature, entered only by the aspersion of insured products, there is also a 5-cent centimeter black warning CTK.
In Czech, it was dropped between two to 10 centimeters of snow; it was the most thrown in the northern Boheme, with often up to 18 cm.
In the Morbian-Silesia region, it was dropped up to 15 centimeters of snow.
The eternity disappeared in Czechia progressively.
Americans have a new "intelligent weapons"
The United States Army sent a new "intelligent weapons" in Afghanistan only known under code XM-25.
Generals believe that this new auto-floor will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and "change the game" to their benefits.
The new weapon is like a super precise canon.
His projectiles are guided by laser with a precision of a few meters.
Special 25 mm calibre ammunition developed for this shuttle and contains a high-scale explosive, actually functions as small grenades.
The munitions can be programmated in such a way they will explose on the target contact but also any point of their balistic trail.
It can therefore be used against an enemy who hides behind a barrier, a wall or a shooting.
It is no longer protected from the top and when it falls over a mortal rain of swimming powders, it may also put it out of battle.
According to Richard Audette, who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new gun is the first weapons of infantry that uses the "intelligent technology".
"The soldier is mainly serving it in such a way as he finds the target, sends him a laser radiate that determines the distance, thus obtains a specific view point, according to which he corrects his visa site and supports the detention.
Numbers you've seen at 543 metres.
"When you press the detention, the weapon is loaded and shooted at the distance of 543 metres more than 1,2,3 m, Audette stated.
400 displaced jobs
The Fujitsu group delocates Bad Homburg's branch office to Francfort.
The next year, in July, 400 collaborators will transfer to Astro Park their workplace that is currently located at the Mareinbader Place building in the Bad Homburg region.
The Japanese Fujitsu group delocalizes Bad Homburg's succursale succursale in Francfort.
As he stated, the specialized genital in the manufacturing and maintenance of computers, the next year in July, the place of work of 400 men and women, which is until now located on the Marienbader place of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, a large complex office station situated on the Lyoner Street of the Niederrad Quarter of Francfort.
A Fujitsu speaker explained that at the mid-term, the group should group 100 other jobs still displaced until now in the region.
The location offer was extremely attractive. In addition, the open air offices of Astro Park are better agreed with the work mode of collaborators.
In Bad Homburg also, Fujitsu was just a localist.
The Director-General Bernd Wagner said: "Frankfurt-Niederrad is a primary place for us with a remarkable infrastructure."
It claims that the airport connection is just a great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new movement of an important company within the region summarized the joy of winners and caused the deception of losers.
The director of the Francfort municipality's economic affairs, Mr Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a "planetary actor" had been conquised.
It's a "excellent faith professional regarding the place of implantation".
Fujitsu agrees to the city and its implantation is an important edge for the Niederrad.
The master of Bad Homburg, Mr. Michael Korwisi (the Greens), regrets the decision of Fujitsu.
The direction has soon informed the municipality of this intention.
"He will say that we have proposed our help to this company," said Mr. Korwisi.
However, friendships couldn't change the difficulties of the computer manufacturer faced the owner of the Marienbader building.
Finally, economic reasons would have been determined.
It is now to avoid that such an exceptional place remains uncertain for a long time.
"I've hoped that the owner and baller of the building will be cooperative."
10 years ago, the building of the Place of the Hotel de Ville, used until now by the Fujitsu company and the neighbouring demand, as well as the rest of the buildings of the Marienbad Place, was part of the contested construction project of the temperature station.
Through a joint project of municipality and a private project developer, a new entry of the city was created between the car and the city Hotel, which caused many criticities, not only because of the impressioning design of surfaces that served in a parking, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the manufacturer of computers for travel distribution systems, Amadeus Start, and Fujitsu, manufacturer of computers still associated with Siemens, moved into buildings.
In 2006, the German Francfort specialized Group of Immobilian-Chancen ran the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as the real estate Morgan Stanley. A year later, these buildings were returned to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate SA based on Madrid.
The Fujitsu Group in Tokyo is the third largest provider of information products in the world.
For example, it provides computers and servers to the undertakings and also ensures the essential service.
His succursale established in the Rhin-Main region is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu is certainly more employees in Munich.
Succursale, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to install in Frankfurt-Nederrad. The other branches presented on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, 7000 square meters were taken in the Astro Park building.
This twenty-year-old complex, whose name remembers its plan as a star, opens among others the seat of the Confederation of the Electronic and Electronic Industry.
Server Exploration by Amazon - Menaces against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks tries more difficult.
The Amazon Internet Services provider issued the specialized website in the revision of confidential documents from its servers.
This may be a cached political pressure after the publications of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, appears to be in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks website is still more powerful.
The "Wikileaks" cyber-activist group has no longer access to its host until now in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
During this time, the emperor American Senator, Joe –ª—é–±rman, called the other countries and companies to Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, which is searched for Interpol, probably resides in Great Britain, according to the information published by newspapers.
"Whileaks excluded the Amazon server."
"Liberty of expression to the country of freedom", stated mercredi (local time) the cyber-activists originating of revelations through the social network of Twitter.
Nevertheless, the cyber company, Amazon, had deleted the Wikileaks documents from his servers.
After the publication of the secret diplomatic notes, the active cyber-activists had been requested to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in order to achieve the largest access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revelations: "Formeasable, our dollars are now expenditured to care for people in Europe."
When freedom of expression poses a problem in Amazon, "they should stop selling books."
The CNN TV chain, quoted by Mr. Amarmann's office, reported that Amazon prohibited Wikileaks to use his servers after the investigation conducted by Senator Joe Madrman.
The President of the Senate Board for the Protection of Territories had threatened the Amazon site to rule a boycott against him, reported the British Journal, "The Guardian".
"I would like Amazon to take this measure soon in respect of previous publications by Wikileaks of the classified information," said the Senator.
Similarly, Mr. Madrmann called the other countries to refuse the use of servers through the platform.
"Whileaks act unlawfully, monstruous and sculptures. This makes our national security in danger and threatens our lives everywhere around the world," says a reporter of the independent senator.
"Another company knows its responsibilities, that she is American or foreign, should not help Wikileaks to disseminate the content of the shooted documents."
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, is searched for Sweden's authorities because it is suspected of violence, figured on the list of people searched for Interpol.
According to the information distributed by the London newspaper The Independent, Australian of 39 years lived in Britain and Scotland Yard, exactly knows where it is.
The cyber-activist has constantly qualified orchesters by its detritors the continues imposed against Sweden.
The Wikileaks port, Christinn Hrafnsson, declared London that threats were caused against the site.
"The calls have even been launched for the murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange was particularly afraid for his security, said Hrafnsson.
That's why the Wikileaks founder continues to hide.
Hrafnsson expressly responded to the statements made in North America.
In America, the former Republic of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, requested the owner of the revelations made by Wikileaks to continue and execute for trajection.
In Canada, Mr. Stehen Harper's Governing Body adviser stated that Mr. Assange should "be killed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a drone".
During that time, a pollecle was cut between the white house and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, a chairman of the United States President, Barack Obama, qualified "ridiculous and absurde" the fact that Mr. assange requested the demission of the secretariat of the State Hilary Clinton if it was responsible for the order given to the diplomates, and recently disseminated, to be released to sponsoring activities.
"I don't know exactly why we need to take care of the opinion of a owner of a website," says Mr. Gibbs.
" Our foreign policy and interests in this country are much more important than the confirmations of a website."
The United States government is now completely testing the protection of its databases.
According to a white house reporter, Mr. Russell Travers, Adjunct Director of the Centre of Anti-Terrorism, was appointed responsible to fight fires.
Mr. Travers is responsible for establishing the necessary structural reforms, which are essential after the dissemination of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House also has the will of verifying the ways of all exchange and protecting information.
In addition, the American Government announced that he wanted to take care of the security of dissidents and militarys if they were never threatened by the Wikileaks revelations.
"We've done everything to contact them," stated Philip Crowley's headquarters of the Department of State.
"We are ready to protect them if it is necessary."
The University of Glass
Bologne's "Gelato University" is prepared for glass confissioners at the best seasons of the year.
The starting course of three days in the intention of the future glass has been very successful and has touched visitors from the whole world.
In fact, where's all the glass coming?
Glacier and glass machine.
The glass, that is, in Germany, the glass container somewhat demoted, produces the cream according to all rules of Italian manufacture of glass.
The glass turbine includes the ice cream of the refrigerated vitrine by means of a spallel, dispose of it in the garage and then starts to sell it.
To know, we do not need to go to Anzola della Emilia in the province of Bologne.
But anyone wants to know more about the glass can not avoid "Gelato-University" of the strong Italian Carpigiani.
The manufacturer of ice manufacturer founded in 2003 so that the ice creatures of its machines were answering all the high Italian ideals.
The starting course of three days towards the future glass will have been very successful and has touched visitors from all over the world.
It also offers special courses on the ice of chocolate and expansion over several days. Similarly, practical meetings are organized in the private glass.
In full crisis of the quarentaine, a number of people dream of a new carriage, others can simply simply make their desires fall on the lisse glass.
This time, these are 40 participants from 19 countries of all continents from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, Professor of Artic Education from California, is a fellow of the Slow Food movement. He wants to propose a European quality product to the industrial glass country.
Anke from Berlin is advisor in business management and she wants to take a few years of uniqueness from this testing work for nerves.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a glass in Cairo.
A man originating Malte and another in Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian household woman came because his children worship the Italian glass creatures.
Guest Luciano Ferrari explains first to participants the ideal features of the perfect glass.
It is determined not only the good savior, but also the sweet sweetness and the good consent.
However, Luciano is not forgotten during the training of the Cyrus on the gate of national superstructuring and, in general, from the south: "Itlandic glass is just the best: and then it keeps a sacred dose of romantism."
The first step in the manufacture appears to be really simple.
Luciano sets the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large measurer that slows up to 85 degrees through an electronic program, then immediately refrigerated to four degrees.
He then opens a machine-installed robin: it encompasses a pastorized white base crystal, based on all kinds of milk glass.
The trainer is soon as a questionnaire: Is it possible to manufacture glass by using only natural substances without stabilizer?
How can free course to personal satisfaction of the experiment?
Mr. Luciano guards the fact that it is to be wrong by the spirit of time.
Those who say only ices "fabricted from natural ingredients" may have been used, despite the use of stabilisingers: most often a natural product, for example, of grain grain obtained from the tissue tissue.
Obviously it is possible to manufacture the glass without using stabilizer, only to sell it within 24 hours, except to shoot it and the customer will not cover anything else than glass galleries.
Some changes in the basic mass are allowed.
This becomes more tragic with the aromas.
The Master Luciano sets the difference between the ingredients that it is acquired in the supermarket fruit or confidence rayon.
Furthermore, there are powders and pants.
"the suppliers will all try to refile you with aromatised twelve ingredients."
"All time you should just try."
Be in the sorbed receipts of fruit with sugar and feed fruit.
It is in the ice creams made from the white base mass that, adding eggs become a yellow and is, when it adds cacao powder, the base of all possible deserts to chocolate.
Now, all the participants in the course must pass to the use of glass machines.
Luciano invites you in time to manufacture four types of glass: the vanilla, the chocolate, the moka and the noise with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less than vanil aroma or other natural ingredients.
The various types of fruit glass are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more cleans of fruit: from the point of view of the guest, it is not absolutely better.
The glass to noises does not comport forcely the sweet of the skin when it consists in large part of the noises.
The kiwi glass, very popular, is made from the group which uses more fruits, less water and little less stabilizer.
"Only a balanced melange correctly retains the pleasing of a glass," Luciano says.
The manufacturing of glass is a calculation exercise: if it is used for fishing cleaning with a lot of sugar, the amount of sugar must be reduced in the basic receipt.
A sugar supplement is required for citron ice.
Luciano presents a device with which he determines the sugar content of the various types of fruit (we will serve it to measure Oechsle's degree in the raw milk).
Happily, the tables facilitate calculations.
The manufacture of the glass no longer requires, as soon as physical intervention.
This is not only the automatic manufacturing machine of the basic mass that helps.
There is also a device where the glass medium available is shocked at the same time to make it sweet and returned to negative temperatures.
Despite all automatizations, slight panes are not excluded.
Brazilian Gustavo was barbory of head fruits cleaning and thus cut out his study chairs when the control of the measuring bowl was shocked away.
The Master Luciano is thinking that a "the same incident is a risk of happening at each course: it's just a time question."
Controllers in a ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry that experiences the culture of genetically modified plants has undergone the European Food Safety Authority.
This accused is now formulated by the Testbiotech Group, which is considered as an independent institution for the evaluation of the results of biotech.
"This sound as a theory of conspiration, but we are well-instructed", said Monday at Munich M. Christoph Then, Director of Testibiatech.
Some information shows that the President of the Efsa Group experts for genetically modified plants, Mr. Harry Kuiper, and other Efsa experts are under contract with the Ilsi Press Group.
This is financed by groups such as Monsanto, Nestl√© or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has cooperated decisively in the preparation of Ephsa test requirements for genetically modified plants and is clearly in a situation of interest conflict, according to the critics made by Mr. Tenn.
The proposed requirements are textually corresponding to the positions of the Ilsi Press Group and thus set the brand of the industry which would, on the ground, be controlled by the authorities installed in Italy.
This is the second time that Testbiotech declares a conflict of interest.
A high-ranking director of the Efsa recently joined the Swedish Agricultural Group Singapore. In this case, she changed from camp.
There was little time ago, even the Central Germany Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) showed the existence of personal relations between the European Union's control authority and industrial lobby, which has deteriored the suspicion of both the German Federal Agency for the Environment and European Deputy.
However, Efsa does not accept the existence of no conflict of interest.
A view shows that all reliable data are exploited, including those of the industry as they are a good professional quality.
There is no prohibition for experts working for the Efsa's account to contact this activity sector.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the International Institute for Life Sciences (International Life Sciences Institute, Ilsi) based on the United States.
This organization is considered a neutral forum that groups experts, inter alia in science, industry and policy, in order to evaluate the risks of biotechnology without being a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. Then denied the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any test of food in animals and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We want to know what is, for example, the impacts of the maize genetically changed caused to the field" said Mr. Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins and not all the genetically modified plant, which does not allow reliable results.
"If you don't find the risks, how can you find them?" asked Mr. Then on your accused.
This is also the point of view by Mrs Angelica Hilbeck.
This research has been done since 1994 in the field of genetics and currently works at Zurich's polytechnical school.
In this region, as in the United States, and now in Europe, the industry is trying to increase the influence or disregard critical sciences.
This is why there are still researchers that are not related to society.
In the opinion of enterprises, critical studies would not be published.
Ms. Hilbeck claims that the industry controls security research.
Hold on! We got a Black Hawk down.
Uli Gsell was looking for it, about 400 pounds.
Wednesday afternoon, she was in front of Stuttgart's car with her tube in the dust.
There was a manif.
He wasn't.
The story was known: In September, the scavators came and began to demobilize a large part of the northern ail.
Stuttgart's world was no longer the same: several thousands of people have demonstrated the S21 project, the transformation of Stuttgart's central garage into a subterranean car that would cost several billion.
A large part of the fleet was ruined when the manifestations decreased on the stop of construction work.
Burned in 6000, 7000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (coquillier kitchen) of Crailsheim, a tender and larger pave built badly between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor in Eastfield.
He's been looking for some fragments.
"The stones are religious."
"They don't have to disappear."
He declares with entusiasm: "A modest and good market rock, simple and earthly."
He stated that when he disappointed it to the skin, he felt the smoker of cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he'll do from this fragment.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell too.
Stuttgart's stone traces lead to an old deposite of the French army munitions in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his stone imperial.
This 44-year-old man makes the trade of old stones.
He purchased all the stones of democracy that happened in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were conquest or if they'd lost in the discharge," he says in his office situated in a hot, which was once a guard position.
He tells us that he was subjected to insults and threats when the newspapers reported that he had purchased the rest of the northern ail to the demolition company in September.
But he has negotiated all day with the opposers of the S21 project.
And he explained them that he couldn't do anything to oppose democracy.
And if it happens, then the most reasonable thing would continue to use the stones.
About 200 opposites of the S21 project were then imported one of the weighted stone parallelepied in average 80 kilograms, with the value between 6,50 and 14 euros.
Some guard it as to remember in everything by hopeing that they can also make it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had 500 tonnes, 25 full charges of a truck.
About half of the forest is still covered in the forest, the rest has been sold for a long time.
owners of gardens, land-agency gardens, Particulars.
They came from all parts and brought everything that could enter into the coffee and the ribs.
These steel stones of Stuttgart have been transformed for a long time in "Mauerle" or in limits of herbs plates.
"In fact, this stone is nothing private," said Mr. Rongen.
"in the summer this political component."
He enters his whole car, makes the tour of his wide empire of 20 hectares.
He has done legal studies that he has abandoned. Afterward, he has undertaken to study the biology before he was interested in the information and to become a carri√®re.
And a stone amateur.
The store is 40000 tonnes.
He loved the treasure around Germany.
IL claims it is the largest market of old stones.
He's relaxing.
Sculpted sand stones with art are placed on the nest.
"August, they were part of the Marianbridge bridge in Dresde."
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, call him with entusiasm.
"My favorite stone."
He takes the road that goes through the forest.
He shows a tas of sweet: Red Peter, previously, part of the car of Karlsruhe.
And so soon.
Good travery.
The paralllepipede was part of the tribe of Stuttgart.
In the nest of the stones and stories, the travertin of Cannstatt from the police prefecture, the red grain from the Holy Blasien Cathedral, which comes from the hospital of Heilbronn.
What a work, what a great effort!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that the stones were sculpted in the hand and moved by using simple palains and carrettes slaughtered by bowls, he becomes very respectful.
"This would be a scandale if such a patrimonie was put into part."
He has not become rich, even less rich.
But this career is currently employed by 14 people. In addition, stones, a sculptor, a forgeron, a drinker and a garden have been installed in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's gratifying", says the recycle of waste.
Nevertheless, he's got to get to Cologne.
There's also stones to save.
Trust of talents to conquer high potentials
The kitchen knows a life-friendy.
16 students are bosculated to buy small bread at the saumon, tomate pigs and white-managers.
The technical university of Braunschweig and the Volkswagen car manufacturer invited students in design and mechanical genius to a workshop.
In the context of a kind of ideas, they need to talk on the car of the future with the VW designers and, through, know the solid Volkswagen.
Today, many enterprises do not have to go to the body to the competition to make better brains and to join themselves, such as Volkswagen, in a multiform cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Recuper the most worthy diplomates as far as possible in the amphithetors before the latter arrive on the employment market, and they are not cut off by the other.
And since universities do not publish statements on the performance of their students, it is tried to re-excellent talents in practice projects and to fidelize them.
On the second day of the workshop organized at the Technical University of Brauschweig, the Amadous Mobile Group the talents.
A young woman of staff service shares the styles, bonbons and cards that include Volkswagen logo.
She speaks of the calendar of professional stages and jobs students to young talents; she shows their ways to access the group's pregnancy.
It's Nico Selle of the Technical University of Braunschweig who is responsible for the project employed with Volkswagen.
For him, there are recital advantages for both parties: "Learnings enter into contact with this industrial sector and gain experience."
"For the Volkswagen group, it can know students, look closer to serious candidates, and appreciate those who enter online as a collaborator."
According to M. Selle, such cooperation is inhabited.
What's again, it's the oppressive with which students are looking for.
"August, the focus was made on the professional project,‚Äù said Mr. Selle.
The struggle for the competition of new diplomas will become more intensive.
In the fields of the sector, enterprises can no longer recruit their collaborators by performing a three on a candidate ciriel.
But they must benefit their reliability and, especially, cut the high-qualified hand.
This is especially the diplomates of engineering subsidies that are in a excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of German technicians, more than 40,000 engineers have remained in occupation in October.
And according to the VDI previsions, the empty Engineering positions will still grow.
Roman Dykta's heading to talents for the account of KPMG, audit office, account expertise and advice.
It organizes costly events for the recruitment of talents, such as KPMG-Race, a type of rallye-papier, where competitors need to find their way through GPS coordinated.
The company will thus send eight promising students in the next year so that they go to the United States.
Participants can accessively visit KPMG's branches and know the company.
The person who must participate is decided to advance after two selection procedures.
Only the creation of many candidates will take place for the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the means used to search for high potential in universities are more important.
"We want to evacuate the lot through the cruise course."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little."
For the talent chair that is Mr Dykta, the account seems to be there.
"Together, we have stayed in contact with all people who have taken part of the last year to a similar action."
"Child of them are on the point of finishing their studies and want to address their requests to our company immediately." He states.
Out of the direct adjustment carried out in the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises act in a very classic way by participating in professional fires where they are delivering the chase to the brain.
"We are trying to reach diplomas by participating in professional salons."
"For example, in the sun-based technology hall," Mrs. Sitha St√ºbe, director of Human Resources at Solarworld, manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
This company is installed in Bonn employed by about 1500 people in Germany.
Ms. St√ºbe has known the problem with the reception.
Currently, 35 posts are placed on the company's website.
"In this moment, it's very difficult to get vacant posts."
"This cost costs and takes a lot of time," does he assure?
Another way to establish contact is to pass through university teachers.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, for example, the University of Fribourg.
"Learners indicate that the student has the opportunity to perform professional stages or to write his project of final study at our home."
Available advertising campaigns are announced in the Solar Specialists.
This is why the company is trying to make its advertising by employing other qualitys: personalized environment, plate herarchia and easy communication.
"Only, a large group can't do this," Mrs. St√ºbe, head of staff.
For a long time the money does not play the main role in employment search.
Flexible work hours, child guard or good promotion opportunities are the other determinant factors.
According to a study conducted by the Great Place to Work, Solarworld operates the 55th place among the 100 best employees in Germany.
The institution is a annual honor table of German employers.
In this regard, it interviews collaborators on their degree of satisfaction in relation to their work and its context while considering the main conditions of employees.
The Chief of Personal Mrs. Stube hopes that this placement will enable the immature of the company to be improved by employees.
"I think that the candidates are particularly addressed to external assessments in terms of potential employer," says it.
Wolf Reiner Deutscher Employer Branding Academy (Deutscher Employer Branding Academy, DEBA) advises the companies who want to build a good reputation as employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Warler, this means mostly taking internal measures.
"The best way for a employer to become attractive is to pass through his own collaborators," he states.
This is called, according to the garden used in the sector, the internal image strategy, namely, the creation of the employer's brand image within its own effectiveness.
"co-operators have strongly satisfied the best messagers."
When they are treated well with his employees and identified with the company, they only make the advertising of their employer at their friends and knowledge.
"It's like we played it in an orchester," says Mr. Warler.
Obama with a fleet to the new oil forge
There will be no new oil forecasts in the Mexican golf along the Flood Coast, the South-East State of the United States, during the coming years.
The Government of Washington made a prohibition An equivalent prohibition and thus finally cancelled its initial plans.
Even along the Atlantic coast, new forecasts remain for the moment forbidden.
The secretariat at the Interior Ken Salazar made this lunch advertising.
This is the explosion, in April, of the "Deep Wat Horison" forecast platform that is originating this strict ban, which must remain in force at least for the next five years.
As a result of this accident, which costs the life of 11 employees and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, subject to the pressure of the opposition and the activity sector, had indicated that he was disposed to authorize the achievement of new forums in the eastern part of the Mexico Golf.
Participants in this solution therefore want to reduce the dependence of the United States in respect of foreign countries in terms of oil supply.
The question of knowing the responsibilities of the devastating black marine in the golf is not, until now, definitely resolved.
The British oil group, which is faced with demands for demunization of several billions, is located in the centre of accused.
A investigation committee established by Obama should submit its current conclusions in December.
In October, the secretariat at the Interior Ken Salazar had leaked the glass of the decreed forecast after the explosion of the platform.
Following this decision, various oil groups had soon submitted requests for new forage projects.
With more strict control measures and severe security consignments, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new disaster.
The competent control authority, which has been discr√©dited after many corruption accused, is now the object of deep reforms.
Similarly, Mr. Obama announced that they would eliminate fiscal winners from giant and oil groups.
The actors of this activity sector are now publicly maintaining the fact that the density of food in the golf would be clearly lower than the case until now.
"The Government's goal is to make a free to rapid growth of the gas and oil sector" according to the result of an current examination carried out in the sector by the BDO Audit Office, before the mercredied forge prohibition.
Moreover, American Energy Alliance regrets the incertitude that characterizes this sector: "Personn knows what will change exactly with regulations."
Investment granted in new support projects has been reported to new order, detrimental growth.
The Ogoni country is sec
The water flowing in the rivers is brun oil; it gives a similar ear to that in the essence station: because of a fleet, billions of green oil litres destroyed the Ogoni country in Nigeria.
Humans live in flights, corruption and oil raffinage.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Do not smell," launchs the ecological warrior to journalists to calm them: "You are still enough of oil in front of the water lens."
The Nigerian of 37 years has tried to photograph a young man swimming water to the swimming water, as well as the fat training that around it: This scene seems almost beautiful in the water shoe at the color of the skin.
It cannot be seen that the sub-sol restricts breast oil shoes.
On the stream of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom tells her that she collected crevettes by all seals here.
But in the meantime, calm waters have completely tariving.
Five years ago, a large amount of oil jailed by a oleodide that was explosed in the shift.
Fishermen in the small neighbourhood of Bodo must now ride for six hours to reach fishing water: the Ogoni country situated in the heart of the Delta del Niger is considered as one of the most polluted regions in the world.
Everything the extensive swimming swimming in the eye when the swimming shoes crossed by water courses.
Instead of a clear water, the motor ship feed a swimming water. Whoever slows his hand to remove all oil cover.
The small roots of the manrove embrace the earth as religious batons. The isolated palms are tragicly painting their palms.
They are searching for the clouds of birds, such as normally found in the humid areas: Since the motor is stopped, a fantastic silence is cut on this paradise of an ancient paradise, which is like a service station by the hot.
"What happens here is a war against the environment," Mr. Celestine Akpobari declares with a tragic air: "There is our life characterized by a permanent danger for health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where the Ogoni lived is a battle camp for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first European operators have been here; the first resistance was organized in 1980 by the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. It was later executed. In 1993, the Shell Group had to interrupt its production activities in this region because they were very dangerous for its employees.
Today, the return to the Ogoni country is banned to this society: while more than 2 million black gold bars are daily pomped by over 5000 pounds of forecast and 7000 kilometers of olive oil throughout the Delta region, three times large as Switzerland, the Ogoni oil fields are inexplosive because the situation is too instable for this oil group.
All the few hundred meters of sleeves swimming into the water of the steel treasures as weird sculptures: they are very affectedly designated "grace trees of Christmas" the heads of forgest sculptures.
They have up to 50 years, most of them are cut by corrosion up to retreat.
Apobari believes that a forgement head of this nature falls in time in skin, because a constant green oil floor in the water.
According to the expert estimates, more than two billion litres have been on the ecosystem in 50 years: each year, the amount of oil equal to that of the sea in the accident of the super-ocean "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago, one of the largest environmental disasters in the history of humanity.
Who must take the responsibility of the persistent environmental pollution? The answer to this question is divided by the actors.
For the shell group, the saotage and the syphony of oleodics are responsible for more than 90% of pollution. Environmentalists consider the explosions of forecast heads and perforated olive oil as the main causes.
In 2008, the American researcher Richard Steiner repressed the Shell Group to apply the Nigerian mainly less strict security standards than all over the world: only the rate of conduct failures is "be much higher than all allies".
Some forms embark on a place that is like a abandoned workshop, full of cambous and installed on the free air: they are completely null and covered by cambout to the coast.
A skin fire under one of the many tons that are soon connected to the toilets, soon without reasons on the site must be repeated: a small clandestine raffine.
We're shooting the crude oil in the tsunami for several hours, explaining Michael, the team chief.
In the first time, the essence in a receipt by passing by tubes, then, at the extremeness of the conduct of the heroin goats, and the diesel is finally obtained.
This is how Michael and his four collaborators are produced daily four pieces of Ceil of 300 litres: "Cela reports us $34,000 Naira", about $22.
Delta's inhabitants were part of the chronic fuel penis in the largest oil producer in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one raffinery.
Illicit raffiners can sell to a less cost than the ridiculously low of EUR 40 centimeters per litre of Essel: because they purchase their first material freely.
It is offered by the "protectors" which put the oil network across the country of the Ogoni. According to experts, the country lost at least 16 million litres of oil in the whole North of the Niger.
Only a small part of the prestigious first material is unlawfully cleaned: the networks of organized crime, which also contain members of the high-range politicians and militarys, load the lion part in tankers and the world market brain.
The warrior Akpobari believes that the debate on the question of knowing whether environmental disaster should be allocated or instead of subversive activities to the population or the laxist production mode is fully academic.
"If oil companies weren't seen as intruces and if the foundations of the fishermen's life were not so destructed, there were no Sabotage, nor illegal flights and raffineries."
But in the meantime, the relationships of the Ogoni, especially in the view of the Shelf, were so deteriorate that it was no longer a question than the retreat of the group. "That may be that operators have other nationalities, such as Chineses, will be better revealed."
So Michael becomes nervous.
"It's a great time you're deguering," announces the oil's ocean robust.
"The soldiers can appear at any time."
If illegal raffiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be the subject of an arrest, but, at least, they will offer them to the best.
Even soldiers from the north of the country have heard benefits like all the Nigerians of the first material.
"In any sense of view, this crazy thing took down our country well low," regrets Akpori.
The investigators discover the construction deficiencies in the A380 reactors
A380 expressly suffers a great security problem.
Reviewing a device that has performed an emergency atterration, the investigators have found a possible construction shortage that can lead to "the catastrophic deficiency of the reactor".
Qantas flight company now wants to complain to the reactor manufacturer.
In November, the airbus passengers from Quantas company had been visiblely more likely: During the investigation that she carried out, the Australian air security authority found that the reactors of certain A380 devices had a serious security problem, and it maintained a possible slight of construction.
This potential deficiency could cause serious consequences: it can cause smoking crystals and escapes at the level of oil conduction, which is indicated in a position taken this Thursday by the ATSB administration.
She could lead to "a catastrophic deficiency of reactors".
Rolls-Royce manufactured reactors and equipped 20 aircrafts from the A380 series.
The Airbus of Quantas Company, which was urgently shooted on November 4 in Singapore, is among them.
The Australian airline has now engaged in prosecution against the English reactor manufacturer.
She has sent a judicial complaint to an Australian federal court whose seat is in Sydney, which gives him the opportunity to take other legal measures against society.
The director of Quantas, Mr. Alan C≈ìd√®s, stated that his company would claim interest-free damages in relation to the incident occurred early November.
parts were disabled, and the portion surface was damaged during the motor fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, it's the oil inflammation that is originating the decades.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced in the world.
Australian investigators announced that other security tests will be carried out on superjumbos that are also equipped with reactors in matters.
Security recommendations are the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, Mr. Martin Dolan's speaking door.
The security problem is considered sufficiently important to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency shuttle of his aircraft, the Quantas airline had reserved all its A380 fleet for a week.
Singapore Airlines temporaryly realized three of its 11 A380.
The Airhansa Company has replaced a A380 reactor with caution.
The aircraft at two floors is the largest line aircraft in the world.
The neighbouring fall over the whole territory causes a chaos in transportation
Germany's whole white copper: On a night, the nest has fallen in almost all the country.
The chaos is dominated on all roads, trains and aircrafts are immobilized.
At least three people died in movement accidents.
The winter makes swimming in Germany: By glass temperatures, almost all the Republic is shineing in the Tuesday night, which leads to the chaos in many locations.
In the north and eastern, the neighbouring cover reaches 15 centimeters per place.
The movement is strongly limited on several authorisations and on many roads.
On the national A7 in Flensburg, winter service staff continued to work on a permanent basis, but they couldn't come out of the nest that was left to accumulate.
Moreover, raw violence has swifted the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office of Maritime Navigation and Hydrographic Navigation (DSH) expected that the marine race was the Baltic Coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels that can reach 1.2 m above normally.
The neighbors on authors and federal roads have resulted in serious problems in Saxe.
This is why the Meteomedia Meteomedia Warning Centre announced the violence warning level was announced in Switzerland: in fact it is the highest level.
By places, 30 centimeters of neighbouring swimming clouds have dispersed the strong winds and expenses.
several cars and cars have remained in the night.
Even in the country of Saxe-Anhalt, police authorities announced serious disorders on roads.
On the A2 car, the snow and the wind interrupted the movement and caused legs.
In Thuringe, the neighbors touched the A4 and A9 authorisations.
According to the German Bahn, serious disorders of rail traffic have occurred in Saxe, Saxe-Anhalt, Thuringe and the north of Bavi√®re.
The main problems are: the nest on the iron roads, the trees falling on the fertile roads, the cath√©naries and the destroyed eggs.
In Saxe, interregional Leipzig-Nuremberg was to break.
In Sallfeld, Thuringe, a ICE train on destination of Munich had to stop his journey.
The pompiers and paramedical shoes had to supply the 165 passengers of the train in covers, food and drinks.
Near winds have swimmed the roads.
The neighbouring switchs covered many flight cancellations in the main airports of Germany.
According to a standard port and flight information, some cancels are already announced in Munich.
A Fraport's port states that 40 flights have already been cancelled in Francfort on the Main.
The winter service and ensures a permanent service.
It is true that passengers in the airport are not more than 400 beds.
Unfortunate accidents were produced after midday on a lot of roads.
On the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost life during a collision with a train at a level.
The train driver was slightly blessed.
Because of the neighbors present on the roads, a similar accident has not been far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was awarded at a level passenger because the vehicle was realized there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were blessed in the train, so the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until morning.
Furthermore, a 30-year-old woman died when his car took tonne on a shocking shoes in Aucciburg.
However, meteorologists announce a good news: Near will always be smooth and powder, but it will turn to twitter in case of dragon lights.
But the wind's going to fail.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by violent and fast winds.
However, it is very cold, at least 15 degrees per place.
German Bank is looking for a buyer for its jumelles tours.
The German Bank is trying to separate its emblem: According to the information reported by newspapers, this financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings situated in the Francfort seat.
This building could report up to 500 million euros.
The German Bank was just just to embarrass the group's headquarter: the juvenile tours in the businessquarter have been modernized; while waiting for bankers had to return to their former service location.
Dorenavant, the financial group clearly seeks to recover the renewal costs and seeks a buyer for its two buildings, as wrote the Financial Times Germany newspaper.
This speaker has not indicated the reasons for the sale planned.
He said "we are more interesting to take care of the buildings or to sell them, and to put them again in place."
This is how the largest financial institution in Germany has already entered its seat, a few days later.
It is only in the middle of 2007 that the bank had purchased the juvenile tours for a amount of 272 million euros with own fund holders, and then reabled them.
Transformations for energy optimising have, according to certain indications, involved around 200 million euros.
Of course, a sale would report a lot of money to the bank.
According to the information provided by the newspaper, experts in this activity sector consider the value of the tours rebapted between "Tower Green" and around 500 million euros.
According to the talk, it is not known now whether the buildings will be re-vended to a fund belonging to the bank or an independent investor.
Thousands of people smile the minors who died.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 persons had a thought for the minors who were declared dead after several explosions occurred in a mine.
The body was not yet able to return because the safety situation of the shooter was continued to be precautional.
Two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 minors whose age was between 17 and 62 years were underground.
A sond was introduced in the sleeves, but no trace of survivors was found.
Because of the strong concentration of toxic gas and other explosions that have followed, no assistance team was able to fall in the mine for security reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration considered that minors had no chance to survive.
Until the body couldn't be remounted.
Today, parents and friends organized a party at the memory of the dead.
Thousands of people were assembled under a sunk in Greymouth, south of the Neo-Zelanda island.
They watched two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29-minor, 29 tables were installed on which the names, casts and lamps were used.
The personal photos and effects, including the clothes and the surf plates, were also their place.
The dragons were made in front of all the public buildings of the country.
The Prime Minister of New Zealand John Key said to participants to the Memorial Festival that New Zealand feeded the hope that minors would return to the surface.
"But they've never come home."
Mr. Lawrey Drew, whose son Zen was saved in the country, stated that he could not be resigned to accept the death of his son as long as he had not seen his rest.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the parents of the victims, several foreign diplomates took part in the Memorial Festival.
In the first explosion of 19 November, minors of South Africa and British were also trained.
The securits began to escape a fire within the carbon mine of the South Zealand New Zealand island.
The police prefect Gary Knowles explained the journalists that when explosive gas massas are moved, burning temperatures inside the mine start to low down.
Go in hell, fighter!
Is Splatter movie a artificial movie?
Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the old man by his film "Walhalla Rising", which was epoched by the fighter.
In what public, the Danish realist Nicolas Winding Refn can you think about "Walhalla Rising" ?
A warrior Viking (Mads Mikkelsen) has only an eye made prisoner; he frees from his barrier and, with almost supernatural force, removes his adversarys after each other. This seems ideal for young men's spectacles to find a bloody action, just because our hero uses brutal killing methods. When he is a bad humble, he shocks the intents of his enemy without expecting that they are dead.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the gargani does not say any word on his true name. Even the other personalities, at least, are able to escape from one or two words some of the powerful agony cris.
On the other hand, we are not talking and celebrating in the unbelievable mountain landscape of Scocia, which is the decor of the Vikings universe, about thousand years ago.
It would be ideal more mature cinema with interest in existingism and excellent travellings.
When a movie looks at several target groups, it is damaged to exclude them mutually.
The realist Winding Refn is considered, since the "Pusher," his trilogia relating to fake and full-style drug traffic, as a kind of Quentin Tarantinon, but it refuses to bring a little more humor to the dominant channel or to introduce a little less brutality in the cinema of art and test.
The majority of the sympathists of the art cinema must be tested from the horrible face of the brain that swallows all around and intelligence.
Action movies amateurs die, when the garage is locked, for reasons that it can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries in a ship to destination of Jerusalem; they are burned forever by calm and brume before the shipment arrives in America and continues to spend.
It is not so surprised that "Walhalla Rising" has found no film distributor in Germany and that there is only a DVD format.
It is especially because of the wonderful images of the poor who pleaded a certain attention, but also because the image of a palpitant movie, in time to another, is hiding behind a pretensive and bloody appearance.
It is not a dialogue in this film, nor a coherent action, everything is ambience, a faithful dream transformed into movie.
The spectrum can't escape it.
Refn gives him a moment of detention and slowly cut the gorge with glass images and a lugable sound band, but especially with an unsuccessable hate that jails from the heart of the persons.
Only a young blond boy, who is loyal to the sides of the guard, keeps a certain innocence, and all others are enthusiasmed by anger.
Moreover, the warning hero whose mobiles are never known, but who return from hell at any time to fight enemy and temporaryly allies by transforming themselves in war, may be sent from the devil itself.
It represents the prostitution, but maybe nothing for those who are, in any way, for them.
"Walhalla Rising" is a enemmatic film that can be hate or admired, which finally has the acting, enthusiasm and admiration.
A traumatically experience.
Mysterious landscape work
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications on a nuclear programme developed by Syria.
However, this country refuses to take position on this subject, even less than to be submitted to the Agency's controls.
In the night from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four F-15 I Israeli chair planes attacked a mysterious building in the Syrian territory.
It is located on the river of the Euphrates; the largest city nearby is 30 kilometers (30 km) away: Dair as-Sur.
His name is included in the IAEA documents, as it is the reactor that Syria has built appears with the help of the northern Korea in stone paralelepide, which is dissimulation in a valle marked by the absence of electric path.
According to a letter from the United States Information Services, the current reactor, known under the name of the neighbourhood, El-Kibar, would be able to produce plutonium, which would enable atomic weapons to produce.
However, this technique is valid since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation video that includes floor satellite images.
Through the computer's animation, it indicated the probable location of each component of the reactor before the destruction of the central, which represents a miniature of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the building located near, or inside.
It seems that the reactor was on the point of being in service, but it was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, more than three years after Israeli bombing, there are also more information available than at the time, and even, with the time, mystery is increasingly disappeared.
The former President of the United States George W. Bush recently revealed in his memories before this attack, the CIA was certain that Syria had built a reactor in El Kibar, but had not had few indices shown by this country developed "a active nuclear weapons programme".
Some information agents in Europe prefer to be more careful about this and only talking about a "reactor-presumer", even though they consider the CIA's presentation as "plauable".
He lacks evidence to them, as well as to the IAEA.
A high-range diploma of the United Nations was only given a Lacony response by claiming that IAEA had ‚Äúdocuments sufficient to put questions‚Äù.
The Syrians certainly removed the decombres of the "inutilized military building" and processed with a methodic planning of the field.
However, in June 2008 a team of IAEA experts conducted by the former inspector Oli Heinonen, found in El-Kibar uranium tracks produced by men.
Furthermore, IAEA has received a Member State of the satellite images of commercial providers that showed the time that had followed the attack directly. It seems that these are more slightly than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous commander, perhaps Israel, has purchased them in exclusiveness.
It is therefore impossible for IAEA to establish their authenticity in an objective manner.
Syria has always assured that it had never implemented a secret atomic programme and that it had not built a reactor.
Damas supports the uranium found on the site from Israel's weapons.
But IAEA rejected this argument after the analysis of the particules as a questionnaire.
Since that time, ladies refused any discussion about this, as well as about satellite images.
In addition, Syria does not allow controllers to perform a second inspection on the site of El-Kibar and refused access to the decombred building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel keeps an obstined silence.
Reaffirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister at the time of the attack, recently said: "We will never make comments on this subject."
This is as well as the investigation on this matter has been long since June 2008 without being achieved to a result, and it "develops more into a serious problem of credibility of the Agency", as recognizes an Western high-rang diploma in service to the IAEA seat in Vienna, finally a serious violation of the Nuclear Weapons Prohibition Treaty.
The IAEA believes that in order to achieve progress, the existence of the three other installations must be clarified with the presumed reactor.
Until now, inspectors have no indication of which installations are here, nor what their function or what they are suspected to contain.
According to the information published by the Southdeutsche Journal, they are also known in the IAEA respectively under the names of Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iscandariayah.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security (International Science and International Security Institute) identified these locations and discovered the satellite images near Masyaf, which would be very likely one of the suspect objects.
It is possible that it is located in a military or directly side of that; this is exactly the reason why Syria rejects the access of the three sites to IAEA inspectors.
In Vienna, Syrians claim that the inspection group was actually a sponsor that would be sent on behalf of the United States by IAEA to sponsor military facilities.
Actually, it is a information provided by the United States secret agents that attracted the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have made ships between the three sites and the stone paralelepide for transporting substances.
A Western highrang diploma said to Vienna that at least one of the installations could "serve to the production of fuel".
There would not be "no indications regarding sensitive activities", such as the enrichment and retraction of the uranium; processes that are essential to the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor is certainly functioning through uranium not enriched.
However, there is a rigorous hypothesis on the following fundamental issues: from which the uranium had to come and where the plutonium was later separated to the manufacture of the bomb.
It is ignored if records, which could hide high value tracks, have been stored in the three sites.
When the hundreds of land loaded trucks are lost, nobody will have information on the store place.
For IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria has examined the mining of al-Tibni salt in 1998, situated only a few miles from El-Kibar, on the other side of the Eurorate, to see whether it can agree to the storage of radioactive waste.
Recently analyzing satellite photos taken on the account of the famous magazine Jane's Intelligence Review, the former IAEA inspector, Mr. Robert Kelley established a link between those and the reactor concerned.
Satellite photos, however, show that Syria has undertaken terrace works in the three suspect sites and moved large containers when IAEA began to demand access to these sites.
It is possible to be a coincidence, but it has not contributed to escape suspicion.
In the diplomatic environments, he said that IAEA has been developing a plan on inspections to be carried out for a number of months, and that plan should allow Syria to keep possible military secrets. Only the time it shows what great interest the inspectors have in this case.
During that time, Damas has also rely on this proposal.
For a year ago, if western diplomas in Vienna had not made a state of the destruction of the reactor, the emergency would not be signaled for this case, for example, Glyn Davies, the U.S. Ambassador, who has been known for a few months, which is known under the name of the special inspections, one of the most powerful means of the Atomic Agency to carry out its controls.
The Director of IAEA, Mr. Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has certainly already spoken of "a option to which I am open for the future," but he still endorses.
This means a great risk: there is, on the one hand, a majority of the IAEA Governors Council and a lot of the 35 countries represented there have no desire to see the situation of a scale.
On the other hand, as the diploma who gives it to reflect, "If it would serve, if at the end they find nothing."
Love in war time
It's bad since Angelina Jolie did his begins as a realist.
She wrote the scenario itself: it's a love history between a woman originating in Bosnia and a serving man.
We don't know any more about this story, but this is enough to cause males.
A continuing rum indicates that the woman, a musulman, has become a loving musulman, has fallen in his Serb bourreau during the war of Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women Federations immediately protested, and in response, some round sequences planned in Sarajevo were moved in Hungary in the last minute.
Between the film is turned in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests are still continued in Bosnia.
According to the information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the war victims' organization addressed a correspondance to Angelina Jolie by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (HCR) and requested to meet the actor.
She is not diplomatic, and a few weeks ago she proposed that these women meet them in Hungary, but they declined this offer.
"The meeting must stay in Bosnia", says Hasecic.
There were no love stories in the concentration camps, and Jolie's scenario said enough about his attitude towards the victims.
The Guardian reports that the Hasecic organization then recommended the United Nations High Commissioner to remove the quality of a mission of good will in Angelina Jolie.
But what kind of scenario Jolie wrote?
The Bosnian Ministry of the Culture, who received copies of his scenario, granted a tournment authorisation to Sarajevo, but it is not known why it was not then arrived, despite this authorisation.
The young author itself ensures that it does not continue political objectives with its film, that it has made many efforts to know the Yugoslav conflict, and supports that it wants to carry out the terrible consequences of the war and to give the opportunity to all stakeholders to express themselves.
However, it remains vacuous about the content.
This is how a second synopsis of the circle movie on the Net. It is quite different: Love were well known before the beginning of the war. He again meets the woman, a bosnic muslim, is deported in the Serbia concentration camp where the man works as a gardien.
This is also a great difference with the version "A victim of violence is loved by his boreau".
The film of Jolie began well before the war, of course.
The pressure on it, thus Jolie, is "injust and based on wrong information".
Now, only Hollywood's fanatics can provide peace with him: By putting this scenario illegally in the Net, as well as other previously.
Come on, let's go!
Tonight, it's going to be well again at the Irish.

The experts of the Economic and Social Research Institute indicate that 100,000 Ireland will be left in their country.
They even prescribed a number of 200,000 migrants from 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4,5 million people.
If these predictions are achieved, it will be a currency of migration comparable to those suffered by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom during which the Irishs played a great chagrin, the chagrin now takes the whole place.
However, the economic crisis is particularly affected by the young Irish, well formed, who have not yet known only times of happiness.
Labour loss and social decline seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there's more money.

"But the work in the foreign area is an extraordinary opportunity to make the first steps at the level of the professional herarchie", says the responsible.
His website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snake surfants in Canada.

Since six months, Sean O'Donovan knows what it means to be based on another.
As there was no more to do in Ireland for this 29-year engineer, he now worked with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction and Germany sector.
A mode house just appears from land to Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other Hannovre or Berlin projects.
Among the time, O'Donovan is only rarely visiting her birth country, since he participates in an additional job post, in order to be able to repay the contracted credit to build his home to the country.
"The situation is already a little thrilled," he says by franking his home's floor for the first time after a long time.
"I win the money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I live almost no longer."
He slows a smile over the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-trained gardens, costful cars of large brands are stationed on accessways.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house in common with his sister for a amount of EUR 380,000, funded to 100 per cent by credit.
"These were moments of fool, without doubt, the money was easy," he stated.
Does it be afraid to see everything out because of credit?
O'Donovan thinks a moment, heat the tea and says, "I have no kids to tear and I'm young; even everything goes through, I can divide to zero."
The Engineer of the building does not like the laughing he often hears these last days.
"Personn must not suffer hunger, our situation is not even so dramatic as what we lived in the island once again," he supports.

"He was back after seven years ago and, in Ireland, life continued. "
Please give Cian Tanner this idea.
Let the future and find out how life happens otherwise.
In his palmer, he has already been working a few years in London. This is the reason why life must not be so easy in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend.
But there's another thing that concerns her in the past few days: the party to organize at his 27th anniversary in Dublin.
He's afraid she couldn't turn to the audience evening.
"Only, not much of the emotions," he said drinking a long beer gorgy.
"Everything, that looks like anxiety."
"Please call this a evening to see you, all over, joining a few friends, with a few drinks and a few games."
Democratic routine
Democracy support in Latin America continues to increase, as well as private undertakings.
Crime has become a greater concern than the unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more affected by the United States in a major part of the region.
There are some conclusions of the last Latinobarometer analysis taken in 18 countries and published in exclusively by The Economist.
Since the examination has been regularly carried out since 1995, it follows the changes of attitude in the region.
Two related elements refer to the results of the review of this year, carried out in September and early October.
The first is the sufficiently insolent humor of Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Democracy support has increased sensitively in several countries on the transition of South America (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has been averaged by 6 per cent per year since 2002, democracy support has been at least 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent in 2005.
It has also increased in Mexico, where the economy has been reduced after a strong decline in production last year.
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most small countries in the region, are convincing democrats, which makes a decrease in the regional average (see table 2).
Some 44 per cent of the respondents in the region were satisfied with the way their country's democracy worked in practice; this is the same number as the last year, but with a strong increase of 25 per cent in 2001 (graph 3)
Some 34 percent said they had confidence in their country Parliament and 45 per cent in their governments, as last year in both cases; but it was strongly increased in 2003 (respectively 17 per cent and 24 per cent).
10 years ago, the economic problems in Latin America have increased democracy support.
If this has been good during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in America have not been subjected to a short recession and have benefited from a strong reprise.
In addition, a social security network has contributed to the protection of poor people.
(The Economic Commission of the United Nations for Latin America reported this week that the percentage of Latin Americans living in poverty has only increased slightly in 2009 and has again slowed up this year to 32 per cent.)
However, humor is significantly different from one country to another (see graph 4.).
The good economic performances of Brazil and the popularity of its exhibiting President, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, are translated by a largely shared sense of progress
What is more rare in Mexico and Central America where recession has been worse and violent crimes have been aggressive.
It is only the second time since the examination has started only more respondents through Latin America in its whole have mentioned the crime instead of unemployment as the most important problem for their countries (see table 5).
About 31 per cent of them say that they or one of them were victims of a criminal act in the past year, but this figure is in decline by 38 per cent in the last year and is the most lowest since 1995.
A more robust economic performance reflects in the increase in private enterprise support and the market economy: about 71% of the respondents in the region say that private undertakings are essential for development, against 56% in 2007 (see Graph 6).
Some 58% believes that market economy is the only system that will make its developed countries, against 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62 per cent of Venezuela's respondents are this opinion (and 80 per cent supports the private company); even though their left President, Hugo Chavez, exemption of many private enterprises.
Brazil is the largest dominant in the region, mentioned by 19 per cent of the persons asked (besides 18 per cent the last year), followed by the United States (9 per cent, changed by the last year) and Venezuela (9 per cent, in decline of 11 per cent since the last year)
But the United States are considered as the most influenced country by respondents in Mexico and most of the Central Americas, while Venezuela played this distinction in Equator, Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A vote contained
Nobody expected to have perfect general elections in Haiti on 28 November.
But it was very worse than foreigners who wanted to help the narrow and pulled country in fear.
Selective boxes and a new voter, voting bottles dispersed in boards, saccaged vote offices and intimidations
The vote offices would be late tonight.
Many of the Haitians, including many who were moved after the January seismo, were wrong in the neighbor to find where to vote.
Some of them finished to leave.
A twenty-five candidate to the presidency, including several presumed favorites, denied fraud and claimed to cancelle the election.
Protections, sometimes violent, have explosed through the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the High Officer of the United Nations in Haiti, considers the event as "a full choice in terms of respect".
Observers of the United States and the Caribbean Community have clearly stated that they did not believe that these irregularities, as serious, were necessaryly invalidated the process.
In other words, the spectacle continues.
The election authority, whose opponents are restored to Ren√© Preval, who is impopulary President, and his candidate, Jude Celestin, must announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The second expected tour is planned for January.
Every hope in the election is not lost.
The two candidates of the opposition, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a first woman, left their initial call to make no vote.
But there may be problems if Mr. Celestin, who has little or no perceptive support in elections, is declared by the election authority as having reached the second tower reaching the second tour.
With a cholera epidemic that makes rare, and more than 1 million survivors in the seismo that still live in tendencies, it was afraid that the participation would be.
In the darkness, many Haitians wanted to vote, but they were prevented of doing this because of the disorder.
About 250 000 identification cards, necessary to vote, were not yet distributed a few times before the election.
It's important.
Donors see the election of a popular and legal government as a major step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, it's clear, the Haitians do it themselves.
The foot point to the center
The weeks after being suddenly old, Cristina Fern√°ndez, President of Argentina, benefited from a public sympathy vague that improved its 20 points of approval rate, more than 50 per cent; it is its highest level since it was elected in 2007.
However, transforming this into a second mandate in the election of the next year could depend on the choice of Ms. Fern√°ndez, apparently deceived by which it would abandon or not the inconsistence of his defunt husband, predecessor and former political partner, N√©tor Kirchner.
And in this regard, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who has continued to manage economic policies, even after his wife was chairman, had the habit of elaborating budgets that were subject to tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to expend the additional income.
The Government of Ms. Fern√°ndez lost its majority in the Congress last year on paper.
But the opposition was divided, and the situation was decreased after the death of Mr Kirchner from a heart crisis on October 27.
Some of the dissident members of the perronist movement have been raised to Mrs Fern√°ndez.
But after chaotic meetings (which a parliamentary shocked the face of one of his couples and where others have accused of the corruption government), the Congress did not approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to discuss me," said the President.
Today, the 2010 budget will be implemented in the next year, letting the President further a larger handling margin to expenditure in will.
The overflow economy is widely flowing: it is likely to increase nearly 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is now 11,1%, but many private estimates and the salary returns of the unions are nearly 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took his functions in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic effective, made a priority for growth and poverty reduction, rather than inflation control.
He refused to treat MFF, he stripped the private sector and cleaned the INDEC, the Statistics Office, which made false statistics on official inflation.
Ms. Fern√°ndez, can you now modify these policies?
She called for conversations between private enterprises and trade leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit payment rates in the next year to 18%.
The economy has been stimulated by high global prices of agricultural exports in Argentina.
However, inflation has deteriorated the growth cut-off after a strong evaluation rate in 2002.
That may be the reason why Mrs Fern√°ndez shows the signs to re-establish the financial relations of Argentina to the rest of the world.
This year, the Government concluded an agreement with the binding persons who refused to restructure the debt for which Argentina did not regulate its debts in 2001.
Now Ms. Fern√°ndez seems to be able to go to an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it deserves $6.7 billion.
Kirchners always stressed the fact that it could not involve monitoring by FMI, as it is cotume.
But last month, Amado Boudu, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund would provide a "technological assistance" to design a new national consumption price index, which is like an inheritance of INDEC.
It is not clear if Mrs. Fern√°ndez wants to stay in policy beyond the end of his mandate, now that his husband is not anymore at its sides.
If it is done, she needs to win the support of the Middle Class, among which Kirchnerism is very preached.
When the Argentinas will return from their summer holidays in Mars, the sympathy vague for it will be flown.
If she wants to win another election, it should decide to reprove or not, without ridicule, many policies of her husband.
A half horra for China
The Thai electors are directed to a kind of closer Union with the continent.
What do Taiwan think of his grand brother located on the other side of the detroit?
More than 7.5 million electors were presented on 27 November, or 70 per cent of the acceptable persons, to elect the households and advisers in five urban districts, in the context of what is considered as a general assessment of the President, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma itself has become a substitute for feelings regarding the continent, which had had been linked to innovative business, including a partial free exchange package, in the largest reorganization of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. My succeeded test, but it's all right.
While his Kuomintang Party (KMT) had reported three of the five masters, he failed to report the majority of the votes.
Instead of that, the Democratic Democratic Party (DPP), who had thought of the full independence of Taiwan, reported about 50 per cent of all votes for KMT of 45 per cent.
If it was a presidential election, Mr. Ma would be difficult.
Since it was elected two years ago, the vote part of his party has fallen about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP has touched elections, even with KMT in municipal advice.
The event declared the majority of the main subjects of the Taiwan elections, including assembly cars and mass assembly dragons with girls who were at least swimming.
An obligatory mystery murder has also been pursued.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, KMT's honourable President, performed a election tour for a candidate from KMT at the electoral level.
A man of the people shooted on the young Mr. Lien, purely through the face, wounded him and killed a passenger.
Weirdly, it was not determined if the slaughter wanted to hurt Mr. Lien or to resolve a difference with the candidate.
In any way, Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PDP, murdered with consequences on the election by directing the suspect on the PDP and turning the elections to the KMT.
Maybe the largest winning of elections was China.
It was shocked to find out how much the question of the continental party itself was absent.
Instead, candidates played with public housing plans and employment.
Taiwan normally played its independence in fact and hate the Chinese military threat.
As a result, KMT has tendencies to avoid stopping its relationship with the Pekin government.
But this time, the DPP also abstend of attracting the anti-China feeling.
It is the response to a new conscience that Chinese enterprises are essential for Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr. Ma, for his part, reaffirmed whether his Chinese policy was acceptable for the majority of Taiwan.
It can be expected that the Peking Government continues to provide trade facilities, in accordance with its strategy to return to Taiwan.
China did not lose time to send a negotiator to Taipei to organize a Summit on Investment Protection and Medical Cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see a political integration, but let us start.
It is better to wait for this after the presidential election of 2012.
The PPP has been re-invented in any way.
Two years ago, he was bad: his former chief Chen Shui-By, was sent to prison after corruption accused.
President of 2000 to 2008, he was a provocator for explicit independence.
However, a new generation of moderates has been under the direction of Mrs. Tsai and the PDP implemented to address professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was welcomed as a candidate to the Presidency, such as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is in doing his best to show that he can also join with Pekin.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a contact point between the DPP and China, provided that their holdings could have been held without pre-conditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Thai public that his party presents a "alternative deal of trust" regarding the rapid approach of Mr. Ma about China.
Mr. Chen seems to be exacerbated by this change.
In a declaration published from its cell, he stated that the candidates of the PDP would have made better results if they insisted on the fact that Taiwan is a different country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, to do not blame the Presidency.
Even without the intervention of Mr. Chen, the PDP will be bad to choose among its potential candidates.
KMT must make itself introspection.
Mr. Ma's evaluations have been low; despite the vertical economic growth, KMT candidates did not want to camp with him.
It seems to be in majority due to the unemployment and the expansion of the feast between rich and poor.
A KMT's talking port says that his office and its local fronts will be remaned.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan's support for approach is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanians see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a editor editor, "the point of not return is already passing."
Names for Grammy Awards: Jazz Esperanza Spalding's song is a surprise selected in the category "Best New Artist"
Effect on the request of a President, and people are required to know it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist collected in hand by President Obama to take place at his Nobel Prize ceremony in Peace in 2009, marked one of the surprises of the Grammy Awards this year with a great envergure appointment in the category of the "more new artist".
Where Spalding is a very known figure on the jazz scene since 2008, "Esperanza", the appointment remains a little mysterious, but it is compatible with the rules of the Grammy Awards that a artist must not get out of more than three albums before the recording of this artist.
His ambitious album of 2010, "Chamber Music Society", certainly marked a step forward and, given its slightly launching vocal style, his pleasant pop and funk hand and its Latin influences, is possible to draw at least one line pointed in Spalding in relation to Norah Jones' succeeding success in 2003, the most closest equivalent for the electors of the Grammy Awards, taking into account jazz productions in this category in the past years.
On the other hand, the electors of the Grammy Awards just honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity" in the "instrumental album" category, a switch on a frisson that was a record that was one of the primary favorites last year.
Among these yesterday, "Moody 4B" of Veterinary Veterinary James Moody and "Positootly" of the cl√°vier John Beasley will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, a favorite for the rare voice of the New Orleans and a invitation frequently to the "Treme" of the HBO, was honored in the contemporary jazz category; which also slowly turns to a certain fusion with Stanley Clarke's albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The Sekretariat of Darcy James Argue, who was familiar with the stepsk, gained a few well-known recognition in the great category; in competition with the rich chamber-jazz of Billy Childs Common and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland, whose "Pathways" album of his octet live was a beautiful example of the democratic hand of this bassist as a group leader.
Name of Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey leading to classic categories
Classic names for the 53th Grammy Awards include a mixed of musicians and composers of the whole world.
On the head of the appointments, quotes "Deus Ex Machina" of Michael Daugherty, for the plan and the orchester, with five "you"; and "Dreamhouse" by Steve Mackey, an electric orchestral work, with three "yi".
Among the names who have links with South California, there is the Estonian Composer Arvo P√§rt for its symphony No.4, "Los Angeles", a work that was commanded by the Philharmonic Orchestre of Los Angeles and opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto of the composer based on Los Angeles, Avner Dorman, is also in license for a reward.
Classical nominations are divided on 13 categories containing orchster, office, chocolate and solitary records.
A category for the classic producer of the year sets five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The classic album names are the Symphonies No.3 and 4 of Bruckner of the Royal Orchestre of Concertge, "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" by Steven Mackey from Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrifium - the art of Castrati" which has different artists; and the "Requiem" of Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the class of the opera, the names are "Lulu" of the Mountain of the Royal Operative House, "Marc Antonio and Cleopatra" of Ars Lyrica Houston, "Amour de Loin" of Kaija Sariaho by German Symphonia-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wander" of Rodion Shchedrin of the Orchestra and the Chaosur of the Mariinsky; and "Ivanhoe" of Arthur Sullivan of the National Orchestra of Wales.
Composers that are placed for the Grammy Awards for the contemporary composition are P√§rt for the Symphony No.4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionally Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted".
The Part's Symphony No.4 was first in the Disney Hall in January 2009 in an execution registered by the Philharmonic Orchestre of Los Angeles, directed by Esa-Pecca Salonen.
The work of about 30 minutes is named "Los Angeles" and is sent to the ex-magnant Michael Khodorkovski oil in Russia.
The "Mandolin Concerto" of Dorman was appointed for its solitary instrumental performance with a orchestra.
The Composer of Los Angeles said he had written the work of 15 minutes specially for the interpretation of the Mandoline Avi Avital, which played the concert with the Metropolis Ensemble in New York.
"I wrote it using sounds in the Middle East and a large number of North African rhythms and rhythms," said Dorman in a telephone interview.
The Head of Orchestra Peter Boulez, 85 years old, received a appointment in the category of orchester performances for the Symphonic Orchestre of Chicago in a record of Stravinsky's works.
Among the instrumental solists who received a appointment, quotes Nelson Freire and Marc-Andr√© Hamelin; the organizer Paul Jacobs, the violonist Julia Fischer and the harpiste Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only names of vocalists; these are Anne Sofie Van Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonov, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classical melang category, Jessye Norman received a name for his record "Racines: my life, my song"
The project of the Themecula Mouse provides the approval of the planning committee.
A project of the Mouse in Temecula received an unilateral support from the local planning committee after over five hours of public witnessing, often patienced.
The critics were undertaken by claiming that it promoted both terrorism and trafficking employees.
But the Commissioners took place on Wednesday night that the new religious center respected the local laws and that it would be strictly impressioning.
"Booccoup of good people came to support him: Christians, Jews, Bahai, you mentioned it," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley, taking the word on Thursday morning.
"I'm proud of it as American citizen."
"This shows that justice supports it."
"The opposition is really minimum," he added.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The meeting began at 18.00 p.m. and was until almost midnight with the most people who spend for or against the center at a little speech nearly shared time, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper website.
"There is no more than America," wrote a intervenant.
"This is another planet of songs with Mrs. Liberty's dead in the sand."
"Amerika's gone."
The planned Islamic centres also protested in other parts of the country, including the Zero Ground, place of attacks of 11 September 2001 in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush condemned violence in the Themecola Valley.
Its 135 co-existent congregation of 135 families in the Riverside county for years, but she wanted a larger and better space than the trap that she has paid on a shared property with a water filtering system manufacturer.
The new mosquito of 24.943 feet in the Mediterranean style would be composed of two mines and up to 43 feet high.
It would take a 4.32-hectare site on the Nicolas road about 2 miles east of Chaparral.
Opponents may still call against this project to the municipal Council.
An arsenic microb that is tolerant is stressing the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or otherwise.
The discovery of a strange bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of its nutritive elements, extends the field to find new forms of life on Earth and may be beyond.
While researchers have discovered the inhabitable bacteria here on Earth, they say that life has more opportunities than major elements that have been considered essential.
"This body has a double capacity."
"He can be developed or developed with fosfor, or with arsenic."
"This is why she's very special, even if she's far away of being a really "extr√™me life form", commented Paul Davies C. W. from the University of State of Arizona, co-auteur of the report in the daily online edition of the Scientific Journal.
Six major elements have been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, acid, oxygen, phosphor and sulphur.
But researchers found that the bacteria, found in the Mono Lake in California, is able to continue to develop after they replaced the arsenic phosphore.
"We ask what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. of the University of Arizona, co-auteur of the report.
The discovery is important in the field of life research beyond the Earth because researchers must be able to recognise life, know what life seems to be, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the advertising of a press conference to discuss it, which has not distributed the details of the rail, generated speculations on the Internet that the report could disseminate the discovery of an extraterrestreat life.
That wasn't the case.
The discovery shows that, in other global environments, the bodies could be able to use other elements to act in biochimie and that the whole "standard" of elements, which we consider absolutely necessary for life, could not be set", commented Charles Cockell, Professor at the Planet and Space Science Institute, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the replacement of one element to another in basic biochimie and biochemical structure," added Cockell.
It wasn't a strong discovery.
Felisa Wolf-Simon from the NASA Astrologue Institute, who directed the study, chose the Mono lake because it has high arsenic levels.
Arsenic and phosphore are chemically similar, so it showed that a microbe exposed to both substances could be able to replace one to another.
"Arsenic is mainly toxic because its chemical behavior is really like the fosfor."
"The organizations are therefore hard to distinguish these elements separately."
"But the arsenic is quite different so that it does not work exactly as the fosfor; it's pulling inside and, in some way, goes the work of our biochimical machine", explained Anbar.
The researchers collected the bacteria known under the name of GFAJ-1 and exposed it to growing arsenic concentrations which it could adapt and grow.
The microbe better believes with the phosphore but the fact that it can live with the arsenic at the place is highlighting the possibility that a life form used by the arsenic can naturally occur, or otherwise on Earth or on another planet or the moon where the arsenic is more frequent.
Jamie S. Foster, adjoint Professor of Microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that the arsenic could be replaced by the phosphore was not new, but nothing has never shown that it could walk.
The arsenic was more frequent at the beginning of the earth's existence, she says; so researchers expressed the hypothesis that the first forms of life could use it.
This suggests that there might be other ways to form life, not only the way life on Earth was formed at the beginning," Foster said, who was not part of the Wolf-Simon research team.
The research was financed by the NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Institute.
The last two flying exposure dogs have been found in Compton
The other two exhibition dogs on four flights outside a motel in Bellflower have been found, the sheriffs of Los Angeles' comte announced it on Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two akitas and two gallery corgs - lost march when someone stole the Chevrolet Express truck in which they passed the night outside a Belflower Motel 6, announced the authorities.
Two dogs were recovered after midday, and the other two were found at the end of Monday evening, said to Steve Whithmore, the talking port of the headquarters of Los Angeles' chief department.
"The good news is that the dogs are good," says Whitmore.
"They are in good forms."
"They were returned to their legal owners."
Whitmore refused to exactly say where the dogs had been found, in which neighbor and what circumstances their discovery were.
"A survey is undertaken."
"We don't want to say it," Whitmore said.
"We follow the orders."
The dog owners, Christina Rickard and David Peek, couldn't be joined to provide a jury comment.
They have been gathered afternoon with their two Akitas in a refugee for animals of the cottage located in Downey.
Sheriff adjoints found the truck and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akatis - Trace, a 3-year-old woman, and Didi, a woman of 10 months, were healthy and except, announced the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the corrupts that Rickard and Peek had planned to show regional competitions this week, for the account of Japanese dog owners, were lost until their Monday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in the city this weekend under the "AC/Echanuba" National Championship of Long Beach, where they were counting to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to participate in the competitions of other trials planned in the previous days of the "ACC/Ekaanuba" exposure, said Peek at Mercedes Times.
South California is one of the stops of the canine exposure tour of almost one month of the couple.
Wednesday night, Peek and Rickard checked in the motel.
They often stay in the words and keep their truck outside, just next to the window of their room.
They brought three other dogs - a chiot Boxer, a parson Russell territory and a bretone spanish - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Aquitas and the Corgis, in the cart where it would be more featuring.
They have a little open the windows so that the dogs can have a free air.
Peek and Rickard reported the truck flight at 6:00 p.m.
Peek said they would offer a reward to every person who could lead them to the corgis, with an implanted micropuce to identify them.
It is not clear if a reward has been granted on Thursday.
The lion is ready to roll again, the restructuring of MGM is not expected to be the final fire of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and insecurity, MGM finally obtained the green fire to restart zero.
A Federal Court of New York's Facilities officially lodged the "pre-packed" plan by creditors whose debt $5 billion would be discarded; opening the way to the diverting company, with 86 years of existence, to concentrate on the production and distribution of films and television emissions.
With the Tuesday decision that the plan comply with the requirements of the facility code of the United States, no legal barrier remains before the MGM to flee on the entire floor of Entertainment Spyglass Foundationrs, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, which will become the general directors of what will be an allocated study.
The staff will be returned to about 320 to 400 at the start.
MGM will not effectively escape Chapter 11 as long as JPMorgan Chase will not complete a $500 million credit facility planned to finance new MGM operations and productions.
It is now distributed under the license by the Investment Bank, which is up to $75 million, and should be financed at the mid-December.
The study's restructuring process began in May 2009 when the Moelis & Co. Investment Bank was undertaken to advise the guidance on the way to finance its finances because it did not have the way to pay interests to $3,3 million per year.
In August, the director-General Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former PDG of Enron, and a renowned expert for his work at Crispy Kreme Doughnuts.
The attempts of Moelis and Cooper to solve the financial difficulties of MGM and to satisfy the more than 140 creditors of the study have been more than planned.
After several months of discussion, the parties agreed to put the company in sale at the end of 2009.
Nevertheless, the sale in shops had a few employees among whom no one was ready to pay the amount of 2 billion more than those who were looking for.
At the spring of this year, the MGM team had started working on a restructuring plan which, after months of internal dealings and discussions, was finally approved by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM is officially out of the failite in the next weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies receive prizes of several million dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., who has already obtained $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper companies, who gathered $375,000 per month for their business management services, will receive a "success prize" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum are able to re-establish MGM's production, which has not found only one film this year, and to put a yearly list of seven or eight films that would be out from 2012.
They also intend to co-financing two films based on the Hobbit, with Warner Bros
The study must conclude a different loan between $265,000 and $275 million to finance its part in these two films, which must be performed by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who has about 18% of MGM debt, tried to make a fusion of the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies have not reached an agreement.
Tech games to maintain your gift budget in balance
Although the main candidate for the most wonderful game of this year is the IPAD, maybe, by the Microsoft video game system, Kinect, the two can make a significant break in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of a iPad, you can buy five BMX wheels to $99 and that a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 perles classic cuts, or about 48 Play-Doh boxes.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national game sellers - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" We and Waterale Club of BJ - to see the electronic games I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that the Moore Law has developed, the technological game of this year is likely to have more strength; but costing the same price at least, compared to the last year.
Furthermore, while there are generally less new games associated with web sites, two of the most known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penuin, have more offers.
And button piles games are in increase, as well as reloadable piles games.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" We, except if other indication.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13 $ for 3 years and more) are games in the size of an Indian cook that sing a note when you press them on the wind.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second allows to compose a song.
If you buy several, they will sing in harmony.
Warning: Once you start supporting, you can't stop.
To combine dance song, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and more) is the best choice.
Inspirating the Elmo Live technology last year, the 14-pool animator puppee plays a role tour games like Simon Says and can play the lunary dance thanks to his innovating legs with the rock blocking.
Childs who shoot the game uses Mickey as dance instructor while their parents have a lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you will remember Alphie, one of the first educational games.
It is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 per year and more), with a double shuttle full of questionnaire game cards designed to transform a car ballet in a session with an auto-covery and a switch class.
If you are missing when your child holds your smartphone, this is three autonomy alternatives.
The VTech Mobigo (60 $, for 3 to 8 years) is the least cherous and easier to use, with a qvaly keyboard, although games do not educate as the Explore Leapster (70 $, for 3 to 12 years) is the first largest revision of the Leapster Game, with a most recent and lighter screen.
No version is compatible with old cards.
Fisher-Price iXL (90$, for 3 to 7 years) uses a iTunes type system to offer games and electronic books and is entitled to SD card that allows family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (30 $, Hasbro, for the eight years and more) is a set of five more painted blocks than a allute box, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing online blocks before the time is up, it is ideal for an imprisoned ortographic concours.
Moreover, games have a kind of online connection.
Only based on their presence in playshops, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penuin.
To buy your child a online company animal from the Kunuin Club, for example, you can get a Penuin Disney Club 2"Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5 for 6 to 12 years) which includes a marked part of a hidden code.
When saving the online code, your child receives sufficient credits to the Club Penuin book for two items on selection.
It may be rolled swimming pools or a companion animal playing Puffle.
Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and more) is the last micro-robot skin button.
The beast false moves rapidly on 12 vibrating silicone sleeves into aleatory directions.
It's funny to do a block labyrinth to see if it can find its way through.
She is also solid.
We resisted to a cut from the kitchen table and even to a temporary passage in our dog's ring.
Advertising a more sweet side in the maintenance of the order in China
Tang Shenbin was a place in the city as a city sergeant in training by severely inspecting its nervous burdens, electing down orders with a military authority.
He wished that women of Changguan - responsibilities of the public order in China, feared and misrepressed for their arbitrary punishment and for violence - bring a certain impression to a set of spectrums.
"Thank right!"
"See a perverse!"
Show them, said, "What are the beautiful girls like!"
Four girls who had been ill with white gants, clothes and same olive color pants, were fixed to you.
Four of black shoes at house, aligned to the rule.
Four heads perfectly curated because of the sum of hair attached by a blue and white neck.
"Personally, I think they have a medium-sized appearance," said Mr. Tang, with deceit.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to raise the image of Chinese urban inspectors.
A city requested that all the new recruitments had a higher study diploma.
The province of Guangdong has changed the greening of uniforms against a more employing blue.
Whan, in Central China, replaced the snacks in a strong way: in 2009, a report report reported that 50 officers had closed an uncontrolable snack chariot by launching black views, firmly for a half hours, until the snack repaired their business and part.
Xindu, a urban district of 6800,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose to make a large image operation.
Since 2003, the district complemented its street police in the urban environment of 13 women, particularly chosen for their appearance, gallery and young age.
The idea is to give the police a more sweet, more women.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson could have difficulties to touch the view of this subterranean band of Chinese
And for the reason, the critics will say.
In contrast to the police, these agents are only allowed to comply with the municipal orders by imposing amendments or other administrative sanctions.
But Chinese media disappoint the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, Hubei province inspectors struck a observer after he used his portable phone to film them with a protest against a discharge of wastes.
Last year, a Manual of Training for Pekin Inspectors, abroad and online, describes how effectively the crimers will win without blood.
This year in Shanghai, a passporter was abandoned with a cerebral lesion after a bagar with five officers.
A printed video of violence, available by online download, shows Chinese inspectors formed by street salers.
"Chengguan marked the government," issued last year, China Daily, a national publication, after a second poll on tactics.
The newspaper recalled a "complete cleaning".
The sceptics say that the approach is far away.
After the district had been announced in October to find eight new women's recruits, a editorial, held in The Beijing Evening News, asked whether women had real tasks or if they were only a tourist funding.
The answer seems to be a little of both.
The district advertising required women who were age from 18 to 22 years of age to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five traces of the face in the good order".
They shall have a higher size than the average of 1,6 meters or 5 feet, 2/12 pounds.
The return to 26 years of age is binding.
The officers said that the work was physically too punishable for women over 25 years.
"It's their image that is important", said a certain district officer in Rednet.com, a almost government website.
"Before, the external qualitys of the candidates will determine whether they agree; it is the size, weight, face traces, etc."
Then the temperature and the "inner qualitys" come.
The women of Chengguan are like flower vagues, he said, "Besides being vases, they will have other responsibility.
Zheng Lihua, Adjunct Director of the City District Management Office, does not adhere to this description.
However, he noted that higher requirements were the standard in many Chinese employment offers for both sex.
This is the case of the requirement for the order of vision traces.
That this means good is a matter of debate among the Chineses.
Of course, the persons with disabilities or disabled should not require.
"We can't let a person who bought or a boss come to serve here," said Mr. Zheng.
"He wouldn't give a good image."
Liu Yi, who patchs on the Baoguang place near a monastery, is a 22-year-old age and has the games rolled with a totally unclosed mouth.
It does not consider the value of its appearance as a gender, as she says.
"Do you think I've been sexy in this uniform?" She asked for a disastrous air.
Xu Yang, his colleague to the 21-year-old age, said: "We work is to present the image of the city."
They did not oppose their mandate to be limited, because they eat more carriage ambitions than simply to catch solders in the streets where they should be limited to their activities.
Each morning, the team faces a twenty-five ambulant goods that move rapidly to foot or swimming, trying to sell as far as possible small bread or tofu bottles before taking the shoot.
"Master Wang, you must go."
"We have already said it several times," said Ms. Xu, while a seller is gone to foot, temporaryly leaveing his new-carret.
The agents describe their functions instead of a monotone than awkwards.
"It's just near the same thing every day," Huang Jing, a 20-year-old age, said, studying the marketing after the work.
"Grande routine."
One of the reasons is that women's agents do not have the power of their male homologists to confidence the goods of the sellers.
They may only threaten to report contraventioners to their male superiors.
This aims to protect the Sudan public exhibitions against bureaucracy that are common in the whole of China.
In this year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, were turned back after the propagation of false false false mention that the Changguan agents killed a soldier.
In one night, more than a twenty-five police and chinguan agents were blessed, 14 government vehicles were shocked or shooted.
Xindu has escaped to such violence.
But calm is not good guarantee.
Only two houses in the place of Baoguang, where women's officers patroled this morning, over 50 people gathered around the street.
The agents confidenced a moto that was being reparated on the throat instead of in a shop, as it implies them to regulate.
The owner of the motor was skilled.
A 15-minute iron arm was followed before the police, on the left side, had been shocked a shooting path to their vehicle, and they went to any speed with the motor and its owner.
Li Xuedong, a 40-year-old coordinator with the male team, remained behind, his white bathroom returned to hide his name.
As women‚Äôs officials, 40 years of age coordinators play a role of support.
Instead of them, they are not formed to maintain a cereal image.
"That's the time, we're fighting very much."
"Four, we struggle physically," said Mr. Lee about one of your neutrons.
"The majority of time is the public that starts."
Prosecutors will not inculcate Senator Ensign
Prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice took up the criminal accused of Senator John Ensign, a case linked to an assistant of an old campaign and his efforts to obtain a lobbying work for the husband of the woman, announced the lawyers of the Senator.
The decision ends to the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Republic of Nevada, which was considered as a potential Republicn candidate at the President of 2012 until the scandale around its case does not make the major national titles last year and smells his career.
The office of Mr. Ensign stated that he was very happy by the decision, resulting in an investigation of a year.
The Senator could still be exposed to disciplinary measures taken by the Ethics Senator.
The lawyers of Mr. Ensign said that the Ministry of Justice had "informed that Senator Ensign had no object of the investigation and that he did not intend to keep any accused against him in this case."
The Ministry of Justice abstends comment on this subject.
The advertising came as a kind of surprise for many external ethical lawyers to the Ministry of Justice, according to which there were significant evidence that Mr. Ensign would have conspirated to violate a federal criminal ban on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first reported in New York Times in October 2009, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to obtain a lucrative lobbying work to win Mr. Hampton's silence and his wife, Cynthia, about the case of Senator with her.
Mrs. Hampton served as a treasure for a Ensign campaign once.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of other political funds to find work for Mr. Hampton, and then he defended their rights after they imposed Mr. Hampton to make lobbying for them, in accordance with documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been a co-operator of Mr. Ensign, he was prohibited for a year by the law of lobbying with his former employer or Senate in its entirety.
Ethic experts supported that the inhabited agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the case, seemed to be in contradiction with the ban on the turning door of lobbying.
According to the evidence made public, "It seems to have a primary evidence of a complaint to violate and violate substantively the law of the turning door," said Stanley Brand, a lawyer of Washington who specializes in the defence of clients of an investigation by the government.
While the judge of the Ministry has refused to explain the reasons made to the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethical lawyers said that the Ministry seemed to merit political advances after a number of high-level reverses imposed by its section of public integrity, including the last year decisions taken to abandon the continuation against the former Senator Ted Stevens accused of continuity.
The Federal Prosecutors clearly feared to take the weapons, said Melanie Sloan, the General Director of Citizens' responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defence group that received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now take the laws not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, the principal lawyer of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a phone call from a lawyer of the Ministry of Justice and a follower on the next morning, said that the Ministry had not seen accused of his customer.
Mr. Ensign's lawyer team had cooperated with the lawyers in order to convince them that the Senator, as its office reaffirmed, "he did in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had done at the parking.
"I am not able to enter into the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice, except to say that we think they have taken the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to abandon an investigation following an independent complaint by the Ethics Group, supporting the payment of $96,000 by the parents of Mr. Ensign aux Hampton, violated the federal election law.
The electoral committee stated that it had not enough evidence to prove that money was all except a gift.
NV Energy, a major company of Nevada who has long supported the Senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton to find the lobbying work.
A email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, the head of the office of Mr. Ensign, John Lopez, communicated with Mr. Hampton and said he "marteled" the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
Mr. Ensign also participated in a dinner with Mr. Hampton and another client in Nevada, Aligiant Air, and requested the transport secretariat to fix a meeting on behalf of the airline company when he urged Mr. Hampton to make a lobbying.
When the news of the case had been surrounded last year, Mr. Ensign was accused of his electors and issued his headquarter at the fourth rank of the Republic of Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for a few months, Mr. Ensign said two weeks ago he intended to impose a third mandate to Senate.
By announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his port, Jennifer Cooper, said that the Senator hoped that the Ethics Committee would soon follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and put an end to his investigation.
Senator Ensign is pleased to continue his work in behalf of the people of Nevada, said.
Cheshire's call will point to Twitter
A half twenty of them were in shocking away on the boards of the hearing room.
They sent every minute from the horrible witness reports via Twitter.
At the end, the defence said that there were more than 140,000 messages on the case of violence and children attached to their bed in a house that was fired.
Thursday, the largely follow-up procedure by Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family, in the Connecticut, should take place on an official end where the judge would imply the death penalty, voted by the jury.
But the lawyers of Mr. Hayes have already posted elements to the court who forgot appeal arguments that may be careful for the courts for years.
What is caused, it is that the intense reports on the process - as well as the generalized and extended use of Twitter journalists - have created a " circle atmosphere ", a very intense and immediate saturation with fire details that the jury has been badly influenced by the passions of the public.
The request could encourage the judges to discuss the question of whether new technologies require new rules in the hearing rooms.
"I have experienced this process; I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in the hearing rooms leads to the rights of the person to a fair process," said Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer of Mr. Hayes, the lawyer.
The judge, John C. Bleue of the Supreme Court of State, lacklessly rejected the revendications in the court's last week, claiming that the media were "speakly controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been listed by the passion.
But it seems not to be the last word on the question.
Appeal courses have been acknowledged for decades that the mediatic covering of cases may highlight issues on the equivalence of a process.
In a sentence of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States cancelled the condemnation of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murderer of his wife, supported in his decision that there was a " carnaval atmosphere in the process " because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for television emissions and the film "Firgitive".
Some lawyers said that the call courts in place for a half-century period later the condemnation of Mr. Hayes may be curious to be given the argument that new rules might be needed to manage the means of communication of the hearing halls, which are immaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of the new media" in the processes of great envergure, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at the Stanford Legislative School, who studied the death penalty to the Connecticut and wrote a report to which it was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue claims that some call judges might be intrigued by the idea that the limitation of the immediate communication from hearing rooms could allow more fair proceedings.
The Twitter case is only one of many other lawyers described by Mr. Hayes, which may be discussed for years, which delays the execution.
The lawyers of the defence also argued that Mr. Hayes had suffered a prejudice when the Blue judge refused to allow them to test the responses of the potential jury by showing their macabre photos of criminal scenes during the selection of the jury.
Some Jews declared have been horrified by the victim photos, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and his daughters, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old.
The lawyers of the defence claim that they will also contest the constitutionality of death penalty, and that they will support that the judge has unjustly excluded one of the jury, which had been critical to the lawyers, and that he has abusely put the pressure for a virtue by taking the inhabited decision to bring the jury into a weekend.
The Jews have not been sequent.
But their arguments on the effect of the media coverage of the process could be the most important source of interest.
They noted in a contest against the great last month that the case dominated the media scene in the Connecticut and that it was discussed during the election campaign by candidates to the Governor and the United States Senate.
They maintained that the computer media stopped attracting the flames of the emotion of the case.
"The daily bousculade of media, cameras and journalists in front of the palace of Justice," the lawyers wrote, "is nothing like what had been seen before here in New Haven, and maybe even at the national level."
They focus on the coverage of the Twitter system is discussed.
In the interviews, some journalists stated that the claim that the new instances were more incendiary than the communications submitted slowly was a luddic view that would apply the policy of the Court on the Medio-Mediac coverage of future proceedings.
However, some lawyers said that the call courses were often affected by the arguments that social and technological changes needed to be adapted by the courts.
The lawyers of Mr. Hayes emphasize this return.
In their record, they refer to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, which had reversed the condemnation of Dr. Sheppard because of the mediatic coverage of the proceedings and explained that they would call for new rules for new media.
"This business," they wrote, "represented by Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21th century. "
Can citizenship be approached?
After a campaign marked by the invasion and negativeness, a minimum civility was educated in Washington this week.
Is this a front sign of true bipartite cooperation to the front or an illusory moment before the rapid return to the partisan fight in the capital?
The Monday Meeting between President Obama and the leaders of the Congress had not been held on the major issues that should be treated during the "boitful canard".
But of course there was at least a political discussion on the differences of the two parties, as well as on the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than a other episode where each camp wanted to mark points. Empty note point.
The Public Meeting of the Committee on the Deficit of the President has been still civilized, despite the political divergences that remain among members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created a mutual respect that transcends the ideological flow, but which is still divided by members.
It is sufficient to declare that a new era of cooperation has occurred.
The two parties are now in a period of trial and mutual trial in order to obtain signs of cooperation and commitment, while trying to evaluate the limits of public opinion and the patience of electioners for a renewed party war.
That is why the Monday Meeting and the post-commentary comments of participants have declared a minimum requirement or accused.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicns are too deep and too deep to suggest a rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
As regards fiscality, expenditure, health care or rights, both parties remain at thousands of distance.
However, the election of November had modified Washington, at least in the short term.
"It is no doubt that things changed on your own," said Pete Wehner, a official of Bush administration, now next to the Centre of Ethics and Public Policy.
"This is inevitable after the elections.
The elections are subject to partisan passions, and then they slow down.
That's good."
On some questions, including those on the agenda of the "boitful canard" session, the Republicns and Democratics have a choice only to find a solution.
Bush tax reductions will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of this.
The two parties want to find a way to maintain a part or the whole, permanent or temporary manner.
Similarly, a commitment is expectable to extend unemployment allocations, not only because the Republicns may not allow to give the impression that they are in favour of the reductions of taxes for the rich, while rejecting unemployment compensation to unemployed workers.
After the Tuesday meeting at the White House, more optimism planned on a possible agreement on issues addressed during the "boitful canard" session with the ratification of the New START pact.
But William Galston, from the Institute of Brookings, warned that a frustrative cooperation on the most pressing problems of the "Lame Duck" session would not be forced towards a better agreement between the two parties when the 112th meeting will be gathered in Janvier.
Instead of that, he said, a period of dealing is likely, or inevitable.
"When things to be done will be done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the conflicts," he said.
Wehner also expressed its widely shared scepticism that civility would lead to real cooperation.
"I consider the majority of what happens today to 2012 as a preview or shadow boxing compared to the 2012 main event, said.
The reasons for this are closely related to the composition of the new Republicn majority in the Chamber and the electioners present in the tea that contributed to its creation.
However, the Republicn leaders are aware of the dangers if they are too far, they know that they must try to be the higher of their promises to reduce public expenditure and to abolish the new health care law.
These partisan positions are already clear in the first responses to the recommendations of the Deficit Committee which includes reforming the tax code and increased taxes, reducing the age of retrait and reducing expenditure.
Co-presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles chose one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, according to them, imposed the issue of the public agenda in a way that could not be ignored.
But they need 14 votes to the Committee, composed of 18 members, to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they had been ill to reach this number.
The largest resistance remains among the elections of the group; it suggests that there are tax issues, at least today, little reasons or commitment will.
Galston prescribed two stages in the battles between the White House and the Republicns of the Congress.
The first year will come in the form of partisan conflicts, since the Republics contest Obama on budget, taxes and health care; to be followed by a period of larger bipartite cooperation.
What would the cause of change?
Public opinion.
It is widely proved that, despite the partisan spirit of the recent election, most Americans always want to see the two parties to work together.
If the confrontation leads to an impasse, as in 1995, the two parties will be carefully observed by the public's response.
Whoever will be judged on loss must change the head and find compromises.
But it would, however, be a optimistic point of view.
The partisan spirit and polarization are now greater than they were not in the middle of the 1990s, and it seems to have a larger ideological difference between Obama and the Republicns of the Congress that there wasn't then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicns.
At the same time, the militarys of the two parties see 2010 as a simple forecast for a more resulting election in 2012.
In view of this reality, civility exposed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But there will be much more efforts from both parties to find an intent field on issues that are still divided.
Among American documents describe Moscow as a corruption hair
The control of the city is among the hands of a "Cleptocracy" and has passed up to Kremlin a part of the pots-devine and the protector money that she collected, reported the U.S. Ambassador in Russia in a note in February.
The Federal Police and Security Service perform great rackets that contribute to explanation the high cost of life in Moscow, said it.
They collect money not only of legal enterprises but also of organized criminal groups.
Each bubble of the office - what the first Minister Vladimir Poutine called the "vertical of power" - takes its part while the money goes to the top of the scale.
The service note, sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted by Wikileaks on his website.
The note is based on sources of which the names have been extended.
She was edited while Iouri Loujkov was still the master of Moscow; and he is largely responsible for corruption.
He was condemned in October by President Dmitri Medvedev, but since then there were few cleaning tracks.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who has a first plan-building company, have always denied corruption accusions over the years; and he has gathered several cases on these charges.
In September, he declared what follows to a Russian TV chain when he was questioned about a documentary suggesting that he was corrupted: "It's crazy, it's to go, it's nothing."
Russians believe that their society is corrupted, according to the reviews.
But it is uncomfortable to find information listed in an embassy account; and it is unforeseen to admit that it would be to diplomates of a foreign country to do it.
The direct link between the Government of the city of Moscow and the crime led some people to call on "disfunctional" and to claim that the government worked more than a government, according to the ambassaded note.
" Criminal elements are played by a " krysha " (term used in the criminal world/la mafia which means literally " toit " or protection), which pass through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) and the lawyer's office, as well as through the entire office of the Government of the city of Moscow.
"The analysts to identify a three-level structure in the crime world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is on the top."
The FSB, MVD and the Milices are on the second level.
Finally, ordinary crimes and corrupt inspectors are at the lower level.
"This is an inefficient system in which criminal groups are empty in certain areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report indicates that the FSB increases the money of the largest enterprises and that the police targets the smaller.
One source, he said, "It explained that the company owners of Moscow understood that it was preferable to obtain the protection of MVD and FSB (approximately than organized crime groups) because not only they have more weapons, means and powers than criminal groups, but they are also protected by law. "
"This is the reason why the application for protection by criminal gangs is not so higher."
The note notes that, although the collection of money is extended, the protection itself may be inequalious; even those who pay sometimes are subject to a arrest.
Those who don't pay quickly see their business closed under a pretext or another.
Medvedev several times said the fight against corruption, but he admitted the little progress.
The ambassaded's note transmits men's status, probably filled with money, until Kremlin.
"On the fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on officecrats," said in a recent interview of Gueorgui Satarov, director of the "think tank Indem" of Moscow.
"But he is part of this bureaucracy."
"There is not part of a political class because it is not in Russia."
Without the policy, without opposition, without separation of powers, did it say, corruption is inevitable.
According to India, corruption costs would increase, at the whole level of Russia, more than 300 billion dollars per year.
The country has been classified in a recent study on corruption over the overall perception by the non-governmental Transparency International (the countries are at least corrupted).
The dissemination of the note of the U.S. Ambassador, which was not achieved only last night in Moscow's evening, will be able to retain with certain discounts within the Russian government; although Loujkov could, in a certain measure, be burned for Moscow's failures, this could be the opportunity for Kremlin to show that it is in resolving the problem.
Interviewed by Larry King, Poutine issued the hypothesis that the WikiLeaks documents could be a manufacture and reacted with angry in the proposals that the United States diplomates had distributed by Batman and approaching Robin's Medveev.
"The problem is the fact that this is our interaction, a important factor of internal policy in this country, says it.
"But to be honest with you, we didn't suspect that this would be done with such an arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to ethics."
The former fighters of the Red Khmers obliged to face the past
In a badly slight class room with slightly decreated beton walls, the secondary school director of Anlong Veng called the man who had built it, the last head of the Red Khmers, Ta Mok.
Everyone here loves Ta Mok.
"He was a good leader, and he was worried about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, aged 42.
Having known as the "boocher" for his brutality, when he was at the head of the red Khmers, this commander remains popular in this isolated basket of former Khmers red in the northwest of Cambodia where he has built hospitals, pumps and other infrastructures; and where thousands of old soldiers of the organization are still living today.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Khmers returned to the government, long-term loyality was finally brought to Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims to publicly face people who participated in the regime.
In June, the government has distributed a high school manual that, for the first time, teaches the history of the Red Khmers to the children of his former soldiers.
And in July, a Cambodian court, jointly directed with the United Nations, announced his first sentence on a former members of the Red Khmers, sentenced at 35 years of prison, the former head of the famous tristety centre of Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, who was better known under the name of "Duch".
In this development of the situation, anxiety increased from the older fighters of the Red Khmers of Anlong Veng; compliance with the reconciliation efforts and their willingness to restore themselves into the Cambodian society.
"The elderly Khmers are rather red, but they are able to do anything." Chahang Youk, director of the Cambodge Documentation Centre, said an independent body that takes research on the regime.
"For them, the life under the Red Khmers was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"The situation generates divisions within the families."
Under the rule of the Red Khmers in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, about 1,7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overall.
When the Vietnamians invaded and turned the Government of Pol-United States in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army went to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that has been duration until the last movement was held in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary directed the guerrilla of their base situated in the west mountains of Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok prepared a suite in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-90s, after a peace agreement discussed by the United Nations led to the first democratic elections of the country in 1993, large groups of red fighters Khmers began to defect the Government, culminating with the Heeng Sary captures in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who was headed, was captured by the government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek mountains.
He died in a prison of Phnom Penh in 2006 while waiting for his proceedings.
Without their benefits, most of the older red kmers struggled in the black poor, commonly in the rural regions of Cambodia, and many of them remain notalgical of the movement.
While some red kmer officers have maintained their local leadership positions in exchange of weapons, it is not qualified farmers for low degree and file.
"The people have enjoyed very little follow-up after the capture," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and the reconciliation that organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are inscribed by the Utopical ideology of the regime."
"They have been higher in a framework where businesses are a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, 55-year-old age, who joined the Red Khmers as adolescents in 1974, struggled in the jungle around Anlong Veng before installing in 1998 as a poor riz cultivator.
"The life under the Red Khmers was good," he said.
"That Mok eats everybody."
But now, life is difficult because we have to be subjected to our own needs."
The current Red Khmers Court also caused concern here.
The court should, at the beginning of the next year, take the judgment of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another red old minister.
The court's mandate is to judge the senior leaders and the main responsible of the crime but did not say if he continues beyond these four cases.
There would be more to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The latest media speculations turned to Im Chaem, aged 64, former district head in the province of Banteay Meanchey under the rule of the Red Khmers in the 1970s.
In 2007, she said to the researchers of the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had supervised the construction of the Trapeang Thma barge, a project where thousands of forced workers would have found death.
Recently, during a tourned night, Im Chaem returned to work in the field near his wood house on pilots, on a land road outside Anlong Veng.
While the sun had long shadows on the deceased herbe, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past in the Red Khmers.
If the court called, she said, she would refuse to go.
"The Cambodge is in peace and stability," she says.
"If there are more progress, there will be war."
The Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defeated the Red Khmers in 1978, also warned several times that instability would happen if the court continued a number of suspects; although experts and historians responded to this.
"The Cambodge must grow a troop and enter the past, he said.
But face the past is everything that Cambodia must do to go before, says Youk Chhang, from the documentation center.
"The reconciliation in terms of khmer is to reconnect the cassed pieces, said he.
"We have to put these pieces together so we can understand."
The center produced the first manual approved by the Government on the Red Khmers, "A history of the Democratic Kampachea, composed of 75 pages".
He distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as an additional to the historic manuscripts of the Ministry of Education, designed for high schools, containing less than four pages on the Red Khmers.
As in the majority of Cambodia, youths of Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Red Khmers, despite urban links to the regime.
Touch Valeak, a 19-year-old student at Anlong Veng's High School, said that the new manual helped students to understand a significant part of their history.
But his parents reacted with scepticism when he returned with the home book to study.
"My family rejected many parts of the manual and the court," he said.
"They are misfunded because they do not know exactly how many people will continue the court."
Such resistance made the complex and difficult reconciliation process, said Sok Leang.
But the public, the manual and the court began to have an impact, he said.
However, the red Khmers keep a powerful attraction here.
In the heights of the Dangrek mountains, a way, covered by the bad herbs and swimming out of plastic skins, leads to a rectangle of black sugar, covered by a rounded tube.
The body of Pol Pot was burned here on a pneumonia after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, a 31-year-old phone salesman on the road board, said that she didn't know much about the man who was burned in this place.
"But he has a great spirit, and many people go there to pray, she says.

Belarus accepts the refusal of its military quality uranium stock
The Government of Belarus announced merry that he would leave his high-rich uranium stock, an essential component for nuclear weapons, which was included in the framework of a surprising victory of President Obama's campaign in order to secure nuclear materials throughout the world.
The agreement was distributed in a joint communication, published after the State secretariat Hillary Rodham Clinton met here the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Belarus, Sergei Martynov, on the basis of a security sum.
The American Government had tried to convince Belarus for years to abandon the high-rich uranium and seemed to have left the horizon in the past spring.
But the american responsibilities reported at Washington Post that some classified operations were carried out with Belarus in the last two months to eliminate 187 military quality uranium books from a Belarus's research centre.
This opened the way to a merry agreement to eliminate the rest of the material of approximately 500 books, according to a official who declared the condition of the anonymat because of the sensitivity of the question.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of the 47 Nation's Nuclear Security Summit, organized at the Obama initiative, where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently it was useful to offer an invitation to the former Soviet Republic in 2012.
"I'm really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the Nuclear Security Summit 2012."
"It proves that this process works", said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group of nuclear security promotion.
Clinton qualified the agreement "the very significant step of Belarus".
Obama was engaged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials over the world in the coming four years.
Since then, the United States Government has helped six countries to defeat all their high-risk uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A twenty-five countries have done it under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the Meeting on Nuclear Safety of Obama, the Bielorrusian President Alexandre Loukachenko said that the nation would never rely on its uranium.
"We have maintained high-rich uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is mainly the military uranium of quality and low-rich uranium", said Mr. Lokkachenko.
"This is our product... we're not gonna manufacture salt bombs, and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We're going to use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus approached the United States a few months ago; however, by demonstrating the interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate the uranium of Belarus, in October, was particularly complicated since the material was slightly irradiated, reported to the responsibilities.
It was carried out on a special train that passed over 1 300 miles to a Russian installation to be stored and eliminated, reported responsibilities.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was carried out by aviation, according to the responsibilities.
The United States Government has expendied 13 million dollars in its efforts, mostly to replace Belarus's research installations with lowly enriched uranium; inadequate for weapons.
"A coordination and a minute organization have been implemented in order to strengthen confidence"; leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, Andrew Beneiawski, who was responsible for the Department of Energy specialized in the World Menace Reduction.
According to the estimates of James Martin Nonproliferation Studies, Belarus had at least 88 military uranium uranium books and hundreds of high-risk uranium miles this year.
Belarus is trying to eliminate its stocks from 2012, according to a joint statement.
The relationships between Belarus and the United States have been endured for years, mainly due to the hard repression of Loukachenko of Human Rights.
But the Mercedes Declaration would suggest a potential renewing.
"The United States and Belarus welcomed the progress on these global security issues, recognized that a increased respect for the democracy and human rights in Belarus remained essential to improve bilateral relations; and that are essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," said it.
The government has not issued any objection to the CIA flights
The Government has not issued any objection to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners in direction through the Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the U.S. Ambassador in Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the filtered documents by Wikileaks at the daily El Pa√≠s, which adds that the first vice-President of the Government of that era, Maria Teresa Fern√°ndez de la Vega, had requested that the Spanish executive should be informed to demonstrate that they were able to monitor properly on foreign aircrafts through Spain.
In June 2006, following a report of the Council of Europe which accused of compliance with human rights practices with a twenty-five country, among which Spain held a meeting between the former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fern√°ndez de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "a surprised the Government of Zapatero outside game" and stressed that Spain had nothing to hide.
"The Vega stressed that Spain has no objection on the intellectual flights above the Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid "to take them to the depourvue," reports Aguirre in a cable.
The titler of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at this time, Miguel Angel Moratinos, reported to the Ambassador that the Spanish Executive "to give this case the lowest possible profile, even if, as she was in the hands of the judges, the Government had limited influence capacity".
In its tour, in January 2007, the Prosecutor Vicente Gonz√°lez sent to the Ambassador that he would not block the initiative of the judge to request the declaration of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of the Defence on the flights of the CIA.
"The reports do not contain any offensive element, no sensitive information," the Ambassade explained after talking to the applicant.
The United States showed even their concern for "spaining coordination between the Spanish judge and the German Prosecutors" more than for the declared information by CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will make our efforts to handle the case discretely between governments", regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007, during a lunch between the U.S. Ambassador and the Minister of Internal, Alfredo P√©rez Rubalcaba, he commented that "if the Spanish judges are very sweet of its independence and do what they consider", he gave instructions to his collaborators "for avoiding the comments of a flamed rhetoric, trying to reduce the temperature".
The Ambassador also expresses its concern for the action of the PP in this case.
"In spite of its pro-American general orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take part of any indication that the Government of Zapatero has tolerated or delegately ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even though those revelations have negative consequences for the Government of the United States, " it states.

And then she talks about a mobile message she just received, "I want you to return this month or you give me a address to send you the child."
She claims, "If you don't please, he leaves the kid with my mother, and I'll take it when I come back," she says.
In May, she talks about the return to her village, "This week I'm going to go, but I'll stay there until 19, because on 20 I have to present me to a job post to not lose it."
She explains that if everything was okay, she would have taken her old man with her.
"He will remain with the right person, that's me, and I will never leave him from my life with another person if this person is not my mother," doubtlessly, taking into account their bad relationships.
In July, there is another post.
When she's the tape, it's supposed that the child, who had arrived in the island on the 1st of that month, and he was supposed to have been killed on 10, died.

The members of the People ' s Party would win 4 seats in the Congress and the CSP would lose 9
With the results of 18-N, the PP could be decisive in Leida, Tarragona and Barcelona municipalities.
After the significant increase in votes and deputy registered in the last autonomy elections, the Catalan PP has already mentioned the generals because, even if there is progress or not, the perspectives are more positive than the number of votes that this training obtain in these sectors normally what it receives in the catalans.
Thus, the catalan populations received 610.473 votes to the generals of 2008, while the 2006 autonomics had reached 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC reached 384.091 votes.
If this tendency was maintained by a decline of the CFP votes and the fidelization of the PP elector, the analysts of this training estimated that, if there were general elections, the PPP could pass from 8 to 12 Members in the Congress, while the CPI would also win four (a.10) and the CSC would lose not less than 9 Members (to 25).
These calculations would indicate that the catalan place is essential for PP and PSOE.
According to the population analysis, ERC would lose a deputy - it had three - while the ICV would keep a deputy or win one.
But if the election agenda remains, the next would take place in May 2011 for municipal committees, where the populations may also be decisive at the end of the socialist hegemonia in the four capitals of the province and in their relaxation to the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manipulate the highest budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
As nationalists and populations agree that PSC could lose the maries of Barcelona, Tarragona, L√©ida and Gerona, where socialists would not obtain the majority of their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
In view of the Republicn Debate, it would not be fantastic that this training loses its representation in the capital of Barcelona - it is necessary to get 5 per cent of the votes.
The PP increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Leida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they governed with the PP before the current socialist master Josep F√©lix Ballesteros.
The PP recorded only a difference of 500 votes with PSC, including the master, Angel Ross, maintained very good relationships with Mariano Rajoy, during this last campaign.
People also registered progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
The PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalogne and aims to form lists in a maximum number of locations.
Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passports in Al Qaida
Besides the seven detention in Barcelona, Thailand there were three
The seven Pakistanians and the Nigerians detained by the General Commissioner for the Information of the Police of Barcelona were a jihadist cell that, leading from Thailand, facilitated passports to various Al Qaida groups, including "The Tigress for the Liberation of the Terre Tamil" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the last author of the Bombay attacks that died of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has given great importance to these investigations, as a result of the fact that "Kampai operation" has "the old deficiency" the Plaza of Al Qaida at the international level and "for example, its operational capacity".
The investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years in which it was active in Catalogne, has sent thousands of passeports to Thailand, or they were false and then distributed to groups that integrate the Criminal Galaxy Al Qaida to enable its "contacts" to cross the European borders and other Western countries with a total impunity.
The dismantled cell is the only one that the Jihadist network had operated in Europe, so that in the investigations, including the Thai services, other European police units, could have been involved in the territory of the European Union in the following days, similar to that registered the night of the mardi past in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation, the Pakistans Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Sitikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Batutunde Agunbiade), in Thailand, have been launched another, with the capture of the Pakistans Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Syrian Tha√Øan Arabian Kijbuming.
They were those who directed from Bangkok the cell in Spain and other European countries.
The catalan network, a part of which was shocked in 2009, was mainly flighting to tourists the passports that satisfy the conditions marked by the "World Islamic Front".
The documents should be named by young men from 25 to 45 years of age, with a validity of several years and without stamped visa.
The investigators point out that until now no details have been found to connect detentions in Catalogne with Bombay, even though the author of this attack, "Laskar and Taiba", were one of the receptor groups of flight passports in Spain and then false in Thailand.
However, the fact is that a few days before the attack was made, Catalogne sent it through a transfer agency of thousands of dollars that have been "inverted" to purchase mobile cards that were used after the integrators of the "command" who killed 106 people.
The police's got a lot of documentation.
PP requests but that it suspends the fiscal complexity
The leader of the PPC, Alicia S√°nchez-Camacho, had the opportunity last night to exhibit in Artur but its conditions to support its investment as President of the Generalitat, which are identical to those exhibited during the campaign and which reiterates to give priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of phylo-sovian events as the economic complexity that the nationalist leader wants to address to the half of its mandate.
The Chairman of the Catalan Peoples has come to you with Artur Mas with the safeness that gives the fact that he has reached 18 Members to the elections last Sunday, more than enough to do, because the candidate of CiU needs at least one of the trainings that will perform oppositions in the vote of investment.
On a possible basis with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists want to maintain in the Congress during general elections, but at the time, the discussions that Mas has today with the rest of political leaders are catalane key.
And with regard to the President of the PP, to support an investment "It should be eliminated all sovereign and independent talks", and the economic complexity - similar to that of the Basque country - that the leader will convergently wish to even submit to the referendum.
The two leaders were commonly able to increase the political device of a very exaggerated autonomic administration and the elimination of the tax for successes and donations.
More details of Mas's investment negotiation will take place from the PC, Jord Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he was already meeting with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition -, Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do it with Joan Puigcerkos (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laport (Solidaritat Catalana).
The generalist claims that the dead have not been due to the "free of measures"
Olot's owners do not eliminate the possibility of their night illness killed more than 11 older people
The generalist La Caritat d'Olot (Gerone) offered last night a press conference to emphasize the damages caused by the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilm√©, the nurse who killed at least nine older persons who were responsible for the interval that he worked.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, was presented with the lawyer of the centre, Joan Ca√±ada and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be the one that can be able to execute the accused against the responsible" for the dead but "the law and responsibility are obligation to take the processual situation of civil responsibilities".
And in addition to the social discreditation that the entity could suffer to have not detected at time the criminal activity of the night illness, the great threat for the Charitat now takes the form of an important compensation that the legal representatives of the victim parents are already calculated.
Joan Vila Dilm√© announced that the first crime dated August 2009 and that from that day he did not stop killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight body - older patients of the geriatric - sought that in many cases no doctors would personally explore the decades but, given the age and pathology of the patients, formality was held by phone.
Caritat, through his director, slowly denied this situation and said that "the lack of measures could not have been at any time the cause of what happened."
The lawyer of La Caritat acknowledged that "in this case there's only a index of imprisonment from any other person who is not accused of it."
The person already baptized as "The Angel of the Mort" has announced 11 murderers before and detailed that he made the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a month and half later he killed a second grandmother.
In that case he died by injecting him a overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he had made with a mix of sedative pillars.
The Director of La Caritat said that it is difficult to control the access of the centre to the doctors.
Insulin injections and sedative cocktail were the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that infected it, in his desire to stress internal suffering, used to kill them.
But laboratory analysis will clarify whether Vila was not lying by saying that he had seen for his first victims a less cruel death or instead he burned them into the inside by giveing them to them as he already admited that he had done with the three women he killed in the 12-17 October.
Caritat does not believe the statements of the night nurse, no longer the number of murdered murderers, they do not eliminate the possibility that the number is larger and justify their attitude by the various versions given by Vila in its visits to the First Instance Court and the lack of logical change in the way to kill after having made it successfully eight murderers.
That is why they say that they will remain at the disposal of justice to clarify the portion of facts.
ECB threatens
Investors reacted brushly last night to the threat to Trichet's yesterday, which warned that "the markets should not substimate our reaction capacity."
The different devices closed to force and the actions of the European banks were more than 5%.
However, we do not have to underestimate the ECB's ability to fail, and the euro has registered an increment, which is a concerning signal.
What happened last night is typical of a liquid market that is the same as it is cut, it is recovered, but motivated by short and very speculative position closures.
The institutional investor will late lose fear.
A month ago, the ECB has mentioned us today to remove liquidity measures, and it must be retracted tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
Federal Bank requested the end of the public debt purchase plan because of its inefficiency and elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures and only allowing unlimited access for the week.
After the Irish crisis, we hope that the current liquidity measures are extended, at least until March, and that the sales of quarters to unlimited access to the end of the quarter are maintained to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We hope that it will continue with the purchase programme and that it is even given the signal of intensification.
If they do not comply with the expectations generated, they will turn the excellent market reaction last night and continue to be slow to remove liquidity measures, which God helps us!
Similarly, during their meeting of May, in which they claimed that they had not even considered the purchase of obligations and they collapsed the markets, the history could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and continuous.
In May, he announced the Bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said he had already purchased a lot by provoking a new shock on the market.
Last year, the shipment of trade in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury has issued only 500 million to 5,28% compared to 750 million to 4,81% of the previous weight.
Even in Portugal, the types have declined 30 basic points in the whole curve, and clearly reflecting a market feelings change after Trichet's words.
In Ireland, the figures of the troop of Alied and the Bank of Ireland were published.
The estimated figures represent a short term of 10,000 million and 15,000 potential and have a period of time until February to obtain private capital or will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with stress tests, the numbers are subject to the Assistant Plan and help to reduce incertitude.
However, on Thursday, the Government must receive Parliamentary approval of its new budget and has no sufficient support, therefore, Ireland remains in a home of insecurity.
Angela Merkel adjusted his speech to leave the tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on December 14th, in which it is necessary to find a political commitment that shows that we are an unity and that we are interpreting all the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present last night the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will adopt on Thursday.
Reform of pensions, transparency in autonomy communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures for reactivation of employment play at the oises of investors, such as Vivaldi's four stages.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains the fact that the Spanish Bourse has been 4.5%, the double of the remaining European bounces.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Spain Bank has been rapid and radical and we benefit from the surprising effect.
Today there is a key enforcement of a three-year obligation that will be benefited by the Trichet effect, so we hope that it will be resolved with a strong request and helpful to dismiss doubts about our refinance capacity.
For Spain to ask for an Assistant Plan would be an auto-immoration.
They would give us a liquidity line that we do not need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million in liquidity available, the trial in relation to March, very cherished types and cut the access to free markets.
However, the strategy must continue to be the one of the wife of C√©sar, "in addition to being it, to it."
We can get out of it!
The President of Uulen will respond to Vega Sicilia's counsel requested by his sons
The storm remains in the open conflict within the Alvarez family, the owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Alvarez, the founder of the group, will contest, since he considers "no law", the Judiciary of El Enebro next 16, requested by five of his seven sons in which they will try to make their majority valuation and avoid management bodies of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Alvarez and his sons Jesus David and Maria Jos√© grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their litigation for the control of one of the group.
The founder of larger business maintenance services for companys seems not to be disposed to be present in the management bodies of El Enebro.
He was excluded by his Governing Board by five of his seven sons who were appointed Administrators in the assembly of shareholders of 18 January this year, which was registered in the Trade and Society Register.
The Judiciary of El Enebro for the next 16th, convocated by the Magistrat Commercial No. 2 of Madrid, again opened the tonner box within the Alvarez family.
The court's appeal to establish the assembly is the only mechanism that ensures the convocation of the Assembly until the conflict is resolved.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Paul, Emilio, Marta and Elvira √Ålvarez Mezquiriz is qualified by David Alvarez as a "desperate recourse of the applicants of his five sons to try, through a procedural argument, clearly frauding the Law and abuseing the law, validing and correcting the radically null assembly on January 18", according to its official doors.
This argument will be the basis for the meeting to be contested by considering that it is "no full right".
The same protagonists, who keep a silence, have already tried without success that the magistrate calls a assembly in June.
The sons of David Alvarez controlled 100% of the capital in El Enebro, a heritage and title company of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
However, the founder of the Service Group requires that 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
This case is the substantial question that the judge must decide after hearing on the request of contestation for which there is no signed date.
Red Bull triomphe in F1 with a secret weapons of Siemens
A software creates improvements on real time cars.
Since Red Bull entered the World of Formula 1 in 2004, his history in this universe's speed selection was marked by surprise and success.
At the first time, no one took into account the options of a new eye that came to arrive, despite the ascensed trajectory in the last seasons, last November, at the last stage of the Championnat, they all triomphed Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without declining the ability as the champion pilot, German Sebastien Vette, not more the ability of the Renault engine that promotes his car, in the form 1 world is talking about the legend of "secret weapons" that the multinational Siemens company has put into the hands of Red Bull to transform it into a winning team.
It is in fact a powerful process simulation software that the German company has started on the market in 2007 with a very distant goal of high automobilistic competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer instrument was used to create mount chains of the manufacturers of the whole world, energy stations, high-specification instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, loyally simulate the product or process before building it in real way, avoiding defects and costs.
PLM facilitated the development of Canon photo devices, Sukhoi aircraft or most famous Nissan vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for the industrial division of Siemens, explains the fact that the use of this computer instrument in its Formal 1 factor allowed Red Bull to create and execute "in few hours, almost real time", the changes, changes and improvements identified during courses and tests.
Russwurm explains that the urgency of 1992 had a average of 10 technicians in their teams that were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on vehicles in each season.
In the Red Bull team today works 180 young high-qualification professionals, which, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyzes and designs any kind of changes on bottles.
The leader of Siemens explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all the elements of the Red Bull balls except the engine, which is exclusively responsible for Renault.
Materials, fuel, airlines and security elements are amended.
Changes can pass from the virtual reality of simulator to reality at less than 24 hours, through advanced production systems by laser and high technology autoclaves.
As the single limitation of this technological perfection is the amount of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can expend as a limit of each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull introduced the high technology plant to create and produce its bottles in a 50 km from London.
There are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are limited.
Everything that happens here is considered "top secret."
Personal for this debt is 580, including two pilots, Vettel Champion and Mark Webber.
The hero of the Red Bull Form 1, of course, is the recent Sebastian Vetell Champion.
Among the largely technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has made the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists whose activity is inevitable and no-notoriality.
The technician director, Steve Nevey, states that five years ago, could be declared that the progress of R+D in the case of cursor cars was 50% of the victories and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, these percentages have changed, and technology represents 85% of success, while pilots give 15% of the added value.
Nevey states that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by the information, because "that are unprevisible gladiators".
HP will install in two years 20 shops with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated in Barcelona his first exclusive store in collaboration with his partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of 20 trade networks between 80 and 100 meters from which multinational multinational plans to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will account for this initiative with the 16 areas already presented in multimarket centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Court English.
The Vice-President of Spain, Helena Herrero, gave, for example, the restored store situated on the Great V√≠a de Barcelone, property of Pont Reyes, with which it works for 30 years.
The North America Group has prepared a plan to introduce 200 mark sell points in Europe in 2013, including 20 Spanish institutions.
The first open was the ones in Bucarest (Romania) and Belgrado (Serbia) last week, as the third of Barcelona.
Gerero did not want to find out the next possible shops, even though she admitted that Madrid could be the next destination.
Personal HM systems managed to ensure that shopping philosophy will always be the same, with support of a local distributor with the experience and knowledge of the sector.
The Advisory Group and the design of the exclusive shopping mobiliary (with products that can be touched in an interactive manner), which will have an identical image in Europe.
In addition, HP covers the training of the institutions staff.
Helena Herrero refused that it is a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive trade network aims to "am√©liore the service offered to customers and PMEs in purchase, assistance, post-venth and even packing".
Barcelona's store includes a space with a global pioneer program that resolves the possible problems of HP-in-garant computer equipment.
A online service connected with a technical center situated in Maustricht (Hollande).
"And in 10 minutes we can solve problems that may often take even two days."
"This system is specially designed for MPEs and users, since large companies have already contracted technical assistance services", noted Herena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell paid on "boot" a million customers to his rivals in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, the delegate administrator of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, thinks that 2011 will be a hard year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
In spite of this, it is expected that the margins of interest will be shocked, and it will be tried to pay partly with increments of the committees and credit prices.
Sabadell waits for three years to capture a million private customers, his task to do.
Saadell has found a way to operate for the next three years and can so survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will run in 2011 a new director plan that will hold a three-year-old ability.
The goal, instead of surviving the public subsidies of FROB, is to win a market account by captureing a million new customers - 700,000 if they could be deducted to those who could get out of the bank, their great task to be carried out, since until now the bank has made more SMEs and companies than the private customer.
This year he captured 250,000 private customers and 500,000 companies.
The market rate of individuals is 3,5%, while it exceeds 10% in companies.
Another basis for the 2011-2013 plan is the productivity balance, or the same, of authenticity, with the reduction of costs as objectives, which will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the year.
Many banks are now awaiting goals and publicly, since the financial crisis has deployed all plans of the global banking sector.
Saadell, in fact, will end this year, has established four years ago, even if the plan was initially for three years, but the market situation has determined its extension for a further year.
Customers who let them escape boxes will be its main goal.
During a small dinner organized by APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "facility and transcendental year".
In fact, the executive thinks that the outcome of the crisis in Spain will be "slow".
Furthermore, in two or three years, it will be "so hard to create job posts", which is fundamental for the survival of the bank business, said it.
And even if it believes that the passive war - which penalises the margins - is reduced, the risk prices paid for banks and casses for its emissions to obtain liquidity are already moved to the credit price to compensate the fall of margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a factor of credit pressure."
"We have not locked the robin, but the differences are higher", said Guardiola.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and to increase the price of diversity - see CincoD√≠as from 22 and 27 November.
He also admitted that the tendency of the banking sector now " is to increase the committees", but "there is a competitive framework".
The leadership plan of Sabadell is based on organic growth even if, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of corporate operations.
It is not just that he ensures that in Spain "we will demand larger sizes".
"That will move next year," he assured.
It claims that capital requirements are "enormely increased" and some Spanish financial entity could enter into red numbers.
And it indicates that the FROB can replace the market in the fund capture in the case of new recapitalizations.
After assuring that Sabadell can survive to the temporary market closure, he reduced the importance of some bankers already predicted as a new liquidity crisis.
It is noted that it can't be issued but, in contrast to what happened in June, it can be obtained from short-term funding through relaxation, which slows the crisis.
CECA rejects the possibility of a second vague of fusions among boxes
The Director-General of CECA, Jos√© Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected the possibility of a new vague of fusions of spring boxes and reiterated the speed with which the sector restructuring was implemented.
When the switch-concentration process began, there were several entities that ensured that they would not be involved in the first phase and that they were reserved for the second phase.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation of Caisses d'Epargnes (ECCA), Jos√© Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected the possibility of production of this new operating vague.
"I think that the largest part of fusions has been performed, it is not possible to say that the integration of Cajasol in the Civica Bank is a second stage, which is adjustments."
"The majority has been completely implemented; it is possible that, at 17th or 14th, all the major processes have been carried out under the whole of the Spanish Bank, which has also cooperated very much in this operation," said the Chief.
In the statements during a small dinner of the Aragon Directors and Executives Association (ADEA), Olavarrieta expressed that the concentration process was "to the largest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way it has been achieved within the past, not now, in business plans with the Spain Bank."
"The overflow of 45 casses with a average of 28.500 million of assets to 17.500 million is an inequalizer process in history, reduced the number of entities by 62 per cent to be more larger to be in accordance with Balle," said it.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that there is a series of little joyful views on the slower of the process, which demonstrates "a lack of severeness and sense," because "as the Spanish Bank is remembering that the period must be respected before the end of the year."
The Director-General of CECA, Jos√© Antonio Olavarrieta, assured last night that Spain has the most strict financial system of all Europe and "probably" of the world and assigned to people who doubtfully put it a "no-knowledge".
The leader said that it was given the current economic conjuncture, "We can remain very calm" with the situation of financial entities and boxes, a system that began a "extremely important" concentration process and "va to the most possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector had taken a good deal of stress tests carried out in July by the ECB.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to stay in the euro, but he has established the conditions for the whole Union.
Market tensions caused a double government response.
On the one hand, Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero announced new methods of adjustment, which consists of tax reductions for KMUs, the regulation of private placement or removal of EUR 426 unemployers, without professional contribution to the privatisation of 49% of the AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the State Lotteries.
On the other hand, the Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of the former President Felipe Gonz√°lez, joins the critics of happiness, Angela Merkel, as regards his responsibilities to delay the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It must be said that Merkel's position is not a mistake in its communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction of the euro's difficult redetermination process.
And here, Germany has a radically new vision of what should be its future, which is a shock to maintain the old traditions of most of its partners.
At European resistances, in Germany there are three possible outcomes of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by its own, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would leave the monetary area.
The second, the recovery of the Mark, even though this seems to be the fiction science, with a very favourable view course, is nearly 50% of the population.
The third, a new design of the euro, in line with the German proposals for a greater macro-economic control, budgetary rigorous, amendments to countries that transgress them, possible payment suspensions of one of them and expansion in the private sector of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it is so long as it is defined, therefore, there is no place for apologises.
First, in 2009, when both FMI and the European Commission encouraged deficiencies, the German Government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between the fact that Germany thought that it should be done (Financies and Stability Plans) and what its European partners, including France, practiced.
The second part of the Central-European country was when Merkel had difficultly longed the decision to save Greece.
Since that moment, it was a feroce critic, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public view and public opinion were against the recovery of Greece.
Finally, at the end of October, Merkel reaffirms a clear position by requesting the reform of the Union treaties to make possible recovery of a country and obliging private prior to support a part of the cost.
This position was interpreted as an anti-European, since it has prevented the Irish crisis and the rest.
But, although his proposal was a little edulcorated, it was approved and, in the next months, we should be assisted in the reform process of the Union that could make these measures possible from 2013.
Germany brought a red line that she doesn't believe.
It says to us all that, even if now we have to take steps with which the euro can not be too agreed, from that date the former functioning of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new currency area, where countries transgressing the rules will be severely sanctioned, they may be obliged to be declared in the stopping of payments and, where appropriate, the private sector will also support a part of the costs.
Germany notes that we must follow a severe growth course with high levels of earning and investment, consumption moderation, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external loans.
A alternative based on debt and construction, with huge payment balances, such as the Spanish growth in the years of the tree, will not just be tolerated.
The movement is clear.
And it wouldn't be worse to not hear him.
It is not only to reduce public deficit in 2013.
What we ask is much harder.
And what is not absolutely to do in these circumstances is to mislead us.
I hope that the current turbulences will lead to us a greater tranquility.
And that we can enter the opportunity given to us, until spring 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero also heard of this form and its dual statement (the promised reforms after the sabbath meeting with the great businesses and the proclamation of new measures) suggests that, despite the critics of Merkel, it was opened the way to the thesis that the order should be put to the house.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is here, and they do not seem to move it.
And among the possibilities that it is considered, it is not possible to exclude a too serious currency area of countries.
And in that case, Germany can always tell us that she had warned us.
Legislative sport and fraud
The Russians similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate innocence but not the will to escape a sanction.
The expulsion in principle by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the game of 23 November against Ajax in the Champions Liga has made a lot of crying on the anti-sport character of such behavior and if the two players should be sanctified by the EUFA.
As we know, a few minutes before finishing the match (when their team was clearly winned), the two players delibly lost the time when they made mistakes to determine the arbitre to show them the second yellow card.
So, as Real Madrid will be the leader of his group, the two players will carry out regulatory sanctions during the next match of the shipping game against August and will be able to pass without cards at the next stage.
Finally, the EUFA Disciplinary Committee sanctified two matches the trainer of the team, Jos√© Mourinho and various are economic to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances such as that or similar is not a new practice, except rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so expansive that it is part of echos, non-write rules, but followed by this sport.
A part of the debate appeared in the reported case should be the fact that this has been a protagonist team of Real Madrid's entity (which shows the nobless and honor and in past occasions condemned an amendment to his players for similar acts) and the orchestrated dramatization, it seems to be, by Mourinho, that adds an episode more to his dilatated history of historic and provocator technicians.
In any case, the debate demands whether this type of conduct does not explicitly prohibit sport principles, i.e., if such actions do with law fraud; for indeed, they are respectful actions with the sportive regulation, but they seem to elect their sense.
The question is to consider the type of prejudice they cause sportive mind.
One of the goods that include the sportive spirit is the physical integrity of the opposite players, a aspect that has not been in danger with these actions, namely, there has not been violence.
Another of these goods in which it is allusion with the right game is to avoid that the team of infractor players benefits injustly from the opposite team, which is not anymore.
However, the paradoxal fact of the action of the players of the Real Madrid is that it is not consistent with what normally is characterized as tricky or fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules has not been made in cached to try to avoid sanction, but their action was exactly tried to be the most clearest possible to receive the punishment of the arbitre.
They waited and accepted the sanction voluntary.
Another question is the type of advantage that the offenders obtain the intentionally examined mistakes.
This seems to be necessary to see that it is not put into a rival disappointment situation and there is no advantage in the same match, for obviously the result of the action is supposed to leave their own team with less players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next match, because the club couldn't contain these players.
Of course the advantage is the fact that players will start the next phase of the Champions Liga without cards that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, because the team could be eliminated fully and, with this action, the players make a sanction match and pass to the second cycle of cartons, where the suspension due to the cumulation of cards is produced with at least one of the first cycle.
So, seriously, it is not so clear that this is a benefit.
Finally, these actions are not contrary to the sportive spirit, which is even part of the adoption of strategic decisions that promote the maximum benefit of what the rules allow.
In our case, players did not act to avoid the application of sanctions (this would actually be a clear case of law fraud), but otherwise they have chosen the moment in which they were subject to it.
They took a strategic decision without delaying punishment or flee.
Even though the border between genia and fraud of law is spread, in this case I think that there was a clear case of genius.
It seems to me that it appears because of two factors, because there have been two self-explosions and because of how to transmit the guideline to cause them.
The bad caused by sport principles by these actions is not as ethical.
Offensive offers to capture Christmas dinners for groups in BCN
The calendar dictatorship focuses on the reserves for 16 and 17 days this year.
There is a proliferation of self-financed celebrations by employees who want to cost between 20 and 30 euros.
As the tour and lottery, when December also comes to dinner groups before the Christmas, which continues to be the oxygen ballon for restaurants and funeral of Barcelona, but which caused the crisis has made your price adjusted to capture the majority client: almost everybody wants to cost between 20 and 30 euros in dinner or dinner, coincidences of businessmen and associations of the interviewed sector.
To complete the accountability, the calendar of this year (such as the night of the Holy Sylvestre) focused on the requests in the week of 13 December, with the result of a breakfast of dinner reservations for pic days (days 17 and 17) and almost nothing previous week.
Since 2008, the origin of difficult times, there are many companies who have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many employees organize them by paying their own pockets.
Everything is the conjuncture, they ask all battle prices, confirms the President of Gremi de Restauracio de Barcelona, Gaiity Farr√†s.
The representative of the patron is now not to predict how to celebrate this month.
"The people think much before booking."
"They want to get out, but they pay much attention to prices," said he.
The case will be well "for those who give good quality to good prices and with good service", he adds, and recalls that customers tend to slow up a scale with the crisis, so that the tranch around 25 euros has become majority in the request.
In a survey in various centre institutions, the collection of requests for the night of 17 is observed.
The Soteras Group indicates that there is a true boom of requests for this Friday, with the intention of expending less than 30 euros, which they responded by adapting their menus to the assembly, with full forms from 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful people, Andilana, with 16 buildings in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the personality of the calendar was higher, even since the beginning of November.
"We made it impossible to keep the same prices in the past year, with menus for all guests from 19.95 to 30 euros," they detailed.
AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, Ququ and a total of 23 locals, remains optimistic after detecting a shore of the facturation since the second half and good, although conquests, business perspectives for the Christmas.
Sources of the group indicate that 18 will also be an hyperactive day at the level of friends groups who are famous in advance of the festivals.
To their six group menus, they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget, and the perception that there is a predicted 10% more than the last year, instead of demanding more details, such as the catalan wine produced according to the champenois method.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies calling again their employees and feeling that the volume of groups has increased.
From the Facasarm patron (including entities such as Bars Association, Restaurants and Divertimento of Barcelona), its vice-president Enric Gom√°, trusts in the possibility to start see the tunnel‚Äôs end and supports that reserves are generally "animated", even though clients "regovern the maximum".
This is true, hope in respect of festivals has not cut down, unforgettablely of whom it pays, it indicates.
The Pakistani nuclear programme generates a great concern in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons with "approximately rythm than any other country".
Wikileaks filters confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the American Embassy in Pakistan and the Department of State filtered by the port of Wikileaks confirms the major concerns caused by the Pakistanian nuclear programme in Washington.
In addition to the clear and wise details offered on the content of the discussions and thoughts of North American diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, documents show that cooperation between the two countries in the field of nuclear security instead of increasing, "decreas" and that the unfair Asian country produces nuclear weapons "to a faster rythm than any other countries of the world".
The particularity of Pakistani nuclear programme - the fact that weapons are not assembled, but they are employed by components to make their destruction difficult in the case of attack - is one of the main causes of concern in Washington.
This is also the embassy in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, listed in a report before visiting the former National Security Adviser James Jones: "The nearness of certain nuclear installations of the territory under the Taliban attack, the dispersion of nuclear materials with the short and vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is considered not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferant and a reason for maintaining the guard.
"Pakistan has a staff's strict religious credibility to protect nuclear installations; given the decline of educational and cultural levels, the extremist organizations have more opportunity to recruit people working in nuclear or mixture programmes," said the U.S. Expert Yuri Corolev, the Russian Foreign Minister, during a meeting with its American homologs.
The new documentation filtered by the Julian Assange port is the increasingly reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the elected degree of Pakistani nuclear weapons production.
A post of the Ambassador in May, who qualifys the communication with Pakistan, supports the following: "Transparency is often unnecessary; help offers remain without answer or are eliminated."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a official of the National Intelligence for South Asia, notes that "in spite of the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons to a faster rythm than any other country of the world."
The Ambassador Patterson also requests Washington, during a visit from the army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, to understand "very clearly" to the responsible that "the Pakistan Army must end with the tactic support for terrorist groups".
To Wikileaks Chief Chasse
Obama will number a high responsible for the fight against terrorism to avoid new infiltrations.
Interpol emits a red alarm to follow the movements and place in Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complex labyrinth where it is difficult to be sure about facts.
Last night Interpol issued a "red warning" to "localize and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, it is not a traditional arrest order.
Moreover, it is not new, except the date of 20 November.
And it has nothing to do with the last filtering of more than a million diplomatic documents in the United States but with sexual abuse accused to Australia in Sweden.
Moreover, the lawyer of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, ensures that "the police knows where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
On 20 of the international police body in Lyon (France) stated the order requested by Sweden, but he did not publicly until yesterday, after receiving the authorisation of the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 Interpol countries received the indication of identifying or localizing Assange "to obtain its provisional arrest and extradition."
Even though Interpol cannot give the order to arrest a person affected by a red warning, many of the Member States, according to the statements of the organization, consider the red call for a free way to arrest - that the national police body must achieve -, especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, such as the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is considered.
The movement was unreasoned to the lawyers of Assange, who later published a letter that denunced the founder of Wikileaks of 39 years of age to respond by video-conference to Sweden's authorities.
They also recalled that Assange requested and obtained the permission to leave Sweden from the lawyer of his case, compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, the Head of the Security of Stalin.
"That seems to be a chase, not a legal persecution," declares the missile.
While the world is looking for him - and in Australia his mother defends the innocence of her son -- Assange continues to be found in a unknown place, but he is not fighting.
On Monday, he granted an interview to the director of the Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the secretariat of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that it was responsible for having orders to the United Nations diplomates that they escape by violating the international treaties signed by the United States, it should be displaced," he said.
His opinion was entered last night by the Press secretariat, Robert Gibbs, who qualified the request of demission as "ridiculous and absurde".
"I am not sure why the opinion of a guy with a web page should interest us," he said for the CNN.
Obama himself was responsible for the fight against terrorists, Rusell Travers, to prevent new fleet of documents.
The test of President Barack Obama's talk to reduce the importance of Assange is contrasted with the views that the conservators and comments today proclaim.
Peter King, the congressist who will preside from January to the National Security Committee in the Bassess Chamber, requested the Department of the State that he examines the possibility of include Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confidence its funds and to continue to any person who provides contributions or assistance".
Moreover, Tom Flanagan, an adviser of Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to return to his statements after saying that Assange should "slaughter".
"Obama should transform it into goal and user a flight without equipment or something similar."
A person who didn't ask for apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist Minister, former government of Arkansas and possible candidate to the Presidency.
"Whoever is found in the Government who filtered information is a tragic fault and all that is not a execution would be a too favorable punishment," he said for Fox.
Puigcercuss search for peace in ERC with eye clinds at Carod adeptes
The Republicn leader will allow the party to vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes more executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcerkos seems to have found the receipt to solve the first internal revolt within the CER, without the north because of the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The President of the Party is conscient of the fact that his demission threat is not sufficient for the adeptes of the former leader Josep Llu√≠s Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now too diluted that his mentor, and that it cannot be absolutely able to give him to his head sweet that he had with other spectacles.
This is why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his new critics with eye clinds that allow him to blind up to municipal elections.
To begin, Puigcercus announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisers will be able to declare on its secret continuity.
By voting balls, not on the hand.
If the carodists want to run a certain punishment vote to the President, they will be able to do it without any fear for resurrections.
In fact, the head of the ranks wants to avoid the image of division and the submission to his person.
In several interviews, he argued that it would not consider to be ratified with half of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "to the Bulgaria" would not be good.
Carod's closer persons require a little more than putting his position at the disposal of war, a geste that is not valuable when Puigcercus controls the maximum body between the congress.
But since they do not have enough majority to force displacements, they will try to accept a road sheet until May.
For this reason, they hope to participate in the development of the strategic reorientation document that the direction will submit to the vote of the National Council on 18th.
Its intention is to support Puigcerkos in exchange of the promise of the programmed session for the 2011 autom, which leaders considered a safe fact.
ERC's leader stated that "polyphony" affects stability and that its goal is to make it possible for all organizations to lay his room in the family.
In this line, the article that the current adviser Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
In view of Puigcerkos' ideology, the titler of Innovacio thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange of various objectives" is like it was done.
And he numbered five, which he stressed two.
First, "recomposing" the executive to represent at least 90% of the war, namely, including new figures from the Cariod adepte sector.
The second may be the character of great new.
Huguet proposes that EC liquid once for all the assembly as a operational mechanism.
He thus defends a reform of the status that allows the realization of the conferences through delegates elected by suffrage.
Finding with the assembly model, a exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession of the Puigcerkos team, which already cut in that sense in the last two congress.
Indeed, the 2008 Conclave Convulsion was responsible for revising the assembly model in a specific status reform conference.
This meeting remains unexpected, since the internal margin of the last few years recommended not addressing this issue.
Now, without critical sectors in this case, the time could be good to retain and close it forever.

China maintains the goals to reduce lock gas
The representative of the country in the COP16 has ensured that its country has made great efforts to reduce the carbon flow and has continued to maintain its offer to reduce 40 to 45 per cent of its greenhouse gas emissions until 2020.
China maintained its offer to reduce 40 to 45 per cent of its greenhouse gas emissions before 2020, assured Su Wei, representative of that country to the COP16.
In his first public appearance in the 16th United Nations Framework Conference on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei has assured that its country had made huge efforts to reduce the carbon trace and to reconvert its industry.
In fact, in the past four years, his country invested $245 million in efforts to reduce the emission of green gas.
However, he clearly mentioned that China would not change its objectives, but will continue to work together with the international community in this area.
It indicated that the Chinese strategy for climate change is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity construction; construction of institutions and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all of these areas, including approval, last year, of a new Energy Law, which recognizes the objectives addressed to the reduction in greenhouse gases, was explained.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, the federal authorities worked in a coordinated way with governments and locals to achieve energy spare goals, effective energy use and emission reduction.
Moreover, it stated that there are various multiannual plans in the course of or end, both financed by the Chinese Government and by the governments of other countries.
For example, it mentioned the effective energy use programme, which was implemented during the past five years and which received investments from the United Nations (ONU), the Government and the private initiative.
There is also a provincial project for climate change, another for the change of incandescence lamps by economic lamps and another attractive and adjustment.
At the same table, Martin Krol, scientific adviser of the Government of this country in terms of climate change, has assured that the efforts of China have been greater than what is thinking.
For example, it was exposed that the per capita of steel gas in China is three tonnes per person, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9 per cent of historical contributions in contamination.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in energy use, how to increase energy efficiency in the past five years and expected to make another similar to 2020.
Legal Explosion of Spino: C√©sar Nava
The national leader of the PAN has detailed that the former panist leader had the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is right.
The national leader of the PAN, C√©sar Nava Vazquez, ensured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barienstos was legal and that the former panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is right.
In the previous interview at Gabino Cu√© Monteagudo's protest as a Governor of the State, he said that, in any case, Espino's explosion is a local decision adopted.
"This is an autonomy decision of the Sonra Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to address, where appropriate, by complaining to the National Council Order Commission, so that it is a decision taken within a competent authority," he noted.
On the other hand, he cleared that this is not the time to think at 2012 and there was no negotiation table an Alliance for the Presidential Chairmanship.
Nava Vazquez was convinced that national action would be stronger after the internal elections of the next 4 and 5 December where a successive should be elected.
"Cela (a alliance in 2012) is an aspect which has never been on the negotiation table at least for the time, that was an approach to local elections that have succeeded and achieved its goal", said it.
The panist leader said that the PAN was supported by 71 years of Dialogue, for which " internal competition does not fear us; on the contrary, " we save and make us stronger", said it.
He said that uncertainly the Council will choose the best leader/and whose National Action needs for the next three years, so he would give the "to the person determined by the Council".
"I'm totally quiet and open, I'd be proud to leave the Presidency office of the party to any of the five."
He expected that the suspension by the Party to the previous elections of 4 July would be reflected on the next conflict, even though "is not yet the time to think at 2012."
"The time is to join the Governor Gabino Cu√© in this task."
In this context, he pointed out that the three Governments who are taking alliances in Oaxaca, Publa and Sinaloa will be the dragon and will be a reason for observing in all the country, so that there were ‚Äúmore hopes for them, and I am sure that Gabino will be at the height of expectations‚Äù.
When the priests were requested to consider the priests of the six years of old President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari, when they were asked to address the PRI critics of President Felipe Calderon because of his four years of government.
"If the PRI think that the Governments of Zedillo and Salinas have been better than the Fox and Calderon; they start to defend them; they're out of 'good'," he said.
He stated that the holder of the Federal Executive may express, such as what he has done in his speech in the National Audit, as there are no balls in the country and less than the censure.
Obama promises the law for non-paper students
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, you call Senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twitte the American President in the social network.
President Barack Obama was meeting today in the national mobilization to support the Ley Dream Act, to legalize students without paper, with a message in his own Twitter social network account.
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, you call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," Twitty Obama said.
Its short message maintains a cybernetic link with a more comprehensive document that requests the public to contact senators immediately, as the vote to legislation is imminent.
"As a vote we hope soon, now it is the time to listen to your voice," he states.
The message was published after the 42 Republicn senators threatened to block any legislation if the expansion of tax reductions in the Bush period and the financing of the Government continued.
A such blocking, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republicn Senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as ratification of the new START Treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Question on the Republicn locking of the Dream Act and other projects, the Presidential port Robert Gibbs stated that it is convinced that once the fiscal problem is resolved, we will be able to fix an allocation for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We are all agreed that we need to solve this fiscal problem before the end of the year..."
"I think we can get an agreement at a given moment and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The leader of the most democratic majority of Senate Harry Reid announced that he would ask for a "clusure vote" for the Lei Dream Act, reason why the initiative to legalize students without papers could be voted from the next Thursday in the Senate, even though the most likely would be the next week.
The Senatoral Version of the Dream Act or the American Rewes Act would be legally equivalent to 800 000 young people who had arrived to the United States before the age of 16, they remained in that country in the past five years and were accepted by a higher education institution or by the Army.
But partisans need 60 votes to approve the initiative, because they require the assistance of a large number of Republicns, in moments where the participating organizations of the Protagonist project have an intense lobbying to ensure the approval of the Law.
Democrats, most of which supports the Dream Act, have 58 places.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson de Nebraska said he would vote against and only one Republicn expressed his support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why the Dream Act partys require the vote of several Republicns if other democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the shortest Republicans there are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and Senator, George Lemieux, from Florida, who complemented his mandate by Senator Mel Mart√≠nez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch, of Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson in Texas, but said that they would not be supported at another time.
Another Republic who supported it, John McCain, has not defined its posture until now.
Although the Representative Chamber has a different version, analysts agree that the largest obstacles in the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With literatures you'll get the doigt on the beach
The second stage of the Language's Pairs was a step in which the participants set up the narration
"Sex in the language, I understand it, but... does it on the plague? what do you hope of me?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the Language's Plaziers, a cycle that celebrates the Spanish literature and which this time used the subtitle of his question (which another round table was deed to the Sexe in the language, explained it).
The doigt on the beach"... we put into the embarras," sweetly launched the argentian writer to the public, most of the young people who were meeting at the International World War of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this modelled table by Marisol Shultz, and to which they participated in Valenzuela, Sergio Ram√≠rez, Mayra Montero and Luis Garc√≠a Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text described in Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz has defined after a great story, with Luisa in the first person as a protagonist who wants to know what the "play" is, she goes from a doctor to another without obtaining a response, only pieces in the same narrative fil.
From infection she seems convinced: "Patience is not my strong, she may be my plague."
At the end, after a frustrated approach to the traumatolog who cut his sweet in the midst of the colloor, but who explains that plague is not a scientific term; it is the psychalist that reveals the mystery: "the plague is what is actually open, the symbolic is the cycling."
The sophisticated protagonist stressed and concludes: "In the plague I only could know that it is open in reality and that it is not existing," but convinced that the joy and pleasances of the language must be very linked with them.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with the two.
Nicaraguaian Sergio Ram√≠rez also exhibited a rare narration that he titled Loge to the inventation, where the dog on the beach is not named but at a given time is found.
With the touchs of magic reality, he spoke of a shocking fame that touched clouds, made back to people who went away or repaird verses that a damoiselle had lost, a narration that would see to talk to the America then, the great news that had since the beginning of his chronics and quoted to Bernal D√≠az del Castillo that criticizes the exceedances of the competitive capitals.
"Cervangers who invented us all (the writers) were shocked by false witnesses that appeared in the stories presented as real, but in another way we would never have contained the history of America with an imagination that had missed even the pudeur."
Nevertheless, he stressed, "the stupids and mentors have the best imagination" and here the reality convergent with lies, there is no longer known what part of the narration belongs to a band or another, where the fiction literature reaches its support.
This is actually called the 'Cervantes' tradition.
"It's thanks to his heritage we're what we're telling."
In his tour, the writer Mayra Montyero announced and applauded the variety of interpretations caused by the FIL invitation with its rond table The need to be on the plage.
The Cuban-Portugal has put it on the great plague of social violence through its country - and the Latin America shared - to conflicts on trafficking and sales of drugs.
"I think that good literature, good poesia the good songs refers to a Tacite commitment that isn't certainly premediate," said she, after pointing out that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment between the author and the readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction".
The evening was finished with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis Garc√≠a Montero, who also stressed "he must be on the plage of the scriben undertaking."
He believed that in a world that lives in great speed also in terms of intellectual habits and the control of consciences that turn to the advantage of dogmatics, "while each claim is small and behind each negative, there is a small yi‚Äù.
"To be the masters of our own feelings and to be the masters of the reality, we must abuse: and nourish many times means pushing the dog on the plague and depressing people who feel very commodes thinking of loading, white and black, in established ideas and without nuance, and also striving the powers that prefer a world in white and black," he said, inviting to restore the sense of writing.
Roman at the chass of his first title
Ruben Omar Romano had three defects in the ends he had high and down in his cart, but he has reached three times the decisive series.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end, there are more than two different styles that are compared, marked by their technicians, which are among them a contrast marked by the results.
Ruben Omar Romano had three defects in the ends, he had high and down in his career, but he has reached three times the decisive series, even though until now he has not put into the thousand and that is why this opportunity is very special for him.
Argentin ended console with the sub-champion medal, he remained a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The Santist Strategy arrived to his first end as an entrepreneur in the Open Tower 2002 Tour, when he held Morelia's rains with whom he lost with a global result of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the 2003 class, there was also a decisive dual and again lost with the global result of 3-1, and it was exactly against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the Vicentary Tournoi 2010, Rub√©n again suffered a reverse, since his team did a equal match of 2-2 against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of game, but in the series of penalties he obtained a benefit for 3-1 with two opportunities to obtain the title and finally three of his players slowed up 11 metres and suffered the salt at the result of 4-3.
Rub√©n lost two ends with the Red Diablos and one with Monterrey, his rival at the tournai, therefore he does not want to have the same sort, he tries to throw off the efficiency so that he can celebrate for the first time a title, even if he claims that the institution is more important for him.
"I want to be champion, I don't want to break any statistics, that is for a club, not for a passion I have and therefore I will obtain the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," commented the terror when the twin asked him what would be his weak points in the ends.
He remembers many of the last end, of which he assures that he has learned much, "The only lesson we can believe is that until the arbitre does not shrink the end, we can't celebrate, we are prepared in the line, because the players are also, the last time, with two penalities to get us ready to run and I believe that this is a lesson, before the end of the match can't be feeded."
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which is not worried about it, because he trusted in his players: "We are never trying to reach the series of penalties, are trying to end in the regular period, but sometimes we have not to prepare, the previous tour we have been prepared, unfortunately the destiny has made us a bad tour, sometimes emotions or anxiety to keep the title between our hands, he has missed us, that has served us as a precision for this end and hope that there is no longer in this situation."
Romano now has the opportunity to not be a sub-champion technician and enjoy the glory offered by the titles for the first time.

NASA will announce the discovery of extraterrestreat life
The United States Space Agency referred the press to present tomorrow a discovery that will have an impact on the search of living in space.
The National Administration of the Aeronautic and Space (NASA) of the United States will communicate tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestreat life.
The discovery will be presented in a print conference on Thursday, at 13:00 p.m. at NASA's headquarters at Washington for astrobiology experts, science that studys the origin, evolution, distribution and future life in the universe.
When she mentioned the press, NASA assured that she would present what would have an impact on the research of the foreign life", which caused speculations from the experts of other countries.
The discovery could show the theory that there are similar creatures to us and in hostile environments that were thought of inhabitance and put on the table the possibility of become intelligent as humans if their conditions of life are improved.
It seems to be talking about a microbe found under the Mono Lake at the Yosemite National Park in California, who lives in a environment that it was thought to be too ventilative for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any way, the creature uses the arsenic as a way of life and this capacity makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planets that have no voluntary atmosphere.
According to astronoms, if these bodies use arsenics in their metabolism, it proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from what we know."
Space Agency will communicate the real part of the discovery in the morning press conference, Thursday.
The conference will participate in the geobiology Pamela Conrad, which studys the possibility of life on Mars; and Steven Benner, a biological student who studied Titan (the largest satellite of Saturne), is the prospect that its chemical is similar to the Earth.
PRD Germe, PT, Convergence and Opposite Block Pattern
With reforms to the Organic Law of the Congress, the arrival of the 'bipartism' is possible, it is condemned.
The 1960s came to be installed when the Congress appeared an opposite block of PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesus Manuel Patron Montalvo, which declared independently and asked the four questions: the arrival of the 'bipartism' in the Chambers.
Before the 60th legislation session, Felipe Manzanarez Rodr√≠guez, of Convergence; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, PRD; and Montalvo Model, "confronted to the reform of the Organic Law, as it excluded,
With this reform, they reiterated the 'bipartism', because there are now two people, from the same number of parties, who control the Congress.
These four Members, at the count of Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, were the only ones to vote against the Director-General, chaired by the PANist Salvador L√≥pez Brito and Luis Antonio C√°rdenas Fonseca as a vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo said that with these institutional reforms it is the political marginality of PRI and PAN.
He stated that the following days they would speak to the representatives of PAN and PRI to amend the scheme from a political will and if they do not have it, they will again be observed by the two parties and so will end the opposite coalition.
"After this happened (opposite coalition), it is what I see, because we are excluded, from any decision, they have not even the political defense to consider the view of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodr√≠guez, of Convergence, said that with PRD, PT and Patron there are conciliations, and that is why they are a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, continued, the Congress, after being monopolist, or now "duopolistical".
"This is not the spirit of the reform of the law that there is a eternal bipartism in the Congress."
To begin, this group begins with 5 legislators and now they speak to other colleagues to be more, the Convergent has enlarged.
Hezequiel Reynoso Esparza, from PT, explained that the Congress is now transformed into a 'busin' between two, making allusion to PAN and PRI.
"After there was only one party, now they divide him between two."
Pattern Montalvo requested to respect the personality of the deputy to give him his place to the negotiations tables.
"If they do not leave by cupular agreements outside 5 which will probably be 9 Members, now at the five we see, separated in different fractions, we decided to join us to find a place in the negotiation table, which is the problem that, in the reform that they have made, we are outside and we are not agreed with this reform there."
$200 million more for the "provision"
The Mayor of Mazatlan pays another cheque to the own questionnaire of the electric material company.
Another cheque of approximately 200 thousand weights for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos has been issued by Mayori.
With this, the amount paid this second semestre to the owner of the electric equipment company is 1 million 200 000 weight.
According to the Municipe‚Äôs transparency page, this last number 9258447 was issued on 16 November last for the amount of 200 000 144.56 weight, with a view of "contact liquidation of suppliers".
The treasurer Luis Miguel L√≥pez Moreno had said that the Commonity would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the Supreme Audit of the State to sell a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total of debt, and therefore, how many cheques will still be issued for Camacho Palazuelos.
"We didn't buy anything, we just pay him what we need to, as the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last Czechs were "reapered" the last quarter of the year: On September 24, 2 on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and last, 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet published in the Public Journal of the State, according to the provisions of the Act when an undertaking is questioned by ASE, to avoid that other Governments use its services, the Treasury has assured that they did not use its services again.
All this, after the 25th July, had published a revised of the Cheques that the Mayor issued to its providers, revealing that in March 2008-July 2010, in the trinity of the Mair Jorge Abel L√≥pez S√°nchez, the Municipe payed by Camacho Palazullos over 10 million weights, over 42 Cheques.
He also performed transactions with Jumapam, engaged in cheques of more than 3 million weight.
Tourism sites must be treated
Tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist because of the bad conditions of the S√°nchez Taboada round in Mazatlan.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a cross of the S√°nchez Taboada round, the tourism sector of Mazatlan asked the authorities to take attention to areas and sites that are in bad conditions and design a bad picture of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, Chairman of the Zona Dorada Trade Association, recalled them several times that the image of the destination was careful and new activities should replace the other people who are wrong.
He said that the bad state of the streets and troops has affected because tourists are walking and seeing the disorder and avoid trade nearby.
"Political people know that it means to close a company a day and they don't know the happiness that it was lost, but they did not work so long and without adequate planning."
The hotel Jos√© Ram√≥n Manguart S√°nchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance from the Mayor.
"The municipality must take its responsibility and avoid that this happens again, how to do it, therefore through preventive and not only corrective," he said.
"We want to play a own city, because not only because of the fact that this is a tourist area, we must enter it, but as a people who have a own place to live and Mayor must change their strategy to keep the city well."
There are other sites that are disadvantaged and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venado de Mazatlan.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it is not only depending on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that is safe in its beaches, boulevards, holds permanent tourist attractions," he said.
"We have not given them the attention that we need and that kind of facts emphasizes something that is noted for all, the maintenance is necessary."
Ra√∫l Llera Mart√≠nez, under the Secretary of Tourism Promotion, declared that the recovery of the tourist sites of Mazatlan is urgent because they are not used correctly and designed a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that must be online together with the municipality and be a priority to have the updating city, private, ordered, and that it is attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Happy Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural sites and sites that should be ordered first, clean and put online to make them attractive to the ability to add to the inventor we have to promote this destination."
IP request for results at the Congress
Eduardo D√°valos, Chairman of the CCE, proposed that Members take great responsibility to be an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations against them.
Mazatlan's business sector requires a generous and free working legislation between the parties and the Government Executive, since Sinaloa is convulsive and faced with major problems.
Lastly, the 60th legislation was established by seven political forces, 19 members of PRI, 13 PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of the PT, one of Convergence and one PVEM, in total 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations that new integrates of the Government Congress are a pure and engaged management with society and the various sectors that need a responsible legislative work and that the same spirit models of party or patrianalism are not repeated.
Eduardo D√°valos, Chairman of the CCE, proposed that Members take great responsibility to be an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations against them.
"We hope that Members really exercise their right, free of agreement between the parties, because the cotume is that they do patents to ensure their own interests and become a carnaval masker of governments and leaders of the parliamentary fractions."
That is why I ask them to ensure the commitment to establish the necessary points that the current Governor makes progress.
"We shall ensure that they work with society and sectors, particularly because the people of Sinaloa have given them their trust in the past elections.
Jos√© Ram√≥n Manguart S√°nchez, Chairman of the Hotels Tres Islands, considered that one of the major provocations of the 40 popular representatives was to push and add forces to the economic growth of the State, since now the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important is that they have economic growth, that they generate stimulations for investment and infrastructure, and that will in a way stimulate generation of jobs."
With regard to tourist activity, he asked that new legislators give him the importance that it had in the government budget to consolidate the Government Tourism Secretariat.
"I understood that it is the Second Secretariat of the State with a lower budget and it is incompatible as an important economic and generator of debts and investments and which is directly revalued with the agro-industry."
In addition to the need to classify resources to detoning tourist projects that help to make the State awareness and update the Alcohol Act that previous legislation could not be resolved.
We're looking for a magic king
Pets, cars and bicyclettes, among other games, are the desire of the family Coronado Valenzuela.
For their parents, the next day of the Queens will be difficult to fulfill their illusions, because their home is formed by no longer than 12 people and a horse.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, Jos√© Alfredo, Maria Guadalupe, Isa√≠as, Jos√© Juan and Miguel do not lose the hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will bring them the games and clothes they want so much.
The family resides in a humble house of Colonia Salvador Allend and lives daily because their father has no stability job.
"It's very difficult for us, because my husband has no job, but we sell mandarines and patates... and the next half I'm going to make the "speaks" to sell in the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little.
Adelaida, a four-year-old, wants a bicyclet or a bicyclette, and his sister Isabel, three-year-old, would like a Barbie poppy.
At his tour, Jos√© Alfredo, a 10-year-old shoot for a 'track' monster, and for his little brother Jesus, 8 months, Cayetana suggests size clothes for a year.
"He said to me (Josea Alfredo), "I would like to have this monster," but I said to him, "I'll see, my son," because he was very nice," remembers Cayetana.
For the largest children, who were at school, clothes and shoes, would be the ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, a 11-year-old age, shooted the size 12; Isaiah, of 10 years old, shooted the size 10, while Miguel was eight years old.
Jos√© Juan, 14 years old, needs a pair of sport shoes, so a couple of sizes five or half six would help him.
If you want to help realize the dream of the family Coronado Valenzuela, you can participate in the Cherche Roi Mage campaign by giving a game or money to the Reception of Noroeste.
14 Drug traffickers arrested
A ten of searches were carried out in Estonia, mercredi, in the context of the demantling of a cannabis production network and sale.
Fourty persons were arrested and will be faced with several accused.
Researches were carried out in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in drug production places.
"Average 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashich, money and equipment that served to the production have been introduced", stated Louis-Philip Ruel, the Kebec S√ºrety's speaking port.
In all, 11 men and three women were arrested, including the two presumed leaders of this network, two men of Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons had to compare to Sherbrooke's justice palace in the following hours after their arrest.
They could face convictions of cannabis production, ownership in order to make it traffic, compliance and service flight, among others.
These surveys took place after a long-term helicopter investigation, which has long-term over one year.
"This is the information received from the public that allowed us to proceed to these arrests," said Mr. Ruel.
Some 70 police officers of the Qu√©bec Regional Investigation Module for Investigation, Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphremagog Police Office took part in this police operation.
Icelandic migration may continue without problems
The draft conservatory law that, according to the Government, should resolve the problem of the ships imposed by illegal migrants, it is obvious to be struggled while the three opposition partys have known merry that they could not support it.
"I'm strongly supported on the Charter."
"I'm on my side with a party who created the granite under your feet," said the Liberal Chief Michael Ignatiff, while he was rounded by Members after the Monday Meeting of the Chalks.
Freedoms claim that the proposed legislation project, which would allow to hold up until one year from a ship that is identified as a transporter of illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Rights and Freedom Charter.
The chief of the Quebecois Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also stated that it could not support the draft law, because it is taking it to the bad target.
"We are opposed and it seems to be against all the parties of the opposition, then we will see what the government will do," said Mr. Duceppe.
Olivia Chow, the NPD's criticism on immigration, rejected the criticism that his party would not be sufficiently strong with regard to clandese immigrants.
"The neo-democrats agree that measures are taken against the passengers of clands and that is what we do through another law project, Mrs Chow," said.
"We do not support the draft conservator law because it takes refugees and imprisons children for at least one year," explained Ms. Chow.
The Minister of Immigration, Jason Kenney, accused the opposite parties to play policy and ignore the will of Canadians.
"The Canadians say massively to Members that they do not tolerate such a kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that govern Canada and treat the country as a paillasson."
"They are waiting for what Canada takes strong measures," replied Minister Kenney.
The Government did not announce a reliable vote on its draft legislation, which would be able to conduct the country to elections with its rejection.
However, a conservator said to the QMI Agency that the Government would ask for a vote that each deputy who will be opposed will then explain to his elections.
The new unit does not make a singleness
In spite of the possibility of a permanent unit to combat corruption and confusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to ask for the creation of a public investigation commission on the subject.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea has not been given last year: Quebec had consulted the Department of Investigation of New York on this subject since January last.
The metropole has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, the announcement of march was surprising more than one.
It should be said that during a meeting of the Permanent Council on the Qu√©bec Police Services on 29 October last, this measure has never been discussed, despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
There was no longer need for the singing criticism in public security, Stephane Bergeron, to qualify this advertising of "lapine out of a chapeau" and to "block out on the coin of a table".
Minister Dutil responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future unit.
"You're going to see the result when we'll announce it, it's glad to confirm."
"We're aware of this problem there."
For the Chairman of the CSQ, Rejean Parent, nothing can replace a public investigation.
"Mr. Charest does not want to create this investigation committee, more people think like you and me that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a investigation commission is Jean Charest's demission," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethical and governance at the National Public Administration School.
In order to get out of this impasse, it suggests Quebec to provide a special mandate to the general verificationer in order to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the General Checker," it stops.
He also believes that Qu√©bec could give the checker the same powers as a Commissioner, so that it would permit people to witness.
The creation of a permanent shuttle is not the only project in the Charest government cards.
Qu√©bec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code in order to be better adapted to this type of crime.
This request would be from the Marteau Operation Prosecutor, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence is not explicit in such investigations.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his colleague of Justice, Rob Nicholson, is presently considering some amendments related to this dossier.
In the 2001 Printemps Operation, who frapped the motard groups, even though the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 were arrested.
Ottawa later adopted the gangsterism Act.
High supervisory shipments
several water courses remain under high surveillance because of the strong precipitations that have been shocked in several regions of the province since march.
A terrain swimming in Maurice took place after midday, in Shawinigan, Maurice.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
Tonight, another shooting would be produced in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudi√®re.
A road was shocked.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, strong precipitations were shocked in several regions, or 40 to 70 billion rain.
From 20 to 40 billion additional rain were expected from Thursday night, according to the regions.
The areas in the northern river and the Western Valley were the most touched.
They could receive up to 100 mm of rain.
As these precipitations should be added to the source of nest already accumulated in some sectors, it is feared that several water courses are discovered.
Advertising warnings were issued by the Civil Security of Quebec for the Uareau Rivers and Achigan in Lanaudi√®re tonight.
The North Rivers, in Saint-Jerome, in the Laurents, and in the Czeen, in Lotbinaire, were the object of injury vessels and remained under control.
In the Lanaudi√®re region, the strong precipitations cut some lakes in Saint-Julian, Saint-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was imported because of the strong rains.
Ten residents had to be evacuated by preventive measure.
In Outaoye, the discharge of certain lakes had been closed by several ways, including in the municipality of Mansfield and Pontefract.
Civil security remains on a foot of warning and supervises the nearby situation, said Annik Bouchard, security adviser.
The Qu√©bec Cross Prevision Centre has for its merry warnings for several rivers, including Maskinonge, Assomption, Uareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Partially infringed
The Quebec Stephane Dupont Radio Animator was partly in front of the Canadian Radio Standards Council (CCNR) for proposals on social assistance and Haitians as well as on its largest language.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his CHOI team had the right to express their views, but some proposals contained "incomprehensive information on the social assistance, the unfairly negative representations of Haitians and the largest language that did not correspond to the emissions diffused during the day".
The Council also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the dissemination of the name of two individuals who were suicided, did not interfere the radiodiffusion codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints on comments during emissions from 2008 to 2010.
The first decision was made after a complaint from the Common Force of Assistant Social Persons of Quebec.
The group regretted that the amounts mentioned in the emission were inexact.
Animators must present solid information instead of false information.
With regard to suicide, an animator Stefane Dupont had estimated that the suicide is a gesture of lack.
The majority of the members of the Committee concluded that the revised message was that the suicide should not be considered as a solution to the problems of life.
The majority of the Committee believes that the episodes in question "Tupront the Middle" have addressed a delicate and appropriate subject.
So no bloom has been stored in his place.
The latter litigation was reported on statements followed by the earthquake in Haiti.
Stephane Dupont and Jean-Ren√© Dufort were then delivered to a mediative face that had caused many reactions.
The CHOI animator stated that he had done no gift to help the Haitians because it was not able to know with certainty that the needy people really would receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abused, but that their cumulative impact is an indeed negative representation of the Haitians.
"I've already cleaned my suspension of three days above."
"My file is empty for a year and half," said the animator.
In all decisions, the Committee denunces the dissemination of gross languages.
In each case, the CHOI-FM Radiodiffusioner cooperated "out of its obligation".
The consequences are minimum for the station which, inter alia, should announce these decisions once during the greatest hearing hours for a period of three days.
A king of the Kung Fu in Montreal
The Montr√©ales of Algerije Nacereddine Zemmal has a extremely special journey.
The athlete that exceeds the "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai box mounts on the Tatamis and rings of the world to search for new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like Kig-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria, Zemmal explained Zemmal, installed in the metholol since 2008 to evolve in professionals."
"I'm in my case, I'm looking for battles, because for those who do not love the present earth game in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, he who works as a security agent and as the UPS company has just delivered bad news to his rivals, bringing two gold medals to the World Amateur Championship of the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23 to 30 October, in Edimburgh, Scotia.
"I reported the categories of kickboxing full contact and Thai box, did he explain."
"Currently, I'm preparing to go to China for the San Shue World Coupe."
"The fighters who ended among the first four at the last championship of the world in each category were invited."
"I brought the bronze in 2009 to Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I ended the eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I concluded the tournament at the fifth rang, while I arrived third to Toronto in 2009, he added."
"What is interesting is that I have progressed in every competition."
"To this ritme, I'm going to be first this time or next year."
The "san shou" or "Sanda" is an original discipline from China where poing and foot cuts are allowed, as well as the earth projections are.
The woods start at originally on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most known pugilist in this form of fight is the Vietnamian American origin Cung Le, well recognized in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has only one event in his career, he will certainly respond to his presence in the Super King of Sanda, the Super Bowl of the Kig-fu.
"This competition is the most releved and most prestigious in China, explained the gaillard sympathy."
"This is a little the equivalent of the Lumpine Stade (the largest stage of Thailand)."
"There was a great experience."
Zemmal returned his first battle in half-final of his category (80 kg) before the end was lost.
"Whoever winning me was a real pro, he analyzed."
" There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of half-final are at the end of their category."
"They then, the winners of each category are faced to round a single champion, the king of the Kig-fu."
450 million in contracts without offers
Hydro-Qu√©bec granted a grade of $450 million in Engineering firms for Eastman-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In the heart of this over 100 contracts, it is a consortium formed by firm BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor, which has reached the most important project management, for a sum of $295 million without offers.
This consortium called Energy Management was formed in 2004 in conjunction with the choice of Hydro-Qu√©bec to grant the private sector his responsibility to manage this important hydro-electric project of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Management Consortium decreased the lucrative contract without calling for public offers.
For the Quebeco Party, the use of enterprises consortiums poses a serious ethical problem that is risked to eliminate competition and cause price growth.
"It's the new way to make confusion and shoot competition."
"It is, that people, instead of doing this secretly, now make it openly", said the sinner Sylvain Simard in press conference yesterday.
Before the morning, Mr. Samard highlighted the question to the National Assembly because he said it is difficult to see how public interest can be served in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, nor strictly that there had been a collusion for this contract.
"I'm starting to have my journey," she painted, supporting that the PQ had been "malhonesty" and had "many of striking."
She said "It'd be less than things" that the PQ would apologize.
Consortium formula is a common practice in the whole world.
It is usually a limited alliance in time that allows two or several enterprises to group their respective experts in order to respond to an appeal for a complex project.
The Eastman project includes a high level of complexity accounting for the extent of work.
The channel is running and must be scanned until 2012.
However, the contract was allocated without the game of competition; there was negotiations.
The formula of consortiums is no longer an exception to Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As the last week the Dever revealed, the formula of consortiums in the Consortium Sector has been an investigation to the government.
A rapid overflow of the Quebec company register allows to number more than 200 consortiums, some of which seem to be permanent.
Thus, the strong Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are decades, brings to a single moral person, or Desau.
For the energy consortium, the Minister Normandeau stressed that "the Territory of Bae James responded to special handling dynamics and that Hydro-Qu√©bec responded in particular to it since the 1970s."
The large leader of the Eastman Project, Real Laport, of the Baie James Energy Society (SEBJ), has explained that the project management contract was granted by grace.
"If you're going to call for offers and there's little delivery, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: whether you take people in this market and you say, we're going to negotiate a satisfactory agreement and with a good price."
"But the idea is that it's not the price that is important, it's the competence of people," said Mr. Laport.
This contract granted to the Energy Management Consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebecois Party.
The contracts were granted by Hydro-Qu√©bec or SEBJ for the Eastman-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, the Dever has accounted of 109 advisory genital contracts between 2002 and March 2010 to firm or subsidiary, including land laboratorys.
SNC-Lavalin had 22 contracts, Genevar reached 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking account of its participation in energy management.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They totalize $449,783,344, including the amount of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard left to hear that the four firms composing the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Group SM and Axor) are "now known to the Quebec Liberal Party".
The Minister of Norway left that the PQ is also linked to those "financing", before clarifying that it was its leaders instead.
Responsible consumption bar - The "verde" label doesn't imply confidence
More green, but frankly sceptic.
Whatbecois consumer is very little confidence to the actors of sustainable development, but also to the equitable brands and the environmental certificates to guide its choices.
Pis, even if it baths in a median universe where messages for more pullulent consumption, it deplore a lack of credible information, the lack of skills even with its commitment, indicates the Barometer of the responsible consumer, whose first reading has been delivered yesterday.
Even though they have increased socially responsible products in 2010, the Quebecians seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of them, in fact, do not believe the environmental commitment of enterprises as the green publicity of companies, reveals the measure tool developed by the Sherbrooke University's Consumption Observatory.
In other words, the half of the consumers doubt the reliability of the official certificates issued on the equitable products, but also the credibility of products and marks that are equipped with, the Barometer indicates.
At the same time, the discussion of the politicians on this subject is seriously taken by only 14.6% of Quebecois.
However, the information on responsible consumers seems to be mainly to stimulate this bread of animal consumption currently by near the third of the Quebecois consumers.
Indeed, the white and suspicious nature of the information would be 46% of consumers.
It is the second ship identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
Furthermore, a third of the Quebecois is also unfair to the performance of green products or services that are seen to put them into their hands.
On another note, consumers were near to half in 2010 to change their habits and especially changed marks of one or more products to respond to their conviction.
At the height of 61%, they also encouraging buyers in their neighborhood and privileged the purchase of food cultivated products in their region, states the Barometer.
More green and responsible - the accounting consumption index reached 64 to a maximum of 100 for this year -, the Quebec Consumer Homo likes to be presented as the king of the recycling that seeks to reduce its environmental impairment by worried about animal protection.
However, his social and ecological conscience seems to remain outside its car, indicates the Barometer: in 2010, at least 28% of the Quebecois have indicated that the transport was commonly used or that they preconceived co-co-co-co-operation to defend their green interests.
The walk and the vessel were also supported by 39.1% of the participants to this wide conductive investigation, which came to take his first click.
A loan of the State for eXcentris purchase
The Government of Quebec, which was asked to be financially involved in the purchase of the eXcentris film complex by the Angus Society and the Parallele, agrees to cooperate, but at the competition of only one loan.
The Angus Development Society and the Parallele, who expected a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to get Daniel Langlois the eXcentris cinema complex on the St. Laurent boilers, don't obtain what they claim.
The Government accepts to participate in the dossier but to its own conditions.
After the expected donation, the Quebec Government proposes a loan that would be less than the initial expectations, which could be a viable solution to advantageous conditions, at least the view of the sources of State offices.
A first plan of action and a request of 12.8 million have already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but applications have already been renewed at low level.
A proposal and a action plan was sent to the Minister of St-Pierre by the President of the Culturel Development Society (SODEC), Fran√ßois Macerola, which pilots the eXcentris dossier.
He has reached a last report over a decade of days.
But the counter-proposal of the office was reached at the Monday SODEC.
The Parallele and Angus have responded to it until 31 December.
It seems, however, that the hypothesis of the gift of the State must really be discarded.
Remember that the Qu√©bec ownership of cinema and cineparks was opposed to a direct investment from the State to support the purchase of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture does not have to finance real estate projects, which did not for other cinema rooms.
But several environmental stakeholders requiring substantial economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the Cean's Master, had ten years of arm cinema of authors in his complex places after funding his own construction, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Council.
The lack of rooms for independent films is criing in Montr√©al, and eXcentris had been fidelizing his customer.
The Angus Society and the Parallele, with their head Christian Yaccarini, pilots, on their side, a private financing campaign, expecting to collect $7,000 to swim the purchase.
Since spring 2009, one of the three screens, The Parallele, continues to spread eXcentris films.
The goal of the future purchasers is to open the three rooms next February 27 by designing the very beautiful film of Xavier Beauvous Mans and Deities.
But Christian Yaccarini did not remember the Dever and it is ignored what he and his group think of proposals to the lowness that they have done.
The swimming water on a complex Canada...
The new American diplomatic cables distributed by WikiLeaks highlight what the United States consider as the complex of Canadian inferry towards the Americans, but the feelings of the suicide to Canada.
Thus, the American diplomates noted that each Canadian elector had no Canadian-American relationships by voting and believe that the visit of President Obama had helped the Conservant Government to adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Ambassador in Ottawa and Washington, located on the public last day, offer more cruel details than the substantial content of the dent.
A cable dated 22 September 2008, or in full federal election campaign, reports to the United States as not part of the chairs discussed by the political leaders.
In the greatest surprise of the U.S. Ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offers a few explanations to this situation.
"A complex of Canadian inheritance may almost inherent Canadian political leaders to speak in the daily, rather than to bring this election to the United States (e.g. at the 1988 free exchange campaign) " , he wrote.
The United States therefore concludes, "the eligible provision of this election: all represent, but potentially threatening to speak to it."
The ambassador is, at least, the "assert-silence" that both countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"Logoly, it considers the capacity of a candidate, a party and more than a party head to manage this key relationship should be a key factor that the electioners have in mind by voters."
On January 22, 2009, Terry Breese was sent to Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama at his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help the Government to survive in the early February confidence vote on the federal budget, by which Canada will show its first deficit over a decade because of a relief plan from 30 to 40 billion dollars", wrote Mr. Brese.
No part was mentioned that the Government had to extend the Parliament before Christmas in order to avoid being reversed by the coalition and that the opposition partys made its conditional survival to the quality of the proposed relief plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by the Ambassador Wilkins, prevents Washington of a more negative image than the dramatic series distributed to CBC return from the United States.
The Ambassador is concerned about the emissions of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which few references are observed in Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or "No-Fly-List".
Another cable reports that Hillary Clinton asked his French homolog Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome certain prisoners in Guant√°namo.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but on the basis of the "case per case".
At the end of the meeting, he wrote: "He sent a paper to the State secretariat about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old musulman of Canadian origin."
"The secretariat agreed to revision the folder."
Let us finally note that the spirits are fleeting about the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, a very closest adviser from Stephen Harper, declared on CBC's waves that the responsibilities of this massive fleet should be "assaulted".
He did Mike Huckabee's echo in the United States.
A global plan to renew lighting
The United Nations proposed last night in Canc√∫n to renew household, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries in order to obtain a reduction in steel gas (GES) which corresponds almost to the third of the additional reductions that must be achieved to stabilize the global climate of 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the gap of large concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to adopt in Canc√∫n to compensate the absence of binding commitments to reduce by industrialized countries.
According to the last plan, if the incandescenced ampules that still monopolize with 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by fluocompact ampulls, or, better, by stroke-electronic diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), the essential 1.8 billion tonnes of GES embedded on the planet to clarify humans would be avoided.
The lighting is responsible for 8% of the global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the planet car park's emissions.
In Copenhagen, last year, the major emission countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and other, including Canada, have been undertaken in voluntary reduction plans, which should take place the global GES emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, it should be undertaken from this 5 Gt further to stabilize from 2020 the increase of the climate to 2 degrees of centigrates in order to avoid that it becomes not controlled.
In incandescence ampules, 95% of energy is dissized in the form of heat and the rest, or 5%, produced from light.
With fluocompact ampulations, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and the new ampulations to the DE is reduced, the need for two times again.
Fluocompact ampoules are averaged from 6000 to 10 000 hours.
The new ampoules to DEL, as Philips manufacturer launched this week - this company also participated in the United Nations study - have a life expectancy of 25 000 hours and consumed less than 80% of energy than an incandescenced ampoule, which gives an idea of the economy possible with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
All these new ampules can also work with reheostats in order to make very little heat.
And they do not contain any mercy.
Several specialists have shown reserves from fluocompact ampole because they contain mercury and have to eliminate them as dangerous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers put consignments into place.
However, the report indicates that the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluocompact ampoule, but instead the carbon thermal centrals, which employ many mercury to produce gaseous electricity in incanded amples.
In the United States only these centres are earned by 250,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report provides details of the profits of each country through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would earn a billion dollars per year in electricity purchases and eight million tonnes of CO2, or equivalent to 3.5 thermal centrals whose construction would cost 2.5 billion.
The Coast of Ivoire waits for the advertising of the electoral results in nervousness
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, requested the "term " publication of the Presidential election results in Costa d'Ivoire, after the expiration of the deadlines.
"The Secretary-General highlights the need for the independent election committee to purchase its work and announce the provisional results without more time, stressed a chairman of the head of the United Nations."
"He calls upon all Ivoire parties and institutions to make evidence of responsibility and abstention of any initiative until the announcement of the provisional results."
Despite the pressures performed by some foreign governments, the electoral committee left the mid-minute day without publishing the results, three days after the Sunday election.
It was about 40 minutes before the end of the period, the President of the ECI had stated the television that the Committee "continued to work" to announce the results.
The calls have been multiplied in the world so that the CEI finally declares the name of the winner of the second tour between Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo camp has taken account of the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of Frauduleus votes in the north, held by the former Rebellion of the New Forces (FN) since the fall of September 2002.
Pascal Afi N'Guessan, head of the Ivoire President's campaign, stated that the NF electors' inhibition work in the north of the country had disappointed the partys of the president coming to vote.
Any election could be canceled if the complaints made by Gbagbo are reserved by the Constitutional Council.
But Gbagbo's adverse believes that the highest court of the country is not neutral because it is directed by Paul Yao N'Dr√©, a nearby Gbagbo political alliance.
Alessane Ouattara, a Northern man who has all linked with the former rebels, judged "inacceptable" the delay in the announcement of results and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go until the victory return.
His allies argued that Gbagbo blocked the publication of the results because he knows that it has lost and that it should be complained to the Constitutional Council, after preventing the electoral committee to disseminate the results, would be illegal.
The second tour of the presidency, Sunday, was supposed to round the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country remained known in two years.
The United Nations warned the Ivoire political class that it could be held responsible for events of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished the first tour on 31 October, with 38 per cent of votes against 32 per cent in Alassane Ouattara, which received the public support of the former President Henri Konan B√©di√© (25 per cent in the first tour).
The unemployment rate has remained stabil in France at the 3rd quarter
The unemployment rate in France in terms of the International Working Bureau (ITB) remained stable to 9.3% in mettropole (9.7% in terms of other sea departments), showing the corrected data of the provisional changes published by Insee.
The number of unemployed employees is 2.631 million in mettropole.
The data of the second quarter were confirmed at 9,3% of the active population in metr√≥l and 9,7% with the DOMs.
In a year, the unemployment rate is increased in 0.1 points.
More widely, 3,4 million people in France did not work at the third quarter but wanted to work, to be or not available in the two weeks to work and to find or not a job.
The situation of young people present on the labour market has still been degraded, with a new increase in the unemployment rate, at 24.2% in mettropole (+ 0.9 points for three months, +0.5 points for one year) and 25%, including DOMs.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people from 15 to 24 years were lacking in the IT.
The seniors have known a slight increase in the unemployment, to 6.4% in mettropole (+0.2 points for three months and one year), or 482.000 people in 50 years or more, and 6.6% with the WTO.
Only 25-49 years have benefited from unemployment stability in the third quarter, at 8.3% in mettropole (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points a year) and 8.8% in the whole of France.
Insees have been published more monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a pollutic on its calculation method.
Eurostat, the EU Statistics Agency, continued to do this instead and announced a rate of 9.8% for France (including WTO) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guerini reviewed and placed in detention
Alexandre Guerini, 53-year-old leader of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS President of the General Council of the Bouches du Rh√¥ne, was understood and carried out at the Luynes' arrest house, near Aix-en-Provence in a frauduleous public market investigation.
Alexandrandre Guerini has been investigated for abuse of social goods, funds and public goods, receipt, active corruption, infringement trafficking and munitions detention, indicates its lawyer.
"Alexandre Guerini is struggle and wants to explain about all the questions that the magistrate will put it, and not fantasies."
"It's easy to continue for a multitude of reprehensible leaders, it's another thing to prove them", stated its lawyer, Florence Rault, before hearing his customer.
Mr. Guerini, the strong man's brother of the PS at the department, Jean-No√´l Guerini, held by his lawyers to pass to the judge before his hearing a record to explain.
One of his neighbors, Philippe Rapezzi, was also reviewed on Wednesday night and erupted.
According to his lawyer, Me Lucien Simon, his customer never did anything else than to make the delays he had to handle.
As regards the assignment of markets or the destination of the funds related to their operation, he never knew it, said Me Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General for the Aggregation Services, was conducted in Monday review for the detriment of public and compliance funds, and left free under judiciary control with prohibition to meet the protagonists of the dossier.
"My customer has made explanations to the facts that he has been reproved."
"The Master Instructor noted that it was free", said his lawyer, Me Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons were reviewed and released in the Monday night, with a position under the judiciary for two of them, reported the Advocate Prosecutor of the Republic of Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Adjunct Director-General of Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), is continued to be "committee of influence and passive corruption".
Two officials of the ABC, Michele Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been reviewed one for "abortion and distortion of public goods by a person responsible for a public service mission," the other for "compressed public fund displacement".
Finally, the company of Alexanndre Guerni, Jeannie Peretti, was reviewed for "abusing of social goods".
Among those who have been faced with Mr. Guerini figure Stefan Brunnengo-Girard, recently elected in a parallel case of fraudulent public markets touching the Corse.
The investigators suspect their companies that they have served to white up the money of the big banditism.
The investigation is conducted under several open legal information against X in April 2009 following an anonymous email for frauds presumed in the passing of public markets, especially in the waste filial.
The investigations focused on the conditions of assignment and operation of the Citatot discharge, which collects Aboriginal waste, as well as certain cities of the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss: Elisea exaggerated the mediation of Syria
Over 10 months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the type of Clotilde Reiss, the French youth researcher arrested in Iran for "spionnage", held the German opinion in France, launched the diplomacy in warning, and highlighted the deterioration of relations between Paris and Teheran.
All under the attention of the United States diplomates.
American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le World reveal some below this crisis.
They describe how Eliseo explained its strategy to the Americans, and then he gives advice for the treatment of their own "otage" crisis in Iran (a small group of randons).
They show how French responsibilities tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the French youth had not been in contradiction with Majid Kakavand, a Iranian detained in France and searched for the American justice for the traffic of materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they put the way the French Presidency tried to handle the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian President, Bachar Al-Assad, had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, there was nothing.
A diplomatic telegram issued on August 12, 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to manage cases".
The Elys√©e for Strategic Affairs, Fran√ßois Richier, composed of the Director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, is close to the American diploma Kathleen Algren.
They explain to him the French method.
They advise the Americans to do so so to repatriage their own residents of force in Iran.
"Feats of the bruit," they say, "mare without stop" in the media the words "right of the basic man", "innocence", "immediate ligation".
It is necessary to abolish the Iranian regime, sensitive to his image.
"Do so much more than the Iranians ask you not to do it."
Because, past the attempts to discuss through discrete channels, "the silence will do nothing", the Iranians are "managers in diligent hands".
Mr. Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is "a family iranian tactic: taking oppositions for political changing".
He announces that the release of prison for Clotilde Reiss (which will take place on August 16, when it is refugee to the embassy of France) "invalids the payment of the Iranians of a large amount of money" (230 000 euros of warranty).
And it is knowing that Elisea anticipates other opposition crisis, a phenomenon that "degrees".
The Iranians could "in a near future to stop another of some 800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is out of prison for twelve days, but remains blocked in Iran.
A information is distributed: Iran, Majid Kakavand, whose United States claims to extradition for illegal electronic traffic to Iran, is released free to Paris on the decision of a judge.
The U.S. Ambassade, as many observers, asked about this huge coincidence.
For Washington, which deals with the Iranian national material purchasing networks for the nuclear programme, Majid Khakavand's expansion is a bad news.
Has France accepted a good?
The release of Iran against the French?
When a new meeting with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4th, Fran√ßois Richier ensures that this is not the case.
The Elisea, said, did not only "returned completely by the decision of the judge," but tried to oppose it.
" There have been lived exchanges between the French Presidency and the guard of the shoes" (in the time, Michele Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot return to the decision," he observes.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "strong" monitoring of French information services.
The adviser of Elisea consists of a phone number and then reports the American diplomat that Iran is now located in buildings in Paris managed by the Ambassador of Iran.
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, Elis√©e does not have its efforts through communications and "features" organized in the media to believe that the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" role and "influence" of "meditor".
Americans observe this non-Ironic activity, and noted that manipulation brings its fruits because several printing articles affect the French official version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 called the 'blitz' mediatic of French officials.
The ambassaded in Paris is requested on which it is based as a "grateful" expressed against Mr. Assad.
"Of their full loan statements, the French officials recognize privately that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then discussed the reasons that the Elisea had to pay in this fiction.
The aim of communication "in order to validate Sarkozy's open policy in Syria", he analyzes.
A policy launched in 2008, which "he was then seen by many critical voices in France and foreigner as premature and imm√©diate".
By ‚Äúexaggering the Syrian role‚Äù, Paris is trying to ‚Äúto demonstrate Syria what loans it can affect by playing a constructive role in the region‚Äù.
The goal is also to "seed grain of discourage between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. Ambassador knows the good source.
On August 11, Fran√ßois Richier trusted him: "We're sure we don't know whether the Syrians did anything."
"But we've always thanked them."
"It should, at least, be confusioned with Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it to Elys√©e.
In a communication, he thanks the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role for the release of our companion."
No online games for young Koreans last minute
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "Cendrillon" which will prohibit adolescents to play online games after minute by blocking their access, reported government responsibilities.
A legislative project will be submitted to the Parliament in December to request online game companies to block access to these games after a minute of 16-year-old youth reported representatives of the Ministry of Cultural and Family.
"Beaucoup of children play these games all night and then have difficult to study schools and have a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and the right to sleep", stated the AFP Jo Rin, the ministerial responsible for the draft legislation.
Online games will be re-accessible at 6 a.m. morning.
The companys will have a year to prepare for the implementation of the law, it has specified.
The Government also intends to ask companies to limit the daily access time to these games for young people whom parents requested.
It will also provide people who recruit free softwares that allow to limit the past time on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected countries" and newspapers regularly report different facts related to intensive Internet use.
The country is also the uncertain champion of the global online game competitions.
In November, South Korea had reported four gold medals to the World Cyber Games, faced 58 other nations.
Worldwide 2018-2022: Fifth designates organizing countries
In full turn because of corruption suspicion, the Executive Committee of Fifa designates the World Coupe countries, 2018 and 2022, a political choice where the influence struggles and lobbying risks to take steps on technical criteria.
One thing is safe, the 2018 edition of the Kingdom Competition of Fifa will take place in Europe, traditional discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands).
The 2022 will be more exotic, the International Federation hoped to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its implantation in the United States or in the Forest (Japana, South Korea).
The list of personalities that are part of delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, Jos√© Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Jos√© Socrates, Bill Clinton, Qatar's eve, Belgian and Dutch government heads, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) provides the measurement of economic and political commitments of a worldwide.
Thus, collision treatments may be hard until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between candidates.
According to Fifa's evaluation report, English, Spanish and Portuguese files (2018) and American (2022) have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be very serious for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
Sunday Times, in the origin of the revelations reached to the corruption of two members of the EC (Reinald Temparii and Amos Adamu), could thus have destroyed the chances of his country, with the football that did not welcome the World only once, in 1966.
The BBC delivered a kitchen, Monday, by spreading a documentary that puts three influence members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Liou.
What to miscontent Fifa and put the English responsibilities in the embarrass, which started in an intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron in the first line.
The government leader hopes to revise the success of his predecessor Tony Blair, who had reached in 2005 for London the JO-2012 organization.
Does this intensive activity suffice to slow the slaughter of the UK at the EC?
There is nothing less certain that the two Spanish-Portugal does not have a lack of shoes with its already prepared towns, its expertise (Mondial-82 in Spain, OJ-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its culture.
But the dark economic and financial perspectives of the two countries could deteriorate their ambitions.
The evental recurrences against the Englishs and the doubts about the solvability of Spain and Portugal only make Russian cotton increased, even though the lacunes of its file (stads, hotels, transports).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Poutine decided not to carry out the movement in Zurich and declared a "fair competitive competitiveness in the preparation of the vote" in an unfair allusion to the accused of the English press against the members of the EC.
"On the coppers, we're trying to compromise," Mr. Poutine launched.
For 2022, the United States, strong from 1994 experience, appear as logical favorites.
The first world economic power, headquarters of the Fifa‚Äôs main sponsors, seems to have a long progress on Japan and South Korea, which separately built a very beautiful project.
But these new candidates appear to be prematured for two countries who have co-organized the test in 2002.
Another threat: the octroy of the World World-2026 to China, slightly desired by Fifa, which would actually cause Asian chances for 2022.
With the Qatar, who out of the big game by proposing future future cities, and Australia, Fifa would continue its expansion towards new conceptions, but these two countries present more risks than certainty.
Australia, as Japan and Korea, could also be able to develop the weakness of the TV rights (for the temporary decay) by European countries, the nervous of the Fifa war.
Second mandate: evidence
De Gaulle had really been sweet.
Mitterrand had believed he was hesiting.
Valery Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not have less hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is less than they.
A mandate to Elisea calls another.
So the current head of the State will be candidate in 2012.
But obviously it does not make good home with the part of mystery attached to the presidential function.
So it must be done as if the doubt was always existing.
In a sense as in the other.
In 2006, even without faith, the friends of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third mandate was not excluded.
On November 15, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy would like to make his decision "whoever part of 2011."
That he speaks before the UMP parliamentars, on Monday night in the Elysai, the perspective of "two mandates" has therefore seen a little febliliness.
Was it the official advertising of his candidate?
We were far.
The President was only reminded that the 2008 Constitutional Revision was limited to two numbers of five.
He did a test, not an advertising.
It's not the first time he vows the President, on the tone of the humor, at such meetings.
"As worse, or best, you've been still seven years old with me," he started them in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Do not believe I do not think at the next step."
His proposal of previously make it not more candidate than older; they do not make it less.
If they submit comments, this is for a double reason.
The acceleration of the curso at the PS candidate, on the one hand.
But this is not the license in Segolene Royal's license that puts Nicolas Sarkozy to declare.
Instead, it is because its candidate in 2012 is obviously that many of the PS claims a more premature struggle in order than planned.
The bad analysis, on the other hand.
The right electioners would first prefer the candidate of Fran√ßois Filon to Nicolas Sarkozy (46 per cent against 44 per cent, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UNP above," immediately and carefully reacted the development of the Prime Minister.
"If he believes the possibility, he will not be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Rapharin.
"He'll always think he can win," corrected Alain Juppee, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: The forced ECB to maintain its State title purchases
The last meeting of the European Central Bank's Governing Council (ECB) should be the opportunity to clarify the conditions of crisis or, at least, advertise the adoption of a good number of non-conventional operations of monetary policy which must be concluded at the end of the year.
The crisis of the European sovereign debt obliged, Francfort Emission Institute will certainly not be allowed to be so perpetrative as to increase the situation of today on European obligatory markets.
Political costs would be even higher.
Last night, at a press conference, the Minister of Finance, Christine Lagarde, welcomed the active role played by the ECB to the resolution of the debt crisis in Europe.
It did not want to say if it was estimated that the Central Bank should do more, for example, by increasing its Sovereign obligation purchase programme.
"I reserve my reflection to my European partners (...)."
The older, in Brussels, during his hearing by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, has not shown disappointment on his intentions, with satisfaction to indicate that the secondary market purchase programme would "prosecute" and that "we will see what we will decide" at the meeting of this Jubilee.
Only certainty: the ECB will maintain its main direct rate to 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, the ECB's obligation purchase by the Treasurer has doubled about EUR 1,35 billion last week.
And, according to the inclusions of market operators, it would have made new purchases of Ireland and Portugal, last night.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have purchased 67 billion euros since May 2010.
Among the market operators, the advances of a purchase continuation do not doubt (see page 29).
Economists do not even expect a significant change in cap.
If the ECB's lending operations for more than three months have already disappeared, the latter is still unlimited to liquidity allocations according to generic conditions and for a week to three months.
Economists are expected today to long this device for a few months.
"I can't imagine that she changes importantly its program."
"If it would take the risk to cause new short-term tensions", says Michael Schubert, economicist of the Commerzbank.
"A progressive outcome announced during the first quarter of 2011 appears more likely," warned Norbert Br√∂ms, economicist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the context of its public debt market interventions, "the ECB should hold a volume of purchase of these obligations to achieving a nuclear market," adds Norbert Brms.
In view of the importance of European bank exposure to the euro area's sovereign debt markets, the Emission Institute has no choice than to maintain its presence on the market.
"All prices must be replaced by the lack of market investmentrs and act in such a way to prevent the packing of income paid by the most fragile States," said a major binding manager last night.
Because if interest rates are carried out, States will be more generous to reduce their endlessness, except to stabilize.
The euro saving is at this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government makes the two rounds
After a week's start of concern for Italy, the situation was a little extensive, yesterday, with the reflux of the obligatory rates for 10 years.
A return to precarious calm.
On the outcome of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the presidents of the region have heard Julio Tremonti qualifying the situation of "indecryptable" and waiting for a "unexpected weekend", which was then denied by the interested person.
In any case, the difference with the German long rates reached the record of 210 basic points, and the prices of contracts against the risk of failite (CDS) were involved to 263 points, involving a certain deal in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that the distance with German rates was more than 400 basic points in Spain.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was declared "freely worried" by "the market turbulences" and by a possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that she is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
It is clear that the problem is the absence of growth and the imprisonment of tax revenues that goes with, driving to the State, the risk of no longer covering its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1 per cent in 2011 and to 1.4 per cent in 2012, while the current review budget at the Senate table was 1.3 per cent and 2 per cent respectively.
In these conditions, the European Commission calculates that public deficit will also represent 4,3% of the GDP the next year (of 3,9% planned by the Government) and 3,5% in 2012 (only 2,7%).
The roll of a new budget collective that could be placed after the feasts, for an amount of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new authenticity measures must be taken", the Commissioner considers economic affairs, Olli Rehn.
For time, Italy receives support from international institutions.
"The fundamentals of its economy are in order, and its accounts are good, we repeat it for a long time," ensures Arrigo Sadun, Italian administer to the International Monetary Fund for the FMI.
" There is no problem in the immediate, or on the short or long term, because, despite its major debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), it is less than those requested to other countries," says Pier Carlo Mauan, an economic director of the OCDE.
It remains the issue of political instability.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a census movement to the Chamber of Members, after which previous elections could be organized at the end of March.
In the case of serious crisis, there would be a short period of decision-making.
Europeans reflect on strengthening anti-crisis devices
Christine Lagarde still marched it last night in a press conference in Paris: "The Europeans, I believe that we have still shown it Sunday and night, are obviously solid, determined, engaged in defending their currency and their monetary area."
While any relative detention on the rates of European State obligations has brought water to the moulin of governments and the ECB.
But we can't even talk about a start of normalization.
The Standard & Poor's Rating Agency announced that it could degrad the debt note of Portugal, the most seen target today by speculating.
"In May there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, especially on banking systems," said Exane BNP Paribas's economicists.
More than "political time is much slow than market time".
Conscious of this heatus and the dangers that he resolves, European countries intensify the discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis devices.
Informal consultations between the Ministers of Finance, which are the most directly concerned and, widely, with their G20 partners will be good trained.
And this is also a view of meetings of the Eurogroup and the Ecofin of the beginning of the next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
In the menu, the type of non-conventional measures to support the countries of the euro area in the market collision (see above).
As regards the European Financial Stabilities Fund (FESF), its Executive Director Klaus Regling began march in Singapore to inform the extreme and eastern investors of crisis developments in Europe.
If the goal of these visits is not to bring funds, it will certainly prepare the field.
The first EDF Title emissions are expected in the next month.
Last, a official representative of the United States has granted the Reuters Agency that the United States will support a possible increase in the funds mobilized by a direct MFB ' s direct commitment.
Countries who are in the first line, Portugal and Spain learn to adopt structural reforms, including in the field of the organization of the labour market.
Reforms that are added to more closer austerity measures.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different way from Greece and Ireland.
One and the other are at all prices to avoid demanding international assistance before the establishment of their own budget corrections and decided to be necessary structural reforms to retain sustainable confidence.
In addition to European funds, finally, are on the options available to accelerate the normalization process of sovereign obligations.
On November 24, Axel Weber had the first advanced idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not be able to give the hand to the portfolio.
Barclays Capital economists, actor of all the first market plan of the European Sovereign Debt Debt, believe that a rail of approximately 100 billion euros would be sufficient, "of preference" in the form of direct liquidity injection.
The vehicle exists: this is the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, which is now $60 billion.
An advisory that has all opportunities to be carefully reviewed in European capitals.
Overall if the market conditions were implemented.
Need and legs: 24 departments in Oversight of Orange
Neglected episodes also generate difficulties in circulation, including on the secondary network in Britain, and risks to break some economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now monitoring for the risk of nest and swimming.
The Eure, the Eure and Loir, the Two Swedish and the Vienna, were added to the 20 Divisions already in the Dutch Monitoring, 18 from Monday after midday and two, Dordogne and Gironde, later in the night.
According to Meteo France, neighborhoods affect the northern of the Gironde and the Charentes, and he weakly shine on the island of France.
Near beds from 2 to 5 cm, pontually from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are the Charente, Charente-Maritime, Coasts d'Armor, Finist√®re, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou, and the regions of the Netherlands-Norwegian regions, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
Neglected episodes are sufficiently notable to generate difficulties in circulation and to defeat some economic activities, predicts Meteo France.
In the Coasts of Armar, several departments were prohibited to weight more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudeac axis.
The transportation of the secondary network in Britain is very difficult according to the gendarmes that recommend to take its vehicle only if necessary and the movement of certain TER cars has been suspended for the day.
School transports were prohibited for Thursday in Picardie.
No specific measure was considered on Wednesday night to restrict the movement of heavy weight.
The prefix "invites all automobilists to the most carefulness of the roads and to adapt their conduct accordingly".
The Civil Aviation Directorate-General (DGAC) requested the airlines to cancel 25% of their flights on the Paris airport of Roissy and 10% to Orly because of the falls to be broken.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their company.
In Great Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh, Scotia, is closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial skies
Since the debate around the modernization of transports in Ile-de-France slaughtered, billions smiles.
In the debate at least.
It is, in particular, 23 billion for the Grand Paris Metro that must build the Grand Paris Society.
To start this SGP, the State announced a capital of EUR 4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, this sum will then allow SGP to make markets a part of the financing of its double bottle.
Today, we are finally arrived at the first addictions.
The 2010 Rectificative Finance Act, reviewed in the Committee on Finance of the National Assembly this morning, contains the arrangements planned to find the start of this money.
They are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase in the office tax in Ile-de-France.
The first, read in the text of the draft law, article 15, is "to the benefit of the public establishment of the Grand Paris Society".
It is crypted, "The product of this tax is of 117 million euros per year".
The second is a re-employment of a office tax that already exists "to modernize it, to increase the product and to affect this increase in the Grand Paris Society".
How much would this report?
Mystery.
It is not encrypted in the text.
We're far from 4 billion.
"It is explicit that these tax resources are added to the $4 billion of capital funds that will be mobilized by the State and delivered to the Grand Paris Society at the flight and measure of the project," may be read in the explanation of reasons.
The SGP does not find this shocking system.
"After the income is created (the two taxes, ndlr), it is possible to cover studies over three years, then to cut into 4 billion after, it will be explained."
"This will be inscribed in the budget and shooted in the flight and measure."
The SGP believes that the four billion will begin to be registered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the promised 4 billion are still to the absent subscribed, is risked to cause a little angry parliamentary debate.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Hackers Vendors and Spyes in Diligence
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it appears a scandale appearing, a scandale that appears as a scandale only before the hypocrisis that controls the reports between States, citizens and presss.
On the other hand, it announces deep changes at the international level, and provides a future dominated by the rebellion.
But procedures by order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each dossier constituted by a secret service (something nation) is composed only of press cuts.
The American "extraordinary" revelations on the sexual habits of Berlusconi only make reports about what has been read in any daily newspaper (except those who Berlusconi is owned) and Khadafi's loading profile has been long for sketch cobart artists.
The rule that secret documents should not be composed of only new known is essential for the dynamic of secret services, not only in this century.
If you go in a library dedicated to hisocratic publications, you will see that each book repeated (to the Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, Templates or Rose-Croix) is exactly what was already written in previous books.
And this is not just because the author of ocult texts does not like to make inedual research (not know where to search for news about the non-exhibitant), but because those who want to go to the ocultism believe only to what they already know, and who confirms what they have already learned.
This is the mechanism of the success of Dan Brown.
Ideal for secret files.
The informer is worthy, and strict (or with a limited spirit) the chief of secret services (if I may, if I know, editor in Liberation), who retains as true as what it recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the American Ambassador in Rome sent to the State Department was the same as the newsweek's previous week.
So why have the revelations about these files so much sounded?
On the one hand, they say that every person culted already knows that the embassy, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the heads of State may call or take a flight to dinner, lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small representation exercises, have been transformed into a spy.
Any spectrum of research films knows this very well, and it's just through hypocrisis that it seems to be ignored.
However, the fact that it repeats it is publicly violated the duty of hypocrisis, and it serves to place the American diplomacy under a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that a hacker could capture the most powerful secrets of the world's most powerful state has an unnecessary case in the press of the State Division.
Thus the scandale does not put the victims as well as the "boreal".
But let's come to the deep nature of what happened.
So, at Olwell's time, we could design all power as a Big Brother that controlled each gesture of his subjects.
The Orelian prophecy was completely adverse since it was possible to control every movement through the phone, every transaction performed, the visited hotel, the buried car and so on, the citizens became the victim of the power's eyes.
But when it is shown, as this happens now, that even the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control report stops to be an unidirectional and become circulated.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least hacker, chosen as a citizen's venture, can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power who has no chance to keep his own secrets keep?
It is true, Georg Simmel said it already, that a real secret is a empty secret (and empty secret will never be declared); it is also true that everything about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually a white secret, because relevant of the public area; but revealing, as WikiLeaks did, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were white secrets means to remove him all power.
WikiLeaks did nothing wrong in Sarkozy or Merkel, but made too big in Clinton and Obama.
What will the consequences of this blessed blessure be inflicted to a very powerful power?
It is obviously clear that in the future, States will not be able to put any reservated information on the internet, and that would return to the publisher on a show covered at the round of the street.
But it is also obvious that with current technologies, it is only to expect to maintain confidential reports by phone.
It's more easy to find out whether and when a State head moved to a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved reports be entered in the future?
I know that at this time, my predict is from the science-fiction and therefore it is romantic, but I am obliged to imagine government agents who move discretely in diligences to uncontrolled itinerarys, not only tolerators of messages learned by heart, or, at least, to hide the rare information written in the house of a chassure.
The information will be stored in unique copy in key shots closed: on the ground, the Watergate's sponsoring attempt has been less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology is now advanced in crave, that is, to recule.
One centuries after the unfilled telegraph revolutionated communications, the Internet rebuild a son's telegraph (telephones).
Video boxes (analogue) allowed cinema researchers to explore a past film, going forward and back and discovering all the secrets of the mount, while now CDs (numbers) are only allowed to get out of chapter, i.e. by macro-portion.
With high speed trains, we go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while in the aircraft, and the movements that it includes, there are three hours and half.
It is therefore not extraordinary that the communication policy and techniques come back to horse vehicles.
A last observation.
On the other hand, the press tried to understand what happened in the secret of the embassy.
Now, these are the embassys who are requesting confidential information to the press.
Climate: how France takes its promises of financing
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to consider the compliance of rapidly discharged financing promises (the fast starting or early finances) carried out by the developed countries.
And the large French smuggles are revealed.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries were able to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has promised 7.2 billion euros in three years and France 1,26 billion euros (e.g. 420 million per year).
In the opening of the COP16, the EU made a great game to convince its partners in the reality of its commitment to fast funding: detailed report on the action of its Member States, press conference, large side event, distribution of brochures...
Transparency is worthy and worthy: developing countries and civil society would like that all developed countries have the same level of accuracy.
The EU announces that 2,2 billion euros were deployed in 2010, which is the right way to respect its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when we look at it in detail, things are more complicated.
This money must be, according to the Copenhagen Agreement, "new and additional" in order to ensure that additional efforts are made without being detrimental to the public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what it means "new and additional".
While the European Commission has proposed a harmonisation, some Member States of which France has blocked the procedure.
Today, each one chooses the most appropriate reference.
For example, the European Commission considered a reference in 2009: international funding is maintained and adds 150 million per three years under the fast starting financing.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or in terms of public development aid.
On the contrary, France believes that the financing of all the new projects in 2010 are "new and additional."
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of previous years or at the global level of public development aid.
Concretely, the total amount of France's support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), which aims at respecting its commitment to "new and additional financing" ...
Another crucial element, the distribution between donations and loans.
There is no rules and everyone chooses its calculation mode.
Some, like France, believed that 1‚Ç¨ was equated to 1‚Ç¨ given.
Of course, this is difficultly justified: efforts are not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are rewardable (e.g. projects related to the acceleration of emissions on more effective technologies), it is necessary to provide an euro that will be recovered as an euro equivalent to the amount of the amount given to the euro... However, it should not be accounted for its commitments only for the payment costs for the payment country (see the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has to do such reason: it "respect" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% of the loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of the donations (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to check yourself.
It is the only Union country to use as much as the loan.
Germany requires 46 per cent, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (e.g.) comply with their commitments with 100 per cent of donations.
On the other hand, when the large majority of the European Union takes 1‚Ç¨ to satisfy its commitment, France is only 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Nice password tour!
In its rapid financing, France works a double scroquency: one part on the development of the action in time and on the reality of the financial effort.
By expenditure only 36.1 million euros, it is possible to believe that it costs 420 million "new and additional" in accordance with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (for it seems well that it's Bercy who has done the arbitration) could have a dual negative impact, both within the EU (for the other Member States would continue to give if it's enough to provide it) and in negotiations as developing countries are not completely...
The chapter of previous financing is only a small, relatively short-term issue in terms of all climate discussions.
But it could be more swimming grain in the machine that is UNFCCC.
We hope that it's not the case.
Whatever it is, it is essential to take the lessons of this first year of pre-financing.
First, France could announce a change in its accounting mode for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and equity with the other countries of the European Union.
However, in particular, France could advance the discussions on long-term funding (another crucial chapter currently discussed): it will not be avoided by the issue of "additionality" or the mode of payment accountability.
France could change its position to become even progressist on these commitments as it is on others.
The hope, therefore, is about the new Minister of Environment, Ms. Kosciusko-Morizet, which will come to Cancun next week.
A surprising advertisement on the rapid start of France and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would be naturally increased the level of international confidence necessary to progress in discussions.
Child-in-child pesticides warning
A 10-year-old child in a day of 81 different chemical substances, according to a study published this mercredi of the Generations Futures Association (ex-Move for the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which expects that its results "not have significant statistical value in view of the low number of analyzed samples but are illustrative of the treated problem," purchased the foods generally consumed in four feet and a incapacity in a day by a child of a decade of years in the Ocean and Paris supermarkets.
These types of food, including official recommendations - five feed and feed fruits, three milk products and 1,5 litres of water per day, as well as colds, have been examined by laboratorys to search for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The asylum balance is suitable: 81 chemical substances whose 42 are classified cancer cancer and five cancer-classified substances, as well as 37 substances that may act as endocrinic disorders (PE), according to studies of several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"If, almost all of the cases, the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, our investigation is well viewed that the reality of the exposure of consumers to pollutants is possiblely concerned with cancer and/or PE," notes the association.
For the small dinner, bourre and the tea in milk include only one ten of possible cancer residues and three addicts such as some cancers, as well as near a twenty-first of residues that may be cutting the hormonal system.
The poom, which was imported from Brazil, as set by the study, presents traces of six chemical substances which are still banned in France.
Even something for the green tissue of Kenya, including in the dinner, on which the study has detected traces of a powerful insekticidate prohibited in the EU.
Furthermore, the shocked steak, the boxe thon, and even the bread bag and the sweet shoeting ghost were truffed by pesticides and other chemical substances.
The analysis showed the presence of nitrates and cloroforms in the robin water.
To dinner, the saumon steak was the most "rich" with 34 detected chemical residues and even the examination of the plastical assistant used to refrigerate the food to the microwave was not exempt.
The final risk for the consumption of this "contamination cocktails" is probably underestimated, according to the study.
The European Ecology and Greens Association (EE-LV), on his side, proposed "face to the emergence of the situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop "the increase in civilization diseases".
In July, a study of the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) identified the presence of 365 different pesticides identified in the fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
