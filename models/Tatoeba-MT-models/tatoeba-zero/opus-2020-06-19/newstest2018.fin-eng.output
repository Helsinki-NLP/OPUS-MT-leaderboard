Camille Auer wanted to correct his family, diagnosis, and now he makes an art of the subject -- "The man should have the right to his own body."
Imageidide acate project room gallery rings ten reports of patients.
Each of them reads Cam Auer's name.
The papers tell a multiannual history of how foreign people have written up their interpretations from Auer and this identity.
They decided who he is.
"I would like to tell a person about my history of treatment so that the violence of the process should be visible," says Auer.
He's referring to the sexual correction process.
It is often a sustainable study period with physicians, psychology, physicians and physicians.
The process is starting by launching the diagnosis of the "skin" diagnostics carried out in Tampere and Helsinki.
The process was started four years ago.
Before this, he had been used through the Internet to place strogens and, in other words, was very long in his own correction process.
He tried to be a woman, but, according to the Finnish law, a person must be visited through the correction process to enable sex to be corrected legally.
Translation, or transsequent transsection of the sex of sual (563/2002), is obligation to transsome people to pack up so that the right sex is obtained, for example, towards the population recruitment and pass.
Clearly, every sex is required by psychiatric diagnostics and proof inadequacy.
People have the right to decide on their own body.
"This situation is insensitive and harmful of human rights," says Auer.
Transla's reform has been discussed in Finland for a long time.
The United Nations Human Rights Council has given eight comments, and the European Court of Human Rights has a preliminary decision to bind the parts of the European Convention on Human Rights to comply with the self-determination rights.
The Finnish previous Government has prepared a law amending the Ministry of Social and Health to the leadership of Susanne Huovise.
The rulers and the basic Somalias came to the government.
Now, the change of law is back in deceased.
This is about internal political disputes that have not even been involved in this law.
"The issue does not want to raise it on the table, because the government has differences in change of law," reports Director of the Finnish Division Frank Johansson.
The front part of the display is controlled by two large installations.
Another of these is the packaging and use of Auer’s medicines.
In patients reporting, each event can read, for example, from Auer’s psicology skin of the University of Tampere’s university hospital.
Psychology met Cam to Auer twice and wrote a report that should be defined for the treatment of the Auer’s court and for help.
The reality of the investigation seems to be incredible to the shock.
The consideration of the investigation itself appears in a way of slow-scale of insufficient dimensions related to personality.
Auer didn't recognize himself of these descriptions.
"I was angry to hear that I was diagnosed as a psychopathy," Auer says.
Another more confusion was when Auer was not granted to sexual correction.
According to the Directorate-General, his power was not sufficient to initiate the process.
He was forbidden by his own identity.
Then, 11 February 2015, Auer walked out and shooted a transpolis waiting television in the shock.
Later, from that television, the artthesis was named Monument for the Excluded, where Auer reflected his experience of power and use.
"I'm awesome that every person defined as a woman in the birth can enhance its strike, but the removal of the beach needs diagnosis," says Auer.
Your body is not your own, if you try other than the number of your family defined in your birth.
Unfortunately, the experience of the sun is not the only quality.
The sexual correction process is for many more painful reasons than because of clean medical operations.
They will meet ten people who have to establish their own existence and have the right to go on their sex.
"I'm awesome that people who are helping and helping in need are being treated, so that they don't get sufficient to their power", says Auer.
Many of the processes have psychological symptoms: depression, disorder, possible relief trials.
In these substances, the Hospital Office may determine that the treatment cannot be initiated.
"The prevention of treatment and assistance can eat humans to the worst situation than it was before the process started," Auer says.
The own exhibition of the Sun also treats pain and thoughts of self-mortality.
Auer's exhibition text writes: "I have had self-respective thoughts throughout my age and it is what people are usually hard to smell."
The dose has been treated in medicines and when Auer started using hormones, the condition was easy.
He was finally able to say the knowledge that had been already in the child and the teenage.
The reason why the wide shoes did not feel appropriate to their own body, and why the skin of the meat came to be swimming instead of the skin.
The main thing to Auer was that he was close to people who see him.
It's a basic need for the coming of the meetings.
"It's going to be based on such a lot by talking, smoking, voice and movement," he says.
Today, Auer has experienced the future, and she is a woman.
However, at the beginning of the process, nearly hundreds of comments could have caused a lot of damage.
It's most harmful when nearby wrong-doers.
"They should know, and they know who I am, but do not agree or can't enter it," he continues.
However, all transisms do not want physical changes.
They do not suffer from physicsphore, such as body or parts of their body may cause pain and even physical pain.
However, without the use of hormones and long study process, it may not be officially confirmed to its own sex.
"These studies have no medical grounds," Auer says.
And it's true.
For example, in the Denmark adopted a new procedure in June 2014 for the recognition of the sex of the laws.
New legislation is based on self-determination rights in respect of the sex of the court.
The full-year-old applicant makes a new request for a new personality, telling it his experience of being another sex.
After a period of consideration, the applicant confirms its application in writing and the Ministry gives the applicant a new personal recognition.
This self-determination right is also required in Finland and is also grateful for the presentation of the Auer.
It was not an artist's trial of therapy, but the show is a political and artificial collection.
I want to believe that art has still a weight and that it can make political changes during the time that politicians have forgotten human rights.

The National Rights Organization gave a travel warning to Missouri
An African national NAACP civil rights organization has given Missouri a travel warning because they have disregarded practices and racist attacks.
"The travel information on the NAACP shall enter into force 28.8.2017, and it is called for African tourists, visitors and local visitors to take particular attention and to respect the extreme care when travelling in the State where a number of events based on the race has recently occurred."
In Missour, the law has been in force to difficulty exports of discrimination cases, and also the implementation of the State law is relatively reduced. According to the NAACP, these issues caused the delivery of travel warning.
"The rights of the citizens are injured.
They are stopped on the basis of the skin color, and they are ill or killed,” the President of the NAACP's Missour said to the Kansas City Star magazine.
"We haven't heard about a lot of cases in the same short time."
Missouri travel information is the first warning of the United States of the United States.
The system mentioned an example of the racist comments submitted against African students at the Missouri University, as well as from Tennessee to the death of the black-western Tory Sanders of 28 years of age.
Sanders died in the situations of the past year, and he was driving through the state when his car ended the fuel, and the Missour police arrested him, although he wasn't accused of a crime.
The travel information was also referring to the Minister of Justice of Missour, which indicates that the police stops the black driver by 75% probably more likely than the white.
"The purpose of the information is to encourage people to be safe and warned by their nature, friends and working partners to what can happen in Missour," said Chapel.
"Thank must be prepared, for example, by taking money for payment of fees or by telling the parents that they want to travel through the State."
According to the FBI, in Missour, hundreds of wines were written in 2015, or more than sixty-year US States.
Travel advertising is also the response to the new Missour Act, which is difficult to develop enterprises with the right to enter into account and working relations with discrimination apparently.
The ACLU, which guarantees the fundamental law of citizens, recently provided travel warnings in Texas and Arizona after accepting immigration laws which are able to arrest the police of immigration agreements.
In general, travel warnings are published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other States, but recently, citizens' organizations have been published as a response to certain laws and development plans in the United States.
Over: Lithuania requested a report from the Additional Director of the Finance
For the purposes of this Regulation, the Commission shall not be aware of the fact that, in the case of the Member States of the European Union, the Commission shall be able to ensure that, in the case of the aircraft’s ownership, it is noted that, in the case of the aircraft’s ownership, it is noted that the company’s owner of the State's owners, the owner Mika Lintilla (see p. 1) has requested a report on the additional payment of the airport company, and that the company has been granted to the Commission.
According to the Minister, it is a conflict with the State's willing declaration.
The additional rate of EUR 130,000 from the Vauramo has risen this week, when Helsinki reported that the payment development of the company leaders was made.
Finnish Description has been newsed from Vauramo's Additional Chronicles in February.
Finnair reported that it would be delayed in 2013.
The State has been linked to not to be used for the payment of additional items.
The government belongs to Finnaire over half.
According to the company, the decision is on line with the principle decision on the ownership of the last year.
The packages accepted the talks immediately
Another time ago it seemed that the relationship between the United States and Russia is on the way to fridge.
The President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who met with the G20 industry meeting in Hampur, showed the future report.
That's why the tunnel has remained significantly.
In the last week of the United States Congress and in the midweek of Trump, the new economic sites signed were fully reacted in Russia.
Another important answer is the Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedevi, which states that the committee signed by Trump means "complete trade war".
Although Russian reactions would only be referred to as political restrictions and overwhelmings, the celebration between the United States and Russia is true after a short month after the election of Trump.
In the United States, there was no simply transition of the compulsory law on Russia, Iran and North Korea.
Indeed, the Congress adopted the law as a considerable harmonization, but the adoption of the law to the President was significantly more difficult.
Trump also criticizes its signing the Law "the lack of significance".
Mr President Trump has been particularly reasonable, especially for Russia, although the adoption of its own rights should also have been contrary to the law of restricting the law.
As well known in the United States, Russia's investigation is used as far as possible on the Presidential shippings as with the Russian campaign of Trump.
The clergy between the United States and Russia is actually after a short month of harvest.
When the White House's staff has changed to the strange and different scandale translations, it is still clear that the external policy is not to do in the United States, but to the President.
This is not hopeful in any of the names.
If Russia's relationship is a chemical in the United States, it is also the same as the European Union.
In addition to the balances, your security situation in the Union's nuclear areas has also been deceived in Austria.
The EU has apparently shown the situation of Ukraine in its Russian relations and requested the Minsk Agreement.
Although the Union has remained in its Russian policy at least in the main part of the main part, the attractions of the Member States are particularly different.
The economic packages, such as the Finnish Russia, have been real strict.
The effects of the United States shipping law are still doubtful.
The EU has feared that the packages will be difficult to work in many European enterprises.
Finnish effects may, for example, feel in the North Stream 2. Gasbuilding project as well as possible in the Fenno-Fenno force project.
The disappearance in Europe has caused the abandonment of the fleet outside, for example, of the importance of liquid gas for the United States economy.
Trade packages are a way in the world policy to demonstrate a bad way.
However, economic responsibilities must be a very analysis and attentive.
On the other hand, it is easy to handle more than benefits.
Isn't there any more holy?
Trump's White House is now in the Star of Liberty Passa
The lack of stocks is certainly a sign of the revolution.
Americans know it as well as others: the Iraqi people fell together with the American soldiers of Saddam Hussein in the opening of Firdon in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the main ideas of Trump's administration, knew well what he had done in a pleasant statement with the CNN channel Jim Acost. The liberty passah was the subject of Miller's attack in the sight of Miller, which slowly reduced legal immigration.
Miller isn't grateful for yourself.
If he had done so, he would have received the magnificent wheels of the organizers of the riders and the exciting pieces of freedom.
His attack was a point of significance, and especially that in 1903, Emma Lazarus was added to his legs after 17 years of preparation.
This is what Miller said, "I don't want to go to his history, but the Liberty Patsa is... the symbol of the world's lighting American freedom.
Runo was later added, and it does not belong to the original Liberty Passage."
Miller wasn't wrong with you, but it's not just the story, as he himself said.
Of course, the words of Lazarus, the only quality in which the State is not called immigrants but the "poorest poorest": "Your tired, your poor, / Your wealthy massas announcing to breathe free, / The wretched rejection of your theme shore."
Runo is more time than ever.
Miller did not have a literature criteria, and he clearly made that "the poorests" are not welcome to the United States of Trump.
The significance of freedom is part of a broader political and cultural aspect of the importance of the United States.
Lazarus’s friends were camping after his death in order to be shocked on his feet, and they knew that the work was strongly political.
Patsa was the purpose of expressing the relationships of the French and American Republic in classic comparisons, women’s physical exercising freedom.
Lazarus changed its significance: Nashihamm is no longer abstract, but it has a voice.
And it gives himself a new name: a fleet mother.
The integration of the routine was a nervous feministic struggle and a destructive attack against the American nationality.
Lazarus changed the significance of the throat, and the court has already wanted to change it back to the original.
Rush Limbaugh, a designer that can now be considered as a sign of Trump, said in 2010 that the Freedom Patsa is not to give any call, but it is a pre-new conservator who brings the United States to smile the dark world: "Lady Liberty's stands out.
He's bringing free from the United States to the other world.
It doesn't look like a way to the United States."
I'm sorry, Limbaugh was in part right.
The significance of freedom depends on the entire view.
Lazarus saw it as the poor and smiling, but the hopeless immigrants were on the side of the ship and tried to travel.
He saw it protection and a better view of people who looked for life.
His freedom will rejoice by giving hope and hope to be welcome.
And Miller and Trump aren't going to want any case.
They don't seem to be the way, but smiling the hair, their only source of power.
Surrounding MM competitor 2017: Neil Black overcome the skotlanian members of the skotlanian group
Eilidh Doyle remembers the time when only two scotts reached the Ison-Brittanian country team
The resulting director of the Britannic Agency of Sports, Neil Black, states that the 16-scotic members of the world's majority civilians participating in the world's civilians are a "reforcing".
Thursday, in London, the MM competitors of general sport have been selected to skotlane sports.
Black says that in Scotia "I'm going to happen a special thing," which the general sport of the United Kingdom must learn.
"This is healthy, and we will continue to investigate it so long as we understand what the question is," says Black.
"I discussed with representatives of the Scotia Sport Institute, and they believed that it was involved in the activities of the institution.
Scotland's general sport unit reiterates that it is involved in the activities of the Agreement,
and the United States of the United States of the United Kingdom believes that it has their activities.
And the normal ruder is thinking that he must have something to do with this.
But there's something that's very wonderful, then what it causes."
Many scot Sports competite in London in their reality of metals, such as Laura Mur, and Andrew Butchart, who competes with Sir Mo Farrah at 5000 meters. Eilidh Doyle was selected as a capital of the country.
"Elidh is unrequisite.
His captain's speech was unbelievable," Black says.
"Organists removed the opportunity from their proud achievements and strongly motivated independence on where they live and practice.
I've said Ilidh had true feeling and intoxicating the sport."
Eilidh Doyle is a golden massage of the United Nations civilians at 400 meters (400 m) away, and these are his fifth worldwide committee. He thinks that it's "innocent," that the country team has 16 skots.
Previous preview was seven years from 1983 and 2015.
The Middle East drinker Laura Mur has been drinking for five years in Ison-Britannia and two European prejudices.
He's competitive in London at 1,500 metres and 5000 meters.
Chris O'Hare travels in London at 1,500 meters. It also supports him with the eye: a man has a great time of winning in the MM-Carsino of Ison and Anniversary Games.
Doyle recalls his first world mastership, where the only skoke to the country's team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the world is saying that there are so many scotts that are really competitive with finances and metalls.
"The access is, however, great honor, but more specially it is because the members of the country team have voted to the Captain," says Doyle.
"I'm certainly very proud of all the skots that have come to the country team.
It shows how long we've been.
They are together as sports who competite for rewards.
Captain's talk?
I think it's all right.
I thought how happy we were when we had homes.
It is important to enjoy the support of the home membership and that we are again in the Olympic Stadiums.
I'll get another chance to competite there and I know that air clouds will be an intelligence."
Prevention of valuers in Facebook: Don't be set to the public office if you don't keep critical
Our father knew what's bad public.
Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers immediately began to appreciate him from all possible homes of political principles always to his political principles.
I'm sure that the critical physician was a doctor.
But he didn't quit his appealers.
"If the freedom of speaking is removed, we will be able to lead as slow and silent as the sheep to torment", said Washington in 1783.
That's what we're coming to the head of Maryland to Larry Hogan, which should be learned from Washington.
Hogan's staff has removed at least 450 comments from his official Facebook page and prevented them.
The United States Citizens' Rights Alliance has dismissed Hogan's right last week.
His staff's challenge is not fundamental, and the relationship was also reduced in the network.
"What's the matter? This is just Facebook." Many comments.
But there's a meaning in this matter.
Especially in the case of Hogan.
Hogan is a surprising representative of the Government of Democratic States.
He's got the second best observations of the 50-hour-leading team.
Hogan is not quite reacting to the warm.
He has been stablely leading to the State and holding the principles strictly.
He has also used the Facebook as the main contact channel of its voters and published the image in the chemotherapy.
Therefore, the prevention of future users on the Facebook page is unnecessary and even dangerous. The page of the Secretary is public and official forum that his staff will handle on taxes.
Amelia Chasse, a reporter of Hogan, defended the President's action in the debate given to Washington Post, and he said that it was only about the moderatory of comments.
However, it is too easy to develop comments as troll, slower or hatred.
Washington Post has discussed Hogan's Facebook users.
They proved to be normal people who wanted to discuss with the leaders of their choice, not trolls, for example, teachers, trials and pastors.
They told them that their comments were respectful, appreciative and interesting.
The pastor led his comments in the Bible; he wanted to join Hogan’s Catholic faith.
The questionnaire Lakshmi Sarma Ramani Maryland's Bowie was not enemy but made a question on the wine.
“I was deceived by the fact that Hogan didn't have taken up to wine and other recent news,” he wrote in the comments of Washington Post.
"I can't also accept that, when more people comment on the same matter, they are immediately considered as an organized group and are set up as a large group of citizens concerned."
The Director's staff called comments "concentrations" and some other might call them to promote important matters.
The message during the Facebook period is easy to control by preventing or eliminating critical comments.
Before the old, the staff should be sent to gather and smoke a newspaper that had been published in critical statements, or to arrest and shut up the publishers.
However, it is really the same matter, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first public officer who was accused of distorting the Facebook and other social media channels.
The president Trump's Twitter users have seen him in the court.
The first important decision was given in Virginia last week.
According to the Court of Justice of Alexander James C. Cacheriis, the Government of Loudou's circle was the first addition of the United States Constitution by hindering the voter in Facebook.
And the United States Citizens Rights Union was discussing the use of Twitter and Facebook by the Deputy Republic of Kentucky.
This shouldn't be hard.
During Washington, the evil post payments had similar effects as today on the Internet.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers quartered, and the unnamed writers moved to Washington.
That's what I'm saying.
The names of Juricola, Valerius, Belizeriaus and Portius wrote letters to the newspapers where they called Washington’s decisions.
The President's office was referred to by Jay's agreement, or between the United States and the United States of Cooperation, Trade and Sea Trade Agreement, which is reported on the documentation of the George Washington Network project.
However, he did not stop his viewers.
Freedom of the Word, freedom of opinion and freedom of discussion are fundamental to our nation.
The real leadership means accepting this fact.
Sounds of birds are the reason to stop right now.
The spectrums have come from about ten places, and also the net notifications of a couple, three.
Not most of them have come from the South and Varsinais Summit, but then individuals from Haapaved and Sieneje, specialist Marja Isomursu Evir.
Vierpeipot died for tricommonosis.
It causes scientist named Trichomonas gallinae.
It has previously been known to skins, and especially to the skin.
However, in the centuries of the 2000s, the diseases also began to be observed by peppolins.
In 2009, it was worthy.
Then tricomonosis caused the zy-romage in the Finnish viar powder, after which the species had been drunk behind.
The diseases have now been, but not at least in a slightly shock, Helsinki University’s Natural Center Museum (Luomus) tells Master Johan Honkala.
It is fearable that the previous epidemic of the skin will be renewed if something is done.
What we need to do now is a very simple thing that can do every one: stop the cold summer immediately.
Add the subject later.
Ronan Rafferty hopes his benefit from home-based vision with Renaissance Club
The next three days, when Renaissance Club in Eastern Lothian, 25 Scotland senior Open Turning, is an ex-European one player, Ronan Rafferty.
The Northern Law Rafferty led in the neighbourhood of Archerfield Links in the past year before the last round, but finally lost Paul Eales. Rafferty has been pleased in the new place and operates a tour for the founder of the club and director Jerry Sarvad.
"I observed the construction of the Renaissance Club, and after this event, it's going to be full of its glory," Rafferty says.
"That's the best thing to see the field, it's fine.
Jerry's done a great job with this place.
He's a joyful sender of the game, and he's proud of his dose here.
Turnance is a great state of presentation in this field."
The English Eaux is the first time to defend masterity, although it has been able to gain a 32-year-old urge as well as to European and European disadvantages.
"This is really a special opportunity," says the player in Southport.
"I'm not allowed to defend my victory of Extremadura Open, because the round does not belong to the round this year.
It's great to come back here.
This is a great place to play golf.
Remembers have come back in the last few years: the shift was a wonderful thing for me and my wife to Sharon.
It was a great time we'll always remember."
Gary Orr returns to the real work in his own land, and he went to the rounds that had been filled this year 50 years ago.
This is his first event in Skotlania, 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Touring.
"Against playing is always the most common one", says Orr, who lives in Helensburg.
"You want to succeed but you also feel more pressure.
I enjoyed playing again and playing time strongly.
"I'm satisfied with my game until now."
The third is to follow the field of the former Masters Prime Minister Ian Woosnamin and the largest artists, Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
In the tour there are six scouts: Orr and former captain Ryder Cup, Sam Torrance, and Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAlister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The car stopping is paying five pounds if there's only a driver, and a ten punch if you have at least two people in the car.
All the products are given to the Prostate Cancer UK Summer Organization.
In the sample, there were possible input problems in the internal climate.
In the sleeves of Pori Priccat, the construction of the carriage company of the Communication Company has not been found at least the internal problems found, the pricks were reported in the tours.
Internal investigations are continued.
The explanations began when a man stopped his health career because of the bad inner of the carpet.
Finally, the Chairman of the Chairman's Chairman Mika Holman said that no problems have been found in the health situation of other insurances.
It appeared that there was an individual status in this case, and other services did not have healthy problems.
Each report is seriously addressed and we wanted to find out this matter basically.
Now there's no idea that we have nothing to do with internal climate, Holma says.
In the precautional information, it is said that, as a result of the arrival of July, the arms had to be transferred to the goods, so that the polarity has been able to increase in the moment.
The air has been able to affect it, Holma says.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian golden country
Bardina Degei doesn't use it in the food plant.
He's shocking, but he's just useful.
Degei is living in the bowl in Enarotal, the capital of the Pania, which is located in the Indonesian province of Papua. When he prepares daily, he generally sets a battle – locally "no" – directly its coming.
After an hour of time, the battle returned to the cart to eat swimmingly, unclean hands.
There are no rooms in Degey home, and it is sit on a different farm, where he generally handles the daily steps, such as the nearby swimming pool in the swimming pool in the water.
The office of the shooting office is delivering a shuttle in the unexpected room.
Degei is four of his young husband's wife, and he hasn't been able to handle the games.
There's a general marriage here.
Labour may be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed, and many drinks, and the soldiers must also be taken into account.
"No one's going to walk in the village after five nights," Degei says.
This is a rare decline in the top of Papua, first in the Dutch movement, which was linked to Indonesia in 1969.
The Hungarian authorities opposed the local self-respect translated rapidly to the government of Jakarta, which holds the region strictly in its governance and prevented the access of foreign providers and human rights assistants.
In 2003, the province was officially shared to Papua and the West Papua.
Anarotale is distant and trick. The path begins from half an hour to flight from the capital of Jayapur, Province, and continues to swimming five hours in the car hill.
There's no public traffic here.
About 19,000 people live in the city, there are pools of bamboo trees with a swimming swimming snake.
Only rare Indonesians have come here without talking about transmissioners and foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, Papua Mee Pago worshiped the divine Uga Tamee.
Another change has happened.
"We didn't have such clothes," Degei says. He means a color, sweet hands of its swimming head, darkness, and slight color.
"After we had just a newspaper in our guards."
Papua is the most poorest province of Indonesia, 28 per cent of its populations live on the lower border of poverty, and children’s mortality and disorder are the highest of Asia.
But it's also the Indonesian golden country.
The pania is designed to be the top area of New Jersey, which is 153.000 inhabitants. Only a hundred miles from Pania is Grasberg, the largest and produced gold shop. It owns Freeport McMoran company, where the home is Phoenix in the United States.
In 2015, the coffee produced for Freeport $3.1 billion from the prices and kitchen.
Furthermore, Papua has estimated 78 billion dollars of forests.
However, these riches of Papel, because they mean the shocking presence of the Indonesian army.
New York Times announced in 2005 that Freeport was paying the local military personnel and the military military units for almost $20 million in 1998-2004. The individual officers were even paid to $10,000.
The requirements of a larger self-determination rights threaten this source of income, and they will be respected to mercy.
According to human rights activists, the Indonesian army has killed more than 5000,000 priests and rape, murdered and imprisoned thousands.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the trials of Papua’s families in the 1970s have resulted in the measuring proportions of the people's murder.
Last year, Indonesia’s police arrested over 3 900 people in peaceful presses.
From 2016 We Will Lose Everything is reporting about the sentences of the past year, such as tsunami without census, complaints – rape and electronic companies are specially recommended means – and regulating attacks towards peaceful effects.
"The calculation of the number of new things is difficult because the cases aren't weekly," says Andreas Harsono, the Indonesian student of the Human Rights Watch Organization.
The grain has been covered when the natural resources of Popea are cut from other Indonesians.
83 per cent of the people in Province is Christians, but the population structure has changed when the Indonesian cities from Jaavan, Borneon, Sumatra and Sulawes are changing muslims to the region in hope of the better income of the muslims.
Javaian warning feeds are sold by grain and gal-gaga-proliferation in the landscape.
The locals are hard to competite.
"News have started to sell channels and hate towers with more than local", says Abeth You, 24-year-old, who is home from Pania and has changed to the capital city of Province.
"Time women lost their customers."
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo – his favorite Jokowi – allowed the lack of injustices for Papua and human rights traders in 2014.
Papua consists of 29 regions, and this former tree wins a vote in 27 regions, including in Pania, on the way to the President of Jakarta.
But just a little changed in Papua, and the locals feel their arrival as a request.
"We were smelling because we voted Jokowi in 2014 and we expected him to fill our hopes and restore justice," you say.
The panies were tested only two months after the officials of Jokow.
The only ten children were sing of Christmas songs from Enarotal in Enarotal 7.12.2014, when the darkness appeared in two Indonesian soldiers in motorcycles.
The scared kids told the soldiers that they should use driving lights.
One of the other soldiers had no comment, and the local pastor Yavedt Teba said that the man returned to the place with four soldiers.
According to the reports of the victims and the Witnesses, the soldiers slaughtered the children, and worried about these injuries.
So one of the wars shot the kids.
One of the 16-year-old children, Yulianus Jaimo, tried to smell as a result of the painfulness.
A couple of hours later, the building of the government’s shipment, located near the event place, was established, and on the next day the event began.
About thousands of priests, young men and women, as well as children, gathered up to the footsteps of the local police office and the military commander’s law.
They were together with the forests designed to celebrate, and they began to present the traditional waiting dance of the Popua Mee Pago family, where they were danced in ring and followed the bird single.
Some of the instincts began to struggle the police and military buildings.
When the tunnel of my clouds, the soldiers got an internal radiosystem order: "If human forces do more than three times opposed, shoot them dead." The information is based on the TIME magazine to see an official document that has not been published for local information instruments.
Jeremiah Kayame, 56. The director of the area of Kego Koto, opened the ruining of the situation and asked the people to be calmed and return to their homes.
Nobody wanted to listen.
"When I turned around, I was shooted on the left coast," he told the TIME newspaper as a brilliant color of its landscaped trees.
He still don't know who shooted him, but the shooting came from the army line.
"A number of shocks were shocked in the shock."
Alfius Youwi was shocked three times.
"I checked to him and assured that it was really she," told John to the TIME magazine. In many Indonesians, he only used the same name.
"That she was dead, I sweared him."
Pope Police Counsellor Yotje Mende told the employees that the police only "protected" the police position because it was an attack.
"We must defend when people threaten to kill us," Padjo Sulistayo reported in 2015.
"There is about life and death."
According to the Human Rights Watch Organization, five young men were killed, and many were assaulted.
The information about the murder was held on Jakara on the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi felt a conversation in Jayapur, in which he expressed his parts to the families of victims and promised that Papua’s violence would be defeated.
"I hope that the case is immediately investigated so that it will never happen anymore."
In October 2016, Vianto, Minister of Security, said that he would start the conclusions of human rights laws outside the legal system.
However, she began to turn on his conversations immediately.
"The majority of the crimes has occurred long ago,
In the 1990s and in the beginning of the 2000s.
The main thing is that we have decided to investigate crimes, but it is necessary for certain processes," he said.
In the TIME magazine in Jakarta 5.6.2017 Wiranto had already changed his mind. He said he didn't want to start findings in Papua.
"It's all going to be out in justice," she told.
The United Nations condemns Wiranto “criminality”. Crimes relate to the death of thousands of people in the East Timor's bloody self-respect in 1999.
The families of the victims in panii are uncomfortable to defense.
"I have been discussed four times in the last year, but things have not been advanced in any way," says John.
"I've already been crazy with this."
She's still telling her life in fear, even though it's been a year ago.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I think the army's arresting me, I'm afraid we're gonna shoot me."
His brother Jacob confirms that the panians are not slow to discuss the event.
He says that the soldiers were worse to him when he had helped to kiss four victims.
"The soldiers are looking for me after the burning of the victims," he says.
The teams haven't finished.
In the meantime, Indonesian police shot villages in the Neighbourhood of Pania in Deiya.
One died and 17 was blessed between the leader of the villages and the construction company, which was starting when the director refused to lose a man’s hospital.
He was 24-year-old Ravianus Dow, who was shocked with water when he was shooting in a neighborhood. He died on the way to the hospital.
The hate villages were likely to be presented in the construction country in front of the company's office.
According to the police, villages were struck by police who responded to warnings.
Nevertheless, the police office that moved by the Indonesian family police opened the population to a village where one died.
"We're in our fear, we're afraid of cost," says Dominggu Badi, 29-year-old, who lives near the hospital and saw when he was injured to the treatment.
"I'm hiding at home two days."
The Deiya Parliament has requested shocks to shoot the police responsibilities and to remove the police unit from the region.
The Pania has always been the issue of the Indonesian government.
The lack of real development was uncomfortable in the homes of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, which live in the Middle East of Papua.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation movement (OPM), the rebellious army who claims to defend the rights of the papians in a degrading attack and in the struggle of Indonesian military soldiers.
Some of the OPM leaders are Pania, such as Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
The army has responded to his country by arresting and imprisoning thousands of people in Pania in the name "Strong National Sovereignty Safety".
Some arrested ones will never return.
In the Middle of Papua, Pania is known as "something, forgotten place".
Poverty eats unpleasantness.
There's only a little bit to sell in the emergency, and it's too expensive to locals,
It's like a bread.
Many will grow up their own food: mainly battles and some fruits and lenses.
It's a woman's job, and one woman's responsibility may have four or five battle games.
The majority of the hundreds is to the family, and the ends are sold on the store.
Ten bathrooms pay only 10 000 rupias (75 cents).
The differences in local and changers have grown in the latest, and the number of changers has grown after opening new routes to the Nabire airport.
Employment is a little, and they are generally going to locally for better educational and acquiremental changers.
Only a rare clergy has sufficient capital and a shared share in the company's competitiveness.
"The people don't want to stay in the village because there's no work and no money here," says President John Gobai, President of the Pania's home Council.
The disadvantaged Papua remains in the world with little attention.
Moreover, the restrictions on international newspapers are still strict.
Previously, the French suppliers Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were disfellowshipped by Papuel, although they had been granted a rare description, and the official reason for the incapacity of cooperating with local institutions.
According to Phelim Kne, President of the Human Rights Watch Organization, Jokowi has not had the right freedom, and he has not increased transparency and did not promote development by eliminating the limitations of the news.
"A new risks for the Indonesian provinces of Papua and Western Papua are: the expansion of the visa and the black list."Kine stated in its opinion.
The lack of the freedom of activity of the newspaper means that the Indonesian government only pressures the nearby Papua.
In March, six of the Pacific states — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Saars and Solomon Saars – encouraged the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate the “displayed and wide crimes”, as well as the Pania shooting case.
These States have also supported the freedom of Papua.
Arrmanatha Nasir, an Indonesian Foreign Minister, declared the accused and reported to the employees in Jakarta that "Indonesia is still a democracy with freedom of publicity, so the fact that the evidence of human rights forces would be difficult."
The locals want that the governments of the Foreign Governments are missing.
When the official delegation of Holland, the Chief of Human Rights Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapur, 4.5.2017, the locals dismissed silence and expressed their desire to freedom, telling the permanent source of meeting.
The Presidents in Indonesia have 2019, but the Popeans say that they are probably not voted by Jokowi.
"Another means good, but there are people around him who have been shooted in Pania's shooting point," says President Gobai.
He wants Jokowin to know the situation of panians: they live under the unprecedented and unprecedented army in the lack of and poverty, in practice, without health care and training opportunities.
According to Goba, the panians, like other papians, like Jokow's voice of "privacy", which must be paid back.
"They don't want money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and fears, the victims of Pania’s shooting had again reflected in comparison: they slaughtered one of the victims of the police office and the army officers in the country.
They know that they may not ever receive justice, but at least they do not let the responsible ones not forget their crimes.
"My family members were killed," Jacobus says in the press.
"What else can we do?"
Dereck Chisora shouted about the breakdown of the Robert Helena's renovation debate: "If the own fans don't want to see."
Robert Helenius and Dereck Chisura were intended to take up on 27 May in the Hartwall Area.
However, the struggle was decreased for commercial reasons.
Chisora is driving in the IFL TV conversation because of the flowing of the renewal to the hearts of Helenius.
I've been fighting in Finland, but it wasn't my fault.
I don't live in Finland. I don't want to sell bands there.
That's why I was a Finnish opposer.
Before his fans, they don't want to see him take care, because he's crazy, Chisora's kidding.
Helenaus and Chisora first met in the Hartwall Area in December 2011.
Helenaus wins the battle with a shocked punishment.
The renewal of the renewal has been shocked, and his promotor Nisse Sauerland told the night-zanome in May that the fight has been moved to the syxy.
There's no new part of the fight.
However, the corruption of Chisor is no longer harmful.
The struggle would, of course, be held to eliminate every case in Chisor's disease.
Torstaina, three days prior to the battle period, I was raised in pain.
My tiny was on the explosion of your life.
In the hospital, it was said that I had to shut up, Chisora tells me.
Britt says he's got about 45 percent in this moment.
He is not all about the interesting renovation with Helenus, but the star is Dillia Whyte.
Chisora suffered because of the murder in December.
I came to repeat your power in Duba, the Torch Palm League.
In Duba's Sunday, the largest residential building in the world was able to run 337 meters from the 79 higher building.
This was already one of the other fires within two years in the building, which is the name of Torch.
The structure was discarded, and no knowledge was hurted, and there was no reason for a lot of ideas after the event.
"We were sleeping and we smiled with the voice of the smile and the people's smile.
We're going down from the 50th section, which took ten minutes, ” said Reuters.
According to the Dubai Savior Authorities, the slaughter teams had been shocked on four mornings of local time and left the building.
The government reported to those who left their home to organize their master.
The meeting can reverse questions on the security of materials that are used in the outside of high buildings in different parts of the world.
The Directorate-General of the Torch Building conducted an investigation after 2015, in which it found that the majority of the damages to publicity and the disadvantagement of the disks used.
In Britain, the police believes that London Grenfell Tower was able to promote the rapid expansion of the pool in the fire where 80 people died in June.

In the United States more than 20% of the aircraft passengers take the banned objects according to the machine, the questionnaire investigation
A flight passenger investigation shows that more than 20 % of travellers in the United States had been prohibited by information or without any information on the United States Transport Security Agency (TSA) control points. At least six per cent passengers had ships or other materials that they knew were not prohibited.
Only one percent reported their receipt that they had been wrong with arms, ammunitions or explosions.
I answered more than thousands of passengers, and it implemented Stratos Jet Charters state company. The results also reveal that young passengers threaten the other rules likely to be more likely.
The TSA rules informally disrupted 19.7% of passengers were representatives of the Y-Souse generation and less than 15% of the generation of X.
In general, the rules were crimed by carrying food and liquids into the airport.
More than three per cent of the advised materials are informed of the aircraft, and 2,2 per cent of women and 3,7 per cent of men reported that they were prohibited by the aircraft.
The question was that travellers were involved from different parts of the United States. The company carried out to find out how many of them had been carried out in a harmful security check and how many of them had done so informally.
It is not surprising that most passengers also have a secret transport resource likely to end up the security check — informally or without knowing.
But as a questionnaire states, TSA's guidelines are especially complex and incredible.
Travellers often don't know what liquids to get to the airport and how much.
It is therefore not surprised that the largest part of the TSA’s back costs is liquid.
Sometimes there was a power to think that the aircraft could not take books to the aircraft.
They can get home to flights, but not to international flights.
Mr Scott Pruitt, Director of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, decided to reduce emissions by Obama
Good day after 15 States were depressed by the EPA Director of the EPA Environmental Protection Agency, the Pruitt revoked its decision to reduce the emissions caused by the Obama government period.
According to the practice, the change shows that the Office of its leaders takes better into account the needs of decision-makers in the environmental matters of States.
The Pruitt has not mentioned a sentence against his previous decision in the Court of Auditors of the Union.
Some States should begin to comply with the requirement of 2015 on the race of the earth from the beginning of 1.10.
In June, Pruitt reported that he would transfer decisions in the next year so that his Agency has more time to be made to the plan, because the Agency “don't want to miss local decisions or to defeat the economic growth”.
The Pruitt was the general accusist of the Oklahoma State, before President Donald Trump appointed him as the director of the EPA, and the Pruits are known as a opposer to the more strict environmental rules.
After his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly tried to prevent or reduce chemicality and fossil fuel decisions.
The recent change of mind in the mid-week is the last part of the Pruit plan to apply the rules.
In the last month, the Court of Auditors of the Union in Washington made a decision which the Director of the EPA had overlooked its authorities by attempting to delay the decision of Obama's Ombudsman administration.
In the last few weeks, the Pruitt stated that its compliance with the titles of its translation only strengthens the cooperation of the EPA in a complex process with the States which aims to meet new requirements in accordance with the timetable.
"In the time of the previous governments, the EPA has often failed to comply with the deadlines, and then expected that the active groups and others strive the right to reach the timetables of the agreement," said Pruitt.
"We do not believe in the regulations that happens through the courts, and we are seriously treated in terms of time.
We are also seriously addressed to the regulation on our activities and to our Finnish powers."
However, in the EPA's opinion, the Pruitt can continue to use "involve the scope of decisions as well as other legal powers" to ensure that the provisions are "based and based on the best available information".
The Republics are going to have more changes in their holding rules in the conferences.
The aim of the last month's legislative instrument is to delay the action of the decisions in 2015 at least eight years.
The proposal has not yet been voted in the senate.
In this week of EPA, the general accuser Eric Schneiderman of the State of New York, who has led to the rule of law, said that the group will continue to press.
"The change of the EPA is the result of a significant profit to 6.7 million New Yorkians and more than 115 million Americans that are exacerbated in the community,” said Sneiderman.
In addition to New York, there were meetings in California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and District of Colombia.
The earth’s title, for example, was reacted to the aircraft at cars, power institutions, oil flows and chemical emissions.
This can cause serious breast-feeding duties to human groups that are also part of thousands of years before death.
The national health providers and environmental protectionists welcomed the surprising project change of Pruit.
"I'm worried about how much pressure was required to use healthy mind the boy concerned with our breathing," says Lori Ann Burd Biological diversity.
"We have to fight against Trump's governance, as its ideological objective is to operate in the conditions of the poorers and other groups in advance."
The Super-Agent Manufacturer comes to the shooter. "It's happening in the Ferrari style."
It also intends to put the hybrid sports in the same way as it is trying to maintain its exclusive position.

The details of the new strategy will be shown next year when the Italian super-audience manufacturer presentes its new five-year plan, Automotive News News.

Literature telephone discussions showing the pressure of Trump to build the border wall
The literature of telephone discussions between the United States President Donald Trump and Mexico and the Australian leaders have been held to Washington Post.
Trump invited President Enrique Peña Nonoa at the telephone debate on 27 January 2017 to stop his public talk that he would not pay the proposed border wall.
The President of the United States summarized Nieto that this had been publicly shocked by the wall project. "You can't say so to the newspaper," Trump said.

Georgia's blood finding: Aktivists renew racist lynching in hope
Ford Mercury's car takes a population team in the small town of Monroe in Georgia's rural area and continues to travel to a small village of Moore's Ford.
There are four black passengers in the car and a white driver.
Some leader, a medium-year-old man slaughtered to take a deep life from his sigaret and smile through the winter.
The passengers are scared.
"Roger, no-u," the man's incredible.
"Let's out of the car!"
The smells break silence when a young black man gets out of the front.
This awesome event is only a re-examination proposed by 22.7.2017.
However, the disorders of the skin are the realities when the shock is shocked to the "Roger".
Since 2005, human rights organizations have returned to Moore's Ford to re-establish the events in 1946. Then Ku Klux Klan had two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom, and George and Mae Murray Dorsey.
There's no one in charge of the murder.
"I'm awesome that no one has been arrested in these years, although the murderers live among us and many have to know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who helps re-related arrangements.
"It's the horrible power of the story, but first, it's the load that pressures our soul."
Brooks is a 71-year-old citizen rights activist and an ex-Georgian Congress Deputy.
It also reminds the people of Monroe that wickedness has never been corrected.
"We want the guilty to come to the right, and we want that things will be finally taken to the decision, and we want to smile and agree, but first we want justice," says Brooks.
"We can't join and agree before we get the right."
The surgery's death investigators are guarding the victim's victim's victim's 27.7.1946 blood in Georgia.
According to the NBC News documents, more than 50 men from Monroe and its environmental circumstance were suspected.
But no one was accused of murder.
Although the guilty has been free for decades, activists say that the motives of lynching have been throughout the time in local information: policy and sex.
In 1946, the neighbors of the Georgia State received the first time to vote in the presidential elections. The Supreme Law adopted its decision in April, and the laws were held in spring.
According to the FBI, there was an interruption in which a black grain farmer Roger Malcom missed white landowner Barnett Hester's battle that apparently cooked Malcom's wife Dorothya.
Brooks reported that Hester had a relationship with Dorothy and that Dorothy was expected to the child.
According to the FBI information, an influential white earthquake Loy Harris was estimated to $25.7.1946 of Malcom's $600, which had been released from prison.
The following Malcom and Dorothy were Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
The small team stopped their car before Moore's Ford was shocked.
"I saw Harris's status and ordered the murders." The FBI says.
"I also find that between the State and the local authorities were secret, and the authorities were part of murders and lost evidence and have not discovered the personality of the Witnesses."
Brooks shows that it's better to deal with.
"It was a vocabulary murder," he says.
"They were murdered, because the blackmans were wanted to tell them that they were going to be like if they wanted to vote."
Cassandra Greene has controlled the redistribution of Georgia's blood invasion for almost ten years.
It is extremely realistic and imprisoning, and it is a descriptive of the race, which many want to believe that they are already lost from the United States today.
It is difficult to look at this, but it is still harder to see what Greene says.
"We don't want to talk about the slowness, because we were supposed to meet our dark sides," says the director.
"But I can't create a relationship with you if you don't hear me or you don't want to hear what I have been trying to experience."
The practice of this year began in June, and the first day, about 30 demonstrators — ten black and a couple of whites — were gathered to listen to the slaughtered green.
Wade Marbaugh works as a Greene advisor.
He has presented the local leader of Ku Klux Klan for years, but the role is always the same hard and contrary.
"It's a bad condition because I'm not myself," Marbaugh says.
"But it is important that the half of the story is being considered in the way that it will never again be repeated."
On the other side of his dialogue, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester.
It's starting at a meeting where Malcom's smiling, and he's smiling Hester, and he's angry that Hester had a relationship with Dorothy.
"You didn't hear?" I said, "I'm out of my mail."
Rascona is Hester's answering.
Then you're gonna go to the shooting.
And then all of them (also all black spectacles) are cut into the smile.
Greene smile.
"What?" Rascona asks.
He's smelling.
"Have I been too excited in harm?" he asked.
"It's," Greene's shocking.
"I just don't believe that the whites used then the word no-u."
"Yes," the other black shower confirms.
"It's a slang, you need to use the slowest version."
The subject of the presentation is unpleasant, but the room will control a boyfriend.
Everyone wants to succeed, not only because of the statement, but they want to respect the memories of their murder.
It's starting from the start.
Now, Rascona's words are weakening.
No one's laughing.
The re-examination ends quickly and violently.
Strikes, shocks... and silence.
A woman slaughtered on a funeral side of the body and sing with Billie Holiday Strange Fruit.
His voice is smelling every other word.
A few ten meters away from the twenty-five watcher shocked his eyes with shoes and skins.
Of course, almost half of the equivalent are black and white.
There is a couple that has come to see the presentation of the New York State, but most of them are local.
They have been trained by Brooks on the skins of the victims in the pressure of Georgia.
The murders have changed in the story to reality.
After the song, Greene calls the people's team to check the body.
Childs are able to look at the beauty and unplaced bodys and to smell each other.
"They aren't really dead," the little boy muds like to remember himself.
A few minutes after Greene thanks the public.
The lyncans presented spectacles blew their references and strike up the cylinders.
Bradshaw likes Marbaugh, the local President of Ku Klux Klan.
Nick Rascona likes two showers, and then he was shocked after a French presentation.
"No, it's okay," a woman had a comfort.
"We know that you're not her.
You did this good reason."
Afterwards, the public and the showers are gathering together at night.
The white couple from the altar is discussing a strict discussion with a black couple.
Denise Duplinsk is difficult to find words when he describes the knowledge of the presentation.
"I'm hard to listen to mad words and to look at the bad things that say and do people that look like you – just because they look like you," he says.
"I'm noting that slowness is still happening," he added. "I'm just called arrests."
On the other side, Brooks reminds the development of citizen rights in the same table to hearers.
He's already talking about the planning of the next year.
"Re-examination is a strong experience, because it describes our fears, but it is also a teaching experience," says Brooks.
"The message is that this can happen again if we don't take it to our learning.
Those who do not know their history are condemned to repeat it."
Exploitation of growth in trades is deteriorated by the elimination of the "internal parts"
Is it possible to switch the blowing smells already before wearing it?
And how much is it going to take the ananax out of the skin fabric?
Responses have strongly shared opinions: one is the introduction of an extraordinary sweet, and others do not want to pay the sweet parts of those who do not use and who, however, go home to the roast.
It's been identified in the business.
For example, in Helsing Ruoholahde's K-City market, there are horrible boxes, as many, for instance, blowing the newspapers away.
The newspapers are carried out to the bio-residue.
According to the news published in the Talonomian, the young man is a wonderful trade.
But how much expensive parts of hate are removed before redning really regulate money?
How important is the smoke?
We tested how the price changes when we're swearing, latva-arts, heroes, sweet list, and flower list takes legs or puts off.
Cotton: 2,10 euros paying a flor cage to $1,80, when it discards all the leaflets.
Analytics: EUR 2,30 of the total analysis price of €1,95, when I put it away from your floor.
Latvia's article: EUR 2,60 was 2.5,40, when the short position was discarded.
Heats: Two necklaces estimated totally 75 cents.
Without the price, it's been 60 centimeters.
Parsacale: The mid-sized parcel estimated 1 euro and without 80 centimeters.
Final result: If the newspapers and the pieces go to shoot, you will be able to fix a few decades in the best way.
As a percentage of the price of hair, even 20% was estimated.
Thus, these purchases would have been arranged for a total of EUR 1.20!
Neymar was purchased out of Barcelona with the PSG of five years.
Brazilian advisor Neymar has concluded that five-year-old agreement with the French PSG has been reported to the AFP Agency.
Last night, the representatives of Neymar had paid their football ligature in Spain to play FC to Barcelona 222 million euros.
A total of EUR 222 million is the largest in the football history.
Previously, it was in the United States, which estimated EUR 105 million last June from French Paul Pogba.

Middle-payment of EUR 5 300, education that comes to - the situation of investment aid was "free and free"
The quality of investment has been spoken in the past few years.
The last reports of Helsinki reported Ritva, 68, to which the investment rates of the bank movement were fully talking about investment products in sale.
In the first year, the rules on the sale of investment investments and different investment products are decreased.
This is based on the new financial market directive which will be started to apply from the beginning of the next year.
Currently, the evaluation of the participation of employees in investment aids and investment products is based on self-regulation.
No part requirements are defined in the law.
The financial sector (FA) itself recommends that investing workers perform their own APV1 or APV2 research.
Financial studys of the APV firm Oy, which is held in the research group as well as experts of the sector, have been authorized by the financing control (Fiva), universities and experts.
Researches are widely updated 12-15 spectrums, and their tests prepared Aalto EE, or Aalto University Executive Education Oy, providers for the development of the guideline.
In its online pages it is reported that both tents are "specificly widely widely".
The study material includes 10-15 books and several other instructions and processes.
The Oy Markku Saviko reports that the rate of the tents is slowly estimated by some 70.
The largest expenditure of the bank staff offers all investment services have been performed either by APV1 or APV2, as they are imposed in accordance with the rules of business own.
Then there are smaller bank movements, unless it is mentioned, which the staff affects the implementation of the card surveys, Savika says.
He said that such bank movements are "others."
According to Saviko, the APV1 study has been performed from 2000 by 13 000 to 14 000 people and recommended APV2 studies for more investments.
Some banking movements consider the interest in conducting the investigation.
In most of the other sectors, there are significantly more strict component requirements.
Savika says that the recommendation of the Financial Area requires the implementation of the APV studies, as it is soon safeguarded for the investment sector.
According to the statistics, financial and investment costs are known in the average month by several thousands of euros provises, creatives and income payments, including.
The average rate of month-time regular work is around 5 300 euros.
In the average month, men who work with workers know about $5,900 and women are more than €4,500.
The most important tens of euros will be a average of €8,100.
The highest-known men will pay more than 9 000 euros per month or more, the largest tens of women who are aware of $6,400 or more.
In accordance with the Investment Service Rules, investment aid can only be granted an official company.
Workers and tasks have been established in self-regulation until this time.
According to Fiva, the review was received by individual cases where investment expertise and skills were not sufficient on the basis of the adviser's activities.
In principle, the sales of investment products may also be operated, although professional and qualification would be a heavy level.
The situation of this part has been ill and free.
In most of the other sectors, Savika states that there are significantly more strict component requirements.
According to Saviko, since the beginning of this year the new financial market Directive (MIFID II) will be obtained.
It requires that each company responds to the fact that the staff offering investment services is sufficiently participating.
Financial supervisory authorities are granted to the amount of which to be paid.
Fivan market supervisor Marko Hovi reports that one of the clear amendments currently is the law on the ownership and experience of investors and investment products.
It is clear that new requirements relating to as well as to the own staff of investment companies and contractors who sell products for some company.
Hovi reports that the Government's statement given to the State Reserve Minister is able to participate and experience in Fiva.
What they are precisely, it will be decided during the coming vision.
The company must also continue to care for the necessary education and, where appropriate, follow-up and supplementary education.
All of this must be documented, and the company has the obligation to demonstrate that this is also done.
It is clear that the company must, for example, card the action of the staff on the individual basis.
This will certainly be different demands, depending on investment or sales of products.
The new requirement is also to work with a person who is more experienced if it is not sufficient to participate or experience.
So if the company pays a new employee that does not complete the criteria defined, the employee must work with a person who comply with a certain time criteria.
According to the fact that the rules of amendment are criticized and concerted.
The legislation on the sale of investment products shall be decreased at the beginning of 2018.

The new results of Swedish security applicants were published
The newest results of the medical age of Swedish safeguards have been published in Swedish, and the results of the tests carried out in the new evaluation method show that over 80% of the tests were defined for over 18 years, but not all tests are considered to be reliable.
Sweden's National Justice Agency has initiated the test this year before.
The tests may be assessed by the age of the security applicant, and the new test was taken after the Swedish Migration Agency was estimated that it had not been able to determine the actual age of the applicants who claimed themselves.
By this time, the Migration Agency has performed 6 880 tests, and the Legal Medical Agency has now published the results of 2 481 tests. The tests were tested between the Mediterranean and the end of July 2017.
The tested 80 per cent, or the 2002 security applicant, was more than 18 years of age, and, in addition, the Legal Medical Science Agency determined 25 that the test was "earth or older than 18 years".
432 cases were concluded to conclude that the security applicant is "until 18 years of age".
The test was made only in cases where the applicant was a cause for the age notified by the questionnaire.
The Bureau of the Jurisprudence of the Virgin Medicine reports that the results are harmonised with the results of the previous months.
"The slows are very harmonious, the differences in the statistics of the last months are not available", he reported to The Local magazine.
Although a larger part of the applicants was defined to be over 18 years, it is not necessarily meaning that the applicants would have lied for their life.
In May, the Agency publiced the results of the 581 test and reported that 442 cases were "reports that the investigation had 18 or older."
When Svenska Dagbladet investigated the same results, it appeared that 243 cases were openly told by the applicant to complete this year in 18 years.
The testing method for the age’s age evaluation is taken by streamgen pictures of wise and magnetic pictures from pollutants and then analyzes pictures of dent doctors and radiologs.
One of the suspects is the endocrinologist of the Carilyan Institute, Claude Marcus, whose work belongs to the evaluation of human biological capacities.
"I have had a reason to think about this, and I believe that the method used is not true.
The determination of the age of biologic age in this way is very uncertain.
If we're surely not able to determine the age, we should not do that we can," he said to Metro.
However, the Office of the Right Medical Science Viansson defended the accuracy of the tests: "True, you can say that the risk to determine the child is small.
The risk is the biggest situation in which it is to be tested precisely 18 years, then the risk is about 10%."

West Virginia's Chairman changes the defence
Western Virginia Democratic President Jim Justice announced the changed defence in Trump's campaign in the evening.
"Democratics simply abandoned me," Justice said.
"I can tell you, after many prayers and fundamental discussions, today I'm telling the Western Virgins that I can't help you as the President of Democratics. "
The university tried to make the recommendation of the raw images.
"Our morning, as a member of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic," he added.
"I would say to you it's a new game time."
Trump had previously promised that in the event of West Virginia's campaign, it would be an important report.
Trump wins in West Virginia 42 points because justice did not support democratic conditions in Hillary Clinton.
Justice was elected as a soldier in 2016. Probes said he is the only one of his states.
He's inherited his father's company and owns hydrocarbons in five states.
His property is about $1.59 billion.
The National Committee of the Republics (RNC) published a tour on the evening, which states that "the Defence of the Defence of Justice is a new attack to the Democratic Party, which will be more pleased to build obstacles than better American."
"Democratics have only 15 soldiers and less states than ever, in this situation, the statement of the Justice is to the last month, where there is no leadership and that is not able to find a positive, combined message," Ronna McDaniel stated in the statement of the CBS.
Skills villaged the damage - towers in arrival even a very long past day

The Saviation Agency has been reported about a half-week swimming shuttle.
The electricity center was located in the sauna state on the row.
The Saviation Unit shut up the cast and walls to find pallets, and smoothed the ball slowly.
Another single room left without electricity, but a person's perpetrator was displaced.
In the holiday, the shuttle reared out the aircraft in Harjuland before midnight.
The construction of the Saviation Unit was already complete in the stage of the ball, and the Savior Office could not be other than preventing the shooting.
A total of fivety square meters of the external structure spends on the ground.
In the design of the coffee, the secret again attacked in the home.
The villages of the land were outside the building and proved to be sweet shelter.
The Savior Office was on the place to check the case, but this time the secret was not temporaryly shuttled, just a few slaughtered.
In the movement, the ukkin caused problems between Sienej and Vasas, when the slaughter stripped the system of transportation.

If the persecution continues to be on the beginning, you can take more than twelve thousand secrets, forecast.
The previous pre-review year was tested in 2015, when the year's salary was about 30 000 sections.
By the mid-week, the number of secrets this year was estimated to be 18,386.
It is therefore unbelievable that this year would not be violated after two years of "pregnancy".
However, it may be expected to continue.
According to the imports, Finland also remains the warm and cosmetic during the last week, which is an odd birth environment.
The main expenditure is transferred from the northern parts of the country to the south, which can be obtained about 2 000 secret days as well as Sunday and Sunday.

Coe overcome the Russian "Overy" for forgiveness from dopingscandale
The World Sport Power Sebastian Coe overcome its open description of the appointment made by Russia because of the dopingscandale, but Coe added that it was not yet time to stop Russia’s participation.
The Russian general sport manager Dmitri Shljaht said in the IAAF Congress that Russia's ban is appropriate and that he would like to fight for specifically a doping.
He said he was sorry for all the sports who were carried out in competition with gold or gold meat.
In spite of his comments, the IAAF congress voted for the prosecution of the ban. Russians were closed from November 2015 after the World Antidoping Office in the WADA report to support the government from Doping in Russia.
"I think that his answer was very direct today, and it was a very open presentation," the President of the IAAF reported to the providers.
"All the Council and the Congress were satisfied that Russia's general sport unions welcomed the land through the difficult times and reported its work to reorganize all its activities."
Coe said it was "pleasant" also that Russia accepted the proposal for a ban decision.
"I think we had the right day to build and progress, but the Congress supports the recommendation of the Working Group that there is no right time to stop the Russian ban," said Coe.
"We have to do in the next months to normalize the situation.
The main principle has always been that we want to hold clean sports different from the corrupted system," he adds.
Nine Russian sportors competite with neutral sports at London on Tuesday Wednesday MM sports. They have complied with the slow criteria of IAAF.
Rune Andersen, director of the IAAF Working Group, said on Monday that Russia must still comply with many requirements before it could be returned.
"The test is still inadequate, and the trainers received the Language continue to work freely", he reported to the IAAF Council on Wednesday after their proposal in London.
Production company slaughtered Tom of Finland's deficiency
Tom of Finland was not a success, as the factors hoped, reports Yle.
If it is honestly said, I'm disappointed, acknowledge the director of the film produced by Helsinki Film, Annika Sucksdorff Yle in the debate.
I was afraid that the Finnish films may be conservative and seem to be that.
The film took its next night in February 2017.
By the end of June it had been targeted by 1000,000 viewers, which was the film budget, about a million euros compared to a few.
There's nothing to do with this, but now it's important that investors get their own back.
If a movie would have been better in your home, they would have got their money.
Now we have to wait for small smells on the outside, Sucksdorff says.

How the economic rules of the football affect Neymar's movement to Paris
The rules that restrict the use of European footballs do not prevent Neymar's movement from Spain from Barcelona to France to Saint-Germain, which have a football movement for all the times of player.
The possible consequences to Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) are to decide the EUFA regulated by the European football, which may prevent the participation of the teams from the Meeting Meeting.
The EUFA has introduced the economic rules of the game in 2011, as the PSG has to be able to demonstrate that the movement of Neymar has been financed without major losses.
It was paid to Barcelona 222 million euros for the conclusion of the Brazilian Agreement, and the new year payment of Neymar is moved in ten million dollars next.
The transfer of Neymar to France is involved in many economic aspects.
The PSG has no difficulties to pay Neymar's transfer and connect it to its stars, since it will be funded by the rich governance of Qatar oil.
Series can use large amounts of players to purchase, but they must be balanced with real income sources so that the operations related to football are not missing.
The economic rules of the real game were designed to be the President of the EUFA in 2007 on the initiative of the French Michel Platin.
As a former footballer, Platin agreed that the obligation of success was to defeat and caused serious problems if the banks or owners supported them.
In 2011, the priority of the economic maintenance of the game was moved from the speed of their losses to be monitored.
The change means that Roman Abramovich’s first operational model in Chelsea was significantly difficult. Abraham buyed a promised team, used great amounts to players and made a worldwide bridge.
The current third-year evaluation period of the real games will continue until 2018. During that period, the follow-ups can be made up to 30 million euros of loss.
Although Platin was to leave the EUFA President's tasks in 2015, his follower also wants to switch the skin out of the skin.
"The rules of the real game are still in use, and we will also apply them in the future," said Andrea Traverso last week to the Associated Press News Office.
Although the PSG was outlined by the Neymar agreement by a simple reimbursement, it may be divided into the total of its new agreement to the holder.
Neymar has made a five-year agreement, so the transfer of EUR 44.4 million can be recorded after the following five years.
The first sanctions of the real game were distributed in 2014. The largest sanctifications were imposed to PSG and Abu Dhab to finance in Manchester City.
The PSG received 60 million euros, which later was reduced to 20 million euros, and was also intended to limit its 21 players instead of the normal 25 players instead of the 2014-2015 period.
The EUFA is checking the strikes that may try to turn its economic rules by increasing its income through the companies associated with the owners.
For example, if a Qatar company supports PSG but the value of the aid is considered to be greater than the normal level of the market, EUFA does not have to be granted as a result.
This occurred when EUFA concluded in 2014 that the support of the Qatar Tourism Authority was exceededed to PSG.
It was also shown that part of Neymar’s PSG could be funded by Qatar in 2022 football MM competitive operations.
However, the PSG and the Committee have refused that Neymar would be the sender of MM competitives, and the EUFA would be very easy to declare that arrangement.
Because of the former sanctions of PSG, the EUFA is most closely monitoring the rules of rules.
The sources from the statistics reported that the EUFA has not negotiated the movement of Neymar with PSG.
The sentences gave a discussion to the Associated Press Review Office, provided that their personality is not reliable because they have no ability to discuss the situation of PSG.
According to the latest public account decision, PSG’s trade change in 2015-2016 was 542,4 million euros and over 10 million EUR.
No recent accounting decisions have yet been published.
PSG expects new sponsors to be reached by Neymar and increased sales of resulting products and pelips.
Assessing that its trade change increases at least 30 % of the Neymar Agreement.
From the exile of the best player in the world, Spain clearly ruined the liga liga tried to move Neymar.
"This is a clear economic condition of doping as well as for the follow-up and State," said the Spanish president Javier Tebas to the Spanish AS, and he refers to the PSG's qatarian property.
Arsenal's manager Arsene Wenger is also worthy to finance the work of the foot-capallose.
"It is the result of self-employment which has changed the activity of the football environment in the last 15 years," Wenger said in the tour.
"All is possible after the State belonging to the football team.
It is very difficult to comply with the economics of the real game. There are so many attractions related to the renowned player to represent the state."
Now it's urgent: Finnish MM sports trainer in Helsinki
Length hip Arttu Pajulahde and three-millionary Christianian trainer Suren Ghazaryan is in the middle of Helsing, although he should prepare a general sport in London.
Christians may be competitive without the counsel of their trainer.
The shooter is competitive tomorrow in the swimming pockets and the sleeves in the three-million shoes.
However, two trainers, the Belgian Ghazarian, have not received vision to Isoon-Brittan.
Ghazaryan has tried to handle the results of the Great Britain.
The trainer has an invitation to organize MM groups as a document, but has not been able to obtain a visa.
Is this the first symptoms of Brexit, or what, director Jorma Kemppa.
He has always been able to handle the visa itself, but now there's some problems.
He's doing everything to get to the place.
Ghazaryan has been working for the Finland SUL for years.
That's not so great.
When someone looks at the stations, Artu Pajulahti said to his trainer about the possible removal.
MM-metal for Finland requires miracles
The MM swimming swimming pool starts in London on Wednesday and Sustaining the week end of Sunday 13 August.
Travelling, landscape and residue are the species of which the Finnish sports divided into intohimately from another year to the other, shock of success or not.
The success in the hearts of the pink sporters is measured in metalls.
It's also other measurements.
A less attention to youth sportors remain the beautiful growth rates of the values of another, where experiences are able to obtain the performance of the sportor to the level that adult MM-meters can be infected.
Now, in the small MM-group of Finland, there are no young sportors, and not really conkers.
The MM-metal for Finland requires miracles.
Surely, the interest in the sport and surprisingness is that wonders can be swept.
It drove sports to the edge of the television swimming pool and swimming to follow the crystals, although the London metalls are raised from the time to the evening afternoon.
From the previous MM swimming swimming swimming pool 2015, Finland has received one prestige.
It took the artist Tero Pitkivuki.
The Ukrainians are waiting for the Mediterranean even now, although others tell the results of his and the last days of his and other folks, and the remaining of the Pitchai will be carded in the last few years of valuation.
In any of these kitchens, Pitcotki remains a great deal of Finnish sports.
To other Finnish sportors, the access to the final competitive or own predictation is sufficiently good.
The realistic metalisation of the coming years of the Finnish general sport gives good success in international values today.
The redistribution of young people's gifts and its financial support is more important than maintaining the elite team of sports supporters.
Success is not at the time, but requires the work of sports and suffering as well as sportors for years.
Finnish members also appreciate international sports and enjoy their unique performance.
Unfortunately, the kitchens in London remain in the history of Usen Bolt and Mo Farah, and not because of the fear of terrorism or weakening attacks.

Reserve company Viking's new FSTR small ship is from timetable badly late.
The little boat had to go from Helsinki to Tallinna at 8:00.

Small area of nostalgia: Wet Hot American Summer and Comrade Detective
The history also deceives the days of the 80s and the 90s gandingees of the demons (which was David Wain and Michael Showalter's exciting The State Scene of MTV), as well as its own period – in 2001, before Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd and other series of stars moved to the most important matters.
Cultural code it is both parod and the description of a continued memories we have discussed in the Facebook period.
As a commercial product, it seems to be alive.
The First Day of Camp works well, and not only because of its absurd drugs (which was told H. Jon Benjamin as a shock-based background).
It is the point of view that the medium-year-old showers appear to be slightly approached to full-year-oldness, and that highlighting it makes the possibility of striving the past is not possible.
Ten Years Later, where adults appear to be adults, is less sensitive, and its parodi is more delicate: there are parodides in the 90s, for example, steel-cakes in the 1990s, such as a horrible picture of your hands that are skilled.
One of the incredible views of Apple Powerbook, Inline Rounds and "Other one from 1991."
Many of the stories are the same as before.
Welcome Coop (Michael Showalter) is now a writer but has not yet been reached over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still kids.
And a crazy smile is with Ronald Reagan, a criminal partner George H. W. Bush (which is partly shown by Michael Ian Black).
Like always in these series, the best ones are the side poles.
The special fun is to see the two-year-old Paul Rudd, who has a squadter under the top, namely Matt Dillon's "soul patch" film Singles. Ruddin showed Andy, the king of the lady, starts to be a old age.
The moments of lunch of the snack may be able to spend this series as a recursive Seven Up! - until it gets a clear decision: Wet Hot American Summer – Twenty Years Later. On the last point, the friend team goes to the first night of Wet Hot American Summer photo.
The Amazon Comrade Detective Search reiterates the second nostalgia: The Americans' cold war, the Atomic Blonde photo, and even the GLOW-series printing in which it goes to the sea.
The commediate series have created Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, and it has managed Rhys Thomas. It has been crypted as a copy Drama of the 1980s, where the Bukarest couple fights for truth, athism and markism.
In the main parts of Gregoria and idealist Iosefin are seeing Florin Piersic Jr and Corneliu Ulici. Their dialogs have Dubaned English Channing Tatum (the final producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitts.
It's a great idea.
But there's nothing else.
In the series, there are some good visa sweets (polices take time to look at the television in the same way as the Americans look at football).
There are a number of popular audio players, such as Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny. They have a very fun game.
However, Comrade Detective remains too much in the follow-up of the socialist Drama of the pump – for example, the murderer behind the Reagan namer, and therefore the series are often starting to feel true from the propaganda.
Six long thresholds are too long, and no drugs of the series are sufficiently fast and not rich.
The strike series could be better functioning as pheprops, even when Gregor and Ioph are repeatingly walking in the United States majority and there are always two meat men in the hamburger.
A message to the imagination of the communist public is that the culture of the western culture can make all the costs of consumption and snakes.

The Cowboy Toni Tauru is coming on Sunday in Macao - the former UFC advisor
Ton Tauru wants to keep the battle possible.
Ton Tauru receives a very sweetie in Maca, because the Brazilian Leandro I was taking the last year in the UFC organization.
Brazil also has a pretty black snake and a worldwide majority of the species.
I'll take myself up against my older.
It's fun, Tauru's 32-year-old.
The cowboy had to rise in Indonesia on Saturday last day.
The fight was revoked because of logistic problems, but three campaigns were obtained in the short-time table of China's self-administration area Macao.
Tauru hasn't ever been in the moon.
This was the first time when my battle was denied.
It was ridiculous because preparing and my tree took a lot of time.
However, the entrepreneur is satisfied that the campaign has been a new point of time.
The weekly expectation is not just an impact on preparation.
The movement isn't affected by the channel because it's not a week.
The time can be worse if it's too experiencing.
Tauru is a number of opposers in its previous campaign whose strength is possible.
This time, the situation is different.
Issaa is described as a typical brazilian.
He's a very aggressive actor.
I'll see she's coming first in a swimming head and try to take the shooting.
He won the world's magic, so he knows the pressure.
The previous struggle of the copper has not been planned according to the plans.
Kevin Belingo, the Philippines, shocked Tauru into the eye, and the winning left the Philippines.
I never thought so much, especially in the possible way: he didn't have any part of it.
When I was leaving to shoot, he bought my eyes.
It's really hurt.
New motivation
Some of the volunteers take one year, a part is slower.
For example, the next opposer Issa took the last time in September.
A three battles last year.
Now, there's a second campaign over the year.
It's been pregnant.
I've been trained over the last few years and I've been fine all the time.
But I've just taken it because of taking it.
When a 32-year-old had heard about the future, he decided to change the land for a minute.
I was in Espo in the tree, and I was rejoiced.
We got very good trees when there was one boyfriend from Swedish.
This was a great help, because the cowboy of the Sunday would be able to spend into physical campaign.
I have been training the same opposers and conducting a position.
It's also the main path of 32 years of age.
I have to smell.
If it's a chance, I'm going to go to my own bag.
The lower shall not be freely given because it is mostly consuming.
Macao shoes before in China the attraction of Tauru.
It's the Chinese Las Vegas.
I think there's a great night before.
The UK Central Bank has a rate of 0.25 per cent
The Central Bank is expected to indicate that it should be highlighted when the economic growth has been unprecedented and the inflation slight has stopped speculations from highlighting.
The British Central Bank has warned that economic growth continues to be slow, and the bank has moved emphasis because the result of the family’s income is higher.
The decision-makers of the Financial Policy Committee decided to have a vote of 6 to 2 per cent, which has been less encouraged in this month because the economic growth has been unprecedented.
In its four-year inflation review, the bank was at 1,7 per cent of its growth in 2017 and the 2018 prediction was 1,6 per cent, and also warned that the income of households was higher, since inflation is still expected to be raised nearly three per cent in the skin.
According to the bank, however, highlights are needed for the rapid inflation of Brex, and the bank also reported that the costs of the wage could be highlighted in the more expected financial market.
Furthermore, the members of the Agency decided to abolish a part of the massive economic package which was started to be implemented in the posts of the Brexit national vote.
The bank stops the Term Funding Scheme programme in February 2018, although it is expected to provide a benefit of the financial for banks for more than 15 million, or a total of 115 million.
The Bank's High Decisions Protocol states: "Declares the financial policy prognoses that long development of the Growth People's production is continued in the nearest years when the consumption rate of the realities of homes is reduced."
In terms of ratings, the bank reiterated that in order to smooth inflation, the expectations of the market "speed more."
The markets presently predict the first highlighting of 2018 on the third and second in 2020.
However, the bank highlighted that the possible emphasis are "sharing" and "reality".
In May, the bank predicted the growth of 1,9 per cent of this year and the next year 1,7 per cent of growth.
Now it has increased by 1,8 per cent in 2018.
The point was heavy to the dollar and the euro as a result of the news.
At $0.5 per cent, and it was $1.31, and the euro has slowed 0.4 per cent and 1.11 per euro.
The decision should be highlighted after the expected weakest growth expectations were increased in the highlights. BKT increased 0.3 per cent in the second fourth and 0.2 per cent in the first fourth.
The bank expects that growth remains at 0.3 per cent in the third fourth, but a little slow in the end of the year.
The infringement of the slow inflation was only a little hope for the pleasant inflation and young households suffering from payment rates, and the bank states that the situation is bad before it changes better.
The bank adds that the income of the monetary policy could "not be prevented" in the nearest years, but it expects that the payment development will be "respectively" at the end of the three-year predicting period.
This will also strengthen the intense growth of British products as a result of the weaknesse of the weaknesse, and it decreases partly the impact of the private consumption.
The decision was made a year after 0.25 per cent was raised after the EU's national reputation result, which would eat the red rate.
The bank estimates that the overall effects of the decision are likely to be seen in prices and in the economy only for four years.
Before the final decision of the Central Bank, the emphasis has been increasingly required when the inflation of the pressure faced by the homes of the crisis. In July, the third heads require 0.5 per cent of the highlight.
In the last month inflation was 2,6 per cent of June 2,9 per cent, but the bank stated that it was expected and inflation was recovered in the next months.
According to the bank, the overwhelming of the objective of the two per cent has resulted in a weak tree.
"When we take into account the last rate of swap rates, the competition on the household market would appear to be a crowd when creditors are looking for sweet customers and want to stop the year", says the director Andrew Montlake.
"The markets seem specially good to those who have been completed the existing counterparty, and the new agreements are more recommended, their impacts are low and also have inconsistent options."
NHS is estimated to 10 000 cylinders of HIV
From the beginning of the month, patients may be determined "transferable" HIV-related medicine. In the highest right, the financing of the medicine in the public health care system (NHS) was decided.
The NHS reported that the predetermination of exhibition (PREP) was estimated for about 100,000 humans during the first third year of experience, and that the medicine to be taken has been reduced by some 86% of the major risk individuals.
The NHS agreed to finance an experience after the case of the marriage of the last year of the Supreme Court, which said that NHS could be able to pay a PrEP, although claims that the local authorities should finance it.
The director of the UK NHS, Simon Stevens, called a tournamental decision "in a significant new intervention", and the national AIDS organization described it "in an important moment".
Sexual Health Clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are the first starting to receive an announced experience that extends to other clinics in October.
Previous exhibition (PrEP) is to be connected to HIV medicine that reduces the history of the storm.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV tests in risk groups.
Before taking a medication, it means that there are sufficient drugs in the body during a combination of HIV.
The physician may take daily or two hours before sex.
The treatment group includes homogenes, biological men, transfusional partners and people with HIV-posittive partners who do not receive effective treatment.
Clinics choose the suggestion of experience comply with the applicants of men, women and transfusions, as well as those who do not know their HIV-positive partner about antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and who have been reported to the general doctor may also be asked to experience in their local sexual health clinic.
The program pays 10 million pounds, and the UK NHS signed this week on drugs after international offering.
The test aims to evaluate the potential of the PrEP device by collecting a wide clinical test on its objection, administration and treatment.
"This important new intervention should be complemented and effective for already existing multilateral and more effective ways to prevent HIV", says Stevens.
"And one significant achievement has been resolved in the more than 30 years of struggle of the major health disaster of humanity."
"This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV," says the director of the national AIDS organization Deborah Gold.
"If the PrEP is treated rightly with those necessary and risk-related groups, because it may have a translational impact on the UK HIV epidemic.
From the beginning of the year, risk groups have been funded by the NHS experience of a medicine which can be used in itself without the need to consult with the partner, which has a powerful impact to improve the lives of many people.
This has been welcomed the news."
"This is the main thing to ensure that the experience will be initiated rapidly in the whole country and no risk group remains outside", says the Director of the Terrence Higgins Act, Ian Green.
"PrEP has been obtained in the construction, and we can soon protect 100,000 people from HIV testing. "
"PrEP trial initiation has been welcomed by a event that has been depressed for a few months because of the government's disadvantagement", says Mr Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health.
"We have evidence that the medicine may have a transparent impact on our work, which we do to prevent HIV and stop this threatening disease.
The test helps us understand better the real benefits of the PrEP.
It is now important that the experience will be initiated as soon as possible in the whole country. This is how we can protect HIV highlights and reiterate the nearest situation in which HIV spread has been able to stop in society."
Life quality: intermediary and slight income solutions have made from the small house of Earl's Court
The former banker Joanne Leigh was inspired to change the smallest apartment in the Knightsbridgen area in Erl's Court in 2014.
Remont's success tells that Joanne has not yet shocked his camps and changed.
"It was before I lived with my former in Knightsbridge in a larger place," says Joanne.
"I didn't have any of the same way in my prices.
I went here in the accommodation, and I found that the rooms were the same high as in my siliness.
I enjoyed immediately and made a offer on the same day."
Afterwards, about 90 square rooms have experienced a complete shape change.
It was two in which the bedroom reached only from the kitchen. Joanne wanted to increase the condition of storage as well as the machine to ensure that the room height could be used.
"I wanted the universe, the great days and a lot of light.
They were my requirements," he says.
He rewarded the work of Erfan Azadin Notting Hill from the Duck & Shed Planning Office. Erfan was able to use nearly four meters of high rooms and to create a residence that would not only be a remont and sale item but a home.
It was not exactly sufficient to two main terms, so the challenge was to build a machine that could be able to stand.
The solution requires a thinking of Erfan.
"The dynastic buildings are complicated in time.
The shops had to be organized in the head so that they don't need a cycling.
The structures had to be amended so that the height is just appropriate on them and under them."
Erphan was able to place the condition on the top two full rooms in a slightly detail.
Retrouvir is opened to a co-christ window on a smooth residence.
Small rooms, gold kitchens and Serge Mouille wintage lights create symptoms style.
The use of games is the theatreality, feeling and light.
The short-cutting pieces in both sides may be more effectively affected.
The painting in the kitchen is like a window opening a view to another room.
In the income of the slipper slippers, Joanne's skins and washing snakes have a condition of conservation.
Additional validity is that the kit is hidden when it is not used.
The kitchens installed at the kitchen is not a new solution,
But in the kitchen Joanne, there is a unique quality that the doors will be shooted as the door of the car.
"It requires a little planning," tells Erfan about the thermal swimming door of the MDF.
"It's been balanced, or it's slowing up, very easily to its places."
After the deterioration and maintenance planning, Joanne received 16 more squares, another bedroom and a better basis solution.
"In the sale of the pinta area, or the value of the cognition, is resolved," said Erfan.
"In the basic case, the competitive intermediator is walking into the apartment and calculating the price area."
In the area of Joanne, the pint area was added by using manufactured materials that produce the integrity of the state.
"Assistance has been related to the materials of housing, and tunnezi is born in the apartment part of them," says Erfan.
"No one was shooted on the walls to electrical guides.
They're also important but not in the same way."
Joanna's apartment is an example of good planning and additional instruments can make an exceptional excellent.
Then it may also be so that the residence does not want to change anymore.

In the summer 1996, the Lahde store appeared to a swimming pool where the Thai food was sold.
The lawyers didn't shoot the floor, but they walked out.
In the kitchen, he sold the Panya Suamsri-Pentti, supported by Panja.
He did not even share the Finnish, nor did the Finnishs still share the tea.
Because the people didn't want to go to eat, Panja offered free lands.
That's how he taught the gifts to eat the shirt snakes.
You're going to be there, he said.
I'm going to go to the cook.
I've been more often, finally every day.
In June 1997 Panja opened the Lahde trade in its tharuo fish.
There were two small tables, the customers might have been less than 20.
He taught us in addition to eating the tharuoca, also to sit next to the aircraft.
When the hunger and places are limited, you can’t leave a empty place between yourself and a visit.
A little silence, we were better acquainted, and we became friends.
Finally, I was sit in a swimming room with a word book that teached the Thaiki.
Two years went on the side of the trade management, but then the restaurant was to change because the disadvantaged powers itself were too slow in the government.
The end of the trade manager is free of a new place.
There's a place.
Now, we're getting the jury again in our own table, just in the shortest time we have to ask for the visitors whether there is a place near.
Mom knows his customer.
They're telling him the people where they're used and who they're seen.
He knows what to eat everybody.
He has seen how the life phases of customers change, and the food safety changes.
She remembers what he called me with a man I came to eat my first sleeves.
He remembers me as a skin and meat, and remembers what I was young.
It's glad to go to lunch a little more than others, sit on my own place to the door of the kitchen and change the belonging to the kitchen with Panja.
The food is not the most important thing we're getting from him.
He has taught sustainability and internationality a time of chilicostics.
He's opened our money in addition to our thinking and our heart.
Today, many are talking to him... and thank you for the promotion that you've grown in the trip.
I like Panja.
Even though she's been hard, he's always friendly.
He's hard.
He's on the restaurant. He's in the swimming and black.
Last week in the restaurant, there were two decades of fulfilment.
We've got our customers a shirt shirt.
Without alarms or attention, this important day was over the work.

The money was used for funds, and the family now owns the activities, the regions of counterparty in Brunswick and Sorrent, and the households in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as the shopping centres of the former cities.
According to the agreement made with the father even with the family, Colin owns about two third parts and Paul is about the ability of the third part of the company. Paul pictures his father as "familiar power and centrality".
According to the documents of justice, the share of property means that Colin owns the funds of about $316 million and Paul about $176 million.
Paul is not satisfied with the share of funds and money.
"I think Colin left the best interests in his proposal," Paul wrote in the first light certificate in 2015.
The meeting was the first time on Thursday after a number of concerting companies.
Brothers now also call on whoever controls the existing business, and Paul claims that Colin has closed him out of the business.
Colin says that it's not like his place, but he accused Paul for some of the funds' malicious treatment.
Colin writes together on his first light proof that he would like to make a decision in this matter.
"In accordance with our Italian tradition, the family is the most important thing to me," Colin states in its statement.
Consultation costs are constantly grown. Remarkable statements, emails and reports are hundreds of pages. The meeting is aware of the concert companies like Deloitten, Pitcher Partners and Charles Keck Cramer, as well as the best and most experienced lawyers, such as Allan Myers.
Anna De Lutis and his husband, Luigi, were Italian migrants who found milk bars and retail sales at the end of the 1950s. At the beginning of the 1970s they bought the market from Brunswick.
They were used as assured when purchasing the family from Collingwood, a counterparty founded by Colin on the first market of the family.
Colin tells his foundation of the trade "the last years of shipment, when Paul was still a child (e.g. aged 10).
Anna De Lutis tells us that he and Luigi died in 2012 wanted to move funds to his sons with a deep appreciation.
"Luigi often said that he did not want to end up the right of the brothers," Anna writes in his statement.
Another two sons, Mark and Luke, are no longer together in the De Lutis Congress. Colin said that Mark had $10 million and 26 million of dollars left the company.
Paul says that Luke and Mark are "the economic conditions of their stay."
Colin had had to slowly profile, even though it is an ex-Australia's ligament member of the government and television, Eddie McGuire's best friend of this year in 2015.
Fairfax Media has contacted Colin and Paul De Lut and their lawyers on Wednesday.
Only Colin answered, and he told him in a text message that it could not be able to comment on it because it was treated in justice.
“I'm very surprising that my brother Paul has decided to deal with me with the right and to bring me into the court,” he wrote.
In the half of 2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to accept his brother's requirements.
"Now our father wouldn't want to do this," Cole continued and told her hope that we would be going to make it possible.
Tonight, the hope looked like a shirt.
"We're going to be solved in the right in the next place," wrote Colin.
Trump's new Chief's staff will be limited to the use of the President's media.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly's finally successful.
First.
According to the Politico magazine, the new Chief of Personals of the White House will restrict President Trump's media use and monitoring of news so that the boss would not be so often affected.
The employer Josh Dawsey reported:
"When the new Chief of the White House, John F. Kelly, met with a leadership in his first working day, he took the discussion of the key problem he would like to solve: he would restrict President Donald Trump's information.
Kelly reported to the Employees of the White House that all the information, as well as those heard in the situations of information, must be carried through him, because the President makes better decisions when he gets good information."
Kelly's words have a sense, but others have tried to restrict the use of the Trump media and the failure.
President Trump has a relationship with the television for decades, and as President, he still looks at much television.
"If President-inquisitive Trump was nervous of the unlawful news, he encouraged him to show that late information instruments were more balanced with matters," the campaign of Trump's advisor Sam Nunberg reported to the Political Journal in February.
The Political Provider Tara Palmerri then wrote that "the management of the use of Trump's Twitter is essential that his personal media fluctuation belongs to the fluctuation of the body."
All right.
But it's funny to say that Trump's use of Twitter would never have been controlled.
Maybe these campsites know something we don't know — perhaps the Twitters of Trump without their efforts were still worse.
Maybe we're never gonna get to know what messages from Trump left without being sent.
If his staff has even several times been able to prevent her from caused problems, their work has not been worried.
However, nobody has been able to prevent Trumpi's smell in consequently.
The problem is partly due to the fact that we have competitive groups in the White House who are trying to run their matter by giving Trump information that supports their views, and that information may be reliable – or then not.
In May, Politics wrote that the advisers will give the President this information to them.
The employee Shane Goldmacher told us about a case:
"The current and old workers of the Trumpe say that he can smile on the newspapers with his appreciation, especially if they are told about the harmful periods of information, and then he must be able to get to know what data are from.
That happened at the end of February, when a president was a tricky copy of the Net Prosecutor Charles C. Johnson's based on the GotNews.com website, where Katie Walshi was accused of many of the White House's information periods.
Johnson was permanently removed because of Twitter's suffering, and he had previously distributed wrong accusations and dismissed them later. He also did not present concrete evidence.
In spite of this, Trump was starting to read about the personality of Walsh."
Goldmacher adds that then, the Chief of Personal Reince Priebus and the White House's Officer, Rob Porter, had tried to introduce Trump's management system.
And what was the result?
Kelly's trying the same three months later.
Maybe he becomes a leader more efficient than Priebus, but Trump is still an impulsive one and his helper continues to work on his own matters.
These unchanged realities make Kelly's task very difficult.

The Currents returned a shock over the "millionians."
The most economic employees of West Midlands have again been shocked with self-related circuits that have been able to overcome the shock of the community and to return to the neighbouring game of houses.
The Currents stopped a couple of thousands of households near the street called Solihull.
They were taken away from the region in May, but they were able to overcome the ruler of the world as a shock of ship, and they took together the army of children, horses and packaging.
The Currents were able to overcome the trail that had been abandoned without protecting the pole.
The widowed populations have condemned Solihul to “resolve a problem of complete incapacity”.
The resident of the circuits reports on Sunday's night about Bentley Heath, where they had shooted shooters in the stone.
"It is to try to operate because it seems to be fully able to solve the problem.
The Currents were here in May, and then they went out, but they returned again.
They came to see more tonight and probably even more likely today."
Ashias told that Birmingham had solved the problem by prohibiting access to parks.
"Asun Streetsbrook Road, and it's unbelievable to pay a gift tax when the community can't do anything to the matter."
According to the second unnamed people, it is ridicule that the circuits return soon after they were displaced.
"They are more than they've been, and they've even counted the horse to put the park into the park."
According to the reporter of the Soviet Union, the community is a informal of the unlawful parliamentation near Streetsbrook Road. "We are taking the necessary legal action with the Soviet police to marry the partners as soon as possible.
It is very important for the collection of evidence that, as far as possible, the police makes an advertising or criminal activity the more locally possible.
It helps form a comprehensive picture of the situation towards legal processing."

His feet tragicly lost the Finnish owner again wins the MM's money: "I wouldn't be World Master."
Matti Grand-Hamari celebrated early mid- Wednesday in Finland MM prices in banked slalom in Canada Big White competition.
The big-Hamari wins in the previous box also the cross MM class.
All the MM tests have already been collected in three.
Time unbelievable MMs!
Two times a gold processed, a good time with water, a telephone targeted big-Hamari has enjoyed.
A 30-year-old child grateed his trainer and successful success to prepare in Finland.
The big-Hamar reports that the number of candidates in the species is growing in the whole time.
The whole paralysis has grown and has developed a lot of recent years.
The divisions are small, and there's a lot of new kids together.
I always thought if somebody's going to hold a black horse.
Everybody in the kit seems to be a different winner.
The large-Hamari lost his other feet in the motorcycle in 2009.
He was sweetly counted with his friends until he was a young man, and the accident did not want to get away.
That's the time I'm thinking of what life my life would be without the accident.
But I've always been thinking that it's bad to do it.
Their cards are playing that has been shared, the Great Hammer's weight.
It would be a serious accident of the titulary and the loss of freshness, and nor the Great Hammer did it.
But he turned it into a dark to the front of the difficulty.
Yes, I would say that the situation turned out to the win.
I wouldn't be a third-wide world master without an accident.
Before the accident of 23 years, the largest crowd of the Great Hammer was already in the shooting.
I'm aware of the shock, and I'm going to see the fact that I'm going to see the fact that I'm going to see.
I trained a young man with a boyfriend, and we always shooted the X-Game.
But they were distant skins that smelled some time later.
After the accident, I found myself somehow from the start of the X-Game.
I wouldn't have thought before.
I was 23-year-old and I wondered that this will be a very long life if I'm staying here to be shocked and hurted.
I decided to spend the shoes and start working.
I'm gonna say I've got a good time.
The child was very pleased by a swimming shopman Leo-Pecca from the choice of this year as a sporting year.
The Nelinker Olympic Olympic offered its reward in the sports gate in January.
The Great Hammer says that the Fine winning is an important signal for the vulnerator.
It was a great thing, and the victory was unprecedented.
This will certainly open the eyes to the world.
Because it's time to start a two-fair World Master Matti Grand-Hamar a sporting campaign for the year?
We'll see it for a while.
I'm trying to make my best success.
There's no way that the Great Hamari has ruined all the deceased higher.
The next year, a great goal.
Any years later, paralytics are used in South Korea.
Yeah, we're going out to get a metal!
The majority of Syrian refugees are not believed to return to their home permanently, unless the war ends and Isis's source of the country
A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees was detected in Jordan and Libanon on the opinions and positions of youth slaughterers.
The Syrian refugees packed their bread in the Jordanian flights.
The majority of Syrian adolescents does not believe to return to their home permanently.
They believe that the end of the Syrian war and the coming of the country are the most important things that should happen so that they could return to their home.
Trump's administration does not see this change in the Syrian conflict.
The Meeting Chamber of Burson-Marsteller identified the opinions and positions of young people in international investigation.
Burson Marstel has already investigated the opinions and positions of the Arab species in nine years.
This year, in the A Voice for Young Syrian Refugees, the opinions and positions of youth in Jordan and Lebanon were found.
In February 2017, a total of 400 years old from 18 to 24 years of age, half of which were women and half men.
The pools were held in Jordan and half in Lebanon.
According to the study, more than half of the young secular pagans do not believe to return to their home permanently in the future.
42 per cent of the employees may be thought of returning to their home and 4 per cent has not been told.
The study shows that the home of the young people’s decision affects the main part of the war in Syria as well as the presence of Dad in the country.
Nearly half (47%) of the war remains the most influenced factor for the permanent homelihood, while again fourth thinking that Dad would be the important one to go out of the country.
Only a ten-minute part of the main factors of the decision are the factors of improvement of the economic situation or of the exit of Bashar al-Assad from Syria.
Military actions do not solve conflicts
The Syrian youths asked what is the factor for the decision of conflict.
The majority agrees that the end of the war is more important than President Bashar al-Assad.
The fourth term is that the President of Al-Assad is a stakeholder of peace agreements.
Nearly half of them are experienced that, in order to stop the Syrian conflict, both political and military solutions are needed.
To solve the conflict only through military action, it does not believe just just just a fourth.
The majority of the Syrian refugees is seen in the last year slowly, when five of them are experienced again by strengthening their power.
According to the respondents, the important battle of the Fathers, and normally against the terrorism is that the media would interfere to people that Dad has nothing to do with Islam.
Nearly a large number of were priority to military measures and to reform education.
The tens of reality thinks that it should be important for young people to create better salary jobs.
As regards the impact of the Trump administration in the Syrian conflict, 66 per cent of the respondents believe that conflict is not changed during the Trump administration.
Nearly every fourth believes in the deepest Trump of Syrian conflict.
The men are shared in two regards whether Russia and the participation of Iran have been improved or increased.
Monty Widenius shipping half of its codes to stay in the order - its development of your databases are using, for example, Wikipedia and Google
The MariaDB Employment has developed the database of the open source code of the world's "s fastest growing."
Codifier Michael "Monty" of Widensian's final output does not pay any users, and it can develop a net via any advanced programs.
For example, Google and Wikipedia are the users of the Finnish database, but paying customers do not necessarily be them.
By using databases, the powerful databases remain in the order and fast available.
If you use linkedin, Twitter or Booking.com, they use the MariaDB or MySQL database.
"All information that is not in the image will come from the database, and the images are linked there", explains Widenius.
Widenius, who works as the President of MariaDB's Technology, carries some half of its codes.
The man who does the beautiful hands takes care of the Internet's smiling work.
Widenius developed the most recommended world's source code database with the Swedish David Axmark.
In 2008, the Sun Technology company purchased MySQL with a billion dollars, and a year later, the Oracle programmed the Sun's 7.4 billion.
When the Oracle trade occurred, large part of MySQL developers reported their source.
"They didn't want to do work to Oracle, who did not have certainly promised MySQL's future," Widenius remembers.
He was already established in this stage, a company that began to develop MariaDB.
She didn't want her life work to die.
I paid from Sun for a couple of best developers, and I assured that the continuity of the code will be secured by the same friends who have been engaged in it.
Since MySQL is an open source code database, MariaDB has been able to develop it on its own side.
I just wanted to change my name.
The legislation was established to ensure the freedom of monitoring the development of the MariaDB code.
"In MySQL, these assurances have not been done", Widenius notes.
Although many have heard about Widenia and MySQL's milliardry, the Finnish is not known about MariaDB.
"The last few years our growth has been around 50 percent in the year", reports the Director of the Employee Kenneth Paqvalen.
MariaDB, who is concentrated in growth, does not even win, and Paqvalé is a slightly sense of company.
In the sense, he declares that the cost of the consumption period MariaDB would be evaluated by 20 million euros.
Since the database is free, the company has developed services around which business customers are ready to pay.
MaryDB also helps to change the databases, which may be more than a year, if the customer has been using the closed database.
MySQL changes are successful at the moment because they are versions of each other.
In other cases, the largest Spanish operator Telephonic and Kaakois Asian DBS are MariaDB customers.
The most favourable pillar services, such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Alababhan Cloud, provides for their customers MariaDB.
In addition, MariaDB automatically expands new users in the distribution packages of Linux systems where MariaDB has long replaced MySQL.
Although we're a small company, we have contacts with the biggest pieces.
"Our Asian group has the largest teleoperators in the world, players, banks and even some of the central banks," the Paqvale list.
Data database markets are still enabled by waste databases such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP.
MySQL is also unrequisite for the traditionally closed database from the company.
Although the biggest database companies have lost their market share in the past few years, MariaDB's switch is still unexpected, although rapidly increased.
About 50 billion dollars on the database market, the databases of the open source code do not even exceed the billion.
However, the weight value of the open source code can only be measured in money because the majority of the users do not pay any of these programs.
The research company Gartner predicts that in 2018 the companys have already developed more than 70 % of their internal applications to the open databases.
Furthermore, more than half of the old databases would then be changed to open or transition.
Employment companies do not receive new customers, since most of them are selected to the following source code.
This has led to the fact that the licensing payments of commercial databases have been delayed to the pillars.
The company wants to make the same money as previously smaller customers," Widenius pointed out.
Since the changing of the closed database is difficulty, most of the customers have a decline of prices in their hearing.
"I'm a lot of customers that are really difficult to move, because their old applications and others are closed on the database", says Widenius.
He still believes that the measure of customers is in full.
When the license payments are increased each year, the customer shall be transferred to the database of the open source code.
The price is 10-20% more than the previous, and the better service is because the customer can easily change to another database.
In addition, many enterprises have large system changes when they move their operations to pillar services.
In addition, many changes the database program.
Lastly, MariaDB received EUR 25 million from the European Investment Bank from the EIB.
It was the largest growth financing ever granted to the Northern countries.
The firms have about 115 employees worldwide and are intended to repay now.
One of the reasons for the financing of the EIB was the impact of MariaDB on public loan projects.
Enterprise has customers of the public sector, for example, in Britain and Germany.
The public sector in Europe will pay billions of euros annually from databases.
"Another country wants to move to the solutions of the open source code and use taxes more effectively", says Paqvale.
The widespread deterioration of how money in Finland is made to the closed health care systems when open systems are more harder and the conditioner is not one of the software companies.
Some say that the open source code is ideology, but I think it's the best way to make a code.
The community helps and does what is not designed or can be done.
Widenius, 55-year-old, belongs to another Finnish, Linux developer Linus Torvalds, who are the most known source code.
Widenius helps other enterprises to develop operational business schemes on the open source code.
I still like 4-5 discussions on the world's subject annually.
Italy considers its relationship with civil organizations' savings ships
Italy has warned citizens who save their vessels in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue to continue, unless they are able to comply with new rules on their activities.
"If citizens organizations don't join the new action, it is difficult to see how they can continue their activities," Mr Marco Minniti said in the discussion of the Torino newspaper La Stampa.
The Minitit warning came on a day after the Italian authorities were shuttled by the German Jugend Rettet assistant organization, and its men, in doubt, cooperating with human vessels that promoted immigration.
Only a year ago the assisting organization refused to comment on the accused Ambrogio Cartosion's detainees.
"We are very regretting that we are not able to operate in the search and salvation area at this time," the organization announced in the social media in its opinion published.
"We can evaluate the decisions just when we took all the necessary information and we can evaluate the situation."
The Italian authorities were watched since October from the Iuven-Organization of Jugend Rettet.
The man is doubtless taken to the ship of voluntary refugees directly from human vessels who received the re-introduction of them.
One of these cases is claimed to be slaughtered just a few miles away from the libyan beach, and the information will be found on the document of the accused person whose content of the Italian information instruments are published.
The man doubts that the Italian coast station is threatened to control the savings activities in the area, and the reasons for help are considered to be intrigued.
According to the approach of action, ships such as Iuvena should be together with the Italian police that monitors the activity.
Only three of the nine citizens organizations participating in research and salvation activities have agreed to comply with the action guide: Save children and the Malta MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms,
who reported to the new rules that would be unnecessary but acceptable because they do not cause "important changes or obstacles" of the Organization.
In the group of refused acts, the physicians have been paid without border organization.
In addition, the Minister stated that the number of transferers in Italy have been slowly calculated in the last few weeks, as it stated, that the action to strengthen the Libyan Beach Watch and to cooperate with local cities leaders will start producing results.
"In the last days we have started to see light on the tunnel," said the minister.
He realized that the plans are to continue the discussions with Libya's city leaders on projects of economic development and on measures to reduce the number of refugees in Europe.
The counterparty suspected his murder in the Enontech, the suspect found on the land... the case to the accused person.
The uncertain crime occurred in December last.
According to the police, his 36-year-old man suspectedly killed his 26-year-old skotlanian opening copy.
It's been told before that both of them were shopping workers.
The police's been telling that the suspect would have gone with two dogs in the land after it.
The man was found to be cold from the land, and he didn't make a reaction when he took it.
There's a reason to get up in a week.
The meeting is obtained in the Lap's arms rights during August.
Robert Hardy, known as Harry Potter and all my friends, is dead.
The British observer Robert Hardy is dead for 91 years.
The spectator's death reported to this family as a tour.
In 1925, Hardy was born as a 24-year-old shower in the theatre.
During his long time, he also showed a film and a television.
Hardy is particularly reminded of the role of Major Cornelius Toffee in the Harry Potter photos and its animal role in James Herriot, based on all the charming friends of my TV.
The recommended BBC series were described through all seven.
Michelle Carter was sentenced in prison of self-assaulted text messages.
The Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and half a year in prison for text messages and phones that she was seen as her overwhelming boyfriend Conrad Roy's suicide.
Michelle Carter, 20, takes 15 months in prison and five years in the case.
Carter was sentenced in June and his boyfriend Conrad Roy made suicide 13.7.2014.
"My family has been destroyed," my father said at the toursite.
"My son was my best friend."
Carter's got a change in the court and was waiting for a complaint processing in freedom.
He threatened 20 years of sentence, but, according to his lawyers, both Carter and Roy suffered from mental health problems.
Carter, who was buried in the red shoes and a shirt color puzzle, listened to his hands in the crust as a shocked look in the land.
"What he did, killed Conrad Roy," the accused said to the court.
"He decided to improve Conradie's life.
He didn't take the responsibility of it." The accused continued.
"He hasn't shown the ransom."
Carter's lawyer said that the case was caused by the "excellent circumstances that Carter is deeply deep."
However, judge Lawrence Moniz agreed that Carter did not have an important impact on his work.
The guilt reads Conradi's mother's statement, Lynn Roy, where she told her, "I'm not going to wake up my loved son to die.
I want that he may be proud of me, and of how I have survived all of this, and I try to comfort his sister in this pain that we will always be slaughtered."
Conradia's sister Camdy Roy told the court that he's "free" thinking that he's never going to see his brother's wedding and not to be a daughter of his children.
"I'm a painful to lose a man who has been in my life every day since I was born, it's never heavy," Camdy said.
There is no law in the Massachusetts State, which indicates that self-suicide would be a crime.
Carter was 17-year-old when Roy was found from the car to die in 2014.
The meeting raised the Kingdom attention when it appeared that Carter was in the text message overwhelming his boyfriend to make self - murder.
"I don't know how it's like," Carter wrote in many messages she had sent to Roy two weeks before this death.
Just a minute before Roy's self-smooth Carter wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "You just have to start a generator, and you're free and happy."
The judge Moniz said that Carter was taking care of Roy's death, and the judge said that he wasn't able to benefit from the case by giving discussions.
The meeting has shared the opinions of experts.
There's only a rare defense of Carter, one of the defenders is Amanda Knox, 30 who was sentenced to the murder of the British council in Italy in 2007, and he was released two years later.
Los Angeles Times published the Knox's opinion description, which says: "Miche Carter needs late and help, no prison."
Prime Minister of Naton: You interrupted Russia's worst war on the worst
The military unions between Nato and Russia have been clearly degraded, commented by the Secretary-General of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in the Ukrainian conflict.
I think that Naton's relationship to Russia is now more difficult than ever after the end of the war, Stoltenberg said in the debate of the CNN.
After the end of the war, we hoped that we could work closely with Russia.
However, in particular after the unlawful accession of Crime in 2014 and the continuing inestablishment of the Russian Eastern and Ukraine, the relationship with the Russians has been significantly deteriorated.
However, Stoltenberg says that Nato has still been able to act so that the shocks would not be slaughtered.
So long as we are strong and so long as we can predict, we can visit Russia's political dialogue to avoid the switch of the situation and the new cold war.
Before the comments of Stoltenberg, President Donald Trump, the U.S. President of the United States had even been a dangerous level.
Trump urged the country to thank the bad congress that adopted the new Russian counterparts last week.
Audi makes changes because of the experience of car manufacturers in 850 000 diesel engine
Day before Aud's notification BMW offered to update more than 350 000 car software.
The director of BMW said to the company that "no more reasonable options than the vehicle limits." He refers to European cities, including BMW’s home town in Munchen, which considers the limitation or prohibition of the use of the vehicles.
Daimler reported the changes in its work to reduce diesel emissions to more than three million Mercede's motors.
No company talked about the return.
European car manufacturers have severely marketed the use of steel vehicles in Europe and in the United States to achieve the objectives of CO2 emissions.
The typical typical emissions of the cell motors are considered to cause cancer and asthma.
The costs of installation of emissions neutralizing devices are increased, in which the cars are difficult to cost competitively.
The German car producers are slightly sighted, and Angela Merkel’s officials were accused of visiting large car companies and problems.
Companies try to avoid Volkswagen's errors. Volkswagen installed cars of shocking devices that reduced emissions in accordance with the rules. In the general period, emissions were greater.
several of the civilian leaders have been assaulted in the United States, but the leaders are investigated both sides of Atlantic.
In the last month, the director of the former thermodynamic department of Aud's motorcycle was arrested in Germany.
Zacheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian, so it can be resigned to the United States for possible courts.
The authorities suspected that Audi had installed a system that could be able to run the European emissions requirements, based on an investigation in the United States.
The Aud investigation can decrease significantly the position of the Volkswagen: the share of the manufacturer of shipping cars is insufficiently large.
From the vote of Venezuela, it started a vilpipe study, the fathers of mind exhibited
According to the company, the number of voters reported by the Venezuelan authorities is at least a million than the real voters.
This is an unpredictable opinion from the company who has no role in the result, President Tibisay Lucenan said to the donors.
Maduro convinces the end of the crisis
Venezuela was elected on Sunday by a sworn vote representative intended to change the Constitution of the country.
The opposition has criticized the vote strongly and organized its changes against the opinions.
The opposition that is opposed to Maduro has cut off its own impressions so that they would be launched at the time of the appointment.
According to the El Paz magazine, the national security teams started in the middle of a week of the local time to take their desire to the country's parliamental construction.
The squad is intended to ensure the security of appointment.
Air change threatens Provence Lavender
The Lavenian list has become a symbol of the South-Lanska Provence region, but now it threatens climate change.
Lavenal has been reduced because of skins and diseases, and researchers and farmers are trying to find a problem solving.
"Lavenl has been directly reduced in the Caribbean Provence, since it has suffered the impact of the climate change last years, and in particular the numbers of skins have been clearly reduced," says the special expert of the CRIEPAM Institute for Agricultural Studies, Eric Chaisse.
"This slows the lavender's lifetime.
Furthermore, the slightness has produced many small cuttings in the region that spread microbacteria."
The taxes are hard.
Lavenal oil is cutting to tourists, and it is also very desired in the skin and cosmetic material.
"Instead of smaller stars and largest flowers we now have smaller flowers that are weakly developed or weak or missed," Chaise says.
"In other words, the parts contained in Southern Oil are less less than."
The solution is made by enhancing the smell, cutting the density of the earth and smelling the plants by protecting the grain and water, and also developing a more sustainable species.
The killer's murder appears to growing threats in Mexico
On a weekly, the posting of the Riodoce analogic newspaper is generally assembled to discuss how the newspaper addresses the most important cases relating to organized crime, corrupted authorities and the endless drug war in the Singapore State.
Today, however, we are discussing security because of the recent tragedy.
The operators have been encouraged to change their daily routines.
Two test providers are discussing who is more safe: leave children home or take them with the provision of the kranat attack in 2009.
The security reporters have written three words: opposers, neutralists, unions.
They ask the suppliers to each group. Proofs do not need, notices and knowledge are sufficient.
The table contains names of drug traffickers, politicians, entrepreneurs and providers who are suspected of the rewards of government or drug cards.
Poverty is unfavourable, and still more than the attacks are suppliers. According to the Protection Committee, at least 25 employees have been killed after President Enrique Peña Nieto in December 2012. In the protection of the Member State, 589 attacks and threats, at least seven employees have been killed in the seventh country.
The latest victim is Javier Valdez Cardenas, the founder, the supplier and the source of intelligence.
"The big error is to live in Mexico and to be a provider", Valdez wrote together with many of its drug violence writings.
He is deeply rounded, even though he is present over all things. The publicity of the Riodoce's building holds a magnificent picture where Valdez looks at the middle. The image reads: "Reality". The three types of suppliers Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez have been cut into T-shirt that correct the faces of Valdez. Valdez has sights and goods formed panamas.
The assembly is held at least two months after Valdez’s death, and the employees discuss their common trauma, their painfulness, their unsoundlessness and persecution.
In 2010, the Judiciary of the Federal State was established for the treatment of cases of providers, but, according to the Protection Committee, only two sentences have been raised.
The murders of the employees are only a rare case, just as thousands of drug trafficking and organized crimes have been dealt with in a court for the year.
The Riodox providers will continue to write violence from Sinala, although they are worse and the situation is most dangerous.
Ibarra says that there is only a little benefit from the Security Meeting, because the killers are not in knowledge and there is no hope of justice.
"This meeting is directly known as a temporary fashion," he says.
"We can't trust anyone as long as we don't know why it happened."
Valdez was deleted from Riodoce, the capital of the state in Culiacan, morning 15.5.2017.
He was ageing in the red Toyotal only a couple of cards on the way when two men stopped him and packed out of the car and shooted twelve shoes.
Ampaña's driven out of Valdez's car and put it on some way.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left his wife and two teenage children.
The smells move rapidly and slowly in the California.
However, Valdez's death is a murderer.
Sinalo has been more bloody fighters in Mexico after Guzman was arrested last year and was disfellowshipped in the United States in January.
On the streets of the Sinal, some or several people die every day, and in the narcotic land, they have shooting double shoes, which are larger than many households.
In the Raniko State, only one cartle controls hundreds and drug traffic routes to the United States.
Although Valdez was very well-known about the dangers of his work, Riodoce founder and director, 60-year-old Ismail Bojorquez feels guilty that he couldn't protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes have caused Valdez's murder.
In February, Riodoce published Damaso Lopez's debate and leads to a competitive group that is going to fight against Guzman's sons.
It could have been shocked by Guzman’s sons: as a suspected clients buying a newspaper immediately when the newspaper came to the sell points.
Another error was that Valdezia was not forced to go out of the country after the second publications of the same issue were the object of the attack.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and foreign countries, and his murder was considered a traduction in violence against employees.
She had learned so many of his friends and colleagues did not have any more fear for him.
He was done a long tour in Noroest when he decided to build five colleagues with Riodoce in 2003. The newspaper shares were sold at $50 at that time.
In Sinaloa, "I was unable to make journalism unlike drug problems", says Bojorquez.
In the meantime, the newspaper began to feel courageous and honest, and its sales and results of the news faced.
The employees appreciated the possibility of publicly investigating journalisms without fear of sensual sensation, and readers learned about things that no one else had shocked about the publications.
After eight years of its creation, Riodoce wind her appreciation for the news of Maria Moors Cabot in Latin America.
In that year, Valdez was urged to follow the history of the Mexican drug trade of the Protection Committee of International Public Freedom.
He accepted his fear openly.
"I want to continue my life," he said when he obtained the payment of the Protection Committee of Providers.
Drug trade is in Sinalo "life mode", Valdez said to Rompevento TV's debate last October.
"The employee must take to him a slaughtering task, or showing the stupid.
I don't want anybody to ask me where I was when the dinner was dwelling here -- why didn't I tell you what was going on?"
Riodoce’s staff is going to take Valdezia — a smooth pushing as a hundred workers, and they know a friend who has always received the appreciation and counsel.
They trusted his rutins.
He's always used at the pants.
She went to the mission in the Gayabo bar, and she was always on the same table.
Now they're wondering if the rutins were cut on him.
The death of a colleague has also been able to consider how they can better do their work and remain spiritually.
"In case we treat their women and children and their clean business, their secret thanks to drug trafficking.
They were left outside the shops," says Bojorquez.
In the best case, it would mean strong self-sensitive and self-protection,
I want to trust you in your own ways.
If you feel that everything isn't on it, you must stay away.
The problem is, according to Andres Villarreal, the employee of Riodoce, that "the effects can be able to smile, and so happened in Javier."
Old rules are no longer low in Sinalo, nor are they lost in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrera and other Member States with dangerous networks: disabled secret transport systems, weak offices and corrupted authorities.
The environment of action continues to change.
A number of days ago, the telephones could not be imported into a room where Riodoz’s security education was considered.
On the outside of the structure, two cops were forced to protect the tree from 40 degrees.
The Government of the State was intended to guard the offices of Rhodox in the Mediterranean building in the Kalifornican region.
Some providers estimated whether these two police were part of the 50% of the team that the Ombudsman of the State did not have to be trusted.
There have been months later when the suppliers had traveled to drugs by dominating the mountain rural area.
This week number of Riodoce delivered three quarters after the end.
Narcotics Summary Julio Cesar Chavez's brother was killed in Sinalo.
The newspaper also tried to discover that the use of the government’s money was focused on the city of the headquarters.
In addition, together with the most important restaurants of Queliacan, which I just cut from the accusator's office, the group of people was disrupted.
There was no official information about whom was defeated and how, so it was to be carefully advanced: all the cities knew that restaurant was both drugs and authorities in the recommendation of drugs.
The employee has found public documents that the restaurant was registered by the name of a institutional revolutionary partner (PRI) policy. PRI has managed Mexico's policy at nearly a century.
In cases of publicity, it has been denied by corruption.
Villareal requested the provider to write the best cases in the same place. Some of them "El Chapo" son of Guzman could run and avoid a military racist.
A few months ago, readers would have known that they would have received a trust in the Valdez column.
"With before we knew what happened," says the 46-year-old Villareal, who has been able to cut her body structure because of his sweet name "El Flaco", Hokuina.
"It's all the contacts with our sources are too much."
Valdez’s work room has been changed to a store where the persecutors are maintained injuries to kitchens and towers. The workers of the newspaper have received a new, unexpected task: they have been able to participate in the free news.
The employer Miriam Ramirez took with her a few villages next morning to the representative of the local accused Agency, which was reasonable for the murder of the new prosecutor.
Salvador Adame died in the west state of Michoacan three days after the murder of Valdez.
After the disappearing, a fuel body found based on DNA tests of the authorities is Adame.
The employees have began to protest more and more in the whole country, and the texts "SOS Press" appear in the Mediterranean addresses.
Today, Director Bojorquez is in Washington where he tries to obtain international support for the investigation of Valdez.
On the day of Valdez's murder, Ramirez met the Ombudsman of Sinalbu and accused the authorities of stability and killing because they were telling the truth.
He therefore has asked him to be transferred from the government of the treaty cases because he is concerned that it is not able to be objective.
Valdez was repeated that the suppliers in Mexico have increased organized crime, criminality allows authorities and interim society.
In the latest book of the Drug Journalist Valdez writes that drugs are killed by translators, but they are also killed by the command of political and security teams in the joint understanding of the crime.
According to Article 19, over half of the attacks faced by the employees last year were the duration of the police and the authorities.
"Where people are silent by killing", Ramirez says.
Murh has an impact on it.
Nobody forgot the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias to die in the border of Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was with the message signed by Zeta Kartel, "I'm because of my writings."
He left his head next to his computer, had the keyboards and the hearings of the computer.
Some magazines have decided to stop their activities, such as the same El Nord magazine in the northern Chihuahua border country, sweet Miroslava Breach, after the murder of the marine murder.
Some of them continues to work, such as Nuevo Laredon El Manana, although the director was killed in 2004.
In 2010 Diario de Ciudad Juarez published a message to the urinary article: "What do you want from us?"
Some suppliers have escaped from their States or from the whole country.
The decision is difficult.
The land has difficult to find work, and the whole time must be safe.
Sometimes criminals are looking for their supplier's hands, such as it seems to have been a photographer Ruben Espinos who was killed with four women in a residence in Mexico City in 2015 three months after her flying from Veracruz.
Those who continue to work every day are full of dangerous decisions.
Ibarra — whose time had to be a skilled — admits that the writing of drugs is afraid.
"I'm a translator, because Mexico's on the sky's way," he says.
Some time ago, Riodoce suppliers sit on Monday afternoon in front of the delivery at a footnote when the new number was prepared.
In the shock of Mazatlan, between competitive jewels and security teams, 19 people died.
The war was pleasant, as was promised in the message of the cartel found from the region.
The employees set up the news on the Riodoce web sites with their smartphones.
The invitation should be re-established on the next day.
The Syrians slopeed nearby... a new shooting attack.
Bojorquez shocked the guard police:
If they were scared, they were very well cutting it.
The Riodoce delivered the murderer of the magazine under this massive shape, where a man appears to the whole Sinalo.
Bojorquez says that you can't even think about stopping the operation. "How can I stop the magazine when our practitioner asked to go to the street to do things still on the same day when Javier was killed?"

Dinosaurus protected its enemy by the appointment
First, it looks horrible from the country.
Now, researchers have revealed the first research results of a Canadian powder's body, which had so much maintained that experts call it a dinosaur of Mona Lises.
It was so well that the researchers could even determine that their finish skin was red and that was “unfortunate past”.
According to the Current Biology magazine, it is the most preserved dinosaur and the best representatives of their species in the world in all times.
Nevertheless, the fossil found has nodosaur, which is 110 to 112 million years ago.
Scientists believe that this amazing well-conserved fossil is really important to find out.
According to the National Geographic magazine, panoramated plants have typically remained fossil in the best times of all times.
It found the Suncor Millennium Hair, located in the Northern Alberta Canada, on December 21, 2011, and the founder was the name of Shawn Funk.
He was part of something that didn’t feel an environmental part of the environment, and decided to investigate his finding better.
The fosil found from the callium was sent to the reign paleonological museum of Tyrrell.
There was a heavy swimming out of the swimming powder of 1100 kg for six years.
The results of a great job are now available.
"If you stop the eye, you can almost believe that it was in sleep", says scientist Caleb Brown, who works as a researcher at the king Museum of Tyrrell.
"The science remains in the history of Mona Lisana, together with the most beautiful and best-served dinosaurs.
In recent studies, it was likely to be an important threat to this farmer, although it was a panzer, and it reminded the walking gas lines.
The red white panzer blew from its listers and also protected it from the head more sweet and higher color, which continues to appear in many animals.
According to experts, it has been better able to defeat its environment and to defeat enemy, larger dinosaurs.
110 million years old Nodosaurus increased in May, and it is now shown in the king paleonology Museum of Tyrrell.
Scientists gave the name of the Mark Mitchell museum in Borealop, according to Mark Mitchell. Mitchell belonged to the team that took over 70,000 hours to the dinosaurs.
Nodosaurus has remained so surprising that the teams of Mitchell and international researchers have been able to determine the pictures and forms of the body of the fingers and panzer.
They found that you have protected it in the animal world even more common coloring, with a body more sweet and higher.
Nevertheless, it was surprising because Borealop has significantly greater than the current animals with corresponding color.
It may conclude that the meat eating dinosaurities have received that evolution recommends to hide instead of fighting.
Today’s animals, for example, in skins, skeepers and armicles, have the same color, which is significantly smaller and therefore easier, which indicates that nodosaurus was seriously threatened.
"Breat, strongly inclined to pansaroid dinosaur tells how dangerous dinosaurs of association were," brewn says.
Chemical analysis of the organic combinations of the filters of nodosea shows that its skin was a red skin.
Scientists continue to investigate the nodoseaur to make the conclusions of their life, and, in other words, study the content of it in order to find out what it eat in their last food.
Scientists believe that when he died, it was thinking of the sea where it put it on the ground of the sea.
At that time, Albert had the same warmness as today in Florida, and the waters and seas probably were far more slower than now.
"This nodosaur is really important, because its finish key has been maintained and has also remained thirdly in its original form," brewn states.
"Why it seems almost the same as the premature convergence period
It doesn't require a lot of thinking: if you smell a little eyes, you can almost believe that it was sleeping."
Your association was the time of the dinosaurs of the earthquakes, the great two-fathers, the time of the dinosaurs of the flesh.
Though their king, Tyronsaurus rex, or a million years ago, Borealope, his magnificent priests have been able to overwhelm this panoramated dinosaur.
Tironsaurus rex, for example, belonged to Acrocanthosaurus, about 11,5 meters long, six tons.
The newest findings of Nodosaur’s researchers have been published in the Current Biology magazine, and they believe that Borealop has been disappointed from the sea after the death of the sea and has been changed otherwise.
It found the Suncor Millennium Hair, located in the Northern Alberta Canada, on December 21, 2011, and the founder was the name of Shawn Funk.
According to the museum, it has remained the most panoramated dinosaurus in the world from the skin and panaline to the end.
It was a medium of five feet (5 m) long and weighed even 1 300 kg.
They were two and a half feet [2 m] of the wheel.
Scientists believe that this panoramated plants passed through the current Western Canada until they came to the open sea.
The panzer has remained small details later in the sea dark.
The fossilised remains have remained so well that the skin is still remaining in the sleeves of the puzzle on its skin.
Michael Greshko also wrote in the National Geographic magazine that this maintenance is "which rare as loneliness.
Whatever it looks better, it feels more incredible.
In its mortal disks, it is still focalized with skins.
Its right front is in the village, five upstairs.
I can also calculate the filter of the base of it."
How did one activeist learn to answer the question: Who belongs to the streets?
Brittany Ferrell was deeply angry 9.8.2014.
She had arrived a day ago in New York, home from St. Louis, and sit in his airbnb bed with his telephone.
And then he saw the message on the box:
"Your police killed a 18-year-old young man, and his body is still on the street."
When he was awesome, she noted that nobody else had sent the same information to his feet, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
At his time, there were several re-electors from the user @TheePharoah.
The user name is St. Louis's resident switch that tweed on the reality of Michael Brown's death, and a white police was shooted in an unarmed 18-year-old Black Brown's Ferguson in Missour's state.
The user also posted a picture from Brown’s life’s body on the street where it was left for four hours.
"This is unbelievable," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to him and his community.
When he returned to Twitter the same night, there were people who were collecting Canfield Drive.
Users posted pictures of the police shut up and smiling people, as well as Brown's self-declared man in the villages: "The police of Ferguson killed my unarmed son!"
Ferrell followed real-time videos in which the police was standing in front of the clusters with the dog.
He also tells her a video where the other police shocked his shock and shouted, "I'll take you all... animals."
"This isn't normal," Ferrell remembers.
"It wasn't the murder we've already done and could be typical.
Then I felt cold colors.
I was angry, and I was crying."
He stood the back home for the next day.
The machine was counted on a night, and Ferrell was looking for his 6-year-old daughter to trust his father and decided that they would go to Ferguson next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in nearly three years later has been done a documentation "Whose Streets?". It received his first night in films at 11.8.2017.
The movie is a story of survival and mind, love and loss, and the strength and sinkness of local people who went to the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell traveled to Farguson's wood and with her together with her daughter who was slaughtered, they went back to the conversation "We have lived in black and where they were". They spoke about unreadful accounts before that morning.
"Remember, when I told you how black people have been struggled for the things they believe?" Ferrell remembers her daughter.
"We're going to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy, and it's not true."
"I couldn't be without taking my daughter with me," Ferrell later said.
"The events of this day are... the highlight of the past events.
My daughter has the right to know it and to grow up.
He must be prepared to active and organize, but he must also know the different accounts and circumstances of the black life experience. And he needs to know what we need to do to free to free our own.
Even though I was happy to protect her from a weird race, he is even the same as other black girls.
I feel that I would harm him if I protect him from the reality."
Their first stoppers in Ferguson were South Florient Road, which was a police officer, and they became an activist office when they were waiting for information about the case and finally found that the police would not rape a crime.
From there, Ferrell and his daughter went to help a local employer who made a lunch package.
They flew dinners to the puzzles and shared them to the psychopaths.
Ferrell began to re-examinate the relationship with the activeism.
“ My work has changed completely after August 9,” she says. When he studied at the Missouri University of St. Louis Ferrell was the President of the hospital organization of nurses in minorities, and then he focused on food laws and health services in black communities.
"I didn't have any experience of organizing.
There's only one thing that happened."
A few weeks later, Ferrell met a nightmare advisor in Sabaah Folayan, a assistant of the document.
Folayan said he and the describer Lucas Alvarado-Farrar would just want to tell what was happening.
Ferrelli's thinking was so suspicious, and he asked, "Do you really want to tell me what's going on, or do you want a story that you can use for good?"
They were unleavenable, when the local community had appeared, usually white people who wanted only to benefit from their difficulties and skinness.
"We heard that there was no common voice for born in Ferguson," Foussan said, silently, "we wanted to do things differently."
Folayan had already been connected to Damon Davis, a visitor who was known to act in the couples of death caused prisons.
In addition to Davids, Ferrelli went to the project together with six other locals, and the description group followed the fire of Brown in the following years.
"This is not a document where someone speaks to us or speaks for us, but we're talking," says Davis.
"I was most important to how local people are presented in the film because I was presented in the same way."
Folayan said he was not focused on the experiences of Ferrelli, because he wanted to seem to be a "no matter of the carristic leader, but of the community."
This is why the documents are seeing a surprising private part of Ferrelli’s life, such as love and marriage.
"I knew myself time to be disappointed," Ferrell smile when she told him how to see the film first.
"But I understood that this work and the human description of blacks requires a certain deterioration."
In addition, Ferrelli's history and re-engage in the meantime in the most largest Black Lives Matter.
Once the police had shot a black son, Trayvo Martin, in 2012, and two of the three founders of the application were the same as Queer identity.
"The leadership of Queer Women has been over the whole movement," says Ferrell. "It's because we're going to be fighting on many sides.
You're smelling Queer kids have been able to keep everything."
Folayan has the same opinion: "Arely, the black women are surprised to have a lot of Queer-Needs."
However, he stressed that Ferrelli was not selected in the document because of its Queer identifier.
"He's got the energy movement," Folayan says.
"But there is no shock that he was in front, but the sweet girls live many things in the surgery, and they have a lot in the game.
His energy is interrupted through the white pool."
The new description groups have left Ferguson for a long time, but the between the Community and the police are still crying.
Ferrell has another two and half years of rest of the United States, and he was sentenced on the support of motors.
His description of the aircraft of the social policy of its homes is short and slow, "From."
However, he continues to trust in a shock that he learned outside Ferguson streets three years ago:
"We have to fight our freedom.
Our obligation is to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We can just lose our coffee."
Successful uniformity: the artist creates pictures of the DNA of Chelsea Manning
The Fridman gallery in New York has been removed in the midst of the faces — white, black and Russian faces, which can be seen in a closer sense of harmonity.
These 30 works are the forms of the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, which are based on the head of Chelsea Manning and the DNA views of the hair.
Manning sent exhibitions from Fort Leavenworth's prison in which he performed 35 years of court. Manning was condemned to be secretized for the WikiLeaks site.
Dewey-Hagborgin A Becoming Resemblence was opened 2.8.2017.
It has two years of a letter change between Dewey-Hagborg and Manning. Dewey-Hagborg combines the work of technology, computer technology and art. Manning is transnatal and busy one who has a prison judge Barack Obama on the third day of his office.
Dewey-Hagborg analyzed the DNA of Manning and made 30 pictures based on its genetics. They are awesome, sometimes a little theoretical emphasis on the adjustability of DNA data, multimodality and reason-related relationships with the background of the interpretations, and were identified.
Chelsea Manning, her born, Bradley Edward, has openly told her sister to the same woman that was already murdered.
The sentence of Manning in prison was only one picture: a swimming, black, white sound where the swimming Manning sits in the car where the driver is sit.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg had a large recommendation from Stranger Visions, which he carried out in 2012.
He made pictures on the basis of criminal information, and he received DNA information, such as tuberculosis and smoke, and made pictures of what people had been concerned to show.
Then the artist got e-mail from the Magazine magazine.
"They discussed Chelsea Manning and needed a picture of the story." Dewey-Hagborg told a new show in the state of information.
Manning's home wasn't allowed to visit and he couldn't be able to picture in the prison, so the newspaper took contact with Chelsea and asked if he was interested in making the manning DNA picture.
The artist and his prison, on the other hand, became surprising of letters, and they wrote to each other for a couple of years.
They even done together a Superpressed Image Search book, which was pictured by Shoili Kanungo, which was described in the future where the President would have put the trial of Chelsea and he would be able to look at the show.
In fact, Obama slowed the sentence of Manning only a few days after a series of publications, which was happy after seven years in the army prisoner.
It is also affected that the display is opened right now when Donald Trump goes to his war against the data years and transsocial soldiers and finds new ways in Twitter to strengthen the powerful two periods that he had to take in this matter.
Dewey-Hagborg believes "the whole thing has its purpose."
At the wall of Galleria, the great name of the artist and under the Manning, where the name of the family is the heart. In his statement, the artist requires the end of the "automatic division that has been based on sex, race, sexuality and culture".
At the random wall, the DNA period of Manning is written in slow-scale of the long C, G and A books.
This 200 letters — or nucleotics, such as the scientific definition used by the artist — is part of the combined Dewey-Hagborg wants to consider how similar we all are, at least our biological.
"I hope my exhibition helps people understand that we are of our most identical values and that the genetics are very personal and open to the balls," Dewey-Hagborg says. The show also shows its Spurious Memoriations video from 2007.
"DNA's telling about unreadable stories, there's 30 before them."
The last work of the display is in its own room: from the series of pages of Maning and Dewey-Hagborg.
There's Maning's smell of the prison like King Kong, handing my megaphone.
"If they get you silent, they've won," reads.
"Don't ever hurt."
"The text is of the letter I received from Maning," the artist from Philadelphia tells.
"It's so affected that I still get cold colors."
Instead of being described in the series, Manning has not yet seen a display. When Manning comes to the place, he welcomed her on his own genetics faces as well as a group of mental publishers in the midst of the display condition.
It is essential, as all other in this display: for example, the DNA period of Manning is written in slow height, which is equal to its length (157,5 cm).

He told the security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We know that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi says.

The threat was not involved in the events of the bookshop.
The authorities noted that Moffatt had been slaughtered in the same way as the question of the book trade events, the police reporter said.

"We will take action in the way of the decision in accordance with the WADA map" – Minister of Russia's stock, Vitaly,
The Russian Prime Minister Vitaly notes that Russia immediately takes the decision under the WADA World Antidoping Office, which can be returned to RUSADA's powers.
"A few measures in accordance with the map have already been implemented, and RUSADA had the right to plan and test in cooperation with the UKAD of the British Anti-Downing Association.
The WDA card has been updated from these parts," said not in the tour.
The Deputy Minister has commented on the other part of the WADA map where the conditions are defined to restore RUSDA's powers. The second part of the map was recently published on the website of the organization.
I don't think it's in no concern for Russia.
"All have been reported, and everything will be done.
The results are presented to the International Olympic Committee and WADA for the next."
However, one of the guidelines requires that the Russian anti-doping authorities accept the terms of WADA, which are the results of the Canadian jurisprudence Richard McLaren's investigation.
Indeed, not it said: "Attention is started because our antidoping system has admitted the failure.
All measures have been implemented.
The national programs were not, and we can't admit what was not existing."
In many words, Vitaly Smirnov, President of the Russian self-double public antidoping Agency, was the opinion.
On the same day, Smirnov agreed that the Russian antidoping body had problems. "We have said a number of reports that the report has an important encouragement and rules.
We don't want to accept the report, but he adds.
WADA decided to stop the Doping Control in Russia in November 2015 when the doping chandal was discovered.
However, in June, it was authorized to plan and coordinate the test in the monitoring of international experts and UKAD.
In July, Olympic Director Olivier Niggli visited the headquarter of RUSADA in Moscow. After the visit, he said that the organization was "weight on the right way" to restore powers.
The British Organization skeptics about the lovely innovation of Finnish: "No proof"
The British Organization suspects the benefits of the Finnish mother packs.
In other words, BBC and Guardian reports that the Lullaby Trust organization, who fights against hands, refuses the use of his own motherhoods in the divided packages in Britain.
The sharing of maternal packs to all pregnant women will be started in skotland this month.
The packaging is also shared in some regions in England.
According to Lullaby Trust, there is no evidence that the maternal pack would reduce the risk of the death of the mother.
The death of the babies means an unexpected shock death.
Lullaby Trust works as a specialist of the British Health Authorities in the child's safe sleep room.
We don't let our official presentations to them anymore, because it would understand that we recommend this product, the organization has informed.
Finnish has one of the lowest children’s mortality in the world, only two thousand dead births.
According to Lullaby Trust, the Finnish good reading is a result of many different reasons, such as the number of smaller teenergics.
If there is a box for each family, it may be one factor.
However, it can't be sure that, the Director of Director Lullaby Trust said, Francine Bates.
We are concerned that motherhoods are marketed as products that reduce children's mortality and handsome deaths.
The case of the mother is a Finnish discovery, and it has been provided freely to all mothers for 80 years in Finland.
The packaging contains various requirements, such as children's clothes.
This year, there's 53 products in the pack.
Indeed, the packaging is a bad box where the child can sleep.
According to the Scotland government, its shared boxes are satisfied with all security standards.
Lullaby Trust said that there is no security standard for bad bedrooms.
According to Lullaby Trust, the package may be the best option for sleep map time if you are not available with swimming or thicking.
The system recommends use of packaging only for day and stop the use of it at the stage when the child is able to turn.
The system also recommends to keep animals from the pack and take care of not being baptized or healed.
I'm going to smell a shock from the Japanese animal garden.
The Japanese animal garden staff is looking for the darkness of the competitor.
The shipment has been surprised by the speed of the staff and has already been depressed in two weeks.
As a competitor, Shibuawa, located in the west of Japan, was shocked on the midday morning.
The security cameras found that the snake was removed from the animal garden through the start.
It doesn't die immediately because it eats food around the animal garden, but we are very concerned, Yoshimi Yamane, who worked in the animal garden.
Karannut 35-year-old canna is a swimming, 55-kill and about a metro.
Yamane describes the carburer as quiet and sweet.
In the open time, the shoes can be freely walked in the area.
The animal garden has not been obtained from the skill.
It's been the last shooting shooting shooting in the other week.
Yamane found the walking road of the carpet over 150 meters from the animal garden.
I noticed it on the way to the animal garden.
I stopped my car, and I asked my colleagues to help, I told Yamane.
It can walk faster than we could ever imagine.
These startings help your company to avoid Uber's errors
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of employees in the startup company, but the questionnaires did not work.
Recommendations were often inadequate, inutilable or even unnecessary.
Although he convinced that the questions are unnamed, part of the employees were incredibly treated.
"Cylinders weren't simply coherent and objective," Errett says. As Madison Reed's hair management company focuses on the network trade. The company has 75 employees.
Errett decided to be safe for external help.
The market has continued to be more new startup companies in the staff management, which helps other enterprises to see how they can workers.
They are developing and authorized by programs which can measure the commitment of employees, which can make questions and address them to certain teams and groups, and provide unnome reporting services to the employees and, in some cases, directly closer to the government.
"The health can be monitored by the applications such as Stravan and Fitbit, but where is Fitbit of the companies?" asks the founder of the Glint Startup in Redwood City, and director Jim Barnett. Glint provides an analysis program for the company to measure the commitment of employees.
Errett has been using the Glinti program for three years, and he tells us about the thoughts and knowledge of his employees.
The program can make rapid questions and votes to certain teams. In addition, there is a card that is seen in one way where the employees are more satisfied and whose leaders have received the most weakest ones.
The enterprises have understood that they must be monitored by the work culture so that they should not be next to Uberia.
Such ruptures for the starting applications such as the glint are attractive business opportunities.
Administration, regulation and compliance are a worldwide operation, which can be the value of Let's Talk Payments website increased by more than 118.7 billion to 2020.
Convercent, located in the Colorado State in Denver, is the startup that helps enterprises to observe and prevent the unnecessary use. Awareness towards the company has grown this year when Uber's headed a test.
Convercents have about 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
It also made a covenant with Uber.
In the way of Glinti, Convercent gives firms the possibility to make detailed questions, to collect answers with confidence in reality, and to card the problem areas.
Furthermore, the employees may notify the non-exported use of the text message.
And if the director has a cause for doubts, the complaints will go directly to the government of the company.
"A general opinion has been excluded by the authorities," says Convercent's founder and director Patrick Quinlan.
He recalls that if the company treats its employees badly or unfairly, the consequences may be calm, although the authorities do not miss it. Consumers may begin to break the company, and it may also lose the employees and become a challenge in the right.
Ruby Tuesday has more than 250,000 employees in 500 operations. The company has been using Convercent over a year because it wants to ensure that the employees are aware of the principles of operation and procedures and are easily connected to the main center.
Previously, it was noted that if the employer wanted to report the problem, he had to first detect the phone number or email address that could be made to the headquarters of the notification, and then he had to make an official election and hope that it should be taken seriously.
"It was often a terrible and unpleasant experience," says Ruby Tuesday's Legal Director James Vitrano. He said that the complaints of employees were difficult to follow.
Previously, problems remained hidden in the other city or in the state of workers, and the problems such as discrimination, distress and injustice can now be identified and handled more quickly.
"I am the most comprehensive and more delicate idea of the employee's reality," says Vitrano, who leads to the Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"We protect the judiciary related to the working relations of our shareholders."
According to the Queenland, the companies began to address their ethical, values and employees' commitment, more seriously after the accounting company Arthur Andersen, as a result of the questionnaire operation in connection with the Enron-scandale.
As a result of social media, enterprises understood that they couldn't stop the public discovery of their likapy.
"I hope was used as a strategic before the technology came to the control of the ethicals," says Quinlan.
Glint and Convercent provides its software as a service that is regularly speeded.
It is a business model and possibility accepted by capital operators, and Glint and Convercent are supported by capital employers.
Convercent collected $10 million in February from Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital firms. It has collected the capital of $47 million.
Glint received 10 million euros from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and has collected $60 million.
Investment is not surprised when taking into account the contact between enterprises, undertakings and risk capitals.
In many studies, employees are expected to increase their workplace.
Good payment on the markets such as the dishwasher, and interesting projects are just starting.
The employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they give their time to the useful company.
"The workers will be stronger emphasis on the success of the company if they rejoice in the company and know that they are listening and that their work is able to be paid", says Nina McQueen, director of LinkedIn Company, who is responsible for the payment of the employees.
Investors will be produced when enterprises have succeeded, and enterprises will be successful when employees are connected.
The analytical instruments of the third part are allowed to strengthen the commitment of employees, so it is not wonderful that they interest investors.
According to the experts of the workplace culture, it is important for the linking of the employees;
But it is not useful if it does not take steps.
If the company requests the return of its employees, it may be signed as a change.
And if the change is not sufficiently fast or nothing changes, it may reduce the commitment of employees.
"If you ask for four thousand proposals, you must be ready to visit four thousand discussions", says the adviser Kotter International Director Russell Raath, who has seen a lot of confidence in the company to collect only information.
"If the company does not take steps, employees start thinking whether they were heard
And if they're thinking about anything they're interesting.
If the company does not care for them, why should they take care of the company?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed is currently making personal issues for months and is able to address the problem as reported in Glint.
When Errett was assembled back to decision-making from disadvantaged employees of quality and communication, he could change the teams and organize communication education to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday understands its employees better and hopes that deep understanding helps it to improve the sustainability of persons in long-term operations that are known as the larger variability of employees.
"If the company is not forced to create a culture of transparency, it loses employees," says Vitrano.
"If it loses workers, it will also lose customers.
And without customers there's no business."

Teachers require more flexibility in the negotiations
The payment development could not be lower than for example by export industry, but the difference should be devastated, said the President of the OAJ as the Tower of Olympic.
The interim surgery of the public sector is highlighting the difference.
We do not have the possibility to make agreements that wouldn't have been in a way that we would have done a loan.
The contracts in the field of the chain are only born when the papers of the private sector have been signed and the highlighting rates are found.
Indeed, in January, the OAJ’s job proposals have been agreed.
The percentage targets have not yet been discovered.
It is also the President of the public-sector-based negotiations organization.
Increased: Lomara treatment to further demands
According to the OAJ, statistics and prophecies show that the payment force of the public sector is decreased when the private sector increases.

Bruin's players day my time when NCAA has less daily practices from two together
It's pretty early about a ten night. Some UCLA's football players have remained talking about a new camp on a other set of practice shops.
Some have been cut off their shirt, and they're shooting from their hair after the building of the first day.
Many time for them this negotiation support for a few minutes is a quarter of the midday.
In the summer seasons, students will return to the home after three hours of practice to read the final trials. The next morning they gathered into the seventh football room.
"Search three days the burdens will come to these friends," the trainer Jim Mora says a little before the earth changes.
The school sport organization reduced the number of daily practices, and the change was to continue the number of players’ jobs, but it has led to their days – at least to the birthdays, where the last tests were held.
Thus, the first three UCLA practices began to be more than seven nights, and the players were already full-time tables.
The limitation of the precautions in the whole day means that the workshops are more than a week ago, which began almost a week ago than last year, and this is the first time to continue through the sixth Westwood training period when the practices are considered at the same time with the summer rates.
Delays are intended to hold 18 times before August 20th, when you start preparing a precisely opening time: UCLA will meet the Texas C & M syliosis in September.
Mora says that he supported the NCAA rules change, although it has made the timetables of the players even more strict.
"We really kill them for a lot of three or four days, and it's very challenged," says Mora.
"But the players are ready to work, they're great friends.
I think that the situation will be easy when we get to the slaughter, then we have more time.
UCLA closes the practices from the external headquarters. It is not easy to take into account the direct view of the practitioner in the neighborhood area and Lusk Center, the level of the hotel that has already been bombed on the safe network over the flights.
Bruins players are intended to move to the hotel in the next weekend, but Mora admits that problems can be born for a period when rooms are available for external use.
"We have security arrangements." Mora says.
"There is that people can store the room and describe the practices of the video, which is not limited to concern.
It's a lot of time to pay the description of the video.
But we have guards there and in the park area.
We'll do our best.
I'm not going to worry about my head about it.
We have a plan."
Freedom in Ruanda
The Central African Ruanda is organized on Wednesday, the Presidents whose winners are already obvious.
Paul Kagame officially tried for its third time, but in practice he has affected the lead of the earth since 1994.
Then the Capital Group RPF stopped organized people's murder.
Kagame was the commander of RPF.
Kagame has been assessed, otherwise, of distorting opposition and restricting the word freedom.
He has also been accused of misunderstandings of poverty statistics.
At the third time, Kagame has been able to work because the Constitution has been changed by the Constitution for two years.
However, in Ruanda, Kagame is also the leader of the age.
During his time, Ruanda has made social reforms and has forced international investments.
Moreover, Kagam has been a major role in the combination of the people's murder.
The success of Ruanda has made many Africans to ask whether free multi-democracy is the right model for African countries.
However, too, Kagame has promised to increase the freedom of his people after the earth was raised to his feet.
Now it's a good time to start.
Facebook fights falsely by effectively checking the facts
Facebook wants to send possible valuables still more independent facts checkers and provide results under the original article. The largest social network of the world has reported about this as a tour.
The company has published its website an opinion that it starts to use updated machines in the recognition of false identification. The possibility of false persons shall be sent to the controllers of facts and results to be published under the original article.

He adds that Facebook will continue to test the operations related to Aiheese and make other changes to its newspapers to reduce false.
born of a series: a story of a license
Small skotney's hill in Kent is now known for the Squeeze music video as well as Margaret Thatcher's hidden place in the 1970s and 1980s.
However, there is 700 years of angry history, which is now a shocking shoes situated in the Bewl Valley, which is the subject of a series book written by Jamie Rhodes, the oldest shodes shodes.
"I'm good to study the text written by a person over 300 years ago," Rhodes says evilly.
"I know a personal connection when I put a letter in my hand."
Rhodes book, A Castle in England, tells the storys of the families in Scotney at the middle of the earliest time. Each story has imagined different artists, promised British series: Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer or Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book based on Rhodes' Archives. In 2014, he reported Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, which was the sources of the intelligence of the British National Library Documents. My project was sensitive.
"In my notice, in my letter of pockets, I had written a letter to the jakobite workers in the 2nd century," Rhodes says.
"It was his ring!
And the letters cut down from the skin, because then the light was used by the fire.
In three centuries later, the reader has been able to know that he is on his own place.
I love architects."
The old writer had lived in the bridge for almost four months in support of the National Trust Act and the English National Art Council, which was feeling too good to be true.
He carried out days in studying the victorian "new" bird, architects, arts, and rare spectacles, such as shoes discarded on the walls, and centuries of balls in the shoe.
He rounded the old trails and the beaches and discussed the forests, the woods, and sometimes the book with imaging artists.
I'd like to say, "I'll take a whiskey and start to write."
The nearest history of Scotney is very unknown, since the shoes moved into the National Trust board only to the last heritage, Elizabeth Hussey, died in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived in the place ten years later, the legislation staff had just started through the architecture. Rhodes describes that the architects had been held hundreds of years in the same way: bringing all the additional balls.
Architecs had letters, letters from the time of the British Imperial and cards of whom had anything. "If you can imagine that the landmen are sweet," Rhodes says. "But this family had even met one swimming.
I was thinking that it wouldn't be already."
Some of the storys of the book continues to be linked to the history of England, such as The Labourer. It relates to a man who is soon joined after the preparation of a license in England's home Chief in 1381.
“Nightly families of Kent and Sussex reported that there was a bit in 1380,” Rhodes says.
"Inland's household captain began in the same area, and it came to mind that the castle could start from us.
Maybe these events are linked to each other?"
Other stories of the book relate to the history of a link — such as The Priest, the history of the priest, which Darrell’s family hided seven years during the English Religious Religion.
The Smuggler again tells the secular driver Arthur Darrell's history in the 1700s. He is called his slaughter by filling the rock (this was observed for years after opening his castle).
Darrells are the favorite family of Rhodes in Scotney.
Darrell's family men resolved their debt by marrying old women of cherished women, and I see them as amazing friends who were part of the patriarch."
Now, Rhodes will take new trials.
He referred two weeks in Finland to write a series of books of Life, a healing of the early 1900s, which has only remained honest.
Scotney's bridge has a special place in his heart.
"I've been painful to go from there," she says.
"I wouldn't have wanted to return to this wicked ark."
You interrupted Russia's worst, then the cold war.
The military unions between Nato and Russia have been clearly degraded, commented by the Secretary-General of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg.
Stoltenberg accused Russia and its position in the Ukrainian conflict.
I think that Naton's relationship to Russia is now more difficult than ever after the end of the war, Stoltenberg said in the debate of the CNN.
After the end of the war, we hoped that we could work closely with Russia.
However, in particular after the unlawful accession of Crime in 2014 and the continuing inestablishment of the Russian Eastern and Ukraine, the relationship with the Russians has been significantly deteriorated.
However, Stoltenberg says that Nato has still been able to act so that the shocks would not be slaughtered.
So long as we are strong and so long as we can predict, we can visit Russia's political dialogue to avoid the switch of the situation and the new cold war.
Before the comments of Stoltenberg, President Donald Trump, the U.S. President of the United States had even been a dangerous level.
Trump urged the country to thank the bad congress that adopted the new Russian counterparts last week.
Vladimir Klitshko stops - No renewal against Anthony Joshua
The long-term pregnant series of worldwide master Vladimir Klitshko stops his car.
The Ukrainian Klitshko, 41, announced its decision on Tuesday morning.
Atlantic Olympics in 1996, Klitshko took 69 times a professional, winning 64 negotiations.
He was able to manage different MMs in 2000-02 and 2006-15.
Klitshko lost his duty of two last battles.
Tyson Fury shocked him in November 2015.
In April, Klitshko met in Wembley’s station Anthony Joshua and lost his battle after the struggle on 11th part.
Joshua and Klitshko were expected to meet a renovation negotiation in November in Las Vegas.
However, Klitshko did not find a motivation for the fight.
I used for a few weeks to make a decision so that I got sufficiently slow to the Wembley negotiation, Klitshko told him when he was informed.
I got an amateur and professional investigator of everything I've seen, and now I want to start my other uran after the sport.
I couldn't have imagined that I had so long and unbelievable success.
I'm very grateful about it.
Look at the foundation of Klitshko on the video.
Klitshko manager Bernd Bönte told you that the stopping decision was difficult to do with Klitshko.
However, he has always stressed that he wants to stop if he has no enough motivation.
That is why this is essentially the right decision, stated by the Commission.
Klitshko has been seen from 2009 with a US shower with Haide Panettier.
There is one child in Paris, a daughter of Kaya born in 2014.
Klitshko's grandmother Vitali is also the former world master of pregnancy.
In 2008-12 brothers dominated different MM texts at the same time.
Finnish regulators increase the conditions of "Export from Fields"
Minna Niccane's head has suffered conditions during the foreign disaster.
Minna Niccas had problems with situations.
Wine and coldness have come from a woman's fill.
Even in London's MM girls, there are insufficient circumstances.
I'm Niccane talking about it.
The situations have been a sweet head of a smuggle against Mina Nicca.
I wouldn't want to blame the money, but I was incomprehensible that I didn't even have a little bit with the honour to move, Niccane said after Innsbruck's kiss.
I've been competitive and practiced here as many times and I have never experienced the same wine in this place, Niccanne told Paavo Nurm Game.
At this time, it was very difficult to stabilize the smooth, even when in practice there were so insufficient stinks, Niccane founded in Kaleva's kitchen.
This talked at the tours in London.
It's time that it's been difficult to get technology to the cast... whether it's a cold smell or something.
It's been cold and sweet, and it's taken out of the fill.
There is no sense to consume energy in bad circumstances.
He went to his government's 455 cases to the MM girls.
There's 445 out there.
The situation is not in London for all.
It's gotta be sweet and wait for better sweetness.
The goal is to overcome the early morning in the carton 460.
Why don't you get any more trees to the outside?
It's not necessary.
Last Sunday, I was starting in Italy and Germany.
I got a shoe and a tech switch.
I'd probably have to do the same now.
The normalist has been engaged in the control, and now the government has been closed.
What would be a nice kid?
25 degrees heat.
It's just a little winter until it's stable.
The former officer has tried the policy in General: "We have no shared resources now and not a lot of years."
In spite of the positive airlines of the economy, the Government of Juha Sipil must take the detriment and causing the allocation of the State budget in the currency, warnings for decades prepared by Erkki Virtane in the Ministry of State Safety.
He said there's no shared resources.
It was generally discussed in 2015 the life of Virta in the United Nations Middle Week.
The next year's construction of the budget is just starting.
Recently, the proposals of the policy, otherwise on the loading, the calculation of car taxes, and the support of the Virtanese electrical shops, have been valid.
They are closely telling that the laws are close, because when 10 per cent of the State budgets are financed with additional obligations, we have no shared resources now and not for many years.
I don't know, I've even been talking about the division when you're going to take it, Virtanen said to Yle.
The office emphasized that all the debts have to be made for children.
The Office has a long experience in preparing the budgets of the State: he started in 1978 as the Ministry of State Safety, and then worked as the Assistant Head of the Budget and the Head of Budgetary.
The last time he remains in a lifetime, he works as the Chief of the National Minister of Work and Life.
The Bureau noted in the general debate that the economic growth of the three percent now is likely to be temporary.
All prophecies estimate that this is a pitch that is flown from the next year to go to the alphabet, and Finland will wait for a percentage of the growth in ten years.
Washington changes the remaining standards of residence
President Donald Trump reported that the remaining standards of Green Card are changed in the new immigration plan.
It is intended to reduce the amount of 50 000 legal immigrants in the year, declare the requirements of the provisional labour permits and limit family wages.
New rules have proposed the Republicns, and the President supports them.
The legislation has to be discussed in two rooms in the Congress.
"This law reduces poverty, increases payments and regulates billions of dollars of taxpayers by changing a way to grant permanent residence to other citizens of the country.
It also reduces the immigration and replaces the current programme.
The new search process benefits applicants who know English and can live themselves and who have our economy's benefits", Trump stated, according to the information instruments.
Denmark's wife doesn't want to be buried with the Queen.
Prince Henrik doesn't want to be buried with Queen Margareth.
In the picture, Prince Henrik and Queen Margareta were described in April.
Danish Queen Margareta, 77, and this couple of prince Henrik, 83, will not be shocked in the ring, tells the Danish Hoof.
Traditional government parks in Denmark have been entered into the same place.
The king's room has reported today that Prince Henrik does not want to be buried to the Roskild Court Church, or not in his information as a tour.
According to the BT magazine, this is the inadequacy of the princess in his role in the king's family.
There is no secret that the prince has been unpleasant to his role and that he had been in the dance monarchy, Lene Belleby's head of communication, comments in the newspaper.
The princess decided that he is not slaughtered to the ring of the Queen, is naturally a consequence of not being treated as a balanced party.
The Queen has been a long-known hope for his partnership and understanding the decision.
A horrible car on the road: Auto was going to be on the motor
Tom had an open copy and two little kids.
They didn't hurt in the accident, but they don't have a convintion of money if the other party is not targeted.
Turma took place at Vanta's Keimoport.
Archive picture of the Keha III construction area.
The Vanish Tommi tells his family surviving as a wonderful trade in car accidents.
Tommi, his opening partner, and his two little children of the couple, were driving in the motorway in the direction of the Vanta Hameenland.
At the Hemeenlandian Headquarters, a long white car that was going to run in the village of the family, Tommi tells us.
Without the people's movement car would have come to To もっと.
I'm jarrut and I moved the car at the same time, and it went out of the hand, Tomm tells me.
The family's car shocked a lot of speed.
Parents and backwards had two small children not hurted.
The second child is a little less than 3 years, the second is a year old.
It seemed to have been a good time when nothing happened to us.
No one's overwhelming didn't even spend on us, even though there was a slight trail in your place.
The accident occurred at 17.20 p.m.
On the other hand, no one stopped with them, and the family called an emergency station.
They got out of the car.
The ammunition and rescue office came to the place, and the time of the family was revised.
The car went to the breakfast.
Tomm tells her and the small income of the opener, and they got a lot of help for a car a couple of years ago.
Without the other car information, the family does not get the money insured.
Thus, the family hopes to observe a viewer about the car that is because of the family is driving to the world.
We need a car every day.
You know, it's hard to get your kids up and go to work without it, Tommy says.
Tomm saw that the car was white, old car.
It probably was the end of the 1990s or the beginning of the 2000s.
He thinks that the start of the car record number was SIG.
If the guilt isn't obtained, I don't know how we're doing economically, today we'll have to count each voice.
Tomm hopes that the events have been seen or something knowing about it are connected to the police.
The New Eastern Police Institute and the Mediterranean Relief Institute are confirmed that they had a mission on the last night.
Title and the case corrected at 21.15: Unlike at the beginning, another car was not receiving shops, but was time on the car of the family's car.
Lotta Jappis's guider's presentation relates to human relations with the method of drug - the own speaker will see what? in the theatre on Wednesday and Wednesday
Lotta Jappin, who's from the coffee home, brings his initial exhibition to what?
Its own speaker is the music testing of the past human relationships and the inadequacy of the inadequate.
The manager Lotta Jappise says that it's still a good idea.
We're going to be treated in the way of the drought.
You know, the feelings of age aren't going to be worthy, he says.
The surrounding summer testing is performed with small budgets and large, young hearts.
The name of the presentation is to consider what humans will be delighted when a new man is aware of.
Does he get something to do, or is he close to another ball open?
Juoneton's presentation is shocking fact and fiction
It has been controlled and dramatised.
He also answers the light.
The report consists of the texts of the Working Group and there is no drink.
The manager believes that even though the presentation of young people's thoughts, it speaks all over the age.
Indeed, it emphasizes that the Ombudsman does not directly tell his own or his working group's relationships.
Facts and physics are shocked.
My own world is certainly interested in the presentation.
I don't think human relations would be bad, but not even that human relationship, especially a couple, would be a happy condition.
Many learn from different parents
Indeed, he believes that his own speaker will draw a temporary picture of youths living in Finland in hundreds of years.
According to him, many have learned many of their relationships with their parents, whom many have disappeared.
At least it's that you like to listen.
You don't have to stay with your relationship.
The presentation shows Minea Lğng, Niklas Rautée and Otto Rocca.
The working group also belongs to Mr Ella Snellman.
The music agreement is Jappies and Rocan.
Love to the Teater in Couvola
Lotta Jappin, 26, studys as a Teater showr in the art academic art.
It's two years behind, and the other shoes before.
The following inspiration to the theatre has been started during the years of Kuuvola.
The growth of music cards has been assisted in the Kuuvola theatre and shown in the university layer in Helsing and the last time in Linnateatter in Turin.
The maintenance has started to be more interested.
He's got the next week in Helsinki, Narr's showing.
At about 45 minutes of sustainability in the future, at least in the city of Jamaica, there is at least 45 minutes.
In the theatre 4.8 at 19:8 and 5.8 p.m. 14 and 19.
The Finnish Olympic Olympic driver took a year's sharp of motocrosslessness.
The hard sporter in Finland has the same unprecedented natural power as Janne Lahtela.
A hundred days in the Year, a couple of years, in the Pearl Lake, he tried to sleep on the Olympics.
Haave took place in 2002, but the government's business continued.
He was not an innocent employer, but also the experimenter of new species.
There are no combinations on the earth that the chimney has not been experienced at least once.
It's been excited to practice.
I'll always find something new, Lahtela tells me.
Finally, one of the urgencys was to stop the whole of the Law.
In 2014 Lahtela was a motorocross problem.
As a result, his skin and both hands were cut off.
I didn't work anymore.
The shoes of my home year, Lahtela says.
The office had a bad luck.
He also admits that she could have been a part of the age.
You can feel like a shock.
You didn't get that circle.
It's just a species so hard that this quarter pipe doesn't make too much sweet!
After the accident, the Law was a special situation.
His urgent life was stopped as in the wall.
The back was long-term to the Japanese freest-leading team as the principal trainer.
The office immediately started in the pesticide after the end of 2006.
The first time after I was 15 years old, I had to be on my place.
I just didn't do anything, Lanthela tells me.
Even in the course of training, Lahtela often deceived its protection in the beach and physics.
Very surprised, stopping was a good experience.
I was physically and mentally so disappointed that my own thoughts did not feel reasonable.
They didn't even have a type in the couple.
It was good to be there.
I enjoyed it right, because I really had to be just once.
The compulsory board instead of serving the Finnish Chief Preparator.
Without stopping, he's afraid that he'd be back to the end.
It's easier to find places that have passed a bit than the wives!
Without an accident, I wouldn't have found that I needed a lot of relax.
The office began as a trainer for the Finnish freestyle team about a year ago.
At the same time, he found a more safeer shock on the state of the speeders.
Switch the motocross frisbeegolfie!
That's just going out of the baby right now.
In the worst, I had seven hours a day in the tent.
Although the Latvia has always been a superinnocent tree, he did not require its trainers to be similar to him.
I'm not going to run all of them in the same way.
Our species cultures have the ability to be their own and the way to become the best world.
Freestyle's free style, and mentality has always been satisfied with it, Lattel says.
Sex-robots come and we have to be a reason to be worried about us.
It's here: a report on the development of technology in the sex-robotic sector – just when you have started to feel that 2017 couldn't be more weird.
Yeah, it's just.
Sex-robots are a great thing now.
The corresponding Robotic Regulation (FRR) was published in the following 5-10 years on the development of sexual robots.
"We have to take serious attention to the publicity of sexual robots," says the legislation's fondator and robotic and effective professeur of the Christel Sharkey Sheffield University.
Customers can select the color of the robot's eyes, the form of the narrow and the type of the rings.
"Scirobots are shocked, but they are already sold, and we're going to see them more." Sharkey said in the public status of the report.
Sexucles have developed as smooth robots that have the warmest feeling cyclonics, as well as work-created designs that remember human use.
Users can also adjust their own favoriteness from the color of the eyes to the type and color of the rings and the color.
It is also more concerned that robots have "privacy", which can women of Stepford show you the progress of your free leaders.
Sexucles have developed as robots with a silikon-fire.
For example, RealBotix robots can adjust user’s preferences even if they are too long.
True Companion Roxxy Gold Robote has an exhibited personality: Frigid Farrah is affected by the hot, Wild Wendy is a sculpture and continues.
"Roxxxy Gold's personality is the most perfectly possible of the user's personality", is reported on the websites of the company.
Otherwise, the robot likes the same thing as the user.
There is also a variety of opinions:
It may be shocked, shocked, or "in the wind".
In the generalization of sex-robots, there are many worried designs that are replaced by gender relationships, but more dangerous than women, and direct rape fans, for example, when the user is approaching long and opposed to a programing robot.
True Companion compares Roxxy-robots to vibrators on its website:
"There's a vibrator, why wouldn't a man have sex robots?"
However, sex robots are not only fetis or new sex.
The generalization and development of them relates to some of our dark and deepest cultures: the equality of sex towards sex, which has one option in other groups.
Of course, most of the men do not get sex-robots, and their recommendation is still marginal, although FRR report reported about their increased recommendation.
However, marginal appearances tell much of the time of life.
And many are starting to be strange or harmful once the markets give it a permission.
There is no doubt that sex-robots have started generally at the same time when women's rights are threatened in different parts of the world and in the White House are a president who has disappointed the women who have suffered.
The Handmaid's Tale (Original) is not concerned about its powerful image language, for example, the images of the painted body and out of the eye.
Gilead’s Republic is far away from our reality, but now it seems to be a surprising short journey.
Sex-robotics are trying to do so much like real women (measures of portraits) as well as technically possible.
Robotes developers want their skin to follow as well as human movements as possible.
However, their "privacy" is far from reality.
Robotics can't get out of the relationship or situation.
They have no own will, no history — nothing that refers to selfishness or perfectly impresss fantasies.
They're awesome servants.
Order.
Police suspect: Australia was planned for two terrorists, a group leader of Dad
The Chief of the Chief of the Fathers conducted a group of Australian employees, which was doubtless of the planned bombs to Etihad Airways' Airways aircraft.
My father's leaderships were Sydney Morning Herald, who sent Sydney also bombs.
The bomb was intended to take on the airport on 15 July, but the company stopped before the safeguard.
The police doesn't tell me why the company stopped.
Another suspected terrorist plan was to build a different colorless gas device and to comply with the device into the public place, for example on the public road.
Michael Phelan, assistant Commissioner of the Australian Union, says that the terrorist plan was one of the most professional plans that has ever been done in Australia.
Because of the unexpected terrorist plans, four men were arrested in the police Councils on Sunday.
One man has been able to be free, but he also continues.
Trump's good side?
You'll get Mitt Romney to show a healthy organization.
Throughout the time of Trump, there has already been a deterioration of the strength of the voters at the level of the arc, the family has also been disappointed.
At Christmas and Thanksgiving Day, American newspapers were taught how to be done with Trumpia voted families.
We all want our simple information team.
The less attention has remained at Trump's ability to combine the family.
I'm telling about this because my shirt was in New York this week, and he's a wheelman in Chicago who has been living with the Republicans for a long time.
He recalled that a common enemy could have a strong combined effect.
Now, when Trump is in the White House, I'm all swearing - also a sister who supports the Republicns with whom he has been struck over the world for decades - are equal and surprised on the same side.
It is a good thing in the day, but, moreover thought, there are significant risks.
Trump has given a new power to the left, but his presidency is indeed to bring us all right.
When we talk about Trump and "normalising", we're talking about the horrible possibility that any day we're not going to be worried about his temper.
In the long term, Trump has even more likely to normalize the right extraterrestrial Republicans, which are compared to Trumpi, just as reasonable.
Remember as a shocked version of Mitt Romney: dog on the car cap, 14% income tax (and his tax notice we have seen it). In comparison with Trumpest, they affect very small crimes.
When Trump's long time has been over, the next presidential workshop of the Republics needs to be clear, and it feels soon a significant improvement.
When I was visiting, we took our children to the Crown House, and it's the biggest coffee and best in New York park, which gets for three dollars without coffee.
The horses of the shoes are powerful, centrally shocks — slow clovns and horror to see animals — are evil, and the swimming music that is on the background is strange.
Many of the signs of New York have been slowly shocked: the visions of high buildings start to be shocked, the cities' cities will be too excited and the reality of the city does not respond to dreams.
And yet, 35 years later, it has been over the fact that Swiss Cottage was not a Swiss cottage but a large business rate in Northern London. Y Olde Swiss Cottage is actually the Swiss pub, but it is not counting.
Instead of the debate, it is still a wonderful animal — even though two years of age, one of the two and two quarters of women enjoyed it.
I would have given the smell complete shoes if someone had requested me to consider, but, unfortunately, no one came to ask.
Instead, I was requested this week in the goods office to evaluate "My payment trial" at one reference star before I set my credit cards to the county.
The same thing is in my home rounds, but there is also the possibility to combine a 15 percent service money when I go to find me from the coffee.
This emphasizes the archiving effects and presss the customer servants to put their person into a game in a situation where it does not need it.
The seller of the cartridge was deceived as an accident when I was depressed by my credit card tests for five stars.
Shefki Kuqi was shocked from the Interior, "It wasn't the leader."
FC Inter today has released Shefki Kuq's advisory tasks for the training team.
Fabricio Piccareta operated as a supporter.
Another training group continues in the current tasks.
The Italian Piccareta has been a assistant in previously other parts of the English Sunderland.
In January, the 51-year-old EUFA Pro-license in the Internal Training Group has been carried out last year.
The FC Internal Government President Stefan Håkans regrets the event.
The variation of the trainer is never easy or satisfied.
However, Shefki Kuq had no longer been the confidence of the leadership, with no other options now, Hækans commented on the follow-up information.
The Piccaretan Agreement is until the end of the time.
He is together with the other training group in charge for the tomorrow meeting with HIFK.
Tonight Zonomy's data shown that the team has defeated long towers.
Kuqi told the players that I follow the helpers of Piccare and John Allen have been moved to the discrimination.
Kuqi and Piccareta took strongly together in the Intern fight against the PS Kemi last Sunday.
Linda Lampenus published a picture of the 80s-year-old you would recognise a serious student?
The student Linda Lampenus published in Instagram a youth picture.
The image has been added to several alarms, which can result in the 16-year-old student of Siberius Académie in the channel.
The lamp itself wonders the young woman who looks at the camera.
For a long time, seriously, he's going to communicate.
If you don't see a picture, you can look at this.
The lamps have previously published pictures of their past and talked about painful subjects.
A year ago, he published in Instagram a couple of pictures.
In the second picture, she's seen 20 years ago, and in the second, she's ownering now, two children.
In the picture, Lampenus considered his own growth as a human and refers to food diseases that he suffered as a young one.
I'm talking about 20 years ago and today...
I'm still showing a lot like that 26-year-old girl, but it's the difference that I've learned to keep myself and what I looked like, Lampenus wrote.
On the text, he had added in English hahtortcus life, food disease, insecurity, self-confidence, self-consciousness, love for himself, 1996, 2016, ageing, girl, woman, older ones is sweet.
The lampenus has been openly talking about his food storm for the past years.
She was 14-year-old in the hospital because of her anorists and ortodoxes.
Shortly later, he was also sick, which finally revealed in 2006.
It's just a little quiet to improve.
In addition to therapy and comparison, the lamp helped new love.
Oscar Pistorius was sent from the prison to the hospital because of the snacks
This is the second time Pistorus was sent to the hospital.
Last year, he received hospital treatment in his beaches to the circles that he said that he was shocked by the prison officials.
Pistorism was sentenced for the original murder case of murderer murderer.
He killed Steen Camp's friendday in the early time in 2013 by shooting several shoots through the door of WC in Pretoria.
Pistorus claimed that he was his girlfriend a night-time skilled in WC.
The guilts have told their expectations to be ring again, because they hold the sentence of the six years of Pistor.
The Government's authorities will wish to register the highest right of South Africa, and the election may be treated as possible this year.
If a complaint is accepted, the Court of Justice of Pistorius may expire for 15 years.
The death penalty is not used in South Africa.
Two boards were arrested from unlawful transmission in Greece
Two illegally translated routines were arrested in Greece, reported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in accordance with the BTV Canadian.
The police arrested a number of people who were allowed to be camped in Sitonia on 1 August morning, and there were two trumpets.
They were still released on the same day, but the investigation of the case continues.
According to the BTV television channel, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported later its release of boarders.
The Greek authorities have decreased the rules on the explicit driving areas and already granted to all those who are crossing in other regions as well as in the purposes.
The checks will be continued until the end of the time.
The Minister has reported that the right could be imposed by a shock.
Nest part of the swimming area - already disabled -7.7%
Nestee, oil exhibiter, has dispersed 7.7 per cent around 11.
It was a result before the tax, but I overcome Inquiry Financial's assembled prediction.
The pool trade has been visiting in the area of the pakket today as in Finland as well as in other Europe.
The broad European Stockx 600-Index was 0.2 per cent after the opening of pounds.
As a general index of Helsinki, OMXH had been calculated after about half hours of trade, 0.3% to 9509.48% and OMXH25 has been weighted by 0.3%.
The total variation of Porsus was 41 million euros, from which nine million were the printer of Neste’s morning.
Red meat, milk products and sweats may be eliminated by symptoms of the cut-off
Red meat and sweat may feel like the painting of the feeding system.
However, such research claims to be insufficient: the use of food containing meat and milk products may facilitate the symptoms of the cut-off.
The symptoms of symptoms are an unprecedented disease that has suffered about 1,3 million people in the United States and 3000,000 people in the United States.
Nevertheless, the investigators of Washington sylipsi found that the necessary amino acid in protein would help organisms to develop immuno-cellular cells that confirm the flexibility of protein.
According to the director of the study, Marco Colonna, immune cells were guarded by the protection and ensure that the disappearing microbits in the food do not go to the body.
Equitable cells caused by future cells that strengthen the ability to protect the organism without harmful fruits.
If the balance is too close to the infusion, the consequence may be the symptoms of the symptoms.
The test was observed that the immune cells confirming resistance have muscles with certain bacteria in the list of bacteria.
This bacterium requires triptophana so that immune cells start to appear. Tryptophana is one of the protein construction substances.
"We found contact between the development of cells for the lactobacillus reuter and the steady capacity. Lactobacillus reuter is part of the normal microbiome of the list," says Professor Colonna.
"More than more in the museums of food had triptophana, more they had such immuno cells."
If the same functions with humans, the combination of the food bacteria of Lactobacillus reuter and a rich triptophana can strengthen the ability to be accumulated and reduce the efficacy of the tuberculosis.
When investigating the strengthening immunity cells, Luisa Cervantes-Brragan observed that although one of the mouse groups had such cells, they were not the same with the mouse mouse mouse muscles that were considered different from another group.
He suspected that the difference was linked to microbiomes of the mouse, or normal bacteria, seed, and virus community.
When the museum’s DNA was investigated, six bakteries were observed in the museums with immune cells but not in other mouses.
When the lactobacillus reuter bacteria was given to the steriil-created muscles of microbiology and not developed immuno cells, they began to appear immune cells.
Scientists wanted to find out how bacteria affect the immune system, which increased the lactobacillus reuter bacteria and moved small liquids – without bacteria — to different muscles of immune cells.
Immuno cells have developed the ability to strengthen the strength of the immune cells.
When active substance was cleaned from liquid, it was demonstrated to the site of triptofhane substance change, known as indol-3-mato acid.
When researchers doubled the number of triptofaans in the museum nutrition, the number of cells confirmed has increased around 50%.
According to Cervantes-Brragan, humans have the same steady cells as the mouse, and most of us have Lactobacillus reuter bacteria in our food channel.
Nevertheless, triptofaan’s site products can be found by the lactobacillus reuter cells to develop humans in the same way as the mouse.
"We certainly want to promote development of such cells because they are regulating the incentive in the internal springs," says Cervantes-Barragan.
"In combination with triptofaanous lactobacillus reuter bacteria can promote generalization."
Jose Mourinho believed that Manchester United received the "neron" agreement with Nemanja Matici
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United had been made on his lines with the Nemanja Maticin agreement.
The EUFA Super Cup tournament of Real Madrid, which moved on the Red 40 million, began to win 2-1 in Dublin, the last battle through the United States before the EUFA Super Cup tournament against Real Madrid. He made an impact on the media player as Paul Pogban and Andreas Perera.
However, Matic was not in the best way, because he was not joining the Asian rounds before the beginning of the years. He worked only 45 minutes in the field — according to Mourinho, it is to change before the beginning of the election.
"He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence and his way of thinking do him - he has the credible thoughtability of the football," Mourinho says.
"We'll help him to be ready more than later."
In addition to mathematics, Victor Lindelof and Rome Lu Luke also started games at Aviva stadiums when Mourinho began to turn to the initial meeting for the beginning of the time.
Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wants more three new players, although the result has already done "good work" by purchasing three of his four priorities to make it.
"For about four -- it must be thanks." he added.
"I'm more satisfied if I get all four, but they've done a good job."
Aeroplanes claimed Germany for two years.
The Finnish airport team dismissed its fourth battle of MM-carsturing for Germany directly ranged 0-3 (23-25, 23-25, 14-25).
The routine routine in Germany's playing is high.
At the same time, their game was on each sector, the Finnish principal trainer buto Kangasniemi told in the information.
In the first two of the Finnish, he had a opposer on the floor, but in the third, a German was clearly stronger.
Germany's leading to illness.
When we were played patiently and in some places enough aggressively, it was possible to shoot with, Kangasniemi said.
Finnish effectively was 14 points gathered by Pia Corhone.
The three battles of four were lost in Finland on Sunday.
Reuters: The large group has already sent challenges to the Russian situation of Trump Jr
In the United States, the great group has sent challenges with Donald Trump Jr and Russians, Christa Veselnishska, in association with Christmas.
The large group of specialists, called for Robert Mueller, has already sent challenges to join Christmas Veselnitska, Donald Trump Jr and Kreml.
The news office Reuters, which has previously confirmed Wall Street Journal's exhibition on the invitation to a large department.
According to Reuters, the large group has sent challenges in the meeting of the Veselnitska, known as Trump Jr and Kreml, which was organized between the United States Presidential Hague in June 2016.
There were also Donald Trump M., head of the campaign, Paul Manafort, and his violence, the current advisor of the White House Jared Kushner.
According to the sources of Reuters, the specialist Robert Mueller has called for a large department in Washington, means the intensification of Russian study.
Submissions increased that Mueller would like to be investigated by a large candidate, which is trying to find Russia's invasion towards the United States President and whether Trump's campaign or its neighbouring cooperation with Russia.
The largest group will enhance the rights of the Muel's rights to collect evidence, send challenges and force people to test lightly.
The large number of general citizens are working behind closed doors.
The large group of defences the evidence found in the investigator's investigation and decides whether it should increase the accusation in this case.
The British discovery of microshirts turned himself to leave her home and his cars through the shock of their hands.
The British discovery is first in the whole country microshirted himself so that he can open out his home door, go to his office and starting his car with the heat of the hand.
Microsiru is a 33-year-old age between Steven Northam's skin and priority standards. He now provides service to enterprises and private persons who want to facilitate their lives in the technology of Northamin BioTeq.
Northam cooperates with Geoff Watson, an advisory doctor of the Royal Hampshire Church in Winchester, in Hants, to meet the requirements of the physician installation.
The microsyndrome uses the same technique as in the microshers and dogs, and its installation is only 30 seconds.
The Northaim company will also change the flows of houses and cars into combination with the microsync. One box will pay 300 pounds.
Northam is married, and he has one child, and he has installed a micro-studio technology as well as his home and his BMW Z4 car that will start when he counts his hands on the board.
In the showing of the White House, thousands of dollars were estimated to taxers
The last decision of the White House is to fly the helicopter of the maritimes to the Southern Sweden of the White House in the United States produce to be paid to the taxpayers $24,000. The information appears to be received by the TIME magazine.
The Green White Sikorsky VH-3D helikopter uses the name Marine One when the President is in the ship, which was in the event in the White House 17.7.2017 presented by American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Chairman Mike Pence and a group of officials of the White House were acquainted with the products of all 50 States.
In addition to the helikopter prepared in Connecticut, there was a shipping boat from Main, a shooting car from Wisconsin and a car from Mississippi.
The Army Office of the White House had requested the Helikopter's missional arrangement only 36 hours before the counting of the Southern "poakestical" event. This appears to be the document of the HMX-1 helicopterics.
"I just want to ensure that you are aware of the matter, because there is an exceptional event that receives much visibility," the HMX-1 unit wrote on the day before the e-mail message, the commander of the marine flight.
The message was told that helicopters would arrive to the Southern Sweden at 17.7 a.m. and that the event was started on three nights. Helikopter would be removed from the place just after the night between six and nine.
Furthermore, the message stated that if helicopter leaves from the White House would be delayed, the second team would be necessary because of the limitations of services.
The initial men were in helicopter during the time, and the security personnel of the unit was near the helicopter when it was on the country.
The document on receipt of the TIME magazine does not find out whether it was finally necessary for other men.
The Hatch Act Act of the United States prohibits the ownership of the State employee for political purposes.
According to the documents, HMX-1 informed whether the law of the event was violated.
"There is why our questions were whether this Hatch Act was crimed, and we were told that it wasn't a crime," the commander wrote.
"Remember that you can participate," the assistant commandant answered.
Made in America was an official event of the White House, so it was not part of Hatch Act law.
But the officials also have political slows.
At the time, the President spoke in the process of the senate for his health care reform and for the more public regulations found.
The use of the Marine One helikopter and Air Force One for political purposes is not a new appearance.
The Presidents shall use them in their lands,
But they're only unnormal for light photos.
Trump's actions were renewed in February when Air Force One rolled the President's campaign in Melbourne, Florida. Trump has strongly criticized the use of the presidential airport on Twitter.
"The White House is very satisfied with the event of Made in America, which was presented by American employees' products from all 50 states," said the White House's director Lindsay Walters.
The HMX-1 units regularly do training institutions in the Washington region and practice the import of the President to the White House by the Southern Sweden.
When Trump was at the G-20 Summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 made 58 exhibits to the White House.
According to one official, the flights Made in America were a monthly training interest in men.
On that day, there were 11 hours of helicopters on "non-presidential funds".
According to the White House, other costs were not caused by taxpayers.
The investigator reported that the company was not joined by the Helikopter's presentation in the Southern Sea of the White House.
HMX-1 has no account of the flights related to the task of the President, and the clear assessment of the expenditure is difficult.
According to the 2017 clock schedules, the VH-3D Helikopter is $24,380 from the airport tunes.
According to the HMX-1 units, flights were supported by Quantico from the Virginia State to the White House and restored a whole hour.
According to the White House, helikopter use costs are clearly lower.
"Reduction of the costs for taxpayers according to the compensation is rare," says Walters.
"Assessed reimbursement includes personal, occupation and many other costs that are deemed likely to be accompanied, taking into account the annual funding."
According to the conclusion of the RAND investigation company in 2015, the costs of reimbursement are not included in staff costs, but are taken into account the fuel costs of the fuel, the counterparty and the contract.
In the past days, the former director of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of helikopter during the event.
"I think it's an American product", Spicer said.
"I know that Sicorsky and the Connecticut State are very proud of safeguarding national security and working through it, of course, hundreds of thousands of people or thousands of people.
And I think that most Americans are proud of helicopters and other defence issues that many Americans have made a lot of work before.
It's fullly interesting to import it."
I'm not sure if Trump was in helicopter during the event, but at least he stood the car driver in the place.
In a white house, Trump flew to the newspaper from his own Sikorsky ship.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President. "I have three of them."

The threat of certain tourists to the culture of the region
The authorities consider their limited number of tourists in Venice.
Local rape is focused on the representation of tourists, especially in the form of the turismo.
The Italian Ministry of Cultural Affairs calls it "eat and flee" as a turism: the aim is only for a few hours and is cut in the major groups.
Venice has been shocked on the tourists made in the city.
There is a difficult movement on the streets and the great openings are so full of visitors that the people of Venice do not already be able to be a group of people.
They have been forced to move from the historical center as they have become hotels.
The New York Times and The Guardian writes about the importance of the turism in Venice.
The authorities consider the limitations to the tariff.
They call the current appearances to be a bad tourist - a low-quality tourist.
When you arrive in a large ritual ship, the time is given two or three hours.
You follow a frozen instruction from Piazzale from Rome to Rialton and to the Holy Marks Tower, and turned back, describes the turism caused by the Italian Minister of Cultural Dario Frances.
The beauty of Italian cities is not only in architecture, but also in the operations of local, trade and jobs.
We have to keep this part of the city's identity.
The Holy Mark’s tor belongs to the most favorable visitors of the Venice historical center.
At the top of the Torin, the Church of Holy Marks is located.
Local angry is also faced with the main part of the race.
In the historical center of Venice, more than 500,000 lives in local populations.
In 1951, there were about 175.000 inhabitants.
In July, 20,000 Russians had shown the appreciation of massaturism.
They say that their tourism has deteriored their quality of life, destroying the environment and slowing the inhabitants.
It's about 20,000 people who live each year.
If this continues, a few years later in Venice is not like tourists.
It would be a social, anthropological and historical disaster, said the impression of Carlo Belframe was organized.
The company is difficult, since the income of the vessels to Venice is deeply required and create the need for a number of different areas of work.
In addition to the limitation of the tariff, the solution has been made to the fact that the riders have been overlooked from the longest historical center.
Luciano Bortot, who lived in Russia, would certainly change the situation if the Russian administrative region, where it is located in Venice, would be more powerful to decide on its own matters - if it is full of autonomy.
In Russia, about 20 to 30 million tourists are visiting each year.
You're going to shoot up there?
Measuring refrigerators in motor vehicles
Without the coopium and the Silian River, the north-eastern motorways had the work of the torstage day during the refrigeratorship of kilometers.
In the area, the motor switching work that shoots the transport is telling Savo's words.
Instead of a regular 120 kilometres of clock speed, the information is 50 km limited to hours speed.
In the area of 50 km, however, your transport was advanced at the tourday in practice.
Scientists moved towards the Tuesday on the side of the Siliang River, or at the front of a golden wall.
I'll be well done without such attention.
23-year-old drinkers have been able to see the letters of publicity.
Amalie Iuel has published beautiful pictures in the large Canyon country.
The Danish-Norweg Amalie Iuel has risen at the present home as a sportor in Norwegia, not at least because he disrupted in March 26, 26 years of old Norwegian vision at 400 meters by rounding the ratings during 51.81.
A month later, he improved 400 meters from Norwegia at 55.38.
Iuel, who uses social media, was soon understood that personality and publicity have a sharp.
Mans around the world, apparently, began to send pictures to the Jewish generation in hope that young drinker would interest them.
Iuel was to close his Snapchat account from the outside.
I got a lot of "truck pictures" of an unknown person, so I had to change my account in private, Iuel told VG magazine.
Iuel didn't want to have the VG's discussion clearly identified what pictures he had.
I'll be sure you can imagine, Iuel's nausea.
It's glad to get back after the journey, but I'm going well without any other attention.
Iuel was born in Denmark 1994.
His mother is a Danish, Dad, dance-norwegian.
Iuele's family moved Norwegians to Amalia for two years.
At Amalia, a 12-year-old family changed his father's work first in Namibia, then in Pakistan.
Then there were Dubai, Thailand and the United States.
Iuel was four years old as a University of Southern California at Los Angeles, which returned to Norway.
In June 2015, he changed Denmark citizenship into the Norway citizens.
In Norwegia, Iuel performs three training, Leif Olav Alnesin, Karsten Warholm and Elisabeth Sletum.
In Norway there are more opener discussions than in the United States.
In the United States, trainers do not ask anything but just give the provisions.
In Norwegia, the trainer has much more time to be personally done with the sportor, Iuel said to VG.
Amalie Iuel is able to dominate the norms of 400 meters and 400 meters in the swimming pool.
The footsteps, Janne Kurve, took the whole side of the horizontal board, now with the MM swimming pools, "That's good if there's nothing."
Now it's been a nice count when nothing happened!
Janne Corpi, who has read the most successfully successfully successfully successfully, has again been reached to enjoy their loved species in this period.
We've been on the left side last summer.
In January, the footage was forced to the Operation Table of Korve, and the feet did not want to improve anything.
The hand had taken a part in the throat.
In the summer I didn't know what I'm doing, if I'm going to continue or not.
Sponsorills were on the shock and many things opened, Corpi tells me.
But that's what it's said, it's a way to do it.
I'm going to go, sponsor continued the contract in two years, and blood began to get back to the ring.
After that, it was easy.
I knew it last time I was going to be on the light.
I was that shit, yes, it's so fun, that's still a couple of waters.
The body came to count up in September, but after a long decade, only an uncomfortable tree was a great thing.
It's just a few of them around.
It doesn't matter.
The competitors weren't the main aspect of the slaughter.
I'm never going to be counted because of a kiss.
I think it's a terrible stern for four years in the kitchen, and then you're in the shooting the week.
I don't want to think about that, Corpi says.
Today the Corpi is in the midst of the MM boxes held in Sierra Nevada in Spain.
Although individual skins do not like him in a couple of bathrooms, he is always slowly smiling.
According to the amendment, the evaluation of the wages organized by the International Railway Association has increased over the past few years, although part of the farmers also chose to be held by Norwegian X-Game at the same time.
Yes, these are important skins. The visibility is great.
Indeed, I think the appreciation is always dependent on the circumstances and the level of the discussions.
The body is a former sporter in Sierra Nevada, Finland 12-century team.
Rene Rinnecangas and Emmi Parkkisennim, 17 years old, are Corpea 14 years old.
It's good to follow the cost of younger friends.
I remember when I was in that stage, that everything was new and that's so sick of all.
That's the new flow for yourself, the Corpi thought.
You know, I'm still on the shooting, but I don't, it's the slight of friends!
Janne Corpi has also built another sportur.
Manager leader Pecca Kurve son has been shocked to the rail sport: the slaughter has its own raisins to which he does my tree programs.
When I'm over the whole time, I'm not going to be in the lady.
But I'm looking at at at least every day's results and usually something out there, Corpi says.
Radio and rail preparation shall be said to Korve a potential urgency plan when the slaughter's swimming swimming speed will take place during the decision.
I'm not planning so long, but it's at least likely a option.
I'm trying to do that a little as I'm studying it in the end of this lunch.
I'm trying to stay nervous and develop, and in the summer, maybe something out there may be.
If it's my coming professional, it's not difficult to start when it's already ready in the species.
The restaurants include also a dinner with Jaajo Linnonma, the Elitloppet restaurant.
Two of them have been shocked up a ritualisation which will lead to the end of May to Tukholma Elitloppet.
The Corps and Linnonland decided to wake up the old tradition again.
The rice has been a lot of business, and people have been joyful.
Now we're already in that point that at least it's not going to be competitive.
A few months you're still in time, you're hoped to get a ship full, Corpi says it's worthy.
I'm waiting for the Kite project has surprising all
waito Esteri is the name of the new name of the 41-place age shop of Kite.
The construction of a 1,700-metre of the public sector is prepared for the next summer of the Health Centre close to the other side of the Health Centre.
Thanks to the general question of the question of which the new treatment unit is sufficient to customers, since now, during the war, many private treatment codes could be a customer.
In the future, the Chile has more questions to ask for options, except for options, also for effective service.
All services are needed, and when you have options, the freedom of choice will also work better, Flink says.
Wait has been buying private care houses from China last year in Canervich and Erica.
Trade is slowly undertaken, but it is obviously a five-year trade agreement.
Flink says that there is no need to move the operations out of these situations.
Add to the subject this afternoon.
GMB is concerned about the continued operation of the McVitie's Bronn of Scotland
The Professional Union will receive the long-term commitment of the McVitie's manufacturer to the production of Glasgow.

McVitie's bridge's Pladis company told his investments in the past five million pounds.
The company adds that the representatives of the Employees and the Employee will be "released as the first", if they were being changed.
In its letter shown by GMB, GMB calls upon the company "to ensure that modernisation of producers has not been provided to the financing."
The GMB Professional Association Drew Duffy is very concerned that the Chairman does not receive clear information on the needs of Tollcross business and future investment plans.
"The family are working here from the generation to the other generation, and the workforce has been strongly concentrated on the local community and the large cities of Glasgow, which is an important employee in the area of high unemployment and weak income.
The east Glasgow needs to be successful McVitie's production, as well as the increased life costs and production costs."
According to the Plasic reporter, the director of the office had received a letter on the past day and the company responds directly to the letter, since it apprecies the continuous effects of the workers and professionals.
"We had a regular meeting with the employees and the GMB representatives in Tollcross two months ago, when we discussed a number of questions.
We have discussed with the employees, otherwise, that, in the way of other very competitive and uncertain market companies, we will continue to evaluate all our business and institutions in order to maintain our competitiveness."
In the past few years, the company has invested more than 5 million pounds in the production of Tollcross, especially for its producers and for improvement.
"We are aware of the long history of Tollcross, and we will certainly tell the first employees and the vocational association representatives if we are going to make changes in the action."
Have you warned PSG Barcelona from Neymar's movement three years ago?
LaLiga may be interested in Marco Verrato
Paris Saint-Germain did not stop Neymar's Objection after the conclusion of the 189 million punishment agreement. But PSG warned Barcelona from the prespective movement three years ago?
The movement of the sensational play has been long talking about the case, and the French ligator of Ligue 1 is ready to break the world’s view of the transfers. The previous predictation was less than half lower: it was born when Paul Pogba returned to Manchester by the transfer of 89 million reds to the United States.
After the movement, Neymar will be a world's football pool and also the best athletes in the world, as the PSG offers him more than 5000,000 punks a week after taxes.
Barcelona is aware of being wrathed about the PSG function and the way Neymar has gone from the people. The nearest source of Barcelona tells us that Neymar had been very concerned since he arrived in Santos in 2013.
Have the President of the PSG warned this transfer three years ago?
When Manchester City announced his interest in Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned the best PSG players.
"I am not worried, for they know that if they strike our players, we shall be their opposers, and we shall contact them with their players," said Al-Khelaiph.
"We convey all the sweet ones.
But if they feel our players, they're going to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to be accused of this: it would express its interest in the central PSG game Marco Verrato previously in the summer.
The PSG made clear that it would not allow Italians to go in any circumstances. It may be very important that Barcelona lose their star player because of this.
