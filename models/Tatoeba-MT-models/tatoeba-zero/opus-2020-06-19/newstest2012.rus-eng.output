The Parliament does not support the amendment that gives the freedom of Timothy
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament in the amendments to the Criminal and Prosecutive Code rejected the attempt to reverse the article condemned by the leader of the opposition, Julia Timothy.
The amendment that would lead to the release of the prison of the former Prime Minister was rejected during the second reading of the draft legislation on the elimination of sentences for economic offences.
In October, Timothy was sentenced to seven years of prison for signing the gas traffic with Russia, which was unacceptable.
The sentence is not yet finished; the court will consider the appeal of Timothy in December.
Timothy claims that the sentence is a political place of regime; the Western process was also suspected in prevention.
The proposed renumbering article 365 of the Criminal Provision Code, which has been sentenced by the former Prime Minister, was supported by 147 members of the Parliament.
It would require 226 votes for ratification.
Libyan winning
In the history of release or resurrection, Libya has already been lost.
Muammar Caddafi has been destroyed in some desert, without him, the war has been finished.
It was time to determine the winners.
In general, the Islamics are overcome in the country; the question is that they are dead or radical.
The transitional Government has announced himself a follower of the ordinary Shariat law, which we have already heard.
Libya will become a country without crime, because the punishment of the rule is the departure of the hands.
Women may forget emancipation; potential religions will be punished, etc.
Instead of the dictator of the society involving the contradictory clan, the Coran will be united.
It will be a order that we cannot imagine in Libya and who wouldn't desire.
Whatever it was, our shadow of life is not the only one in its own, nor the best and probably wouldn't come, for example, to the population of Libya.
In fact, it is surprising that the Islamic fighters have received assistance from the unbelieving.
The only of them is that they believed that NATO was leading not the American General, but God, whom they glorified after each shock.
And if we are looking for winners in Libya, the West is not in their number.
We participated in shocks, served Islam, and our policies were free from the dictator, their political associator, without any guarantees of benefit.
In view of the recent painful experience of Afghanistan and Iraq, we decided to reject the military occupation of Libya.
The local population, therefore, does not need to worry about the expulsion of the "crestons".
Even though without occupiation, the black gold companys of Libya are practically unprecedented?
It may not be obtained, and the West will finally be able to defeat the unfair protection of civil rights.
If only the followers of Shariat don't end this end.
Starting a new cloud of Crisis
France and the rest of Europe are currently in the centre of investors.
Statistical shore was over Europe on Tuesday.
A number of countries have generated GDP data in 3 quarters.
In comparison with the previous quarter of the Czech economy, Germany and France demonstrated growth.
And today, the long market is cutting backs.
Investors have already seen from Italy not only, but now focused on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
Statistics offices of the European Union in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries have generated their preliminary evaluation of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany has grown by 0.5 per cent; France is 0.4 per cent.
Both countries have also adjusted data on the second quarter, in which Germany was better expected than 0.3 per cent instead of substantial 0.1 per cent). France reported a small decline of 0.1 per cent (the minimum information prescribed stability).
In the third quarter of this year, the Checa economy has shown an anticipal growth of 1.5 per cent.
However, compared to the previous Quartal, the Czech Statistics Office confirmed the tendency to delay economic growth.
The results were worse than the analysis were predicted.
Key events:
In the third quarter of that year, the Checa economy has shown an anticipated growth of 1.5 per cent, but it was in the state of slowness compared to the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, the third quarter of Germany's economics increased by 0.5 per cent.
From July to September, economic and European Union has demonstrated growth in comparison with the previous quarter of 0.2 per cent, corresponding to analytical prognosis.
The economics of Greece have demonstrated a preliminary reduction of 5.2 per cent.
The responsibilities of 10 years are 28.45 per cent.
The responsibilities of Italian and Spanish circumstances are close to the critical note.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, and so on.
Despite the deterioration of the situation in the region, the revenue of the 1-year-old Czechs remains around 4 per cent.
In Germany, the ECB is the last creditor who can save the situation.
The Czech Republic has chosen in Europe.
They winned from 1:0 in the Black, and they celebrated unexpected financial contributions in 200 million.
The National Team has successfully done the most complex task of the season!
Thanks to the magnificent Chahu and the beautiful ball Peter, they wined with account 1:0.
In the second time, the Chesian team was able to maintain significant advantages after the home-to-responsibilities, and it will again participate in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz observed the step and composed a detailed report.
Practically, nothing not to be noted in the first time and a great luck in the second.
Czech National Collection, partially because of the struggle of the team at the end; the Great Chah, and the Heroic Iraks, wined 1:0 in the Black and celebrate the outcome to Championato of Europe.
The Supreme Defence of the Czech team allowed the Black Army team to establish a dangerous moment only in the second half of the game.
Damianovic and Wuchinich became the most unsuccessful couple of matchs after they left two great opportunities.
The Great Peter Chech is one of the reasons why the Chech National Collection does not lose Championet Europe in the next year, and the chesh football is about 200 million Czech chronic crowns.
The game was very pressed since the first minute.
Both teams have experienced difficulties with combinations, playing a large part of time in the field center.
This also explains the lack of pressure from the host teams in the first time, and further shocks have been shocked by the Chech Protectors.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear programme.
They created a living shield.
A number of hundreds of students of the university have created a living shield around the Iranian atomic electricity station.
They also wish to express their support for the nuclear programme of their country before the possible attack by Israel.
On Thursday, the students prayed for the arrival of the building after the prayer of the death of both the United States and of Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundreds of universities have created a living shield around the Uran Fabric.
Thus, they demonstrated the willingness to protect the nuclear programme of their country's value of their own life.
In its last report, the International Nuclear Energy Agency (IAEA) indicated that all evidence that Iran did not allow the attempt to obtain nuclear weapons.
The possible nuclear attack in Iran was discussed in Israel.
On Thursday, the students prayed for the arrival of the Uran Railway, the Uran Hurdle, followed the prayer of the death of both the United States and Israel.
In the case of the attacks aimed at the maximum paralysis of the Iranian nuclear programme, Israeli presss, both in Isfahan and in Nathan, where the uranium is carried out.
Question of children suffering from grain: No breakfast and colbase at dinner
More than thirds of children from 9 to 13 years of age are more standards; while 9 per cent of schools have weight, 5 per cent suffered from illness.
According to the last study, children suffering from grain are usually from families who lead to an unfortunate life.
We reiterately see the importance of environments and modes of conduct towards a person ' s conciliation for his or her healthy development.
For example, the colobase appears on the tables of children suffering from grain, almost two times more than the family with children who have normal weight.
More than 19 per cent of the children suffering from grain, eating at the dinner cardle Fry, which relates to the educational event, called Ogleration, is not an accident.
Furthermore, the family of children suffering from gender is not sported, but this is the majority of the family of modern schools - only 15 per cent said that their parents have time for sports at least once a week.
A study was conducted among 900 children.
A study was conducted at the end of the last year, and about 900 early students were involved in God’s entire education.
It was not the second year of shipment, with the support of VSCHeobecná zdravotní Pojišovna and Unilever insurance company.
At this time, more than 12 000 students of 4 to 8 classes were attended to the project.
The legal food and the sufficient sporting burden are the main factors that are the results of the growing number of children suffering from the weight of expensiveness or of fertilizing.
"For example, only half of the visitors said that they eat five times a day on a breakfast breakfast breakfast, and that's one of the unprecedented conditions of right food," says one of the findings of the study.
No balls and balls at night
Experts warn that even related details are important for health development as a permanent family breakfast time.
The Czech Republic only 23 per cent of school families are cooking together.
In most families, everybody is breaking apart.
The worst opening was that in every ten family people do not even breakfast.
But the morning is the foundation of the right day ratio.
The survey showed that heat food is more useful in families with children suffering from hepatitis.
Only everybody, unless weight, is drinking sweet smells every day (70 per cent).
Although more than 40 per cent of children regularly employed, the number is lower than two - to 15 per cent - when they talk about their parents.
Create your own menu.
Another part of the study of the selected children (204 boys and 172 girls of 13 schools) was proposed to be made up their own menu, from the proposed products and based on their attractions and preferences.
"Food Mediums in Chesh children under 12 to 15 years of age from ideality as regards healthy food."
Their favorite food includes large numbers of mourn, meat and sweet smells.
The final part of the study states: "The accurate concern causes a great popularity of smells of smells, "
As a primary meal guard, the past wins a bird with a small breast.
However, children did not have an interest in bombs, fish and vegetables.
Towards healthy life
The study also showed that children are willing to change their apprenticement in the food, provided that they would be provided for relevant information.
"My participants of the investigation group have demonstrated significant use of healthy food preferences when they completed the channel after the treatment of Observation is not an accident," says the project.
This was particularly noted, for example, in the case of smooth smells - more children were pretending to make them a simple water.
In addition, children have often observed birds and fishes, limited the number of swimming powders and drinks.
Stilists must also be a good psychologist, claiming professionals
In the first article on the styles training, I visited the number of information on income occupations.
I didn't know what it would be.
Lectures of three experts in this area; clothing advises for unexpected spectrums; and the seminar on how all of this works in real life.
There's more.
As far as we are closer to the final review, more information and practical tasks are expected.
It's training every Saturday and Sunday, but it's really a good information.
At this time with Alanka, director, we discussed how one woman is not perfectly symmetric.
Most women are not completely symmetrical.
In one short shirt, the other child's figure without appropriate forms, another weights more standards.
The strip must know how to decrease the wide shoes, to smell the shoes or to add the insufficient amounts.
We gave advice to highlight the figures of women such as Jennifer Lopez, that is, the owner of a swimming grain and poor, and the skin of the tall, and that is not too much more.
For example, if the difference in the field and the poor is so large that it is not possible to draw up a shoe or a brown, it should be one thing to be sent to the order.
You will not obviously be grateful of the materials set, since the perfectly sit clothes are unworthy.
In the sandwich, you will feel much better than those who are going out at the summer, find the talent, etc.
The machines, on the other hand, may have clothes with shoes, applets, switchs or machines.
In view of the use of such information and the type of graphics, I'm glad I have a whole week to understand that.
But I'm afraid it's too much, taking into account the home task we have received.
Each participant of the course had to be considered two places for any famousity: a day and evening.
We need to learn their modern outer species, their styles in clothing and figures.
I'm here with Miranda Kerr, who you can know about the advertising campaigns of Victoria's Secret.
I'm glad about myself, because I'm going to eat her much more simple than I say, Brian Spirs, Christine Aguiler, who recently moved to the ton (because I'm overwhelming) or the very young Celene Gomes.
We need to get the clothes out of the magazines or find it online, print and process with graphic programs.
Mudbord - this is the result of the work -- then reflects our own style and the relationship with the graphic image.
It is important to keep a graphic style in the head.
The style is not just aware of real people but creates product pages in the magazines (update on specific indications, such as modal tubes, palto and etc.).
That's what the stylest and designer Mario Camenik told us.
But it was just Sunday.
Styles need general knowledge
The Saturday Lecture on Figure Types lived three specialists in this area.
Stylest, Honza Pocorn; a modern designer, Jacob Polanka; and a modern photo of Ben Rench.
Jacob reminded us that the model is the illusion and the style must use the data.
Good style has one object of clothing to use.
In this case, diversity is key to success.
For instance, the palm-dritch can normally be loaded, the surface of the jains and the footballs as a palt; but it can also be put on the left body without slowness as a shock.
Another possibility is to cut the hand or get up the door, and the entire image is completely changed.
"Gay with him," he stressed.
Anyway, I was more grateful to the following advice: "You must know the rules for your work perfectly."
Then you can start infringing them," said Jacob.
Here I finally understand why we're going to make all definitions and rules that are to combine with what and why, while in moderate magazines, we often look very different.
Don't talk about mode shows.
From Ben, the photo, I learned that the style should have more options than the number of photos he had to do.
Yes, for a model review on 10 pages (equivalent to 10) I must be ready to create as a minimum of 15 images.
Now I also know that on the picture of the clothing object, it often looks and works in combination with others not just as in reality.
We have to mean that when we create a image.
Honza Pocorna confirmed that many mines and styles were half of success.
Look at Madonna, who does not have a shooting army, but her gang and marketing have transformed her into a world star.
The relationship with the styleists in the Republic of Czech remains still quite slow.
Even known people often believe that it is unlikely (and believe that they are sufficient to be a specialist in something and how they look to be secondary).
And if someone finally allows us to create these styles, we should expect that they call us the other (lower) size than the one they really have.
Then we're talking to Google and explaining if there's something that's not written to the tablets about some famousity of the poster, and that's, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario focused on the fact that the style is not sufficient to consider in mode and to be able to put up.
Our work is mainly of communication with people we join; therefore, it is important to be a good psychologist.
To assess people, not create them and maintain their views.
"If the manager asks you to look at her clothes and add a few beautiful things, you can't get her all the gardeow, said her that her clothes are horrible."
"If you can praise a few things, you can praise, and recommend what you can bring with them."
He also showed us that specifically the labour should be placed.
It's a tasting that you're connecting around the tall to bring everything necessary.
Besides obvious substances such as feet, rope or English sheets, it should be neutral (styles use it with some objects, such as shoes or shoes), special clamps to strengthen the shoes on the snake if the clothing is too large (bottles and similar objects are prohibited because they carry clothes) or strikes.
To get away from the medication and get some practical experience, we learned to do correctly on the tuberculosis.
Even during a swimming study, where a swimming swimming smell, the swimming smells can be damaged - not talking about smells on the street.
And here we got a snake.
You don't have to do anything to do with your legs so that you don't export them.
This requires a real masterity.
I was glad that Mario loving my work.
The qualities mentioned have not come to me in the soul.
It's only part of what we heard during the second part of the weekend.
I'm starting to understand that being a professional style isn't so easy that they wouldn't say.
V Need for Speed: Ride in America.
Operation
What had to be an unfortunate passenger, it became a rutin sun journey to work because of a series of completely unreasonable and unfair errors.
Ambassadors were satisfied, but it was not important because no one was obviously wanted to do a clear job.
Before the new version with the subtitle "Flights" has linked great hopes.
It was expected that the previous series of Need For Speed series would be found in a new direction; the demonstration version showed that the game would take a suitable place in the jeans of the honey games.
We were glad to see the part of the game where the main hero goes out of the car and runs.
As often this is with NFS, it is very different from what we expected.
The game represents a very bad arcade, but the general impression causes a number of unnecessary errors that are present in the game series for a few years.
That means, in fact, that is not a mistake, but an unexpected bound of developers.
It's very good.
You are part of the story, the main heritage, Jack, to solve some personal problems by participating in the illegal throne through America.
You sit in a car on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your job is first to reach New York.
This idea has a number of interesting features.
Marshrut is of ten stages separated by over 50 hour.
This means that each roof is walking on its route, and individual stages are in a variety of and interesting environments.
So there is no feeling that the game always happens.
Despite the same level as the previous parts of the series, some traces are pleased to consider.
However, the game does not cause strong emotions.
Although the car is driven through the desert, it is very pleasant to be sweet in the swimming mountains.
Furthermore, the hole lives from time to time.
For example, in the desert, you will fall in a swimming snake that is significantly low to the visibility.
On the other hand, the mountains need to be careful so that they do not fall under the lavine.
The individual holes are very well arranged.
There's a few differences, but it's enough.
Sometimes you're trying to smell a few of them (in the existence of the ordinary ring); then you'll try to improve the time (in second), or you're going to ride with one opposer.
Besides what else you're on the police, which is still more complicating your task.
Outdoor components are new.
It's just an interactive animation where a large part of the time Jack runs away from someone and you have to help him click on the necessary buttons for the time.
Nothing complicated.
Although it is surprising that these fractions are much less than you could expect (all three to be exact).
In fact, it is good for the game because it does not require it; taking into account all the above, it is one of the things that make the game more careful.
The Honour Model is following the previous models.
This means that it doesn't make it anymore a particular thing, but it cannot be considered inadequate.
If you are looking for a real life, you should be looking for another place.
However, this model of shipment is very good for dynamic rings, although you can find better options on the market.
Together it's very good.
However, there is some time to start a problem.
Unlike the models of the starting models, it's not so good.
You don't expect complicated conversions and bindings from that game, but if you don't have any ideas before the mounting of an object, how your machine will drive yourself, something is wrong.
Usually, by driving or walking a car in a flesh flow, you sometimes have a slight concern of another machine, and sometimes in practically the situation of your machine begins to be drunk.
Or the murderers were cut off.
This is not so important as the restart system is, but it is enough to export fun.
Restarts are set so that if you're cut or get away from the trass, the game will return you to the point where she stopped.
However, for each hole, only five restarts are available.
If you're using them all, you'll have to start a ring since the beginning.
It's useful if something doesn't get, but you can't believe it completely.
Sometimes the restart is inadequate, and you have to learn to use a separate hole area.
The major inadequacy of the game is the fact that the same things often occur in the same places.
For example, some turns need to be a certain way, otherwise you can't just write.
In other cases, you meet civil machines in a certain place in one and the same configuration, independently of the first, five, five seconds before or a minute later.
This is especially disappointed in situations when you see that your companion is easily walking between two machines moved into the opposite direction, while when you are there, the machines are already located so that you need to move them or slow them to speed.
It is not important when you are close to them; everything has been built so that the situation is always happening as a time before your skin.
The counterparts have other advantages.
During the game, you find a few places where, despite time, one of the same partners will shoot you at the same place.
This is especially obvious at the end of the game, on the long bridge where you eat in the opposite direction.
Surely, your covenant must stand before you, despite anything.
The case is that when he goes before you, he hurts you a review that leads to one or a few audiences in this area.
You can understand the attempt to make the game more interesting and full adrenaline, but it is so obviously that it begins to make a divorce.
Because, despite the simple model of the primary, it is employed and sometimes so fun and you don't have time to focus on the event around you.
It's not important that you don't lose - a concept of 50 unique traces, a hole or something else.
The idea of shifting the machine during the shooting is uncomfortable.
You need to follow the cars on the road, because, in fact, your car may change, despite the most of you already have, is completely enough.
The machines are shared in three categories.
Sporting machines go to towns; powerful American machines - for direct shoes; and ecologic super-sporters for technological starting, such as shocked mountain traces.
The main mode history mode is closely linked to the mode challenge mode; it's the counts on individual parts you're familiar with the game loop.
Here you are inquiring for your personal work as well as the shoes that are common for the challenges and history regimes.
Many of the possibilities are available to obtain higher levels: starting from the car and ending data of profile.
In addition, the profile related to the online Autolog function, which compares the results achieved with other players and provides public connection.
This is another deficiency that is difficult to understand; this is an example of the last counts in the next place.
You and your car will fall in a tonnel of metro (which do it) where you smell in darkness (which think that it is).
Your spadometer shows the numbers from 150 to 200 km/h (I think that it is) when a metro flows back to you, converting your car to a metal ring.
Over a few days, our edition discussed whether nobody really thought at the creation of the game or its creators really considered us such a bleeding.
The technological game does not represent anything special, but the general impression of the videos in most parts is pleasant, sometimes even awesome.
Although the quality of the record is at some critical times, sometimes very strong, is regretted.
This applies particularly to events with large numbers of participants, where the good record would not also help you.
It's all right, Sawtreck, to the lover.
To welcome how much more young audience is possible, Saoundreck's compounds of different styles have been composed of different styles, but not many people have purchased a game because of her music.
Overall impression of Need for Speed: shoot is very uncomfortable.
If the game was clearly avoided unnecessary errors, we could honestly say that Flight is the best part of the NFS in the past few years.
Anyway, the game remains incomplete.
Of course, it's a good disappointment, but prepare for the shortcomings to hide you as a airport driver.

Ambassadors in the EU Assessment:
The reputation of non-employers and skeptics in relation to the euro has been held in the Czech Republic.
"The Lisbon Treaty made significant differences between individual organizations."
"I didn't expect that it would be such a cruel war."
" The need for five or six years before the situation is stable, and all the games are inclined to their new roles, " ambassadors EU Millena Vienna Vienna began hardly their study at the legal faculty.
She proved how simple and understanding its girl "Yes and open for Europe " was in the first part of its lesson, where she described individual EU institutions and relationships between them.
Furthermore, Vice-President, Herman Van Rompey, commended the work of the new Permanent Chairman of the European Council:
"The first critics said he was a series of official museum that could not play any role; I should say that all were surprised how good he had done with his role."
"The man who can listen to twenty-seven participating countries is good to share with them and has a clear presentation of the part of the EU's development."
She explained its new position for international relations and security as a response to the question: "Who is the European Union, what number I need to call?", that is, the important step towards the unification and greater transparency of the Union's policies in respect of countries such as China or India.
No one's going to ban our skins.
The evaluation has continued to focus on the EU's key programme in the past, the present and the nearest future.
She called a successful chairmanship in the past year.
Chechs had a case with the emerging financial crisis; they overcome this crisis and organized the Somit of Eastern Partnership.
She said that the disappearance of the Government was at that time a negative revelation caused by the German damage of the Republic of Czech.
The representatives of Czech in the EU are now very busy.
As the Ambassador said, the Presidency and the following financial crisis continued to be broken.
It is also necessary to take the new seventh EU budget, which is very difficult, taking into account a modern crisis.
Whether budgets will be sweet and economic, which areas will provide; those countries will receive more support and less support; all of these issues are in the next programme.
The Ambassador recalled the key lounges she brought to Brussels: "O Europe, understanding language."
"I really don't like the reduction, foreign words and jargon that no one understands.
As citizens can understand that in Brussel people are not trying to sell crystal or round shoes, different bananas, or that someone will prohibit our shoes."
It will also use the EU environment more effectively and engage more chains into European organizations.
Multi-agriculture Europe is our future
The police claims that Chiefs are considered euro-skeptics, as well as those who are precisely negative, not positive.
She wished that more representatives of the Czech Republic be involved in the European organizations.
She believes that this is a number of factors: for example, the modestness of our candidates and their inability to write a motivative letter; at the same time with a small support of the Chesk side.
In addition to the successful Chairman ' s presidency, she noted the strength and cooperation of the Vishergrad Group.
"Cree that when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary and joined us, the French said to me, "Why is the congregation again?"
In the future, the Evaluation Union expects a new strategy for the budgetary policy of States parties.
In comparison with the new European Federation, it is considered a double-sized idea, if not a multi-sized Europe more realistic.
"We have both countries and countries beyond the borders of Eurosona."
"We have a Zhangen zone, and we've already got the Institute of Force Cooperation."
"The first time it was said that countries who want to be united, while those who do not want may remain in the side."
"The number of such institutions will grow, that will be the actual double-sized Europe", expects the Value.
In this regard, she emphasized the role of the Czech Republic as well as Herman Van Rompey in promoting the rules in which all issues relating to all the EU should be discussed by all countries parties, not only in Europe.
Brenda history:
The IBM involves the second stage of its existence.
If someone wants to find a word that is better expressing the IMB strategy, the nearest might be "debt."
For the wide public, IBM is a symbol of technological revolution; the company is considered very modern, although it was based for more than ten years ago.
The duration of the company was put to her first boss, the dreamer Thomas J. Watson's older.
He believed in her girl, according to which many world problems could be resolved if people want to think.
His “Dumai” lounge thus became a stamp around which was a future guigant life (and also the name of his internal magazine, which IMB began to publish in 1935).
Moreover, it was the foundation of a corporate culture that Watson carefully expressed.
"For us in IBM, long-term thinking means a constant movement towards the future.
IBM lived and prospered for hundreds of years because it remained faithful to its initial values, although it was not afraid to change everything around himself.
In our first hundred years, this allowed us to convert technology, business and company.
In the second hundred years, we hope to get even more,” said the current leader of Samuel J. Palmizano in the case of jubily.
Common system
In the 1930s, Watson addressed the concern of the servants as Batia in the Czech Republic, IMB officials were one of the first American servants with payable disbursement, assets of employee, an eligint university and a complicated bonus system for best researchers and entrepreneurs.
These are long-term IBM relations with consumers.
From the beginning of the company, there was a huge use of talenting people, and it was one of the first world companies that eliminated the entire discrimination that offered its excellent choice.
The anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan, in accordance with which Women, Virginia Robothy, will change Palmizano in the next year.
She was working in the IBM for thirty years; she is currently the director for sales, marketing and development.
In recent years, the IBM organized meetings, online brain stories, during which many future innovations exist.
It is unexpected that many ideas are working in the company around half a man.
Organization with good reputation
The strong position of the company in business is provided by strong internal and external immigrations.
From the beginning, IBM's concept was better than a technological company, said the Economist of the Harvard Business School Professor and the author of the IBM Disabert Moss Canter.
"IBM is not a technological company, it is a company that helps to solve business problems with technology", adds Joe Coloni from the Forrester Research Corporation.
As it is said in the company, there is a difference between entertainment to go to the market and create it.
For hundreds of years, IBM, or "Global Giant", as it is called in the United States because of his logotype, has become one of the largest companies of the world.
It seems that this is the most universal technological company, the developing and software supply; the infrastructure; the heating and the consolency services, from the servers to the nanotechnology.
It has the largest number of patents among all American technological companies, five of its staff received the Nobel premium.

With $220 billion, based on market capitalization, IBM has become the second major technological company (the first place in Apple company) since 1996.
Show forward
Not all its products came to the purchasers and were recorded at the epoch. For example, IBM suffered from its operating system of OS/2; the online Prodigy service and the PCJr IBM computers.
"If your business is determined before, you can't be emotionally involved in the past," says Samuel J. Palmizano.
That's why IBM makes several platforms a basis -- if they don't work, it rejects them.
This is different from its Microsoft competitor, which is based and caused by Windows, its operational system.
Prospective technologie
The main income of IBM is received from services, some five in each case from computer programs and devices.
As in 1990, with the capital of two less than, it was the stronger manufacturer of equipment.
Since 2000, IBM has sold 15 billion dollars low income assets, and at the same time 58 billion in purchase prospective technologies.
She continued to invest even after 2008, when the world was the first towards the current economic crisis.
IBM should be an example of his first director, Thomas J. Watson, who increased the number of investments in the Great Depression years.
It seems that IBM did not hurt the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, the IBM share price increased by 120 per cent; the purity of the company is constantly growing.
Corporate IBM nine is to change everything except its own values.
It may therefore be expected that, even if another crisis is disrupted, this smooth guiant faces the situation.
IBM's history: from the soft foot to space flights.
IBM (International Business Machines) was based for a hundred years ago in New York, and its original name "Corporation, Tabulation, Registration" was very complicated.
She took the name of IBM in 1924, which was originally called Brand used for company offices in Canada and South America.
The main part of the future IBM was the streaming of four companies, the history of the 1880s.
They owned technologies such as legendary " Tabel hours, i.e., physicianing hours when staff come and get out of work.
The architector of the new company was an entrepreneur Charles Ranette Flint, who also engaged in the company's council until 1930.
Flint took the director of the competitor company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him manage the company.
Then, the leader of the IBM founder in the darkness of Watson's ideas remain the base of the unfair corporate culture and individuality.
Watson resigned the company until 1952.
The IBM, as clear from the name, began from the production and sale of different business equipment, from green legs and meat to cash devices.
In the first four years, the shipment was doubled to nine million dollars, and the company began a wide expansion of all continents.
Watson was so important for the company, that almost four hundred years after his place in the headquarter, Thomas Watson's boy.
Under its leadership, IBM began to develop art intellectual technologies and created the first language of programmation.
In the 1960s, both staff and IBM computers helped NASA to control space flows - at Mercury, Saturn, and 1969 - a human flight to Monday.
In 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers - IBM line System/360.
The classical CPC, which determined the computer standards at that time, named IBM 5150, appeared at the market in 1981.
After twenty years, IBM sold a computer production of the Chinese company Lenovo, buying the Price Water Coopers Consolential Office, thus fully focusing on the console and services with high value.
In the past three years, the IBM has made great success with its concept of Smarter Planet.
Its goal is the wise use of technologies in areas that have not yet been planned and the improvement of road situation and urban management.
In the field of trade, IBM recently presented Smarter Comerce platform, which helps entrepreneurs to control the whole trade cycle.
IBM traditions are strong even in our country.
In the former Czech Republic, as the first country that was simultaneously in Central and Eastern Europe, the IBM founded its office in 1932.
Today, the IBM CZ is also managed by the Strategic Absorption Centre in Bruno.
The Division of Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, where it also works with the world-level research group that recognizes the speech.
Injury to his infidel husband:
I'm not gonna need him anymore!
Darin Rhithtarjwa (53) said that everything was done!
After her husband Joseph Rhitarge (53) became a body conservator and loved Ivá Bartosh (45), Darina still hoped that he would start and return home.
However, she did not want to wait, and set clear rules for his future life.
"Pap can return home, but not as my partner," explained Richtarje.
When Darin Rhithtargiv had been offered in her house of Bartosh, she probably had no small idea of what would happen to her marriage.
And even though she let Eve go from Ritchan 30 days later, Pepa didn't leave the beast.
Furthermore, he acknowledged publicly that she loved her.
After a while, Darin came and made a look that had died with the Roman husband, and now he finally forgiven him.
I'm still going to ride with whom his wife is.
Even if Rhithtarge and Bartoshwa are disappeared, his wife will not take him with disrespectified smuggles.
"He's my son's biological father, and if he wants to take his last days in our home, no one's going out of it."
"After he ends his days not as my loved, lost and found old drunk, but a man with whom something is connecting me," said Richard, adding that she has already been released from my husband and just put up on the boards.
Before Joseph had nothing against his wife, he was rejected.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Ivy, I won't change it."
"My wife decided to leave a marriage on a bowl, and I respect this decision."
Our Union continues to work; I'm responsible for repairs, gardens, houses and shopings.
"There and I are very normal, we're just not going to share beds", said the magazine Blesk.
He claims that if Rhitarja finds a new love, he will not hinder her.
"We're not sleeping together, and I'm still where she goes, with whom he has a friend.
I know that it's my fault, I loved Eve, and I have full responsibility," said Joseph.
The worst women's affairs: Are they chasing you?
When you ask men to call some kind of women's bad affairs, they are generally counting all of them.
Dear ladies, do you know yourself in the next lines that describe a number of women's traits that make men evil?
Shopping
Your second half regrets that you're walking on the shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one thing every week?
Do you like to purchase a lot of sales?
If so, your showping can be considered a stupid shooting.
Some women recognize that they need to control their shocks.
But who of you is displaced from the shops of clothing in the search for perfect clothes and its examples (for example) in different colors?
Perhaps it's a hobby for most women, but for men it can be the only fool.
Just remember how many times you said your second half to wait for you outside...
A Life Injury
"I'm too excited?"
"I need to slow as at least five kilograms - maybe I'm going to make a gymnastic?"
"There's still on me?"
Do you know these phrases?
Yeah?
Then you enter the group of women bound to your external view.
Not that you have to stop following yourself, but many men, in letterly mean, have an alergia on permanent complaints of partnership on their own external nature.
The strong gender agrees also with what is more often the case of such complaints, and more women are disappointed.
It is important for all orders and cleanness
It's like an unconscious story.
Mocka steel, shocking piles, my pocket, the copper, the sweet cleaning, as at least two times a week.
Do you criticize your partner because he starts on a clean cafeteria in the clean bottles; kids for crying in clean crystal and printing fingers on the window in the guest, which was so difficult to clean?
If you are suffering from this “circumcision”, try to understand that it is very bad; and that your family’s order and cleanness should not stand on the first place.
Indeed, cleanness is a threat to your relationship, as well as your whole family.
Communication
"Brow the whites in the corsin."
"You're going to get the blue feet tomorrow?"
"The Marshall ships should not be on the ground."
If you make comments to your partner several times a day, it may be very convenient.
Of course, you have good purposes, you just want to be perfect.
Maybe, if men understood that, women shouldn't have so often commanded them...
Skills
Some women like to smile, strike, and smile intégrity against others.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss where, with whom and why.
It's like, from time to time, each of us's shooting.
We'll be open and look like all the women's nature.
In any case, there are more severe shoes, women who are often buried and presuming others, especially in women ' s work collectives, are a major danger for their environment.
The resulting transfers of Yaga and Worcek helped Philadelphia to win
During the NHL shop on Monday, two resulting transfers of chocolate attacking Yagra helped Philadelphia to win 5.3 on the ice of Caroline, and again became the most outstanding chessian player.
In both cases, he used the experience of thirty-year-old star experience, and added another transfer and was announced by the best match player.
Two resulting matches also belonged to the player in one team with Yakubu Worochek.
After the Yagre Match said to the foreign journalists that he predicted the great night of Jorah.
"I told him to the mask that he's gonna forget the heettrick."
"I felt it."
"Atime you feel like that," explained Jagre, after whom Jüra had killed the first chance that Flyers gave.
Shortly later, the second team also had a "China suite".
The remarkable Harriekens Worches had a shirt and delivered her to Maxim Talbot, who slaughtered between the circles.
In seconds before the first interruption of the home game Patrick Dwayer has reduced the explosion with the advantages, but in the beginning of the second secret, Flayers again took it.
Specially Jüra.
After the resulting duty of the Yagra, he killed the third hole; his next shock was converted into the fourth Wayne Simmonds.
"I like to play with him."
"I don't mean he's the best liga player, but he's exactly in the three of the best ones," said Jagre, loving his center.
"I never thought that at the end of my carriage, I'm going to play with a cracky game like he."
"This makes me happy."
"I want to support him."
"All these years in NHL, my team friends tried to help me, and now I'm on my mind," added Jagre.
Carolina made a shop more dramatic using Tuomo Ruuth and the Duyer panels, cutting the shooting to one hole.
More complications prevented Matt Rid, which increased the disappearance to two points.
"Pronger has worked well in our area."
"He shocked the shoes, I spent, and Rid moved on the ground."
"I've been in him and I'm glad that it's worked," she described my impression from the last handle.
The wine provided Philadelphia to the first place at the Eastern Conference.
The protector of Montreal's chicks, Yaroslav Spacks, did not complete the shop with Buffalo; he left the game in the second period, because of the tragic part of the body.
However, with the experienced protector, Canadians lost their dual advantage and lost 2.3 after the series of panels.
Thomash Plecanic couldn't forget during one of their attacks.
More than lost eyes, a home trainer was shocked by a larger number of rabbits in the back, as the shop was completed with five protectors.
"That's bad."
"We've been finished with only one experienced player, the rest of the young people."
"Whatever it was, we can't do anything with this, we just need to do with this," said Jack Martin.
"The names of the replacement, it was ridicule, and we couldn't resist."
"We had to simplify the game, move the shoe from our zone."
"What was our weak side," added the protector of P.C. Subaan.
After thirty-first attacks, the Chechish golfer Henjai Paul helped Vinnipegs to win the Bay 5 - 2.
Jets' hands, who stopped the fifth series of infringements, were killed by five different games.
Dinamic prices since 1989
Up to 1989 only five public tourism agencies could work in the former Czech Republic: śedok, Sportrist, CKM, Recrea and Autoturist.
As travels to the West were strictly limited, the tourists were mainly sold to the social block in the country.
Thus, in the Czech Tourist Canadians, they went to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Society, Great on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (the two countries in the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balaton).
The only exception was from 1962 to 1972 when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia, and then the Yugoslav regime returned to the West, which has resulted in significant limitations to the traveling of the Tchech Tourists to Yugoslavia.
The largest paradox of the socialist period was that the citizens of the socialist block (e.g. and Czech Republic) were not allowed for individual travels to socialist countries.
If the Czech Republic wanted to go to himself, for example, to the Soviet Union or Poland, a letter of invitation was necessary from that country; another personal journey was not possible.
At that time, tourist agencies proposed travels to West, but they had to stay all night, with a bedroom, or have a "good friends" in the office.
And it wasn't yet.
The full permission was necessary to travel to West, and it was not issued by the political uncertain people who had not yet been allowed to travel.
The currency was not freely converted; without monetary permission, it was impossible to obtain money (which currency) for travel to Western.
In fact, a large number of cottons and flight houses had been carried out in the house.
After 1989, tourism was so survived to the real revolution.
While our travels were culminated in the GDP or Bulgaria until 1989, in the past year 4,5 million leaves in countries around the world have been held in Checa.
The Great Paradox, which we don't know, is that until 1989 we could not be freely visiting the most popular today of Croatia because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
At the beginning of 1990, the need for visa in the neighbourhood of Western Europe was deleted, and it began a great deal of short travels in Vienna and Germany.
The Czechrusians couldn't be on the western journeys, and they all wanted to go there even if they were in mind.
For example, in Paris, the cheese tourists sleeped in the parks because their revenues were not enough for a guest or a pancin.
The typical feature of the Czech Tourism during that period was to bring its own food (consertions, salts, etc.) to collect money.
Another important moment is the introduction of a chess-converted Czech chronic, and our tourists can finally buy the western currency.
Our life level and the average income growed, which resulted in another important circumstances around 1997.
Since 1997, the growing demand allowed tourists to prepare regular ships carried out by a terrorist aircraft, compared to the past, the aircraft now became incredibly disabled by the possibility of ordering optical shipments.
Until the end of the 1990s, the visa was not needed to visit almost all developing world countries, except the United States, which has made our trips more easier.
The following significant events in the history of the journeys after the revolution occurred in 2000, and the largest demand was historicly brought to the first direct card race from the Czech Republic in the exotic country in Thailand.
Since then, Czech tourists have provided direct chair races in warm ecologic countries, and this winter fleet from the Republic of Czech will be sent to twelve exotic directions.
Currently, about 1000,000 Czechs visit the exotic countries every year!
And another important event of this period, symbolized by our development after the revolution, occurred in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States rejected the need to receive a visa for the chesian tourists, and our country has thus joined the world's most developed countries.
In the first history of 2008, more than half of its leaves were passed outside the border (50,3 per cent); and in the first history, more than 15,000 chrones were expenditured during the displacement, including their expenditure.
The General Assembly must choose the President, the threat of the patent is returned
For about five months there was no President in the chessian football; there is a risk that the priest of Ivan Hask, head of the Chesian Field Association, will not even be called after another external meeting in Niemburg on Sunday.
There is no agreement on the rules of election to follow.
Without this vote one of the three candidates will not begin.
Idridges Rail, Miroslav Pelt and Tomás Pazlick are willing to call the chess football.
Gashek went out of his stay in June, and he called his colleagues to join and find a strong person that would call a football in the future.
However, the era of Gasheka reloaded a football in the division of two associations palms that couldn't choose a single candidate.
This was very obviously 16 September when the new President had to elect.
The Delegates of the Common Meeting came to the National House in Prague, Smihaw, because the negotiations remained blocked, not only the election procedure.
It was not agreed that those who have the right to vote to the general congregation were only legal representatives or officials provided by the authority.
Since then, it was partially resolved by the recommendation of the State and the Law Institute, according to which the representative based on the powers provided is impossible.
The arguments relating to the election rules, however, continue.
The Executive Board does not also help too much, although in its congregations, both in general and indirect, it is mainly employed to this issue.
Submissions have changed several times, but the key issue remains the same.
The question is: How to go to the 3nd round and avoid the castle?
" The spot is to follow the established rules or find another model," said one of the Vice-Presidents of the FA-R Duchan Suboda, who represents the professional football in the association management.
Based on the model prescribed by the establishment, the winner of the 3th round is a candidate who receives a large support for the room from which he speaks to the candidate.
As it is said, Moldova agrees to compromise to consider the winner of the candidate with the most common number of voted in both rooms.
The Czech party is constituting that, in the general percentage of the winner, two thirds of the vote should be taken.
"But however, two previous rounds would lose their sense, and it would be fully rejected by the concept of two palates," the Freedom agreed with the Moldova ' s statements. He said that it would be better not to change the rules and to vote in accordance with the existing rules.
Many unexpectedly, Tomás Pazlick agreed with his view, although, according to the assessments of the election rules, Pelthat is more than other candidates.
"I would like the elections to be able to smell."
"I want to avoid the possible representative stupidity, as in the previous general congregation,," said the owner of Victoria Pleane, who first is a candidate; and in his statements he mainly opposed Pelt.
Pelt remains optimistic.
He believes that the new President will be known in Nigeria; he also hopes that future candidates will cooperate constructively.
"All emotions will be peaceful after today's expected outcome of a national collection in Championship of Europe."
"Fotball will be again happy, people will work more willingly," said the representative of Jablonian, and from three candidates, he has more experience at both professional and regional levels.
Rail's more detention.
"I hope to the agreement, but the situation is very unlikely."
"This is not between the representatives of Bolivia and Moldova, but there is a attempt to adjust the rules."
"That can call another shock of the general congregation."
"I hope the good meaning will win", said Rachel.
It was not so much time for the parties to reach the agreement.
Some information shows that individual negotiations were directly in the Red Norwegian; but who knows whether a football unit would be reached.
The additional chair that was to add, including other, the Vice-Presidents, Dajar Kuchera and Ryan, had not fled from the Prague of the morning because of technical injustice, and the alternative was to bring part of the Executive Committee to the place of the overcome.
Finally, a meeting at the ministerial level, expected at the environment, may be a decision-making.
The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport, Joseph Dobesh, would like to be the most powerful sporting association in the country.
There are many: Government subsidies; creditability of the footbool; and the general STV meeting planned with the new Czech sport directive after the financial problems of Saskat.
Pacific enters the Presidency because he does not see a suitable candidate
If, before the outcome general meeting, the head of the footballists of the Pulnnie Tomás Pazlick would see a strong candidate that would comply with all his requirements to the President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAśR), he would not even claim for a high post.
"If I would have been a suitable candidate, I would have fighted for him and I wouldn't participate in the fight."
"But that man hasn't been found before," said Patty.
Pacific's motivation to fight Miroslave Pelthoy and Yindrich Railway is to try to prevent Pelt, the preferential election preference, to enter into the administration of the FATHR.
Moreover, Patrick stressed that in the case of victory, he remains the President only until 2013 when a regular meeting was planned.
In the future, he would like to take the experienced fuel-minister that is not too bound to a football life.
"I talked to some people that could mean."
"I was horrible to hear how some of them said that at this time they don't even want to have a relationship with the Chesh football."
"I would like to change this opinion," he said.
Currently, the main difference between Pakistan and Pelthoy is in connection with the recent relationship with Roman Berbro, President of the regional football Association in Pulne, and Berlin is a anti-oriented reputation that is known as a influential lobbyist to affect the vote of the delegates of the general congregation.
Pacific therefore considered it unacceptable that Pelt would become President.
"If he wins, the current situation remains without change, and the football will not move forward."
"In the support of the Barbara, the possible businessman, it would be even more angry for the football," said Patty.
He pointed out that a few years ago the name of Pelt was recorded during the hearing of telephones in the investigation of corruption; Pelt could avoid a sentence.
"I don't know what's the prestige of the Pelta's victory would bring to the football."
"And as we looked at the EUFA and FIFA," said Patty, "and now he doesn't mention his previous statement that he will sell the Palestine club if Pelt becomes President."
If Pazlick wins on Friday, he could present cooperation with Peltho in the future.
This view is part of another candidate, Rachel, whom Patty supported the overall congregation in September, which was finished by the Fiasco.
"It would be the first to whom I would call."
It's very powerful.
"I can imagine him in the head of a assembly."
"But he can't control the association."
"I am not also in what I don't know," said Patty, who brought a large number of attention to myself in September, when he supported the removal of the trial brigade sent by Lude Macelloy, who changed Dumkay.
The patient claims that he is risking to manage the association.
He refers to his experience of the management of private companies; since the past summer he managed the Plulunch team, which was using his first triumph in May.
"I have strength to make a football environment change, support her change to better."
"Restricting the influence of some groups of persons who are strict to influence the discipline and appeal advice that leads to the reverse situations", said Patty. He does not hide his antipathy, for example, to the director of the Space Daniel Krynig.
One of its priorities will enhance the relationship between the FARC and the Czech Olympic Committee, with whom it will help to allocate at the higher political level the higher number of sport money from the lottery collections.
"This is one of the key moments to be taken by the new President."
"If taxes are imposed, as politically claimed, I understand their arguments, but they must declare clearly where the money goes, " he said.
The Pacific does not consider its connection with the Pulling Club as a burden, although he claims that President FABR should be independent.
Pelt is connected to the Yabulonian, and Rail with the Prag Dukley.
"This isn't a perfect option."
"But I don't see what I'm going to be in the hidden transfer of my Plucky club to someone else, when I'm going back there for six months," says Patty.
Pelt promised the new rules of the FAśR that would enable the Elected Party
Two days before the general meeting of a football association one of the candidates at the President, Miroslave Pelt, promised that, if they elected, he would fight for the new rules of FAśR to avoid conflicts on the rule of election.
Before the negotiations in Nimburg, the Yabulonian functioner remains optimistic and believes that the attention of the prevention of the fight is depressed by the expected success of our football collection today.
Before the lost elections in September, Pelt promised that, if he wins, he focused on both representation and the receipt of financial resources.
He decided to participate in elections at the last moment before the last general meeting, and two months delays could therefore be useful for him to resolve his ideas about the football in a broader context.
"There's all levels have been in the football for a long time, and they're expecting that the President will be known on Thursday."
" They feel that it is now the time for someone to make a association", said a man who is mainly related to the Yabulon club; but he has spent many years in Space and the Executive Committee of the Association.
This gives him the reason to suggest that he is sufficiently experienced to be managed by the Chesian football.
He believes that the present problem is called the aforiah reigned during the reign of Ivan Hashka.
"Peace, the rules that were not so perfect as we all thought were adopted in the general congregation in June."
"If different ways of representatives were not adopted, we would have already been the President from September", said Pelt.
He resigned the key document of civilian association as a false goal for delegates.
"If I become the President, I'll consider that my personal task, and I'm going to take personal responsibility if this trial is unsuccessful."
"This is a fundamental question that we cannot exist without", says Pelt.
Besides, he says he doesn't try to split himself on the back of the shock.
In the past, he stated that he could provide his cooperation with the Indigenh Ryan, whom he valued for legal education; he fully recognized that his co-advisor must become his first Vice-President.
For a long time he was not attacked by Thomas Pazlick, who has always criticized Pelt.
"He has made a certain success in the football more than a year."
"Whenever it was, his attacks were unpleasant, and many people surprised the methods of his predicted campaign."
"Besides, some of them are now doubtful in his true personality," said Pelt about his competitor, and he himself claims that he is faithful to the declarations announced in September.
He considers its main weapons of knowledge of the football, from low-level to the national collection.
The National Collection should represent the entire football.
"I would also try to stop all incidents, starting with the case of gods or the consequences of the last year corruption scandale."
"I would focus on negotiations with both private and public sectors in order to ensure enough money for the whole football," said the candidate two months ago.
Then he promised that his election at the head of the football did not depend on the vulnerable personnel.
"I'm going to know the official instructions of individual staff." It was his sentence to Strahav, where the duration of the period between the authorities causes an understanding of nervousity.
Despite the present catastrophic scenarios of the planned general congregation, he believes that the delegates will not come in Nimburg on the fourth day.
"If the only conflict is how to take elections in the third round, we can do so."
"Fotball needs confidence that he can get only elected to the end of his leader," says Pelt, who remains optimistic for two days before the key day of his carriage.
Rachel promises that FA-R will start actively working with its leadership
If in the congregation on Thursday, the Vice-President, the Vice-President, Chash-Fotball Association, would be chaired, and many people in the Association, listeningly, will be unwanted.
Rachel promises that if he's chosen, it's going to be a hard job.
He wants to establish changes in the system and to make members of the Executive Committee responsible for the individual fields in the football.
He also promises to solve the problem of gods; to improve the relationship with the EUFA as well as with the FIFA; to bring more money into the football; and to continue work by the previous President, Ivan Hashka.
"When President, I would like to focus on a football overall."
"The EUFA and FIFA international contacts, to national collection, professional football and youth football activities."
"I don't want to say that I'm doing everything myself," said Rachel in his interview to TK.
"I am the command player, and I would like to distribute the power to the Executive Committee so that each member should focus on a specific area."
"I'm carefully distributing the tasks, so that each of these segments of football makes great steps forward."
"It must not be liked by many, because it will mean hard work, but not just the critical work of others," he added.
The atmosphere of the football movement suggested that he was questioning in his candidate.
"or I know I'm working 20 hours a day."
"But I have to know whether there's any meaning; and that I'm not going to be around people who put my shoes into the wheels and who have made me any doubt of my step," he explained their doubts.
"But yet, many people said to me that I shouldn't be able to get up, otherwise they'd come."
"This is the confidence I can't abandon," he said.
Moreover, he says that his motivation is to continue his work with Gask.
"A lot of work has been done for that two years, and I don't want to overlook all this."
"There are starting processes that can bring results over a few years, and I don't want someone else to stop them," he said by fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelt, will be elected, the situation in the Association can return to the one that was to Haska.
"I believe in systematic approach, and that's what Miek Pelt's competence is."
"He's around people who would work with a football so that he'd be accessed only to the chosen."
"May can be accused of many, but it's not exactly as subjective."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make a football available to everybody, because then all will take good time, not only the chosen minority," said Ryan.
He also checks the accusation that he would be only President of Checa.
"They many people are trying to say back, I'm planning to make the maximum for Moldova."
"For example, it was time to think about the second lines on the Czech and Sea, whose winners would continue to fight in the first liga."
" This will prevent the current situation when there are only three Moriab teams, which is a problem for youth players in Moldova," said Ryan.
While the presidential struggle entered Tomás Pazlick club, Ryan is not intended to evaluate his chances of winning.
"But however, I still feel strong support in the Chesh House, which has chosen my Vice-President, and I see that I have achieved some clear success," said Ryan, and he was able to deal with the economy of decades of millions of krones in unexpected contracts, the negotiations with TV and the negotiations of the Lottery Act.
On the other hand, he is partly responsible for having an unity in association.
Bearing in mind that Pelt was "excluding from the returning process of the Chesh football" he is considered the second counterparty, the Pacific, a strong candidate who has to propose.
"Nobody can doubt that he worked well in Pullen this year."
"If he will choose, I hope he will continue with the start of Ivan Gashek, without significant careful changes in the committees."
“It wouldn't be telling the facts for its benefits,” said Rachel about his companion.
The most beautiful substances of Europe
Drop in the Water
Julia Stake
Children's bathrooms with universal voluntary optics and state baskets in Budapest, which can try an incredibly water of Europe - and decrease the body that was left in jacuzzi after the excursion of the city or the walk.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
Without one thing, Iris Meder couldn't be able to spend during his research trips last half of the year: without its purchase costume.
The left in the water, she looked at the top with a sweet-formed cup, shooted up to marble heroes, waiting for her in the area of the bassin, and loved carefully rebuilding bassins in the ar-weapon style.
She tried to add every favorite bassin into his block, with the important details of building and building history.
The architector Meder has seen more than 200 platforms and now collected impressions in his recently published book Badefreuden (Book Roads), where all of the public basins in Munich to the historical shopping parks in the Black Forest and the functional beton buildings in Taunus.
Her “reportation in the most unnecessary shops in Central Europe” was conducted through 13 countries, including Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and visited the shops in Italy, France, Slovenia, Slovenia, Slovenia, Romania and Poland, and one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
46-year-old author is the real enthusiasm of the purchase culture.
She experiences very little enthusiasm regarding sports, says Meder, but in the water it is all different.
The unique deficiency is that swimming worshipers must be peaceed with the skin and cloud sweet, while the flights can smile by the swimming powder of shoe forests or listen to the joyful birds in the park.
"After I asked me why the swimming baskets should always be so terrible," says the living in Win Meder.
"So I started collecting beautiful baskets."
When the surface turns up the architecture
The swimming in the basin and the sauna - health factor in the shoppings is so important, since Meder believes that all feelings are stimulated.
And swimming baskets may be very pleased to see if the buildings take such work. "Instead, you have water surfaces."
"It's very transparent, but also reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is incredibly reflected: high throats, colour sleeves, and tramps.
The illustrated "Buy Radocity" publication on 190 pages contains a valuable information about the architectural and cultural history of the health oasis, and calls for you to swim in water.
The Meder Water Collectioner has found a number of exhibitors during the study in Hungary.
It has found a rich water nitrogen in the cartle pearl (Mishcoltz-Tapolis) and a thermal bathroom filled with milk water, in the building built in the form of the bottle (Városi Termalfordo in Yasbiren), as well as great therapeutic purchase, such as the 100-year-old Sechine purchase in Budapeste.
From many incredible open bassins in Switzerland and Australia, on the other hand, it's a shocking species, and you can see the whole Zyriach from the shopping shops, or consider the swimming Arberg from the open bassin in Sant-Anton, and there's a window that allows to see the events in the western.
It may be the most unnecessary design of buyers in Langenfeld, which appears to be the NLO only in the Alpes.
The winter is up to three of the open cancers, which are very small on the back of the Ectal Mountains.
Algamber in Swartzwald
The copy of the Meder wasn't meeting cloud in each bassin.
Many of the term shops are shocked by a series, and the copper name of Arcade in Becketschabe is so strong that you may be hard to believe you're in a health source.
The water is almost black from the skin when you are loading in the bassin is a health experience of a certain type.
Iris Meder, however, in a certain moment, was disappointed in his search for beautiful purchase places, and when she tried to visit the open basin of the Chesh shops in Lugashiz, she found that the territory was printed.
The coppery projected by Duchan Yurkovid was closed in 1902.
When Meder looked at a red and white-year window in the ar-week style, she saw a shoe that grows between caffel balls.
One of the places where the destruction was stopped by the horrible follow-up, the surprising placing basket in Schvartzwald, the Dead of the Term water in Bad Wildbade.
The Bassians have already been through three stages of construction, and you will find not only the non-roman elements of the period after the building in 1844, but also the Maurice Hall in the Algambra style added around 1900.
After a precise reconstruction in 1995, the Term Garden is a favorite swimming basket of the Iris Meder and not only because she was born from Swartzwald.
" This real achievement is so massive to combine such different architecture styles", says Meder.
In the terminical basin in that park, it is apparently a smooth occupation.
Agricultural production
Finch Bank is investigating the trade of agricultural products.
Christian Tivs
Doech Bank stops to trade agricultural products?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Joseph Akkerman gave the task to investigate the impacts of the poor worldwide.
The Executive Director plans to change in January.
Gambourg -
For the German citizens, the situation is clear, and 84 per cent of Germans are inacceptable that the banks are equipped with agricultural products such as birds and cucuurs.
Two thirds of the requested persons require that Doych Bank and other banks stop the marketing of agricultural products, since trade affects the problems faced by the poorest people worldwide.
The findings were made in the study conducted by the Institute of Social Research and Forsa Statistical Analysis from the consumers of Foodwatch.
The study is based on the report submitted by Foodwatch in the midst of October.
The report author Harald Schuman demonstrates that the games on world goods have higher prices and banks, thus participating in global hunger.
Consumer protection campaigns are directly addressed to the head of the Danny Bank Yoseph Akkerman, although large bank houses, such as Hodman Sax and Morgan Stanley, operate the same.
The goods rates were originally considered as a means of protecting traders from the collection of prices.
Nevertheless, most experts are now agreed that the games are rejected from the proposal and demand rules and are used by the poorest ones.
Rather than competitors in the United States, Akkerman responded to the critical, and he promised to investigate the accused and said that there was no trade "no risk to be a good reputation of Doych Bank".
In accordance with SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group currently investigates the accusations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The survey should be completed until the year end, when the results will be submitted to the Governing Directors Danny Bank's Board with the recommendations for action.
The head of the bank then plans to declare the changes followed at the end of January.
Trade may be decreased or completely stopped.
Akkerman works on his immigration.
The President Foodwatch Tylo Bode has enjoyed the news, emphasized its critical attitude to the financial sector. "The increased food prices are an example of the unexpected example of banks currently acting against common interests."
As the main lobster of the bank at Akkerman has a certain responsibility, Bod thinks.
"Dache Bank must remove all investments that make money rates for food prices from the portfolio", said Bode.
"It's not important if it's about the hungers or the reputation of Dacha Bank."
The early reaction of Akkerman was surprised, but the director would like to have an unforeseen injury for a few months before the end of his stay in the office.
Doych Bank announced on Monday that the Chairman would not go to the observing Council as planned.
The disagreement of speculation on the market of food products could improve its nigs.
He also does not need to take care of the expenditure - with the consequences of his primary.
Each second would reject the investment in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep pressure on the manager.
Today more than 30,000 Internet users were joined to the organization campaign.
Bode published a study in Thursday, which was conducted for the Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis of Forza 7 and 8 November, and 1001 people participated.
Not more than 11 per cent believe that investments that make food price rates are acceptable for the Danny Bank.
Many bank customers would also take concrete steps if they found that their bank is involved in such trade, and according to the study, each second would send contributions that finally bring to the specialization of goods.
43 per cent would be recommended to leave from the bank, 49 per cent said that they thought about the closure and transfer to another bank.
21th century house in Vienna
Pavilion on the New Place
Vincebourg
Architective history with planes, falls and a happy end, and Paulon Austria, the World Exhibition in Brussels, was shocked, became a museum in Vienna, a wilderness and was buried.
Now it's opened again as an extraordinary center.
Pavelon Austria, designed by Carlo Swancer for the World Exhibition in Brussels, is an example of modern post-architecture with its simple forms, strict sweet shells, who expressed faith in technical progress.
Pavilion Swanzer has bought Gran-Ad by architecture in 1958 for its slightly swimming swimming construction of its becomes and swimming.
The building is considered a wide in modern architecture.
The architect was so well known that he also built an Austrian pavilion on the next World Summit.
Finally, he glorified the whole world in 1973 by his legendary BMW and her sister as a chash building.
Pavilion, as a building for temporary exhibitions, was transferred to the Switzerland garden around the Southern Wayne, converted and opened as Museo of the 20th century in 1962, and is often mentioned as "the 20th century House" for this reason.
Anyway, the building did not agree to the museum on technical and space views - there was no stone in which it could be painted for arts and a bad air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until the modern art of Vienna had received a new house.
Since 2001, the home was desolated, and its status was worse and worse.
Architector Adolf Crishanitz has resetted the pavilion named "the 21th century" and will be used as a modern art Museum.
This museum is the Belveder Museum Division, which opens the first exhibition on Thursday night, in all senses of a joyful event.
Agnes Hussein-Arko, who became a new director of the Austrian Galerie of Belveder in 2007, has contributed to a new start.
Hussilyn-Arko, a historic historic historic historic physician in Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum, and finally became a founder and director of the Museum of Modernity in Salzburg, convinced politicians and guards to continue reconstruction, engaged public resources and private donations and decided on how the building would be used.
The new museum had to be placed with a permanent exhibition of the Fund of Friza, Café, and a bookshop along the modern art, and an official building should also be built.
Strong control and limited budget
Crishanitz was then a perfect candidate to implement the project.
He was known, due to the restoration and expansion of the Vienna Session, Joseph Olbrich, and wins competitors, but he also learned at Swanzer University of Vienna, and Palilion was a "excellently important place" for him where he visited the exhibition "until week".
He knew the original design and knew the tasks that were before the building, the building that had already lost part of its greatness and easyness when it was transferred to Vienna and converted.
The problems in the last reconstruction were very seriously, and the building was "populator of energy", says Krishanitz.
The window profiles were replaced by a strike fascinate, a forced sleeve safe sleeve was placed, and a high-scale switch was replaced.
The traduction of the warm bridge was strengthened or replaced, and the shooter was burned.
Two stages below were built a space for the new use of the building, shooting the light shooting between the building and the streets, which makes it clear, almost new buildings, but continues to be elected by the Swanzer pavilion.
The original doors were stored, and the building was elected in an old red-root color protection against corruption.
The kinotheater is the same as before.
All of these are in a strict control of museum management and with a limited budget.
"We often had to find material that was good, sweet and accepted by the museum management", says Krishanitz, indicating a weird behaviour in the subway.
The building remained flexible and light, despite limitations, problems and preventions.
Crishanitz recently noted that the pavilion of Brussels was a typical story in the city.
This architecture is not always on its own place, but he wants to "move the real understanding".
At the 21th century, there is a very proper place, because in the planning of the city, an unexpected luck has occurred, and the full rebuilding core of the main vacuum, with offices and housing in movement around the Switzerland garden is growing.
The second happiness of the 21th century may be complemented by the Second Cristina Collector, Francisk фон Gabsburg, has acquired the Interim Exhibition Hall of Berlin and, as it is noted, the negotiations with the city on his location near the Switzerland garde.
Germane Bahn plans a multimillional winter anticrisis package
Germane Bahn has generated an anticrisis plan to avoid the slaughter of winter journeys.
The number of staff must be increased by two.
The costs are millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Germane Bahn will cost more than 70 million euros in this year to avoid winters and late trains.
In response to the internal anticrisis plan Germane Bahn, the Billd newspaper reports that up to 2015 a total of EUR 300 million was planned.
Investments are allocated to improve the labour capacity of local and frozen networks even in extreme weather conditions.
The number of own and dedicated staff in sneety and platforms will be increased to 16.000.
The aim is to clean the platforms from snow and ice before work and 90 per cent of the necessary pillars from four to five hours.
Rudiger Grubu, head of German Bahn, warned the possibility of cancellation and late trips in the winter meeting with Government leaders and industry two months ago.
Last winter Germane Bahn had experienced significant difficulties with passenger transport because it was not enough for reserves at the time of deterioration of the weather conditions.
Many of the new regional trains have been expected to accept the Federal Economy Service.
Some delays were also delayed by the ICE trains.
In many years, Germane Bahn has also been much more to check the ICE trains as one of the ICE trains was cut into the main airport in Kelene.
Doych Bank will pay a lot of millions of feet in the United States.
New inquiries resulted in the concerns around Joseph Akkerman, Director-General Danny Bank: Doych Bank threatens a lot of millions of feet of sterlings in the United States.
The last industrial guigan in the United States has now been slaughtered by Daych Bank, and the Bank is paying $145 million in Francoforte (106 million) to enhance the controversies resulting after banking during the financial crisis of the five major credit unions.
The problem occurred around the sales of hypotheticals.
The National Financial Market Office (CNUA), the Financial Market Regulator, condemns a number of larger banks that they have used false promises to make credit unions to purchase their financial products.
The quantity of funds was slightly slow during the financial crisis and has led down the credit unions.
"We are glad that we have solved this problem without treating the parties in court," said the representative of the Bank in New York.
The bank had not recognized its fault in the Agreement.
Similarly, the Citi-Gruppe agreed to pay $20.5 million.
The President of the CNUA Debbie Mattz welcomed the operational response of both banks.
National credit unions management (CNUA) is responsible for the United States credit unions and is involved in banking processes to protect consumer contributions.
CNUA is fighting for the compensation of losses exempt from billions.
This is the first agreement of such a kind.
The regulator also focused on other major banks and summer cases against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
Summary hypotheticals are such as the value papers safeguarded by epothetical credit smuggles.
They are supported by internal employees.
This decided to judge a number of financial companies, when in 2007 the inmobility market was slaughtered.
The American Investment Bank Lehman Brothers ordered to live long in September 2008 for the financial crisis.
A few years later, banks in the United States are still fighting with shock.
Investmenters and regulators have made a large number of claims, demanding compensation or punishment.
The Federal Women Financing Agency (FHFA).
It condemns 18 major international banks that they have acquired $200 billion in the United States credit organizations Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
The Bank is also under the threat of the judicial persecution by FHFA on several general value agreements 14.2 billion dollars between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator requires that the bank with a headquarter in Francoforte takes the responsibility for the "social losses" but has not yet indicated the precise amount.
Doy Bank rejected the claims as unreasonable and reported the intention of opposing them.
Warren Baffit contributes 10 billion to IBM
The Baffit Financial Gulf is actively investing in the IBM IT Companion.
Since March, he purchased the shares in the total amount of more than ten billion dollars.
The larger American investor Warren Baffit has always stated that it was not invested in computers and ITs because their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, the annual report of IBM changed its view of investment in this area.
According to Baffet, it should have been very much to understand that IBM first proposes services and purchase computer systems for other company IT departments.
In the financial world, Warren Baffed has been estimated as a market progress.
IBM, veterinary IT-related, has now been entitled Sir IBM.
In the interview of the American Business Channel, CNBC Baffit reported that from March he acquired IBM shares for a total of $10.7 billion.
His investment curding Berkshire Hathaway was one of the largest IBM shareholders with 5,5 per cent.
Baffit said that even IBM had not been aware of his participation before the recent time.
He endorsed the mining that was able to achieve even during the financial crisis.
"They have done a great job," said Baffit, with a meaning of a mining strategy.
The significant time of IBM was focused on high income IT services such as the centre date.
The main component of the computer sector, which has been proposed for more than 100 years today, is offering more software and consultative services, as well as powerful computers for business.
Baffit has still avoided technological companies.
He claimed that he's investing only in the company whose business he understands.
and invested, for example, in the carriage transport, in the production of soft materials and in machinery construction.
His coldging Berkshire Hathaway has a long list of larger companies, such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (ex-munchener back), along with about 80 her own daughter companies.
The 81-year-old has acquired a small textile company of Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and made it based on one of the most precious companies of the world.
His form of life, however, remained modest,
He made it cultural figure for unnumbered investors around the world.
His almost unfair instinct in money brings him the name "Oracula from Omachi".
The price of IBM shares increased by one per cent before the opening of the market after the Baffith investment announcement.
The Golden Giant, as still called IBM, has more than 220 billion dollars on the fund board, which makes it one of the most precious world technological companies along with Apple and Microsoft.
But Baffet said that he wouldn't be invested in Microsoft.
Her founder Bill Gates is his close friend.
Inevitably
After the outcome of the twins in Zwickkau, the Turkish media became doubtful in the authorities of the Republic of Germany.
One of the newspapers speaks of the "The Main ideology", which is now slowing up on the surface.
The murder of the eight tourists and one Greek businessmen between 2000 and 2006 were the result of the right of extremist ideology.
The fear and concern reacted to this message in Turkey and the German and Turkey community.
For many towers in Germany, this news has been forgotten for a long time, and such orthodox orthodox attacks have not been shocked in Meln in November 1992 and Zolyngen in May 1993.
There was no doubt that xenophobia in Germany exists.
However, the right-extraordinary network now has such a scale that is not yet completely understood.
"Breaking Blood ideology?" was the title of the Turkish Haberturk newspaper's Internet version.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, notes that one of the criminals was a secret acknowledgement of secret services, and expresses concern that the German authorities may have been engaged in the legitimate illness.
Turk community in Germany (TGD) has reacted calmly by the victim of racial hate against the Brendanburg gates in the weekends.
Over two weeks ago, the Turkish community of Berlin at the ceremony with the participation of German and Turkey political politicians noted the fifty-year anniversary of the Dual-Turkey Dual Agreement on the Labour Force.
The cooperation between two countries was a positive light, as a history of success.
The publication in some Turkeyn media was as sweet. "The German's fifty-fifth anniversary" was the name of one of the articles on the Turkish Internet Haber X, the commentary situation of a series of murders.
The German publication of Heritage also did not allow the parallel to take place.
It's the name of the Ahmet Culachji column.
He notes that the murdered persons who paid taxes and their work have contributed significantly to the conversion of Germany.
The police ' s conduct and the successive area of the German and Turkish Internet forums were criticized.
The authors asked why the German authorities had not previously thought to follow suspects in the law-extreme circles.
Some authors have reached a very rare rhythm. "If they will continue to act so unlikely, the migrants will have no choice, except the armed self-defence."
"This will be the best self-defense."
"The Mother in Germany is very dependent on how the network and the justice of punishment will be hidden", writes "Selen".
Crimes in Meln and Zolyngen in the 1990s were example of the peace in Germany under threat.
The photos of the grain in Zolyngen were deeply impressed in the memory of the Germans and the torch.
No other events have shown to the tourists that there are so clearly lived, that there is a danger on them, and the Germans are that incredibly and equality may be a real violence.
However, these crimes have increased the feeling of the torch.
Do not repeat errors in past
The Turkish press was mainly condemned by the German police after the attack, and Germut Cole refused to visit the survivors in Meln.
He sent a telegram to the President of Turkistan after he was slaughtered in Zolyngen, but participating in the Memorial Ceremony in Kelene, his Minister for Foreign Affairs Claus Kinkel Kinkel, was subjected to the taxes paid in Germany,
Like he determined the value of human taxes that he pays.
The current revelation in Turkey's media has reaffirmed how the incredible incredible of many German tutors to the current German State has been.
He clearly showed that it was necessary to do more than the efforts to identify and revalue legitimate terrorist organizations in Germany.
Bank Scanda on the Cuban Lake
Most European banking policies are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has not been swallowed during the financial crisis, and since then it is struggling towards another crisis.
Now returning him to a faithful course must be Germany.
Alex Weber probably didn't suspect that he had the role.
In July, after his effective departure from the head of the Federal Bank, he was declared that in 2013, he would start working at least effective post, the Chairman of the Directors of the High Swiss Bank; an unexpected and rewarded carriage.
Alex Weber was obvious, honored Switzerland for her beauty, UBS for a re-reliance and made several friendly comments in the address of his future colleagues.
"UBS could change to better."
"I'm hoping to work with Caspar Phillipher and Oswald Grabel."
But in September it was clear that everything would be completely different.
The UBS Treeder in London was covered by the bank security system and lost about EUR 1.7 billion.
The Executive Director of the UBS Oswald Grabel is a bankier known not only in Switzerland.
Since then, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of UBS is considered sick, and everyone wants to know, when will Alex Weber finally be in charge?
Weber should consult the bank from February 2012.
And as the bank stated on Tuesday, the post of the Chairman of the Board will take in May, not in 2013.
This will be hard for Alex Weber.
He is a professor of economics and specialists of Century, not a traditional banker, and he is uncertainly needing time for adaptation.
He was soon responsible for the Bank's strategy, which has proved that long ago the call of "the main bank scandale in Europe".
The UBS, from one part, has managed the world's largest assets, and the other years did not benefit from scandals.
It seems that the Swedish Bank doesn't have anything.
Everything started during the financial crisis.
Up to 2007, the UBS had a beautiful reputation.
The Bank has connected the image of a hidden and sustainable, but at the same time a fair management as an ambitious goals and the effort to become the larger player in investment banking.
In 2007, UBS managed 1.6 billion and thus managed more cashable clients than any other bank in the world,
and as an investment bank, the largest banks of the world have entered.
That's the impression.
Hans Gaeger, an ex-banker and professor of banking business, who has long provided to the University of the University of the Bank, explains: "I have always brought my students to UBS as a picture of a good bank."
"What we know now, you can ask how I could be wrong."
He's really very wrong.
Only in 2007, it was clear that there was something wrong with UBS.
In the middle of the year, the executive director Peter Wofflee, who was considered to be an extraordinary intellectual, and at the same time a literature banker, went unexpectedly away.
A few months later, we could suggest why he was gone.
The Bank's Investment Unit tried to play on substantial price shops and was required to write billions.
You want to believe, you don't want to, but the UBS reported about the increase in the capital for 13 billion Swiss Frances to resist the crisis.
The Bank was really grateful to find investors - but investors whose services would still have been rejected recently - one of the very unproportional Asian Sovereign Funds from Singapore and one Arab Sovereign Sovereign Fund that was hidden so much that even the name was not reported.
It was just the first shot.
In April 2008, it was much worse.
Bank had to declare new billion losses, and the Chairman of the Directors of Marsel Opel, second on the payment level of the Chairman of the Directors of the Board in Switzerland in 2006, left away.
In October 2008, a disaster began, because of the lack of investment during the financial crisis, the UBS was threatened to the struggle, and the State had to save it.
The National Bank has purchased a total of billions of dollars in UBS, and the Swiss Conference paid six billion Swiss Frances for the convergence of compulsory convergence to become a owner of the bank.
The whole Swedish was shocked: the country understood the dramatic consequences that large banks in a small country were shocked.
At the end of 2007, the UBS final balance was five times more than all production of Switzerland (see graphic).
"We can't save UBS in the second time," says the bank analysis of Gaeger.
The second disaster came quickly after the first.
A few months later, the UBS funded tax controversial with the United States and stated that he was ready to provide state clients that might have been able to give taxes.
UBS also agreed to pay $780 million from the reimbursement of unfair income from business plus costs.
The UBS therefore acknowledged that it was a instrument for tax displacement.
At the same time, the UBS lost his advantage to combat rich customers, the secretity.
After that, the Swedish banky secret was no longer the same as before.
The Executive Director and Chairman of the Directors' Advisory, after that, have been departured, and
The money of customers started.
In the course of a few months, the bank lost confidence in both main areas of its activities - in investing in insufficient speculations and in management of assets resulting in assistance and promotion of tax disbursement.
And it's all over, and it's been like, that the UBS could slow up the situation, as this disaster occurred with a trader farmers, and a single trainer left 1,7 billion euros before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
The risk management of the investment office is clearly not working.
“The Adoboli Institute has clearly shown that risk control has not been changed,” said Martin Janssen, Economy Professor and Finance in the Switzerland Bank Affairs Institute of the University of Cuba.
The Financial Director of one of the largest German banks is also uncertain: “UBS has no risk control tool”.
This is a long timely carefulness for Switzerlandn bankers for larger world shareholders - not a risk of risk, but the security for money, without the disappearance of the world outside the Alpian Republic or not.
Swiss banks have become a symbol of unreasonable confidence as Lindt and Springli symbolizes a shocked shock.
The UBS Apartment in Cuba still corresponds to the image of the pleasant Swiss private bank, just a little more.
Her position is in itself classic.
The main office of the bank is located in Zurich at Banhofshtrass, which leads to the main coast to the Zyriff Lake, in the area of the Switzerland mountains.
The buildings here are grown, and the shopping rates are one of the highest in Europe.
Among the traditional Swiss business type of Confiserie Springli, you can find young companies like Tiffany's.
Switzerlandn banks have been equipped here for hundreds of years from the National Bank to the port of Keith Suisse and the elite private banks, such as Julias Bar.
The hard door leads to the UBS status.
Towards the shooting snake, the shooting snakes stand, with the embleming bank's large seef indicator.
The UBS knows that he needs his customers, that's the reliability.
But both Switzerland's largest banks, UBS and credit Suisse, in any moment rejected the Swiss banking idea, or, as one of the Swiss small banks believes, they had led them.
He wouldn't want to see his name in the newspaper, as well as all Swiss bankers, also cooperate with two larger banks.
He believes that the UBS is too large - in particular in investment banking, where English is very active.
He thinks nothing to add here to the Switzerlandns.
"And if there's something, they've been adaptationd to the angsakson practices for a long time."
Indeed, the angsockson investment banking has changed UBS, bringing it to the first big arrives, and then the fascism, and no other financial institutions of Europe had lost so much money in the Jungles as the largest Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparently 15 October 2008.
“In that environment, a small country of population in seven million has undertaken the greatest rescue operation in the history of the country,” wrote Lucas Hessig in his book of Khares UBS.
Politics approved the election of 68 billion Swedish Frances (e.g. 45 billion euros) to save the bank from banking.
How could I come to this?
If you ask Swiss banks, they will say that the problem is mainly the UBS.
Two of the three larger Swiss banks joined one major group in June 1998.
There was a bank education that has already been too large for a small Switzerland, and a bank that has continued to grow.
This also helped two UBS banks to complement each other, one was rich, but a steady bank specialized in Zurich for the management of assets; another was not so rich but much more internationalized.
Internationalized investment banks have immediately received access to a large number of money that they could use in order to move the entire powerful routine.
Two names are related to the growth of the UBS: Peter Wolfley, Executive Director of the UBS Group from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Opel, Chairman of the Directors Board.
"I always thought that Wolfly and Opple were the dream team," says the Bank Analytics Hans Gagger.
"Wulfley, which is intellectual, modest and deeply comprehensive models and statistics, and Opplel with his internal instinct, which passed the whole way up, starting from the staircase in the bank."
But Opel was finally put on Wolfly.
Wellfly could make a critical mistake. "He decided that his models were reality," says Gager.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
The honour is inflicted.
The servants of the UBS recall the meetings of the government members on which Wolfly has always repeated one and the same lounge - to hide Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At that time, he declared the "tourn table" in which bank successes were made.
The UBS wanted to be on the top of this table.
He could take part in that way.
UBS was the larger player in the trade of currency and public valuable buggers.
The authorized management advisers, however, indicated a weak place, and the parameters called " permanent income " were far behind the largest banks.
UBS had lost in American hypothetical products.
In order to shut the dragon, the UBS entered the autumn who had never been in his life.
As a result of growth, the bank itself and its established hedge Fund invested in American substantive papers.
This has been developed in a large mechanism, which combined the value papers based on the American and powerful credits and continued to sell them, and continued to bring risks.
Even when other banks have been looking for a way to go out of this process, the UBS has not stopped.
“The UBS has struck until the summer 2007 when the American market of inmobility has already been fired,” says the bank analysis of Gaeger.
As far as the growth is above, the deep down.
One manager had to go on when attempting to put the bank into order was more difficult than first.
E-mails to UBS have become a child game with stales, and there are still uncertainty to the present day.
Before anyone who launchs this large bank, it is almost impossible.
He must find a bank strategy that has returned to all the existing business models.
Gaeger's bank analysis already has an idea - rejecting investment banking, focusing on the management of assets and forgetting their Switzerland rains.
The bank, however, isn't ready to go so far.
However, it is obviously that investment activities need to be substantial.
The new head of the Sergio Ermotti bank plans to submit its future strategy on Tuesday.
The 51-year-old Swiss banker had actually been considered only as an interim decision when the bank was unexpectedly disappeared with his former Grabel.
In the past time, he was grateful to show the nature and now, as he stated on Tuesday, the UBS continued.
Ernotti plans to return the investment bank to the state in which he was in the mid-90s.
He reduces 3500 jobs.
But that's not enough.
UBS needs the concept of development.
What is UBS?
How is he planning to pay money?
These are probably Axel Weber.
He's still publicly told only that they're looking for a apartment in Zurich.
The next year.
Recesions in Europe are cut down by the American Fund
The emerging recession in Europe has deteriored the establishment of American investors in the beginning of the week.
The change of governments in Athenach and Rome had no great effect.
The decline of industrial production in the continent was hoped that a long crisis could be overcome.
The general consolidation of Governments in Rome and Athena did not have been supported.

Industrial troops fill the city
Greats are considered difficult birds in many places, and today experts say that these very intelligent birds are not able to get out of the cities.
Some like birds, others would like to be removed as soon as possible, and the troops of centuries were part of the city countryside, but people who are complaining of smiling and smiling are increasing in many populations.
The problem of birds, however, has not been achieved.
The first symposium dedicated to the troops, in Ler, the experts said that the player was no longer able to get away from the towns.
Specialists and all Germany have discussed possible decisions.
Search for urban alternatives
Consecutors claimed that the root problem in the cities was in migration of special protected games, indicating that the use of chemicals in agricultural farms was increasingly destructed by traditional swimming arrays.
The struggle of the building and the slaughter of traditional trees has complicated the lives of birds.
The troops are safe.
In the city of Zest in West Fari and northwest in Yevere, Dipcolze, Ahima under Bmen and Lere, there are large colonies that contain more than 600 parents.
The unacceptable project of the vulgar fleet in Lere issued unacceptable newspaper titles in 2005.
Critics described the wood of birds in the bowl and slaughtered with them as a special cruelty.
"The good movement and dispopulation aren't giving anything." - "The architect and the Landscape Designer Verner Clever from Lera said.
The slaughter of water snakes or trees are often unwanted, said an expert on the protection of the environment of Manfred Kaiser from Lara, Baden-Wurtberg.
"The lives are disappeared, and large colonies are shared and distributed in other areas."
Powering can only be excluded from hospitals, homes and schools.
"We have to live with them, they're free from them, not an option."
Mr. Ler Wolfgang Kelner will not be resolved in the departure of the areas in the towns.
The combination of birds disappointment from the needs of living areas and their encouragement to return to other areas could be a way.
The "Information Stewards instead of Benzopil" was a logo proposed by psicologist and etnologist Utoia Marie Yürgens, who speaks for a complete different approach to birds. "We must be sure to live with this problem."
Jürgens was one of the founders of the training routine in Asherberg in Slovenia-Gongthene, where information about the lives of very industrial games is provided.
The project has already been interested in tourists.
Jurgens also expressed his view of the complaints made by birds. "The Sum provides a lot of information, and they have to say much to each other."
The snake of these birds entered into the lingery, and the snakes often use not only weapons to protect the sighted pieces but also make their own weapons.
Training researchers at the University of Cambridge recently protested on four games of birds.
In one experiment, birds quickly understood that they had to smell the smell to get a skin.
Without special training, they found the size and shape of a stone that was necessary to shoot.
Another experience of constitutive players had to address a more complicated task.
Researchers put a small bicycle of prayer in the vertical cylinder.
The birds couldn't be able to get a ball.
But the researchers gave them a piece of shock.
All four birds were used with a snake to make snakes and to use the snakes to stir the skin and cut it out of the cylinder.
Three of the four players have done this from the first trial.

Massive murders - Human measurement
The painful and very good new book of Peter Englendo 'Crasso and pain: the personal history of the First World War's " begins a long list of active ones from whom heart dies.
This is the advice to read the following: Be carefully cut this page and use it as a bookmark.
You will meet these people very closely by the events of Mr. Englendo, and this list of active persons will be your GPS, your magie at the time when, like one of these men and women, you'll get on the road and lose in the dark war.
Mr. Englendo is Swedish historian and journalist.
It is also a new permanent secretariat of the Swedish Academia, which condemns the Nobel Prize on literature.
The book he wrote now is innocent, he describes it, pretty precisely as "the work of anti-Historical."
There are few known names, important treaties or famous battles; there are almost no paths, journalists or tactics and war technologies.
It's not so much book about what it was, he explains, "the book of what it was like." It's about "the feelings, the impressions, the concerns and the condition of the spirit".
The book 'Crase and Train' was a single experience of more than 20 years of military men and women, both of the front lines, from school schools and boxers to alpinists, doctors, fast assistance drivers and servants.
Some of these people will be heroes.
Someone's going to fall in the ball, lost his hands or legs, get out of mind, or die.
Their lives are here as church snares: new are added to many others, and some are at this time.
The book of Mr. Englendo is the outcome of the historical book standard.
This is the amendment to imagine that the First World War was only a weak war on the Western front.
The "Create and tribulation" has enabled other military theaters: Alp, Balkan, Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The troops in this book fall a sleeves; one of them meets the Christmas in Egypt under the piramids; the unresolved problem is a shock.
It's a worried book, almost from the beginning.
The war covers the lives of these people like a natural disaster, such as the uragan Catherine, who is shocked by unexpected pork.
When it's close to the canon, and you're a woman and you're home with children, you're gonna stay in the place or get away?
Well, or otherwise, who's going to do that?
There is no one who understands what happens and actually why we have to fight in this war.
"The lack of facts," observes Mr. Englendo, "complete with memories, suggestions, hopes, fears, ideas, theories of conspiration, dreams, cosmetics, and listening."
"Cruz and Dress" is the court of people such as Florence Farmboro, the English nursing in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpff, a young German flag of open sea.
Their history is mainly taken from memories, letters and other already published materials.
Discussions of their lives may be horrible or hidden, but they are mostly living through the small moments and the detailed details of Mr. Englendo.
Many of them are about punishment and how to do with them.
When he told the history of a German school, he said, "Erzaz, it's all right."
"Amenticicofe, separate aluminium, hate rains, paper links, tree powders."
He continues to tell herself in Germany.
It describes "the meat of the presumed quality of grain grain (and a false skin made from tree); a shock made of roots and a shocked skin skin skin; shoes shocked by tree."
He noted that there was “837 registered meat replacements for the production of cowboys, 511 registered coffee replacements”.
Some stories have the honor and courage.
One Americanman notes in itself the debt to cruelness and says about the war: "You feel that, at the end of the end, it is what men were created, not to sit in good crystals with smoke and whiskeys, newspapers or freezeler, and to say that it is civilization, and under your shocked snake, is not hiding barbar. "
The British soldier, on the contrary, notes that he may have died, and no one will not notice or wake up.
"When a person mourns with the thinking of self-offering, he would like to think that would happen before the public," he writes.
But it's a horrible thing, it's like a person who's secretly condemned.
Other comments relate to the old Europe, which is disrupted and about new kinds of fear.
"The Confliction has become more economicly devastating", writes Mr. Englendo, "the war plants".
He recalls the coming of the one who calls "a new kind of immortality in the beginning of the century: a beautiful and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a well-known shock that spends on the snake, sit in the written table."
People act unexpectedly: low effects as much as heroism.
Mr. Englendo told soldiers that were always trying to subsequently subsequently undergoing the prostitution of Veneric disease to avoid services on the front.
"There is a very explanatory expression in the trade of gorgeous angos, which soldiers have buried and dismissed in themselves by genetics in hope to go into the hospital," he wrote.
"There were the deceased ones cut him into the eyes that often brought to a lifestyle."
Translated from Swedish Peter Graves by Mr. Englendo is dead but sweetly adapted to his gumnist task.
In the tens of small scenes, he shows how the war "freeth completely uncontrolled forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People start to ask why their leaders put them to fight.
The best books on the I World War were often indirect, such as "The Great War and the Modern Memory" Paul Fassel or Romans, such as "The Western Front without change" Erich-Mari Remark, not historical works.
The book Mr. Englendo enters this unfortunate pantheon.
His book has the most exciting finish that I can remember in an incredible literature.
I'm not gonna tell him.
But that's like he got out of the book to the page of a person's list, cut it out of your hand and the shooting.
After the previous error, the raid is carefully raised
hundreds of police officers were employed in the operation, some in protected shoes.
The night hour from Monday on Monday was chosen because in Zuokothy Park there should have been less people at that time.
Operation was held in secret from all, except a few high-employed officers, and the other first said they were going to learn.
The police committee Raymond W. Kelly was in the centre of events, and his presence stressed the importance of the operation of the Department of Police.
It could not be said that such episodes were repeated last week, such as the use of the switch gas against the protesters, contrary to the department and calling uragan the sympathy publication to the occupants.
Thus, two weeks after planning and training, the police operation was started to be released from protesting Zekoti Park.
The authorities were ready to observe how the occupation was discovered in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis teachings were carried out on the Randall Island with the calculation of Zuokothi.
The authorities have increased the number of trains called in cases of terrorism, which provide rapid movement of the police, as indicated in the below Manhattan.
The latest train was on Monday at the East River side of Manhattan.
The command to enter the park came in the last minute, and told the source known with the commands that the order was mentioned only as a "truck".
"There are some of the cops I know and called on this case, they didn't say they've sent to Zuokothy Park," said the man who talked about an anonymity conditions.
The only ones who knew they're going to Zuokothy Park were at the highest posts in the Department.
One of the reasons for secretity was a lesson that led the city.
On October 14, the authorities wanted to clean the park, but they went away from hundreds of protesters who cryed inside before the designated time, listening to these plans.
In Friday, the officers of various police offices, including the police teams, were used to control criminal districts.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost as to work, came out of the park during the day, which makes an approximative time for the invasion.
"It was good to do that when there was less people in the park," he said.
Saving machines with drivers and voice speakers, gathered at Pyck-Slip and Franklin Roosevelt-Draw, around the Manhattan Mosque, before they turned forward.
The director and previously registered statements from the speakers seemed to have threatened many protesters.
When the park entered the administrative units in their blue winds, many protesters simply collected their things and left.
The police reported that the palms did not throw up until 1:45 night, giving the protesting time to collect things.
Other police groups, as witnesses, had been gathered at perimeter to enter the park if they needed arrests.
The journalists in the park were put to leave.
Paul J. Brown, representative of the head of the police Department, said that this was done for their security.
But many journalists claim that they did not see how the police acts and that the police were struck with them.
Mr. Brown said the TV machines on the Cherch Street, around the west of the park, could take a picture.
When the police passed over the west through the slaughter of personal protesters, including skins, plastic boxes and polyethics, full clothes, the sanitary Department teams slaughtered after it, collecting what was broken.
Some protesters who refused to get out of the outside, the photos of the internet quickly appeared.
The main group of Protestants took positions next to the kitchen camp, in the park centre.
Some have built barrifugs, and the police entered into, methodically arresting them.
About 10 people in the episode of the camp were shocked together.
And two men got to go to the trees, said Mr. Kelly.
To cut the signs, the rescue officers were called.
There were no arrests in the park until 3:30 in the morning, Mr. Kelly said.
Clearing operation was completed about 75 minutes, reported the police.
Mr. Brown said that some 142 persons were arrested in the park.
Most were arrested for "infringement of public order and opposition in detention," he said.
The highest officer was Joseph J. Esposito, head of the Department and senior officer at the Department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the department, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, although she was present, "not directed the operation", said Mr. Brown.
The Second Police Group was waiting for the east of Broodwey, between Liberty Street and Sidar Street, if necessary, to enter into.
The loans were placed on the Cortland Street, north of the park, and on the Pyne Street, on the quarter to the south.
The observers saw that the police had extended the perimeter from these positions even further beyond the Zoothy Park border.
At one time, observers saw how a group of policemen, many with shields, continued to shoot people.
About 28 people were northern perimeters.
Some of the most serious events of the night have occurred to the south of the park.
About 5 a.m., one of the protesters shocked the shock of the police car, and others, according to the witnesses, pulled air from the police shore.
At some time, the shooter flyed a shooter of fans.
As a result, one policeman and one of the protesters were hosted.
Workers of the Services of Schools in the Court of Freedom
Professional, representing hundreds of school staff personnel lost places in the last month, plans to provide a city court in the middle, claiming that freeship was not necessary and discriminated because of non-proportional impact on schools where poor students were taught.
Judicial election is probably the last means available by the Environment Council 37 to try to defeat the exemption.
Sixty-seventy-two school assistants, parent work coordinator and other officials, who were among the lowest employees in the city, lost their place on 7 October, as the professional leaders called political response to their refusal to give the city access to medical funds managed by the working groups to closure the burden in the last spring budget.
The citizens were classically rejected by the accused.
During the hearing of the People's Council last month, the University of Denise M. Walcott said that the exemption was part of the budget which they signed in June.
One of the members of the Board said that there was no indication in the budget that the supporting staff of the school would be released.
Representatives of the 37 environmental Council reported that they had requested the notification of claims, providing the Department of Education against it; the press conference will be held in the midst to announce the formal expenditure in the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
As respondents, Mr. Walcott and the Department of City Education will be indicated and are listed on eight temporary employees as a routine, all of them are black or Latin American women, as well as most of the assistants who lost their place.
Elizabeth Thomas, representative of the city's legal department, said that the city had not seen a search and could therefore not comment on its specific provisions.
In accordance with the provisional version of New York Times ' s complaints, the professor focused on a number of volunteers in the poorest towns to support the claim on injust treatment, claiming that the poor schools had lost more assistant because they were chronically unfinancing.
He pointed out that there was no volunteer at Staten Island, and there was little in the high schools of East Side or Tribeki, 17 support workers have lost places in 23 in Brooklyn, Brooklyn, and 46 had to go to the districts 8 and 9 of South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five of the eight school assistants working at Harlem average in 36, where 68 per cent of the students live in poverty, it says: "These are not areas of state parents who can find money to fill the budget losses."
P.S. 36. Budget was decreased to 3.26 per cent in this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way to report additional funding for each poor student in school.
The Professional also claims that the director of the school could be introduced in a false language of notification authorised to free work coordinators with parents.
The notification was used by the word “prerogation”, although it is often said when the teacher from the school payment state moves to the list of existing employees who pays the central office.
" Sixty-sixth work coordinators were allowed with parents," says the black shock, "and not just translated."
Mission End, the Congress is ready to agree on Libya
It seems that the Republicans and Democratics at the Capitol golf are finally ready to agree on some of the resurrection in Libya.
Everything that was needed is to get the shooting, the long dictator Muamar Kadafi was taken into the slaughter and killed, and the American intervention has been completed.
On Friday, the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs should consider the resolution issued by President John Kerry (democratics, Massachusetts) together with Senators John Mckein (Republic, Arcedon) and Joseph I. Liberman (independent Connectoic), who complied the liquids for the lucky resurrection and the American Army for “respect”.
" The purpose of this resolution is to give respect to the courageous people of Libya when they begin to restore their country," said Cury.
"This is the confirmation of supporting their democratic constraints from both parties."
The language can be shown unfair, but there was no other discussion on Libya.
In that year, both parties lawyers were held together with the White House on the formulation of a series of resolutions which endorsed or condemned the role of the American army in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Corri and McKeyne were submitted a resolution that allows limited use of American armed forces in Libya.
The draft legislation was rejected by the representatives of the Palestinian, most of the votes of both parties, and did not vote in Senate.
However, on the same day when the draft legislation passed in the Palestine, the hall also did not support the proposal that would increase the financing of the American Operation in Libya.
This was left by the American mission in some kind of legislative cleaning - when the Congress is sufficiently discovered to criticize the Ambassador's approach to the mission, but not so smooth to really elect the e-mail from her feet.
Then the events of the Congress were defended by the insolvency
In August, Tripoli was lost the liquid forces, and Kadafi was killed on October 20.
The UNO Mission has been officially completed on 31 October.
The Senate may now be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs "promotes the people of Libya for its unreasonable schedule and unreasonable duty to pursue freedom" and appreciation for men and women of the United States and their coalition partners who participated in the military operation for the protection of the Level people for their unreasonable courage and professionalism".
The resolution also “affirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and unreasonable transition to democracy in Libye”.
Should new measures be fully supported by the Foreign Affairs Board or develop lawyers, as the June Legislative Project?
The last version of Senator Richard G. Luger, the leader of the Republicns in the Committee.
The representative of Luger said on Monday he did not see the last version of the draft legislation.
On the other side of the Chamber of the Palestinian Representatives, this week, the Constitutional Amendment requires a balanced budget, the main legislative priority for almost each Republic and for some democratics in the Congress.
This measure proposed by the Party of the representatives of Bob Gudlat (republic, Virginia) will be the first Constitutional Amendment on Budget or any other who will be issued at the plenary vote of the Congress.
Other legislators have not been able to amend their amendments to the plenary meeting, but not because they did not try.
The amendment of Gudlat is only one of 68 constitutional amendments affecting the wide circle of issues that have been introduced in the conviction.
Some publicized, one of the same legislation projects included representatives in the Palestine and the Senate, and others were not significant.
At least 15 versions of the amendments on balanced budget are amended only in the Palestine and some other “Federal Control”.
Some of them are also identical, but they give their own authors, in the main part of the electioned Republicans, who want to steal their resonance, the possibility of "affirming" such a proposal.
The Act on the Control of the Budget, which was conducted in August, requested that the Party of Representatives and the Senate voted for the amendment to the balanced budget.
In March 58, Senators proclaimed the unnecessary resolution supporting the idea of this amendment.
In addition to the budget, some conventions want to limit the duration of the authority of the Congress members, and the members of the Chamber of José Serrano (Democratic Democratics, New York) want to derogate the duration of the duration of the mandate for the Chairman.
The Congress of Jessie L. Jackson Lawrence (Democratic, Illinois) proposed a number of amendments to ensure, including, the right to quality education and health.
Amendments prohibiting single marriages have been proposed for many years, as well as one that prohibits the fleet.
Some legislators also want to authorize the cancellation of federal laws if they reflect two third States.
As the members of the Congress have not been trying to propose amendments, they are not faster than in the past years.
At the 111th conviction of the Congress, legislators proposed 77 such amendments, and 66 were introduced at 110th.
This time is compared to the beginning of the 1990s when members of the Congress, according to the Senate Library, regularly proposed more than 150 amendments each two years.
But their success wasn't more than now.
The last amendment adopted, 27th, was approved in 1992, but in fact it was introduced to the Congress in 1789.
"Thought but not convinced," says Gifffords in his first television interview after the pursuit
10 months after the armed person shooted in it in a public event in Tusson, a member of the Palestinian representatives of Gabriel Hyffords (Democratic Party, Arizona) appeared in the federal channel on Wednesday, slaughtered from the Broodway show, and said that he would like to restore more than returning to the Congress.
In the 20/20 programme, Ay-bi-s-News and Diana Soyer, Giffords made proposals and needed assistance for the step.
The program showed its hard way of rebuilding after the trauma struck a ball that developed the heads and tried the left side of the brain, walking from the front to the back of the head.
Three months later, she returned unexpectedly to the Palestinian representatives and triumphatedly proclaimed by the legislation on the marginal debt.
In his first television interview after the shoot of January, in which six and 13 people were killed, Giffords smiled, smiled and smiled, and called her "that's difficult."
The question of Saeer, how she feels, the 41-year-old Gifffords answered, "That's good."
A 20/20 interview with Gifffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was a part of the temporary special editor of the 20/20, which was shown by the new Gabe's marriage book: the history of courage and hope.
The Special Office reported the restoration of Gibfords after the shoot of 8 January.
On a video cut Kelly in the first few weeks, she stands on a hospital kitchen with a brain of head and a long shoe on the labo.
She can just take up one or two fingers on a husband's request.
A few months later, we see Gifffords sit in the box, and the physiologists taught her how to do simple action.
Shut up your head.
Get out of the legs.
And then her first word, "What."
A few days later, Gifffords made a second word, the "this", requested to change the bedroom menu.
A video shown by Abby-ss shows that music has played a central role in Hyffords rebuilding: we're seeing the Congressman's asking with the Dr. "Dawski just want to enjoy" Sindy Lopper and "Free Cafe" Tom Petty.
Soyer Gifffords, who spent two hours per day on the procedure, said that he would not remember the day of the pursuit.
Her husband told him that he had read a article in the shooting newspaper on 12 March when she stopped him to ask for the first time of the six murdered ones.
The suspected Jerry Le Lafner is in the prison of the Missouri and has been treated in the expectation of the court.
"My people died," said Giffards Soyer.
"That's hard, hard."
One day during her recovery, he said, "I'm convinced."
"And I said, Gabe, you're not convinced," said Kelly.
You're just killing.
And you're going through this, you're gonna get up and return stronger than ever.
The war feels more compassion than respect
The event was a Wall Street feast, which has collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sleeped a ballet about inability, disappointment and loss.
On the signal, hundreds of soldiers, marine soldiers, flights, and marine pesticides were built around him.
The audition in the shockings applauded him.
"But the military servants looked like heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the spring collection of money.
The Senior Military Officer, whose officer also was the Chairman of the Headquarters Committee, Amedral Michael Mallen, saw the role of another army.
"They were treated as cyrhotos," wrote the officer in an e-mail letter.
I'm sure the organizers wanted to be better.
I know that.
But in fact it wasn't respect, it was mercy.
Completely opposite impressions illustrate the unfair relationships between the army and often equivalent, sometimes engraved by the American publisher.
The wars raised the pride for their victims.
But the honors have their own prices, and they say the military.
The public is increasingly conducted, as is the form of compassion to people.
"We are not the victims," said the brigade General Shawn B. McFarland, who commanded armies in Iraq and soon goes to Afghanistan.
"But it seems the only way for some to show support is to do with us as with happiness."
This is an sensitive topic for soldiers who do not want to appear ungrateful or uncomfortable to the society they serve.
They also understood that angers with the returning forces in Vietnam in recent years were much worse.
As a result, the majority of the discussions on pestilence is quiet and only among the veterans.
After the two of his sons returned from the fighting action in the coast of the sea, Colonel Mark Kanshan warned them that people would not be viewed by the army from two points of view.
Some will look at them with sweetness, because they smile the murderers and were in ecologist places.
Others will think whether "the wicked veteran's wicked veterinary," said Canshan, who shooting in Iraq and returning towards a high government post in Washington.
While he was looking for work, he said, he felt that some interviewers were carefully asked whether he could press the responsibility of the work in Washington immediately after the battle.
Canshan recalls how he said to his sons, "When you're talking about your service, you should be counting on the negative effect."
The infringement experienced by militarys is partly from the American unfairness to wars.
Battle gains are rarely encouraging from the country that is little known with the army and seeing little direct benefits from war in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, are no longer valuable for military heroism as it was normally in the II World War", says the General League David Barnou, who commanded the American troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the enhancement of policies and publics is mainly focused on the deeply suffering of military servants.
The soldiers are estimated by the number of flows that they have done, by the number of their losses or by the loss.
Army faces the pression of the stakeholders against violence
This week, at historical judicial hearings, should be decided whether 28 men and women would be taken against the army for the non-proliferation of violence.
If not, hundreds of pieces will be rebuilt in the next way.
At the first class of Elizabeth Layman, 25 years of age and 11 weeks of pregnancies, on her approval, his servant was forced by the night.
It was in October 2008, she returned to her card to the Miramar Aerodrome, north of San Diego after dinner with a friend and met a man who was packed with a 12-bottle of bird.
He asked if he could go to her in the room.
"This was a red fleet," says Layman.
But Tehas's birth has been threatening.
I thought, no, he was 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I'm glad I didn't listen to my instinct."
After a few minutes after they came to the Layman room, the man came to her back, fled and forced, she claims.
In this week, 18 November, Layman and 27 military servants will wait for the decision of the court to take historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia and whether they will go to the trial which they have issued against the former Minister of Defence Robert Gates and his former Donald Ramfeld.
It is said that Gates and Ramsfeld had not been able to deal with a widely distributed violence in the army in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
In February, a lawyer Susan Berk from Washington, D.C., originally included 17 lawyers, but increased up to 28 months next, 25 women and three men, who all claimed that they had suffered violence or threatened sexual violence from the employees and that the army had not been investigated, not injured or insured the appropriate justice after the attacks confronted.
Berke says she was shocked on the top of the army because the problem starts with them.
"Armia is a vertical structure," she says.
Who are those who can destroy the culture of violence?
Berke also said that in February about 400 other victims were linked with her, many of which could participate in future trials.
She's strategy: instead of gathering all the eggs in this matter -- to class the eggs into one corner, so it will open a lot of things if it's necessary to support pressure.
The Department of Defence team under the Governing Federal Prosecutor Nila McBraid took steps to stop the case.
The judiciary documents received by Newsweek have discovered a protection strategy, in the main sense of that former or current soldiers cannot claim the complaints of the army for harm in armed forces.
According to the doctrine in the decision of the Supreme Court of 1950, the Federal Government is not responsible for the damage caused by those in the military service.
" Promotional damage relates to the risk of the military service of distortion," says the documents.
The Ministry of Defence refused to comment this story.
The situation has changed since the 50s.
Although women are still officially prohibited to participate in the fight, this section is only in words: the modern wars have a clear front line.
And in Iraq, and in Afghanistan, women ' s teams play a more important role, especially in contacting local women in the fight zone.
Result: 150 soldiers died during two wars, two thirds in their battle.
The Army is also time to become modern, says Berke.
It is not alone in its fight; in addition to its search, three others are prepared.
The Veteranian legal seminar at the Ellen Legislative School is preparing a case against four large military academias for the promotion of the maternity atmosphere.
A separate non-commercial association of the American war veterans in Vietnam is preparing a search against the army, in the centre of which the " personality change" diagnoses are victims of violence to remove them from the services, generally, in the words of activists such as Ana Bhaghiti from the Human Rights Group of the Organization of Women and Voluntary Action.
In December, her group made the search against the Veterinary Affairs Office, condemned him in discriminatory practices to consider pensions from persons who claim that sexual violence was threatened during the service.
Eight individual legislation projects proposing a number of measures were introduced in the Congress of Senators and members of the Party of both parties.
In 2010, on the data of the Service for Warning and Combating Sexual Violence, 3.158 trials were reported.
However, as it is known, the attacks are often not reported, and Pentagon's own estimates are about 13.5 per cent of the cases that had occurred in that year.
The report published in March also investigated the percentage of court cases: in 2010 20 per cent of the known cases have been reached to the court - two times less than in the civil justice system.
Burk's people call their attack only the first in a number of other rabbits.
In the case of Layman, she declared the violence in the military police less than a hour later.
On that night, she said she was asked to tell the details of violence at one 11 times of the police, doctors and commanders.
She gathered a set of evidence of violence, and the blood of the attacker was found at her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Layman settled before the judges to listen, in which she asked whether she had sex with her friend before the day of attack.
Six persons had a positive character of the accused who was finally justified.
"I remember the day when the verdict was read", says Layman.
"I thought I'm growing now, I'm out of the court hall with a crick."
"I was in the psychiatrist office, and when I came out, I remember my commander said, "This wasn't a judge on him.
Layman was ordered to turn to a military psychiatrist who finally diagnosed the change of personality that had made it unacceptable to the service.
In January 2010, she was authorized with an unpleasant formula that did not allow her to obtain any benefits.
Whether the case was forwarded by Layman and her friends at the search is a complex question, says John Terry, Professor of the Rights at the University of George Washington.
But he notes: "I think they can go forward."
Among them and the credibility is the doctrine that is criticized since it appeared.
I criticized Doctrine Ferris.
The army has been distant for decades because it has no stimulation and funds that are responsible.
He adds: "The Championships are greatly against them... but they are important to try."
These things will change only when people in order want to fight.
If the listening will not be useful, Berk, the lawyer, will collect hundreds of other cases for future affairs.
"We will continue to fight with the army on this issue until the reform is not reformed," she says.
Or until we die, depending on what will happen before.
The wall has the eyes: how researchers are studying you at Facebook.
Before being a new person of the right extremism in Europe, Anders Bering Breewick was a general man who expressed their anti-immigration views on the Internet.
On Monday, Breweyk, who was aware of the mass murder in Norwegia in July, who lived 77 persons, appeared at its first open judicial hearing.
Although Bravik could act alone, he was not a single network: he has been ready to attack his computer by communicating with millions of nationalists who support the legal groups in social networks.
After the summer tragedy, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how do they find?
Let's just go to the Facebuck.
"We have understood that it is not very difficult to look at them," says Jaime Barlett, who has recently published a report on the European Cyber-Polysis of the British DemoS research center.
The stock of personal data on Facebook is so large, Barlett says that researchers could easily use the advertising website to identify the necessary demographic group with scientific precise accuracy -- that marketologists and work for a few years.
The Bartlett team found a half billion fans of the legal groups throughout Europe and then slowed them to the advertising, but instead of showing a new group or diethic product, the advertising invited the user to investigate the issues of their educational levels relating to violence and optimism in respect of their own future.
With Facebook Barlett and his colleagues, more than 10,000 members were able to ask 14 extremely legal partys in 11 European countries, not even out of office.
"This is completely a new way to conduct research," Barlett says.
Some results are not so discreet: the online and multilateral of the legal groups are mostly all young men of the man's gender, unnecessary immigration.
But unexpectedly, "They who join their online-activeness with the offline-activeness are more discreet, more democratic and less aggressive than those who are hidden by the monitor."
DemoS work is only one example of Facebook becomes a new popular instrument in the hands of scientists.
Scientific centres, researchers and politicians are using websites to study all the light from health issues to social trains expressed in Leaks, wall posts and updates.
More than 800 million active users who add to a medium-third-third record, the Super-Actual Information Facebuck has a research boom, increased the number of scientific articles in the title of the website by 800 per cent for the past five years.
For some researchers, Facebuck has the opportunity to study people who could not go on the street with a blocknote.
"If you wanted to ask people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them."
"We should enter the party, and they would never have taken you", says Barlett.
"Facebuck excludes all this, you're going to call them directly."
Others say that the website could be identified and investigated on social health.
The latest study by Dr. Megan Mornon from the University of Viscina, Madison, and her colleague showed that students who discussed their drinking submissions on Facebook were significantly undermined to alcoholism than students who prayed for this matter.
Morno pretends that students, for example, would be able to monitor the website and to help students who are too often updating the drinking status.
"You can't solve the problem, don't detect it," reported Washington Post Dimitri Christkis, co-actor Morno and Director of the Centre for Children's Health, Conduction and Development at the Child Scientific Institute of Seattle.
"We found a way to identify children from the risk group that wouldn't be found."
Facebuck also constantly extracts a different type of data on its users.
The website data processing group has processed the statistics of the status and the Day of Saint Valentine, the elections in the middle of 2010, as well as the National Index of Happiness (in the main use of information that they have only available, the Cyber liberty Championers had long been able to make their broad collection of data available for research).
But Facebook users know that the website looks for them, they like it or not, in the way to play Scrabbl with a friend that is thousands of miles from you, the website can handle your personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of the research that they don't even know?
While researchers have extremely specific rules for the investigation, online data are available.
"I don't think that many users would have thought that the researcher can observe their profiles," says Neil Selvin, a socialist from the London Lab of knowledge, about the study he carried out in 2006 with the use of the general available student pages in Facebook.
"When they represented themselves, it was just between them and their friends."
There is a question of methodology.
There is no guarantee even that the research objects are extremely honest.
On Facebook, it is unable to know what number of information on the profile and page of the user is true.
"What you say on Facebook, and what you're doing beyond the Facebook borders is two absolutely different things," says Selvin.
This is why, despite the years of its technological research work, Selvin believes that blocks and hands are still the best research tools that can be used.
"There is nothing to replace the outcome in a real peace and relationship with real people," he says.
"Social research is about social, and the majority of the social is still offline."
Anders Bering Breewick is first publicly present before the court.
Anders Bering Breweek, a person who acknowledged the organization of a double attack, who lived 77 people in Norwegia this year, describes himself as a fighter of "resistance" during the first public statement in Oslo.
"I am the military commander of the Norwegian rebellion and the Ryzari Tampuri of the Norwegians," he issued before 500 attendants in the court hall.
"I reflect the court because you have received your mandate from organizations who support hate ideology and because it supports musculturalism."
"I recognize acts, but I don't recognize guilty."
Judge Thorkyel Neshaym stopped Bravik during this monologist, because he "assumed not to give Brevik the opportunity to use this listening as an area for expressing his own views."
For the same reason, he refused to authorize Brevik, who brought the previously written talk, to call the parents of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Neshayam also commanded the police to keep Brevik in custody for more than 12 weeks, prohibited access to media for four weeks, and said that the authorities would take control of all visits and records for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and families of the victims visited the hearing.
Some came to hope to look at Bravey in the eyes, others make sure he's under the shoot.
Everyone came to find answers to their questions.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," said the Norwegian NRK channel.
"It was uncomfortable, but personally became me a little more easy after I saw and heard a suspect."
In the dark coast and blue blue, Bravik maintained peace and professionalism during the whole hearing, and looked at the journalists and survivors when he entered and out of the building.
Despite the strange idea of Bravik that he was part of the great " resistance" movement, the judge decided that he was not worse, and said that there was no evidence that he acted with the messagers.
Some may be concerned that the attacks are said to be one extremist, not the radio-actor work of 22 July.
But this does not decrease automatically the tribulation and disappointment that the whole country now feels.
"I would like he looked like a monster, but it's not true," said the family of one victim.
"It would be much more simple if it would be that."
7 lessons from the lost interview Steve Joses, shown in the theatre this week
After the death of Steve Joses, on October 5, some compared him with Henry Ford, describing the technical guest as the Great Researcher of the Modernity.
But what the Apple fans can read the most important opening of the recently recovered interview, which was reminded of the prevention of the main market indicators on this week, is how much this creative mind had been understood in business processes and production technologies.
He, of course, was a designer, a dream and considered himself a skip, but he was also a pretty organizer and a modernist of a production process, who believed that many business leaders had suffered from "ills thinking that the idea really is 90 per cent of the work... the great idea of the product is a large number of artistic works".
Returned in 1995, Bob Cringley created the Triumph nerve television on the appearance of a personal computer, and he spent more hours with Jobbs for a unique long interview.
At that time, about 10 years since Joses had gone out of Apple, he had already been working in his new NeXT computer company in waiting for the Internet's mass release.
While a small part of the Cringley interview was used in the Norways, he said that the original interviews were lost in the carriage.
Only after Jobs died, the complete VHS copy was found in the repository garage.
The 68-minute movie of Steve Jobbs was the basis for the 68-minute film: a lost interview in Landmark Theaters in this and Friday.
For a person who has known his hate to a detailed interview, Jacques seems to be inadequate to express its technological philosophy and business strategy.
And it's unbelievable.
In four different moments, the interview has great intervals between questions and answers - a meditation in 10-15 seconds, where Jobbs clearly expresses its thoughts to say exactly.
There are also moments in which the perfectionism of Jobbs is on the surface where it seems to be discreet about Cringley, which makes it rapidly move to matters or signs of greater importance.
Without the eye of Pixar, eggs and Iphones of the Postian interview, there is a bad prophecy when Jobbs evaluate what it sees, different companies do true and injustly, and offers their own vision of future information technologies.
One thing to read about the death assessments of Jobbs' work, but there's something premature and inspiring in Jobbs, which we see here, a worried smile on the hole of the greatness.
He has a vision of what things might and should be.
Soon after he said everything here, he went and did it.
Small conclusion of seven significant conclusions of the Persistent Interview:
The way he learned to lead to business:
"Why are you doing this?" and the answers that you are instinctly receive, "Oh, it's just doing so."
Nobody knows why they do what they do, no one thinks very deeply about business.
That's what I learned.
Jobbs continues to describe its attempts to racionalize Apple reporting.
The cost recording, often starting with the "state expenditure " which was taken from the roof and then complemented by the " facture ", made a automaticized structure that ensured that they would be able to follow the expenditure of the business.
About the shock about the Pope:
Jobbs' details about the box's skin that he met with Steve Wonnick, the device that allows people to get the phone company effectively and call freely on large distances.
A lot of the devices had been written before, but the ephorium of Joses is here in describing the son of a box as an act of authority.
He tells how he and Vasik tested the box using the automatic phone, ordering a conversation and then connecting one AT and T to another until they were able to connect more stations.
"We've got the earth's chair half a day, and you've cryed in the mobile phone, and that's passing a minute later in the nearby phone phone," said Joss with a sweet.
"We were young, and everything we've been able to imagine something that could be controlled by billions of infrastructure in the world."
We two knew a little, but we could imagine a little thing that could control the big thing -- it was an incredibly lesson, and I don't think that without this, it could ever happen Apple.
Jobbs continues to describe a famous journey with him and Vatican, calling in Vatican through the blue box and asked Daddy's phone, and all the forces were trying to copy Henry Quissenger.
When several members of the Catholic Jerrychy were called in the night to speak with the American diplomat, these two were smiling directly before the Pope himself was taken to answer the phone.
About Technology Love (and cold launched by Bill Hulett):
When he was 12 years old, looking for safe details for the collection of frequencies, Bill Hulett found a phone accountant and calling him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone conversation, Jobbs received a summer record in Hulett-Pacard.
"It was a strong impact on me, it was the only company I saw in that age, and she formed my view that such a company and how well they were related to their staff."
Jobbs was later one of the HP staff visiting research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first first permanent computer."
He was the size of the chaod, he had a small monitor with an e-commerce tube, and I loved him.
I often moved to HP adolescent and moved around that car and wrote for it.
On an innovated innovation:
In several places, Jobbs says about the discovery of new winter products.
At his carriage, when he went to sell a monastery payment, one buyer asked him to collect a whole computer.
Only 30 days of credit, he was supposed to think and assemble, and providing ready devices.
The Apple later recalls the difficulties he faced by developing a computer mouse:
"I remember the weird conflicts... they cryed to me that it would take five years of the mouse, that's going to be $300, and I was slept on the ball, and I went out and found a designer."
Twenty-twenty days later we had a mouse that we could collect for $15, which was incredibly reliable.
The large companies who lose energy:
During Apple's resurrection, Josbs predicted exactly how many leaders were wrong in the vision of the situation and lost control over their market share.
"Don't you work in IBM or Xerox, so you're doing the best copy or printer, and what?"
You have a monopolie on the market, so the company does not make it successful.
Sellers and marketing make it more successful, so [these types of people] who are finally leading to corporations, and people who make products are experiencing from the levels of decision-making.
The genius of the product that has brought to this monopolist position is exacerbated by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products, the required masterity.
That's what happened with Xerox...
Xerox could take all the information technology industry.
He could have been 10 times more, maybe a microsof of 90.
They were shocked from the victory.
Innovation as art form:
"The great idea of a great product is separated by a great number of artistic works... when you cut a great idea, it changes and grows."
You know a lot of her tongues.
There are compromises that you need to go - some things you can't make electronics, steel, jobs or firms.
You have to keep your head 5,000 ideas -- these concepts -- connecting them all together...
Finally, it's going to be shock - it's trying to express himself better than ever made people, and then try to bring it to what you're doing.
Picasso said the good artists are copying, the big artists are angry.
We've always been horrible to struggle great ideas.
The part of the famous Mcintosh was that people who worked over it were musicians, poeters, artists, zoologists, and historians that have become the best information technologies worldwide.
If not information technologies, they would do trigger things in other areas.
Scala and Thomas eat with the opposers of the Health Act until the court considers the case
On the day when the Supreme Court was gathered for close doors to discuss a political controversial question, whether he would listen to the Division of the Act on Health of President Obama, two of his judges, Antonio Skalya and Clarens Thomas, who had been on the dinner of a legal company that would interfere the case before the Supreme Court.
This case occurred in the past Friday when all nine judges met to discuss the requests for consideration.
One of the agenda items was a request for 26 States to oppose a degree of health review adopted by the Congress last year, which combined conservative activists of the whole country.
The judges agreed to consider the process; indeed, the reverse debates at 5 1/2 hours are expected to be in March 2012, and the end would be in the presidential chain, which will be indefinitely disappeared until the court decision was agreed.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and claim that the health law should be cancelled, perhaps Paul Clement, who was a Vice-General Prosecutor during the President of George W. Bush.
The legal company of the Clement, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two duties of the company, which helped to discuss the annual commodity of the Federalist Society for a long time, a continuing conservative legal principle.
Another company, who has spent dinner, is one of the commercial associations that opposed the law, the National Independence Federation.
Another sponsor was Pflizer Inc pharmaceutical guiant, who had a great financial interest in gravity.
The dinner was held in the Washington Hotel a few hours after the judiciary meeting.
Among the other, Mrs McConnel, the leader of the Republic of Senate and the known opposer of the Health Act.
The guests at lunch?
Nothing new: Two judges have been visiting the Federal Society for many years.
This is not the contrary to the ethical standards.
In fact, the judges are free from the Code of Conduction which regulates the actions of the lower federal courts.
If they were subjected, they may be under the Principle 4C Code, which says: "The Sweden may visit the legal and other organizations, although the judge cannot be a rapporteur, a guest or to mention in the programme of such events."
However, the clear closeness of Scales and Thomas to two legal companies in this case, as well as the company with great financial interests, was sufficient to activists of ethics in the Government.
" This is a deteriorating violation of the ethics and unrelatedness to the code against the statements of some judges that the court remains faithful to the same rules applying to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the General Deal.
"Thes were drunk and dinner in an official action on the collection of money with lawyers whose cases are now considered in the court."
Their exhibition and assistance in the collection of money for this event is unacceptable and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have not been focused on critics that say that they are very willing to prevent the cases of the courts with the figurous groups of the Federal Society.
And the wife of Thomas, Jeannie, is known as Conservators.
Furthermore, the observers claim that this is an ethical issue against the judges of Elena Kagan, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the principal legal service in the Ombudsman administration when the first courts were sent to the courts of the first infringement.
Her criticism required that Kagan refused to listen to this case because it was too involved in the protection of the law in order to be impartial now.
Kagan hasn't shown that she would do this.
Boeing receives recursive 18 billion aircraft order
Emirates' companion claims 50 wide-food bands of Boeing 777 and may be remarked more than 20.
Boeing also sell six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, the amount of $1 billion.
This is just a news that the company receives a 50-unit of its product.
But this is an important event when the company is Boeing Co., and the presuming price for all these 50 flights is $18 billion.
However, it is so important where Boeing received the order: the Middle East, increased the golden lives in future aircraft orders.
In the prediction published on Monday, the Tajik company notes that the Middle East will need 2,520 flights to 450 billion aircraft in the nearest 20 years.
Boeing announced in these weeks its most biggest in the dollar to evacuate the commercial aircraft as 50 two passenger flights Boeing 777.
The incredible order was made from Emirates' aircraft in Dubai.
The aircraft also has the opportunity to purchase more than 20 flights that would be upset by 26 billion dollars, said Boeing in Abiashio Dubay 2011.
Later, on Monday, Oman Air reported 6 Boeing 787-8s, which were called Dreamliner, which could be significantly improved by the fuel economy and passengers.
The premium price for six flights is more than 1 billion dollars.
"It's really good for Boeing," said analysis Morningstar Nil Diaor.
"The quantity of these specific purchasers is very high."
Many of the south-East aircraft have oiled countries.
Consequently, they have no only money to pay for aircrafts, but also the growth of fuel prices that are usually damaged by aircrafts because they are one of their most largest articles, not so violent because the country pays money for high oil prices.
This is important, as they are less likely than other aircrafts, to abolish a flight order when prices grow, said Diora.
"They have natural protection," he said.
Emirates enhance the leadership of Boeing on the market of wide-floor aircraft and helps not allow a SAS Airbus composer to be dominated with his A350 aircraft.
Boeing's winner was four months later after Airbus claimed that it would be dealt with the largest A350, which counters the 777-300ER as a whole.
He put the debts to increase the burden charge after purchasers needed to increase the cost of the flight and further.
Boeing Co actions grown up to $67,94.
The sister of President of Mexico apparently had been playing for elections in Michoacan
Louise Maria Calderon claims that drug traffickers have helped the opponent Fausto Valeho from the IRP in a predicted gang.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon seemed to have not performed his request at the location of the Governor Michokan during the disaster of State elections, and she declared on the lunch that drug traffickers had helped recruiting the drought for one of its opposers.
On the preliminary results, the leader of the Western State's Gong is called Fausto Valeho from the Institution and Revolutionary Party, or IDP.
"Involvement of organized crime during the whole election process and especially last night causes anxiety, not only for Michoacan but also for all the country," said Louise Maria Calderon in radio interview on the next day after the Sunday.
"They were threatening our candidates, our employees at the election... they were slow to vote, hindered... and let people vote."
IDP managed Mexico for seven decades until he lost the Presidency in 2000.
She's ready to return, and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in this trial.
IDP hopes to win the presidential elections in July.
Valeho seems to be just a little defended by Calderon, who urged the ratings to the electoral day.
Calderon, a candidate from the National Action Party, or a NPT, envoyed by her brother, was refused to recognize the Victor Valeho.
Silvano Aureoles, a candidate from the left Democratic Democratic Party, or a DDP, now belonging to the Governant Cross, was the third, a serious conspiration for separate and unexpected left before the presidential elections 2012.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the preliminary results.
Valeho, former master of the state of Morel, rejected drug traffickers and urged other candidates to recognize the results.
In Michoacan, drugs specialized in marihuana, heroin and metalphetamines were long dominated.
This was the parent state of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacan to initiate a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
Violence still continues.
Mr. von PND was killed a week before the elections were attacked by Louis Maria Calderon, and some candidates were out of the local predicted box for fear.
For the IRP, however, the electorals in Michoacan would be terrible, but the victory will give the movement of the party.
The man who should represent the IRP in the presidential shock, Enrique Pine Nito, said from Washington, welcomed Valeho and said, "I think that this victory should be very encouraging in the warning of the next year."
ABR avoids Asia to help save the euro
The Asian Development Bank forced India and China to help Europe to save a long-term crisis to avoid a long-term decline that stops the growth of Asian economy.
Mr Nag, director of the AVR Office in Manila, said that two of the most rapidly developed economys should "deal all that can" to accelerate the rebuilding of the currency block by means of the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRIC countries had regarded the difficulties of Europe ' s " independence " and said that Asian financial assistance towards the European leadership and resources could help avoid a long-term fall in global economy.
"We all do this."
"Another who can help Europe to get out of the crisis is useful," he reported the Financial Times in the course of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some point, but it can't be unlawful."
"So if China and India can help, this must be done."
The European Monetary Union has been strongly undermined by a long-term European crisis in the past months.
In the past few days, Italia has grown more threatening, and the Prime Minister and the Greece have gone away.
The long-term crisis in Europe generated fears that it could bring a world economy again to recession, and brought the calls for leading developing economy to meet together to help the Euroon to find a decision.
Mr. Nag suggested that any Asian assistance would be carried out through the FMI, but said that bilateral cooperation was the type of purchase EU financial assistance fund, the means for financial stability in Europe - provides great strength in negotiations with the Asian partners of Europe.
Annand Sharma, Minister of Trade of India, said that "India will do everything that can" to help Euroon, since its own economy now suffers the reduction in export and the reduction of foreign capitals.
"Nobody wants to remain instable and instable," he said.
"We have major tasks, and we have to support a high level of growth."
"This is an unable option, it's a binding condition, because where we find work for decades of our youth and girls."
Others say that India ' s development of economics is not a meaning to help rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashitosh Varshni, Professor at the University of Brown at the United States, said that it would be very difficult to provide European assistance to the Indians of 1.2 billion people, from which about 800 million lives for $2 per day or less.
"In some moment, they know that Greeks go to pension for 50 years and travel to sea feasts, and that's not going to be good, " said he.
Li Howell, director of the World Economic Forum, also discussed why the India's reservations should be used in order to contain Greece ' s numerous and well-payed workers in the public sector to work in bad organized, lost enterprises, such as iron roads.
Mr. Nag said that the European crisis threatens the “important direct consequences” throughout Asia.
ABR ' s 7.5 per cent growth in Asia in 2011/12 has now faced "low risks" because of the threat of Europe.
He said that the vulnerable developing markets need to be “excellent plans” to protect themselves from falling and significant capital rates from their economy.
Pentagon ' s long-term warnings on potential defence expenditure reductions
The Minister of Defence of Leon Panett was a midday at the convention, causing that the expected automatic reduction of the budget would be slaughtered by national security and the financial reaction from the Pentagon Corinthians to the fight camps in Afghanistan and the Civil Assembly.
Pentagon has already been decreased by the reduction of $450 billion in the coming decade, but it is now afraid that additional reductions of 600 billion may be inevitable if the conventions cannot be reached to the expenditure agreement.
" The consequences of these reductions will be devastated to the Ministry, " reported Panett in writing to Senator John McKaine, Arizona, and the Republic of Lindsy Graham, Southern Caroline.
He said that the convention could not be able to adopt budget agreements and that, as a result, the so-called secretariat would initiate a comprehensive reduction of 23 per cent and the end of many new projects.
"There is a strong reduction that is so unexpectedly, the majority of our shipbuilding and construction projects -- you can't buy three four ships or buildings -- and cause serious damage to other attempts to modernize", wrote the Senator's Panel.
"We must also be able to let many of our state workers, and as the reduction will be made so quickly, we must almost be able to let the states to achieve the goals."
"These changes will make the trust of those who support our army and cause a serious damage to warfare."
Finally, the decrease of military parts will be covered, said Panet.
"The military financing in the U.S. emergency operations did not have a direct sectator, but the achievement of the war suffers seriously from a serious shock in the main budgets", stated the Paneta.
"Contract staff will be decreased that the delay of contracts and the supervisory treaty which supports the army will be decreased."
"State staff will be decreased that it will bring repayments to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be violated."
Two senators wrote the Paneta 10 days ago, requesting details of the possible automatic reductions in the Ministry of Defence.
" The secondary in the Ministry of Defence will become a rapid attack of the United States as a leading world military force."
"We are strongly opposed to these Dragonic actions," reported Senators in a joint statement on Monday night when they were born by the Panetat letter.
"It's not the way we can live, and it's not the way we have to spend ourselves."
"Seekest is the threat to the interests of national security in the United States, and this cannot happen."
Whether the Panette or the last warnings of Senators to the budget committee will be brought or increased the calls for the release of Pentagon from reducing, so we will see later.
The Paneta was absolutely honest about the possible reductions, although he had been working in Pentagon's leadership since many years of budget expertise in the Congress and Belarus house and understanding that it was a difficult choice.
At the Press Conference last week, the Minister of Defence was a unique picture of what could follow, a troop with a ball, but without nuclear.
"This is a ship without marine."
"It's a shooter without a ball."
"It's locked a plane without enough trained pilots."
" This is a paper tiger, a army with charms, buildings and bombs, without enough prepared soldiers to carry out the mission," said the Paneta in its entry observations in Pentagon.
"This is the power that suffers from an insufficient war spirit, badly prepared and unable to fight potential enemy."
"In fact, it promotes aggression."
In the Annex to its letters to McKeen and Greeham Panet, new details were made about the reducing " significant operational risks: reactions to crisis, conflict and disasters; serious limitations of our possibility to be first in the development and in the reaction of the world; and lead to unacceptable risks in future war operations. "
The Paneta said that some of the largest defence projects could be faced with obstacles, including those already tested, and only some at the early stages of planning.
This list includes the only F35 shocked destroyer planned for a new bomb ship, a new generation-based ship, a new coastal coastal ship and a new earthquake-based vehicle that Army and the Sea Peach needed to replace hammers.
The end of the further development and test F35 may be $80 billion for 10 years, but its parties say that it is a vital step to improve and combat the potential threats of China and other opposers.
How to get a lie
The last chapter shows how serious and widespread lies and lies are in daily life.
The Chairman of the Republicns of Herman Keen is embarrassing a number of women's sexual convictions; each party is a lie accused of another.
The University of Pennsylvania was pronounced by a false witness, since they were likely to hide that a football trainer had violated the boys.
Last week, President of France Nicola Sarkosi was captured when the President of the United States's microphone spoke Baraku Obama that the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Nayanjahu, was a false.
The lie destroys the carriages and strikes the country.
The New York Congress and Antony Wayner's Internet Exhibitionist Entony Wayner was ridicule, rejecting its exits, which had quickly been checked by unrelated evidence.
The former candidate to President John Edvards was accused of financial maquination during the campaigns related to the opening of external communications.
And again, no one who lives at that time will never forget a medical circle with President Bill Clinton, who has been lied on his sexual relations with Monique Levinski during his second time.
The history of frozening at school and college is a common case.
There were cases when the teachers gave the answer to the tests to have a good evaluation of their activities.
The employees who should teach the opposite are sent a message that the lie and the fairness of the acceptance.
What number of lies do we face?
In one day, as the research shows, you can lie from 10 to 200 times.
Now it is expected that the major part of this is a lie in salvation.
Another study showed that no-known persons were swearing three times in the first 10 minutes of knowledge with each other.
Detection of lies or lies is necessary for both individual and professional purposes.
Unlike the room game, like the sharads, where it is to be called " Slaughter", the detection of a serious knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at the prestigious universities that work over comprehensive research projects, especially on psychology and physics.
One study was that most old mixes of lies have been discovered.
The lies look in the eyes.
They're not always thinking, shocking, reding or cutting.
It should not be concluded that the liars are difficult to notify and deplete.
The experienced false dispenser can reach to truth by observing the structures of approval, technology, the structuring of questions and temporary characteristics.
I have conducted a few years by studying scientific openings in a wide and continuously growing segment of lies knowledge, and clearly that the detection of lies is a modern mind that is easy to learn and help in our complex world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include reforming, knowledge, negotiations or management.
Guest false persons are best able to read others, letting them feel innocent, manage their own emotions and feelings intuitively, as others understand them.
We know from the study that extravers are more angry than introverts that men lie more about themselves, while women are about others, generally to protect some feelings that marriage people are less angry to their partners than the unmarried (the lie they say most often).
We also know that if you're an engaging person, others will feel less guilty and lie to you.
How do you understand that someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your object.
This is called "determination of origin".
This helps us to ensure the shipment point for further evaluation of changes.
Watch your object’s calls, smile, and voice features.
You should be glad to know whether a person is constantly smelling in a normal state, then you will not pronounce injustices when you see a swimming leg in the midst of the meeting.
Then search for a group of false and incomparable acts.
Regard these groups as the red fleet, not the evidence of lie.
The interviewers can fix the top of their body when trying to remember their history, they can put their steps to the door, turn out, change their search in a specific way, or demonstrate "facility after the interview" - this slow air of facilitation and change of positions when all complex issues are behind.
The followers often fascinate the termination of the request to simply see the facilitation after the interview.
So look at your object's talk.
It was known that Scott Peterson had passed and used the past by saying that his murdered wife lived to find her around the country.
Admiral people can also use distances in the words: “I have no sexual relationship with this woman... Mrs. Levinski” or to repeat a complex issue completely.
The most typical virtue indicators are low.
Someone can use a qualification language when answers the complex question, "Good... Very well, I know how much I know."
This makes it more emotional than reality, and it is often a red flag.
There is no magical means to detect lies, but it is possible to have the ability to discover a lie.
These thoughts will increase the opportunity of each person to not be victims of art juices in professional and personal life.
The counter-building plan needs to be revised after the threat of the United States to delay it
A few days later, after the Ombudsman’s administration, threatened the approval of the planned petroleum from Canada to the Mexico Valley, he argued the angry of Professionals, but endorsed the environmental protectioners - the company to build oil, claims that it would be wished to revise the project to restore its work.
TransCanada reported on Monday that it would take the planned oil from the environmentally sensitive area of the Nebrask Hormons and convinced that the project would still be approved.
The company heard this decision at the press conference in the Nebraska State Capital.
The official representative of TransCanada Alex Purbas said that the company remains confident that it will finally receive oil approval, although other road routes.
This happens after the statement of the State Department last week that he will make a decision on the project at the federal level until he will not study the possible new road routes that do not affect the Nebrask Holm and the Ogal aquarium, a large subterranean water stock.
"This is a real step forward," said Fox News Congressmen Le Terry, the Republic of Nebraska.
The new environmental expert, as stated by the State Department, may be denied by decision-making until 2013, after elections in the next year, although the authorities refused that the policy was prohibited.
In the written statement last week, Obama called on the request of the State Department and expressed support.
The oil is 1.700 miles long from Canada to the Mexico Valley.
He must move 700,000 barriles a day from the province of Albert to the petroleum plants in Texas.
To do that, he needs to move six states.
He hate environmental protectioners, but love professionals that hope about 20,000 workplaces related to oil.
However, Nebrask lawyers, who speak against the plan, consider the draft legislation to accelerate the movement of the Sesha golf and the Ogal avior, the main source of drinking water and rhythmation.
The current study of the State Department on Environment showed that the project would only be limited to negative effects on the environment, but the source of the energy industry stated that the Department's audit had issued a specific examination procedure, focusing on two issues.
One is whether transCanada, Paul Eliott, was an adviser in the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2008, is a conflict of interests in the programme.
Another was whether the company's choice was taken to conduct an unreasonable initial study because it was linked to TransCanada.
To Patti Label, she was in court because she could call a child to be a shock of fear.
The family from New York claims that Patti Label’s discovery began to spend in their home lobby in Manhattan, fearing their young daughter to that point of fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" executioner was so strong that she had brought "change of personality, sleep disorders" and "the strong fear of unbelievers", says her family at the High Court of Manhattan.
This occurred on 10 November last year when the work scene of Kevin Monk, his wife, was a child garden, Rosanna, and Geneva was going to go to the family journey.
When Kevin Monk took the car, Roshan Monk went down to the building in the Riversayd Bowl Valley with their bag, Geneva.
Rosan Monk said she stopped around the door and left her daughter at half a minute.
Someone came behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter does?" I said "Yes" and I went to take her, she said.
Label was a heartfelt discovery of a pregnant woman.
"It was aggressively said, "You shouldn't have left your daughter outside the door," said Roshan Monk.
"I said to her, "I don't care what you're talking or thinking."
She came to be angry and began to use the rugment -- the word C and the word "F" -- on the higher tons ...
She had a bottle of water, and she began to shoot water from the bottle on me.
She said Geneva started a sterilizer.
"I said this woman, "See what you did with my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LABEL slaughtered the mother - who still holded Geneva - and her companion had to keep her in the waiting car, said Roshan Monk.
The girl cryed so strong that she was standing and added to her.
Label later sent a note of apologize, but he did not receive the answer.
The lawyers and representatives of Label do not respond to the calls for comments.
The amount of compensation for the damage is not reported but the lawyer, Sam Davis, said that he was taken for this case free and that the family plans to provide any money that will receive, for the goodness of children, a ill cancer.
"The goal is to put Patty Labell answers for his progress," said David.
"We are perfectly unable, especially in relation to the child garden of the 18-month child in the hands. "
Climate problems have delayed the economy
During the first year of Mario Lopes’ government in Singapore, unemployment and unlawful labour markets have been decreased and the economy has been decreased.
2011, which will be in the economic history of Sinala as the first year of the Government of Mario Lopes Waldes, as well as the year ' s change, which generated great hopes for economic development, but, taking into account the unpleasant climate conditions of the year, growth was not registered but the reduction of the main economic development indicators was registered.
The lower temperatures in February were not only losses of millions of agricultural sectors but have limited the possibility of the growth of the public economy, resulting in the reduction of the economic activity in the whole 3,6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly because of the historical fall of 31,16 per cent in the agricultural sector, which has affected the dynamic of other economic sectors.
According to the report on areas affected by the Council of Mexico on Sustainable Agricultural Development, 835.582 hectares, of which 78.03 per cent had suffered from the totality and 21.07 per cent of the remaining population suffered in part.
The fall of economic activity was fixed by November by the continuing growth of unemployed unemployed in the State, by the National Statistics and Geographic Institute, during the first three quarters, the rapid growth of unemployed unemployment, from March 55,053 people of Singal had been unemployed, from 4.53 per cent of the economic active population, in the second quarter of the population increased up to 5.28 per cent, and from September to 6.19 per cent, the percentage of the population was more than 74.000 unemployed in Singapore, that by 18.9 per cent more than half of the first.
Decreasing liquidity
The workers in Singapore have been discussed by many factors, for the economy, Gerardo Lopes Servantes, Director of the Economy Faculty and Social Science of the Autonome University (UAS), the growth of unemployed people in space and in public policies can be explained.
"What we are now seeing is the growth of unemployed persons who are linked to a number of factors, including the loss of the market in order to restrict the resources adopted in the convention to combat the distortion of money, as they are illegally owners, is not easy to work with them, invest and use them in something," he said.
Stopped immigration
Lopez Servanthes said that unemployment is still a demographic factor in the growth of the unemployment.
"The number of people who leave the state in the search of border work was limited in the United States, in the first way because of the income difficulties, and in the second time, as they have already faced very many difficulties in searching for work, so that the group remains and requires workplaces in the State, as a result, increases the unemployment level," he said.
Infringement of formal requirements
The Sinala's work market analysis is worse when focusing on a large number of violations in the working conditions, under INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the active population of the State is working without being mentioned as employees in any institution of social protection.
In addition to unemployment and violations, there is another memorandum on work in the State; in the state, the lower payments in the country, in accordance with the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Safety and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
The average income of the workers of Sinala was 5.352 weights, largely below the average country, which is 7.375 weights.
Decreasing the PYME
In addition to the fall of economic activity and the high rate of unemployment in 2011, the largest rate of direct foreign investment in the past 10 years has been fixed by the Ministry of Finance, with $630,697,74 per cent in July, compared with $5,143,312 during the same period.
From its part, the Ministry of Economic Development of State has fixed only 17,280,000 fish of investment during the year, which was mainly a service company.
Double
The Government of the State requested in July at the State Congress on credit approval in 3 billion peso, which would be used to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities in order to live in the economy, at the local level, a total of 2.600 million weights had been approved, and the debt benefits were not expected in any State economy sector until November.
Reactions
For the first year, the Government of Mario Lopes Waldes demonstrates the lack of Government opportunities.
Mr. Loredo Lopes, President of the National Training Facility, said that in 2011, the desires of various sectors, including the Government of the State, had not yet been agreed.
" The effectiveness of the economy in Singapore in this year was really low, it is to work to restore the positions lost in this year, in 2012 we must duplicate our efforts, we have not been able to agree to all and, above all, the good and synchronized work of the new Government, we hope that the next year will be better", said he.
Economy delay
Lopez Loredo said that events such as premature overwhelms have stopped the economy of the state and its effectiveness and growth in this year.
"The number of economies is a result of several events, including smooth, one of the main effects was a late economy that is not enough to create an economic dynamic that allows us to have the acceptable level of processes, goods and services and, therefore, we close it at the end of the year under our expectations", said he.
Guide View
Theodoro Sarazar Uriarte, President of the Conference of the Workers of the Mexican Republic of Sinala, said that the State had to continue the most dynamic productivity.
"In general, we have found that we have worked about this, we believe that we need to develop a long-term programme that will re-determinate the direction and economic course of the state, must mobilize all material and human resources in Singapore," said he.
Sustainable work
The Chairman Koparmex emphasized the importance of identifying the future direction to improve the efforts of the Government.
"In general and in general, I would say that the Government is trying to be successful in various areas, there is a small progress in economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current Administration has demonstrated progress in its own manner of public policy.
"The facts that let us say that the Government begins to join the work, and I can say that some work has been done, and I think the Government understands that much still needs to do", said he.

We need to make contributions to the work
The public work on such programmes such as Rodin, Safety of Public Areas and 3x1 for migrants is risked to remain incomplete or long-term reliable because of the lack of resources, said Mr. Angel Lopez Miland.
The Director of the Municipal Social Development stated that, although the work programmes have been developed, they are in danger, since the Government of the State is not able to make relevant contributions, which exceeded 11 million weights for all three programmes.
He noted that the overall financing of all three programmes is about 50 million weights, with 25 per cent of which the State should be invoked, and only the Federation and the Municipalitat had provided resources for work, so that it is still possible to delay with the end of it.
"They have to put about 12 million, and although the year is ended, they don't give us any cops when they had to give us a part from July at the beginning of July," he said, "to do not leave, we've started working and they've been very good, but we need money."
He recalled that last year, during the Hess Aguilar Padily government, the State did not have the contributions he had to take, so at the beginning of the municipality's rule had to make money to cover more than 7 million, the amount that was not provided in the case of the State Administration.
" This happened with us in the previous administration, since the State had no financial opportunities to participate and the programs continued to develop, and in this year, to get access to these programmes, we need to find resources to closure what was to be left," he explained.
While the State authorities have the obligation to carry out these resources, he said that the request was made on behalf of the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villerarial, to increase the efforts to ensure that the percentage of them arrived as soon as possible.
"They should put about 12 million, and even though the year is ended, they don't give us any copy."
The Court will approve the "displacement of digital television" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of digital analysis signals is one of the most important changes that have been made in the past few years.
The Supreme Court (WHO) rejected the constitutional claims issued by Senate and Pallate, the representatives of the President Decree, which brought such a "transmission to digital television" from 2021 to 2015, since eight votes were not received for its cancellation.
The minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court of Justice, Juan Silva Mes, had not been overlooked by President Felipe Calderon, having issued a decree with a detailed description of action to transfer to digital land television.
Consequently, the constitutional claims declared by the Senate were rejected by the absence of the majority qualified of the eight votes necessary to ensure that the court was issued under constitutionality or non-constitution of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft declaration prepared by Minister Olgoy Sanchez Cordero proposed to declare the decree of non-constitutional, since the regulation of the radio programme and television is the right firmed by the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of the Jerish Sociation and the Legislative Reserve.
Only Salvicar, Horchee Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sanchez Cordero proclamed for the project.
According to this argument, and the House of Deputy held two constitutional debates in order to check the decree and support complaints, Minister Sanchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all actions mentioned in it with regard to the transition to the digital message.
At the minister meeting, it was also decided to reject the request of the House of Deputy, not entering in the draft discussion, as well as under the responsibility of Minister Sanchez Cordero.
In his statement, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, as the Federal Executive Authority could not define the general rules for the preparation of the State Administration.
"I am also not thinking that if this happened, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and recalled that the planning of public policy in strategic areas such as telecommunication sectors, the federal executive authority had a constitutional mandate, the government of the State.
The replacement of digital signals, one of the most important changes that have occurred in recent years, has made better use of the radio and electrical sphere, the best quality of the signal and more channels.
Transition, he said, would mean designing benefits from the conversion into a digital form, including the satisfaction of public needs, which is not only technically measured, " as it covers economic, social, political issues and national security issues".
These questions, he said, "we need to work all the system educational in the principle of public economic governance, include a group of authorities which the Constitution combines public executive authority."
He recalled that a large number of countries worldwide have already been overlooked to digital preaching, and that was done by the executive authority, despite the existence of universal technical institutions.
It cannot be noted that the Government, taking the debated decree, which, in any case, affects the competence of the Congress, provides an administrative area of compliance with the legislative laws adopted by the congregation.
In Michoacan, it is analyzed the possibility of reporting the vote by a vote.
According to the data transmitted to the CPU, the difference between the first and second place to the Governing Elections is totally 27 per cent, even without a number of votes coming to 879 from the general number of protocols at 6.074.
The possibility of a vote on vote is real, as regards the election process in Michoacan this year, where the difference between the first and second place in the Governing Elections is of 27 per cent, even without a number of votes from 879 from the general number of protocols at 6.074.
In the light of this Chairman of the General Council of the Institute of Electorals (IUM), Maria de Los Angeles Lyanderal Saragos reminded that a few days ago, 9 November, the election Corps adopted the package of principles to agree on local rules with the federal election reform.
As should be reminded, Michoacan did not adopt the Constitution or Electoral Code of State or the Electoral Law, since the Congress of the State had adopted reforms immediately before the time of their entry into force in this election process and the Governor Leonard of the Kingdom did not include its publication in the times defined in the Official Journal of the State, said that he had some expressions.
On the same day, on 9 November, the High Court of Justice (USU) decided on a constitutional claim issued by the local legislative meeting, and called the vote of the representative of the State for the Constitutional Reform, since it had no right to "accepte or support them".
In the interview of the possibility of vote, Mary de Los Angeles Linderal said that, with the adoption of appropriate principles by the General Council of the IUM, the vote would be possible to be a part or full account of the votes by the local election body.
Similarly, a partial changing of one or more election urn may be occurred at the conditions that: the results of the protocols are not matched; no vote protocol or reporting documents in urn or is not in the Chairman; or if there are clear errors or corrections in the protocol.
Furthermore, the general changing of votes to all elections may have a place where there is a sign that the difference between the candidate of the elections concerned and the one who received the second place in the vote, less or equal to one per cent, provided that at the beginning of the session a request from the representative of the party and/or coalition which has issued the second of the candidates mentioned.
The overall votes will also be reported if, at the end of the normal calculation, the difference between the winner and the candidate who has taken the second place is less or equivalent to one per cent, provided that there is a request from a political party whose candidate has taken the second place when the election routines were excluded by the partial list.
It should be noted that there are elections in Moldova, where, according to the DDP data, the difference between the first and the second place is only 0.16 per cent, even 129 votes from the general number of the 923 protocol.

The new Italian Government will be formed in the medium
The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monty, is meeting tomorrow with the President of Italy to submit the new Government to the crisis imposed by the country to a degree of economic disaster.
The designated Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, is meeting in the middle of the President of Italy in order to submit the new Government with the crisis put by Italy to the degree of economic disaster and the damage of the whole euro.
The statement from the presidency stated that Monty, appointed at Sunday, was meeting in the midday with the President, George Napleitano to confirm that he could form the Government.
It is expected that it will represent the office, which is mainly from the technology, although it is unreasonable when the new Executive Authority will take its positions.
Monty said that he would present the President's results of its negotiations with political parties in his attempt to form the Government.
"I want to confirm my full confidence in the ability of our country to get out of that complex period," said the former European Commissioner of the reporters.
Monty did not directly say that he could form the Government, but the ton of his comments showed that obstacles were overcome.
"The Structure is now well shocked," he said.
Monty has concluded the process of training of the Government less than three days, which was much less common, since Italy had fighted with a political and financial crisis, which increased their debt at critical level
The Administration under the leadership of the former European Commissioner Monty should adopt a green economy package required by European leaders to return trust in Italy.
On the basis of the pressure on Monty to accelerate, the instability markets have established income from the BTPs Italy for over 10 years more than 7 per cent, the level of which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Markegalia, the leader of the Italian Workers Federation, reported reporters after the meeting with Monty: "We said we'd be actively supporting the Government."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to get out of this critical situation.
Shanes Monti had succeeded in many ways based on the support of the LDP Party, Sylvia Berlusconi, which had taken place in Saturday for the crisis.
“We believe that the efforts of Professor Monty should lead to a good outcome,” said the reporter Angelino Alfano, the secretariat of the Centralist and Rights Party.
LDP support, the largest party in Italy, is important, since many of its members have opposed the government majority of the technicians in Monty.
Parliament support
The new Government of Monty should be a strong parliamentary support for reforms that would probably be unpopularable reforms of the economy.
Any blocking or stopping of these attempts may lead to a new and destructive attack on financial markets.
The Italian Bank Association increased pressure by warning that the loss of Monty could be a disaster.
Monty began its consultations on Monti on Monday with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as with young and women organizations.
He finishes his meeting on Tuesday night.
Monty was appointed on Sunday, Napolitano, which allowed the extreme rapid transition to the crisis.
After the short transfer at the end of the last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi would go to the departure, the cost of the long Italy has now been critical on the background of the incertitude of whether the new Prime Minister was successful.
The saving of Italy with a long period of EUR 1.8 billion would be too much for the modern financial protectioners of the euro.
Monty said that his Government will exist before the following elections to be appointed for 2013, despite disseminating prognosis, that policies would only give him the time to reform before the designation of new elections.
Monty said he would like to include policies in his office, but the main parties argued that he should only be composed of technical specialists, proof their frustration that the financial situation affects the process.
Political sources reported that mutual infidelity and inconvenience of the parties are difficult to include political figures.

Spain footballers playing in Liga all the stars and strong clubs of the Premier Ligue were very active during this year in the liga and local cows, and they are the high-level games in European cows and Championships.
This should be added to the experience of the Spanish flare in a complex qualification in Europe or Championship of the world.
The Tisco players, however, have a limited international experience in the area of ConcacaF, which is considered the lowest level in the FIFA.

Quintat included the country in the honour of the twenty-third carriage
The trip to Costa Rica is a forgotten dream.
In the exceptional Viva-basist Jeff Action from Pearl Jam said that the group was ready to give one of the best concerts on Sunday next.
It was more than 20 years of expectation, but the group says that it is also a dream of reality to play in that country.
This was the approval of the Basis and founder, Jeff Ament, which gave an exceptional Viva interview from Brazil last week.
The Group is located in the territory of South America in the area of the twenty-year work and on Sunday 20, will make its only stopper in Central America.
To this day, they will be held at the National Station, starting from 7:30 a.m., together with the Los Angeles The X team and the local group of Las Robertas.
This is a switch from the Nation, a full decryption that is available online in The Nation.
For your fans, from Costa Rica, is this a forgotten dream that Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica?
The trip to Costa Rica is a forgotten dream and for us.
It's our only second visit to South and Central America, and it's all right.
I was in Costa Rica only one time - in a vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
That's why we're very happy to bring our music there.
I ask this because there is some loyalty of the group; the fans are pressing the day before the concert.
What do you say to your most faithful fanats?
Thank you for having been with us all these years.
We needed some 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thank you for waiting so long, and we're sorry that we needed so much time to get here.
Some people, in the expectation of your concert, relate to him as a big show of the year.
Is this a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows that we have played over the last 21 years have been during the last two weeks.
We've spent a few beautiful shows in San Paulo and we hope that this has brought us into the form of this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we want to play here very much.
We love this country, we love serving and jongle about these two things, Costa Rica, one of the best countries in the world.
How did you know about Costa Rica and her snakes?
We have a lot of serphant friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the waves are incredible here.
My friends are always traveling in the Costa Rica and Nicaragua, and in Mexico, are good places for the serfing, that's how we learned about this, from those who love serving.
Looking at the tour, you can say that you've made a big show with a lot of songs.
What have you planned to say in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there before, we have no limitations to what we can do.
We're trying to make the best show of the possible songs; we're trying to play several songs from each album and to present our fans a great variety of repertoires.
You never repeat the repertoire.
How do you get that?
I think it's partially because we've got nine platforms and we can play more than 120 songs, and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose what songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven't played in a while, it keeps us in the tones and surprises us, because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved these songs and what we could forget.
This makes the show more interesting for us, and so I think it makes it more interesting for people.
This tour you're noting 20 years of carriage.
As you look back, it's hard to believe in everything you've done?
Yeah, of course.
First, I think that no one of us could never imagine that we're going to be a row-group and that we do this for more than 20 years.
We welcome our luck and we are very encouraging that we can continue to create music together.
We all love each other and love music.
We're happy to travel to the world where we always wanted to go.
It's very lucky for us.
What does it mean to you to be a significant part of the grain race?
It was always the honour to be part of this group of great collections.
We are good friends with Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
Good when the movement is out of the group of friends, and it's uncomfortable.
From time to time one group appears, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups appear at one time in one city.
We are honoured and for us to be part of the Seattle Group.
I'm still playing with some of them from time.
Last year we were celebrating Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we are happy to be friends with all of them and to be part of the sound that was received.
It is also very strange that your group remains together in the same way as the same long time.
Yes, four of us were together 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) was joined with us 13 years ago, which is very much more than many groups.
First, I think we've been happy that we're still alive, and second, we're worried about others.
We are all very close friends and, as a result, have also been opened by musical roads that give each experiment freedom.
We trust each other in music, and it couldn't be better.
Your relationship to the word of glory was not easy; but through your success you have been able to do everything you wanted.
How do you find the balance?
When we grown, it was easier to find the balance.
We're worried about being too long in the tower because it's easy to get in this game of big balls and people that love your music.
As you remember that people here for music, it reminds you that you have to respect the music and what it has been done, not to be famous and to be a rock star, but that's what no one of us do not worry about.
How do you remember your other project, Manother Love Bone?
I think we're writing very good songs, and it was great at the beginning.
We were a group of almost three years and we didn't have any album, which affected Andy (Andrew Woods) before death.
It was a lot of disappointment because it was so long, and the most important thing is that we have yet been close friends with Bruce (Ferweser) and Gragom (Hilmom), who started with us in the group, and when I hear a song or see a photo, I think the incredible man who was Andy, and how he put me to ride, was always pleased to go to work, speak about music and football, and a lot of friends.
It was a wonderful man, and we're missing him.
The local group of Las Robertas will be responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
That's true, you know her work, especially Eddie Water, and then you chose her to open her?
Yes, the producers sent us a few video sets, and it was a group that loved us all, so we're not trying to see that Las Robertas can offer food, and that must be very enthusiastic.
Why are you constantly changed words in Yellow Ledbetter on the concerts?
This is the question to Edddy Water, so I don't know.
He's hunting her and I think he's using the first thing he's coming to his head.
Who has affected you as a basket?
They're so much.
Among the first ones in mind, Giber Batler, John Entzill, Sey Jay Ramon, John Dow, Paul McCarney, Chuck Ducksski...
They're so much that I can talk about the basists I love.
How did Pearl Jam have been successful in maintaining the reality of the grid, despite the fact that he wasn't in mode?
I think we're all feeling a little deceptive from the words of the grench.
When I think about it, he recalls me of the groups I mentioned before, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana, and all that appeared at the same time, and if that's important now, I think it's wonderful because it's a music that is to listen, and the teams like Mudhoney make a music better than ever.
At first, your music was more mad, and now she becomes more positive.
How do you explain this change?
It's interesting, as I think, there are several songs in the album that can be easier, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe, which are considered very mad, although they can feel a little positive.
From both, when Ed played them, I cryed when I heard them, these songs were very dreaming.
I think that when you grown, and in your life, you've lost family or friend, these events start to influence your creation and music, and these two songs, of course, reflect that for me.
So, I think you can be a happy man, and everybody knows how to create a laugh music.

The water driver will be three-dimensional with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario had been struggling over 25 years to save Princess Pitch from the bad bossor, but he never did it in three measures: "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of girls in stereoscope technology.
The publication that appears in the world's shops this month has been created, taking into account the portable Nintendo 3DS console that allows to play in three measurements without the need to use of views.
"Marrio is a hero that should be informed about how to work a stereoscope without looks", said the head of the Nintendo Press Service in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the games in Madrid.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" was the first Nintendo video game, which was specially developed under this platform, since there are successful products like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" to be adapted to existing games.
The representative Nintendo stated that, despite existing in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" was a "accessible" video game that allows to enjoy a fast and moved game.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part of the "small" to engage less experienced users.
One day, the majority of experts will start on the second round at the level of the games that are more complicated at this time.

Columbia guarantees the extradition of Portugal in the United States
President Alvaro Colum said, on Monday, that the extradition process of Alfonso Portilo began to respond to the United States for the delay of 70 million dollars.
This ended the process that Guatemala responded to the request of a northern country that required portuguil extradition to judge it there.
At the Press Conference, Colombia said that his decision was related to the independence of the court and executive authorities, taking into account that the Court of First Instance had already signed extradition.
He stated that during his mandate, he did not "play hands" to legal decisions and adopted all extradition procedures that he had ever known.
Nevertheless, the portal Serquio Ruano Marrowin will be extracted for murder and heavy physical damage, as well as Edgar Estras Morales and Victor Estrasdo Paudes, both for the loss of drugs.
What was done by the Columbia shows the executive process after the extinction of all legal and constitutional courts with a view to the persecution of States extremes from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CCP), Portugal will be extracted once, in accordance with its legal situation in Guatemala and the guarantee of its human rights.
Portugal was recognized innocent Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence during the Presidency period, which was a process that had been previously extraditional, but the Ministry of Public Relations has appealed and renewed the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people from the risk group
Organization was established to prevent young people's marginalization without education
The results of the first 25 years of Trinijove social support organization are important: 6.000 young people supported the social isolation have helped overcome situations during the fourth century.
This should be added to more than hundreds of workplaces for this social group.
It was a case for the ceremony of the old factory Fabra I Coats, where more than 300 people had come.
Trinijove appeared close to Trinitat Well in 1986 in order to assist young people with lack of education, lack of work and drug problems or substantial marginalization.
Last birthday, Sant Andreu collected a large number of responsible organizations and institutions that cooperated with the association in these 25 years.
A different political presentation during elections showed the only nature of Trinijove work.
After the President of Generality, Arthur Mass, and his former Hordi Puhole, the ceremony, were visited by the Ex-Consultant of Social Education, Ernest Maragal, and Ex-Legendant lady and the current ecocilist, a member of the Municipal Council of Ricard Goma.
In Fabra I Coats, the current social welfare adviser, José Leis Cleris and SSEO on La Caixa, Haum Lansap, had also occurred in the present Fabra I Coats.
He said that Trinijove appeared at a very difficult time and that the present period was also difficult, but he added that the work that was still done is "a good basis".
The Chairman brought Trinijove as an example of fighting against bad circumstances and endorsing hope in people who experience difficulties.
"The crisis is not new for her organization and work", he said.
The hidden building where the mass festivities were organized is evacuated
11 from 13 stages of the building on the Balmes Street, 51
12 Occupiers left the building on the midday without fighting
It seems to be a shock of neighbors who lived in the 51th palace at Balmes Street.
Twelve men were voluntary to leave the building that they were unlawfully occupied and where they organized feasts that disfellowshipped neighbors on the decision of the court without the police.
When the operation was completed, the door lock was changed to prevent the recurrence of the situation.
"After this moment, it's going to be a slow control", said the manager.
The clouds, which were covered by 11 from 13 stages of the buildings, were resident, brought all electricity and parts of water, detection of the walls and left the sequences of different kinds, especially the banks from alcoholic drinks.
The first three stages were a place for the Mass festivities that longed up to two days and disappointed the owners.
There is a night club, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
The owner, Mary Pantinat, reported Europe Press that from the time that the building was busy, its income was decreased to 80 per cent.
The club's owner says that the shippings have inflicted it as they sold drinks for three euros, as in the club for 10.
Moreover, the owner of the discotech should be answered to the complaints of neighbouring, although it noticed, the sound was called by non-club visitors, but by the people of the crowd and, above all, those who visited the celebrations that there were organized, the frequency and the intensity of their growing neighbors, as said.
The Hospital Club said that inquiries were so great that she even reached agreement with the owner of the ownership, and that's now nine months ago, as he "missed" her payment.
The City Police also confirmed that the last weeks more complaints had been received from neighbourhood.
The President of the Municipal Group PP, adviser Alberto Ferrandon Dias, needed last week "needly evacuate the building to address the problems of coherence and the general spirit in the neighbourhood and degradation".
The Popular leader explained that only one stage of the building was busy before the summer, but in the past few months, the crowds were invaded in all stages and practically in each placement and some of them had occurred.
In this sense, he added that "the end of impunity and strictly resisting the uncultural created in the building".
So, last night, the police members evacuated the building in Nou Barris.
In 1530, the police went to Montreal Street, 35 after receiving a call from the neighbor, which noticed how four men were in the building.
Four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
Archives agreed with the possibility of competition after the contributions
The Municipal Competition on 16 doors re-debates on the role of Colossello in Barcelona
In the mid-80s, the Administration has printed a list of lists for the Colsellol on the midst.
The boxe described the mountain as a large park of the capital Barcelone.
Moreover, this was compared with the pictures of the New York Central Park.
By the death of the SCB, the park reiterated in 1987, as the upper point of Barcelona, as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few who were not orientated to the northern and upwards (more).
The position of Colombia as a natural park is contrary to this idea.
The prototype was not the Central Park, but the Yellowstone, with the wild cabin of the Jogg Mediterranean.
It was so until September the Council had not announced great conspirations from 16 concurrents to many other gates in Colosserol.
It's under the doors that the park's idea, unbelievable.
Of course, someone wants to put the door on the field.
One question is: Colsello? Park or mountain?
The reconstruction and their organizational side, and their impact on the city, are the theme to discuss all the architects of Barcelona.
This is not the most repeating topic discussed when two members of the clan chosen persons are acquainted to each other in the lift.
And this is just one of the few convergences between the three architects of Barcelona and the scientists who were present.
Michael Roldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayon: the defence
For Roldan, after reaching the beach, it is “need” to discuss the “previous part of the mountain” when the proposed Ildephone Serda, with green balls, was not implemented.
"The largest Barcelona Park is the beach.
Moreover, thanks to his beautiful access.
The colleague is more complicated," says the architect, whose heading of the Colsello's door contains a word wood: we don't have to think about them "the income in the park, but as the limitation of some areas where we have to act."
The model, as Roldan and Bayon experienced in the city building, called the proposed "Intelligence task " with " some dangers".
The risks that have come to the "indetermination of public space" after the experience of the 80s, which ended on the Forum's "living song".
The first fear is the limitation of the border where it can be built.
"Restriction of something is the preparation of the next step," means transition.
"We should think of the new urban planning instruments, since the current [as regards the general capital plan] may lead to real disaster. "
In addition to the case, Modolo believes that simplification of the Colsello Valley may be understood as a park, Barcelona, and not as a pure smooth issue.
Modolo recalls that there is already work done on the borders of Calserola, which "no ears to pass," although he thanks for the possibility she offers his professionals to enter the project from the beginning.
Furthermore, it understands that the nearness of the mountain to the city is a path that allows the architects to enter the debate, but "that is doubtful" is whether this technical profile should lead to the inter-disciplinary teams ("success"), which should be created: "Architectors should be only a tool".
Byone believes that the answer to the question that is called this part is a set, as the rules of competition are not sufficient to the general type of Colombia: "It has been declared 16 concorrencies, he says, in terms of the sea hole, but there is no prominent reading here to see and understand the area as a whole."
This implies at least 16 complaints in the case of it.
On the other hand, the project for some doors can be overlooked by the program and defined by the architecture project for neighbouring doors.
In your view, the Council should ensure that the spot must be provided in its entire area to establish a swimming transition between the city and the green.
Cassino forgives Jonathan Larrasaball and will be released
After 72 days of the resolution, the Judge Representative Red Casino forgive Mrs. Montrey in the process against him as a prosecution accused.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrasabal will be freed after the legal representative of Red Casino gave him forgivement to the Second Criminal Court, which leads to the request process against the brother Mr. Montrey.
After the bombs of Casino Royale, Red Casino, Serquio Gil Garcia, published a series of photos and videos, where Manuel Jonas needed to pay the economic contributions to the Montreal authorities to authorize secret operations in the house.
After the public condemnation, the State General Prosecutor opened a criminal case against the brother of Mary, and on 2 September, he was arrested and sent to prison for 30 days.
After four hours before the Office of the State Minister for Heritage Crimes, he was sent to a temporary prison situated in the old part of the capital of the State.
In that place, he remained 49 days, following the second order for prohibition of movement after the prosecutor excluded crimes of arrest and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Cadeette for the expense of polymilion peso to Red Casino's owner, but he was only a few hours in prison with a medium-term isolation of prisoners because he was threatened to death.
The authorities allowed him to continue to leave in a municipal prison in San Nicholas in Garza.
25 October, a arrest order was issued by the secretariat of the Second Criminal Court of Criminal Court, Horchee Yannes, who said that after almost two months, a investigation was sufficiently clearly evidence of Jonas' guilty, such as the appointment of 1.5 million weight with the representatives of the buckmeckers in exchange of operational authorisation.
On Monday, the legal representative of Red Casino, Victor Aldo Garcy Gomess, was before the judge José Luis Pesín, to ask for a mistake to the brother of the region, so that at the next hour he could receive freedom.
During the court examination, the State Prosecutor Ramiro Arias asked Harcy Gomes if he was repaid and who of the partners of the game house had a mistake, although the lawyer tried not to hear the name.
Based on note 197/2011, the legal infringement was granted by Jonathan Larrasabal, and then no statement on the process planned against it; no damage and punishment is also needed.
After listening to the lawful representative, almost 1550, it was ordered to release Larrasabal Bretton immediately.
The servant of the Court, Horchee Yannes, was sent to the municipality of San Nicholas in Harza, in order to inform Jonah that he was legally forgiven and his case will be closed.
He also will notify him of the immediate order of release signed by the judge.
The Minister of Dionicio Pers Haccoh relates to the details of disasters where the Minister of Internal Affairs, Francisco Blake, and the other seven people.
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (MST) reported that the results received in unfortunate cases during which the Minister of Internal Affairs of Francisco Blake Mor and the seven other people had demonstrated that the helicopter had been shocked directly on the ground in full integrity, without trying to make a pilot accident.
During the Press Conference, Dionicio Prus Hakoe, Minister of Communication and Transport, said that before the aircraft was upward, the pilot found that the weather conditions were appropriate for the flight.
"The elements that seem to be shown that the ship had a number of contacts with the land, the fleet entered into contact with trees at 25 meters, where the fleet has lost."
He also reported that 19 persons were shipped shippingly, according to the necessary requirements for transportation of persons.
He also said that the investigation carried out in the shock area did not report about the existing parts of the earth.
"The study reports that there is no ship components in another place, the shock occurred in the state of structural integrity.
" The veterinary was designed for 19 passengers to meet the relevant transport requirements of passengers.
The earth is cut from seven to 30 degrees.
At that time, the secretariat said that it was mainly to obtain results as soon as possible; however, the study may take a few months or even a year.
In addition, Gilberto Lopes Meyer, Director-General of Airports and Support Services, said that during the attack, the presidential helicopter was driving to the race and what happened in a mild swimming flight.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of the normal summer maneuver at the time of the shooting," he said.
At the Press Conference, the owner of SCT, Overs Hakow, counted six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aircraft rules, the ray was implemented under the visual flow rules, which means that the team should be visibility during the flight and the landscape.
Available conditions:
The AICM reports identified the appropriate conditions for the flight when the aircraft was sent to the border territory between the city of Mexico and the State of Mexico, where low heights were observed.
Selected routes:
The team may have searched for a lower height and more visibility in the Kuernava Valley because of the areas of the team.
The place of the shooting.
Coordinates of the shooting and recent records with the aircraft are likely not loss of control or change of the direction of the flight before the shooting.
Slow-scale disabledness:
Available information indicates that the attack was at the front and the side line.
The disappearance of the clusters is aware that the helicopter had been covered with the earth in the conditions of structural integrity.
No apparent signs of fire or explosion were found:
There is remained an unreasoned evidence in the ships, any kind of explosion or fire.
The results of recent research show that there could be multi-scale contacts with the earth.
During the work of the place, there were pieces of aircraft at 9200 feet above the sea, and the land has been cut from seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The images show the incidence in which it was destroyed in the way.
Information contains facts that seem to show that helicopter could have a number of counts with the earth.
After an intensive study on a larger territories than the area covered by a disaster, the aircraft has not been discovered by a plane that strengthens the suggestion that the shock occurred in the conditions of structural integrity.
MSS declares a geno-friendy-research programme
Social protection has been undertaken by research on the search for gender grain in children and youth; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Social Protection Institute (MSSI) announced that research was carried out in order to discover the genes of children and young people, which was received by the Genetics of Child Fellowship and Youth Age, which would be reported to the signs related to loss weight.
In his statement, the Head of the Office of Medical Studies on Biochemia, the National Medical Center of the 21th century, Michael Crus Lopes explained that a multi-profile team of therapy, nurses, physicians and social workers was gathered.
This team has contributed to specialists and asylums of the National Institute of the United Nations Health (NIPH) and the Centre for Science and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Political Institute (NPI).
In the study of the population (produced or not), it is invited to participate in the sports centres of the MSSI participating in the research Valley in Mexico, where each Saturday, from 8:00 a.m. will be tested with children's participation.
He stressed that the protocols were started to take place in the sports centre in Kuwaitmok (on the west of Mexico), and since 8 October, the events were held in the sports centre in Nepal (east Mexico).
After the goal of accession from 500 to 600 children, the study continues in the sports centre of Independence (South Mexico) and, finally, in the sports center of Moreleux (South Mexico).
He explained that the purpose of this study was to understand the consistents and the importance of genetics in the development of gender and to establish a risk factor between children and youth mexicans to prevent chronic degenerative diseases
14 November, the World Day of Diabetes will be noted, and the main goal is to collect three thousand children and adolescents from 6 to 14 years of age with their parents ' s appointment and the appointment for the completion of individual food channels.
They also ask for physical activity and the history of family heritage diseases to avoid risk factors caused by diseases such as diabetes or sexual inadequacy.
He explained that on Saturday, anthropometric measurement of all participants (weight, growth and grain), blood pressure and level of glucose, grass, colesterin and insulin and genetic analysis (to identify genies related to child glucose).
Cross Lopes said that this study reflected the concern of health specialists in the concern of children ' s weight to increase.
Medical studies reported that the only six years of growth was in the period 1999-2006: 77 per cent of the boys suffered from gender, 47 per cent in the case of girls, as regards the lost weight, also seeks a significant growth in this area,” said the MSSI specialist.
He said that the reason for the search of markers was based on the difference between other peoples in their genetic history.
He observed that the average Mexicoians were 65 per cent of the post-American Indians, 30 per cent of the European descendants and 5 per cent of the African descendants, and the condition of genes related to diabetes and lost weight.
He explained that, in the main sense of genetics of grain, the body was incapable to defeat the energy loss we need (calorie), and it was displaced in the form of grass.
The investigator explained that the direct benefit for the participants was a comprehensive assessment of children that could detect whether they had any level of weight or healing.
He even said that the existence of dark pieces on the shoes (actors) and predicts means the possibility of violating metabolism and even predicting.
The information is addressed to the whole confidentiality, and the doctor is transmitted to the parents in writing to which they explain all measurements and changes in the life-shows that should be undertaken to avoid disease.
Cross Lopes explained that there were three major reasons for lossing weight, heavyness and other chronic diseases: sit life, or lack of daily physical activity, a major part of the home before television and the use of small distances instead of passing.
This is also due to high-consumption of calor, i.e. the increased use of coal and hydrocarbons (tameles, bread, pizzas, gasberries, etc.) with the high content of grass and proteins and genetic precaution analyzed in the programme.
UNAM asshalt can escape the threshold
Rafael Errera, researcher of UNAM Chemical Faculty, has developed a polymer-modificed bit to produce the best quality that is sustainable to the impact of the environment and temperature.
If the signals sent by the road currency would be given to attention, it would be necessary to repair about 2000,000 miles per season of rain in the capital area in Mexico, says Rafael Errera Nahara, researcher of the UNAM Chemical Faculty, and adds that if the construction and content of the asfalted road is regulated, the amount of oil may be reduced or entered into the mine.
In its lesson, the technological consideration of the bones read within the International Chemistry, reports that the labs that it is responsible are developing polymer-modificed bitum for the production of massa with the characteristics of the vitamin but with the best resistance of high and low temperatures.
Errera Naher said that this type of revised bitum could be used in places where the weather was extremely shocked, as in some cities north to improve the quality of the road and therefore against education.
He explained that the bitum, the most serious part of the oil, is the part of the hydrocarbon molecule, one of the high molecular mass called asfalten, and other low molecular mass, called smaller, which together bring the road to its characteristic nervous behavior.
The vulnerable behaviour of the bitum is that at high temperatures of about 180 degrees it leads to himself as a heavyness, with 120 limiars very high, and by 50 degrees of celulose it remains almost solid, while at very low temperatures, he said that it is a slower.
This means that the resistance of the universe asfalt is not permanent but changed during the day, depending on natural conditions and temperatures, said expert in chemical engineering.
The scientist noted that the streets of Mexico were mainly swinged by a smooth shooting, which was composed of six of the materials, including three lasts of the bitum.
Among the top shoes, a bitum consists of small stones covered in a bitum and then sprayed.
Each stone that composes it, he said, was slaughtered in the bathroom.
In the movement of vehicles and examples of efforts, this helps the forces to distribute the road.
If this would be modified asfalt, they would be better distributed, said the chemical engineer.
In the asfalt crystal, he added, placed by the latest layer, which is called a sleeve of a small stone, which is actually swimming in the asfalt.
Since this slide, which will contact the transport routines, he must have more resistance than the asfalt shoot and ensure the road train.
As a part of the road currency that will receive and distribute data, the report also requires appropriate interpretation, and is necessary to take into account the material which it is prepared.
The weather, especially the ability and transactions of temperatures, also are very important factors to consider, especially water, because it has a significant impact on the situation of asfalt.
When the soil land, water flows in the cloud and it is difficult to get out of there, it causes the expansion of all clouds and, therefore, education.
In education, he said that the first seed is found, and only then it affects a bitum, but the damage does not happen mentally, the process that should be focused on the first signs of the current reparatory programs.
The members of the National System also explained that the transport was another important factor in the education of dental, and therefore the interpretation of each area should always be linked to the vehicle load and must ensure that the requirements are implemented in order to prevent frequencies appearances.
Rafael Errera said that there is still a lot to study and to do, for example, biological emulsions that are already on the market in other countries and even helping to deal with light and without using high temperatures.
What wasn't the candidate of Vale to become a new Mrs. Columbia?
Analysis of the reasons that Serne Merlyn Ramirez stopped receiving Mrs. Columbia.
The representative of Vale received the title of the princess 14 times.
Vale del Cauca was only desired to put the king of Mrs. Columbia.
On this occasion, Melin Ramirez Serna had to be satisfied with the submission of winners with a golden king and a ring that proclaimed her new princess in Colombia.
In view of the results reached last night in Cartahen, where Miss Atlantic wins the king and shoes, the department constitutes 14 titulated princess, and Merina joined a legione of women from Vale del Caucas, who were close to the king, but were declared by the princess, among them Mirias Ospina Benoit (1947), Clare Borero Duminges (1949), Patricia Belini Ala (1979), Lauren Alvarez (1981), Roz Meriza Alteza (1983), Ogaria Arcenia (1987), Blackland (1988), Marshall (1989), Iceland (Alaska).
Question that is now taking many:
It was not enough because the result is the principal favorites that demonstrated each of the statements that she had everything to be the new Miss Columbia, not just that was elected by the Queen Police and the most beautiful person on the version of Vogue - titles of the Queens, such as Tatiana Vargas or Natal Navarro, who received the kings of Mrs. Columbia.
The first factor playing the role of the jury to condemn her the title of the First Prince was that she was not able to answer conviously the question "What book characterizes you and why?, sent by Martin Muriel Gomes from the literature society, let us read.
She answered the questionnaire:
"I'm reading a lot, I believe in the literature, I think it's an university form, and I certainly think that the book that characterizes my childhood is a very deep book.
Today, I read "Prevention and Punishment" is the chief of the world literature that we all should read; and at this time I also read the book of Irina of the Nemilous, Russian writer, a wonderful book called "The Blood Garden".
The answer that did not like the jury because of the term “exciting” and, secondly, because it did not explain exactly how each of the procycted books characterize it.
But after the ceremony, Maryn said that she was calm and satisfied with his result: "Only wise is what should happen."
And you all, please, read a little bit, "Big Prince" is a great book."
Among the sound hypothesis - Vale was shocked from favoritesm.
The reporter from Bogotá suggested that, because they prefered to meet the events and that she was a candidate who received all the preliminary rewards (a culinary revocation of Oster, a brain vote for the best national costs, and the Queen of Maui), " which rebuild the joy of other candidates, constituted stress from the Queen, and as a result it was not closed to the scene".
And it was noted during her first show in the Hillton shopping floor and during the two of her coronization night.
Although both apparently seemed to be sure, it was noted that it was lacking of power and energy that demonstrated the representative of Magdalene and Atlantic.
Ariel Osrio, a journalist of the Cock House on the RCN channel, said that the fact that Milene was called the princess means "it means that a candidate who wins more rewards during the competition is not king."
Furthermore, the representative of Vale recently avoided press communication and was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that the representative of Vale has been trying to convince the prison in its interest in social work, which is finally accounting for the integrity of the National Concours of Crace.
This is why two days before the election of a member of the international jury, Lucy Dotti, said that they are looking for a woman engaged in the social needs of their country.
"There is not enough for Mrs. Columbia, we must not only look at the external, but also focus on public knowledge, before they take part in the competition, they must already be involved in the projects," she said.
It is also suggested that the representative of Vale had a deficiency on the biennial and fibrosis, which was seen on its animal, but it was compared, as the judiciary had noted her as a candidate with the " natural beauty ", taking into account its healthy body, good food and responsible physical work.
The Consultant of King Horkine Orosco notes that Melina had no better body that had received, "no problem of fibrosis on the animals that weren't very noticed for me, let her lost skin in the last day."
In addition, a journalist, Guyso Oyos from the magazine, believes that Vale de Caucash’s error was the case of surgical involvement.
"Operation is good, but the representative of Vale does not know how to do.
Her body never had her best, and she was sentenced here.
For the first time, organized by the National Beauty Competitor, the brutal prediction last night, said that it was a girl who Raimund gave Melin as a compensation for her reward.
Thus or not, the fact that the year of government is now in Melin, not as the Queen, but as the princess, the position that gives it the opportunity to submit Colombia to one of the international conspirations specified directly by the National Concurrent.
However, it comes to the story, as one of the kings, who, despite its predominant exhibition in Kartahen, faced difficulties in receiving the king.
This was the work of a man who identified the body of Alfonso Cano.
The criminalist from Kaliforni went into the story as a person who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these servants is key.
On 4 November, CTI criminalist Kali entered his history as a person who confirmed the identity of FARC Alfonso Canada's head for comparing his fingers.
For the seven CTI criminals this week, Elizabeth Gonzales, a man from Porto Tehad, who held 21 years of judicial injury.
At the beginning of his carriage, Gonzales worked in Choco Citys, where he was often to pass over five days through Jungle to reach the place where the body had to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to Vale, and after the end of the relevant course, he became a criminalist in the field of criminality where he studied the skin training, i.e. ladone and steen.
During the week of the operation of Elizar on human recognition, known as Alfonso Cano, he was said to be a brother of clothing for three days.
What's going on?
On Friday night he arrived in a helicopter from Kauka to Palmer.
He knew that he would have to identify two bodies, and one of them, as was supposed, belonged to a man who was the elderly party war in the world, so they asked him to take ten pictures of Gilermo Leon Saens (the real name).
However, when he arrived with the research group in the place where the body was, he did not identify it out of the field; he was very different from the one shown in the media.
He was without struggles, he was like a local farmer, without a sight and a significant sweet.
But the impressions aren't ridiculous.
By using the largest shoes, the shoes, the blooms and the snakes, Elizar composed the paintings of the dentists of the body with the images.
His eyes didn't get up: it was Alfonso Kano.
On the same night, the representative of Puerta Tehad requested to confirm the Minister of Defence of Huanun Carlos Pinson, that it was the leader of the CRC
Find Find Printers
For a specialist in the field of the addict of Sijin from Kali, acknowledged by President Huan Manuel Santos Elizabeth González at the Press Conference on Operation against Canada, it is particularly important.
Many people don't know our work.
Dactloscopian is a strict science, without error, that can play a key role in the discovery of crimes.
In addition to the identification of the body, donkey specialists participate in investigating crimes such as rape and murder, and establish the personality of detented.
In detention, many criminals have detailed certification or have documents.
We're taking the impressions and searching for them in the base.
The researcher said that in the case of the murder, he had to put a piece of house walls, because the shooting was shocked with the hands to possess the seef, the full values and the money.
"It's hard to work because they're not good surfaces to remove printings, but in that case we can make a picture of all the ladon and set up the personality of a criminal who has participated in a number of civilians," he states.
Expressions also help to exclude or establish the responsibilities of suspect cases related to murder.
Recently, a dead man was found with a bottle under the library around him.
During the events, a family could be suspicious in the crime and, in fact, the printing of the fingers on the bottle corresponded.
Although it doesn't guarantee that he was a murderer, it proves that he was on the place of murder.
The TIC adviser explained that the place where there are figures, the chemical or physical reactor was presented.
When they are shown, they are used to remove them.
After that, the pictures of prints are sent to Asif, which is the base of the criminal data, or in the register.
"There is that we still have a lot of unexpected colombianers," said the CTI expert.
He explained that it wasn't all that was shown in the CSI television program.
Just as it's not all the gold that you're swearing, not everything you're swearing, keeps the print on yourself.
However, if possible, the comparison will be produced.
The "reasoned people" calls the authorities of New York
Hundreds of Protestants have destroyed the camp before the Zokkotti area.
Some protesters listened to the decision of the court on demonstrations from the area and moved to a park nearby.
Members of the "Zahati Wall Street" moved in the Sunday of New York's calls, when they tried to shoot again, under the judicial protection of the Manhatten area, where they were evacuated at the sight of trying to shoot another Great Yack Park.
Hundreds of protesters were covered in the Zoothy area, where they wanted to come through the judicial order that allowed the "defeated people" to destroy a camp on the area until the other part of the movement was reacting to the shooting park in the northern city where further arrests were held.
"Our idea is that, once the court doesn't allow us to destroy the camp on the ground, we're going to develop a camp anymore and continued to fight for return to Zuckott and through peaceful seats and demonstrations," said one of the representatives of the movement, "Wow the Wall Street."
Bray explained that the answer of the "defeated people" to the evacuation of a Palestinian city, which was sent by Mrs. Michael Blumbergom, was given to the court where the judge Lucy Billlings issued a decision prohibiting violent evacuation in the area and allowing demonstrators to stay in the camp.
Furthermore, the "missed people" began to shut up a new park situated on the centre streets of Canal Strip and the sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tonne, which joins New York and New Jersey, and was in the property of the Church's arrival.
At least at least they could take this place, but then the police arrived and began arresting some of the protesters, although Bray couldn't call the exact number, but Ephes said that he saw a number of journalists that were also in the publishers.
The Organization believes that several hundreds of people were standing at the place where the delegation of religious leaders had sent to demonstrate the support of movement members by trying to speak as a mediator in police negotiations.
However, the area of Zuckott, which is a private authority, remains close to the waiting for the court's hearing designated to that Tuesday, in which the law of today's protesters is considered.
Some of the protesters who were sent there took and distributed at the same time the copy of the judicial decision and even gave the copy of the police, protected area, which brought to "also small clusters", said Bray, who stated that some of the police offenders were demonstrators.
The judiciary prohibits the authorities to evacuate the movement of the "Share Wall Street" members and to require the implementation of the "legislatives issued after the opening, or to prohibit the demonstrators to re-access access to shops and other properties previously used".
Mr. Blumberg said reporters that, because of the decision of the Court of Justice, the opening of public spaces and demonstrations had been informed about it, but local laws did not allow them to redistribute palace shops and beds.
The members of the municipal Council personally justified the removal of Protestants from the Zoothy area, which was carried out at about 200 arrests, and the decision was adopted because the protesters were "in violation of the law".
Blomberg said he gave the order to clean the area because it became "the place where people were going to be protested, but to violate the law and, in some cases, to harm others," because "also some companies have been threatened" and the neighbors were threatened "for the deterioration of the quality of life".
The evacuation carried out this morning was dealt with and shows that the soul of Blumberg is more interested in protecting the financial interests of the American workers," added the representative of the movement that condemns the master for “no respect for the freedom of words”.
The responsibilities for the Sahati Wall Street also indicated that they would like to organize " voluntary action" on Thursday, in association with public organizations and professionals, to remind the last two months of protest that began 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Duke Marie at the special birthday TV show
Instead, with Michael Bobby and other Canadian artists, it appears in the television program of Russell Peter's Royality 1 December.
Canada Pamela Anderson was a Assistent Tim Allen in the "Best Reparate", a Savior of Malibu, Benni in the Praiboy, a wife of Tommy Li, and now the activist and model of Dewe Marie will become a special birth show at Canadian television.
The CTV's private television announced today that Anderson, together with the baller (Ballery Executor) Michael Bobby and other Canadian artists, appears in the TV program "Royal Race of Peters" on 1 December, as a very special role of Mary.
The CTV presented the television show offices, where Anderson, also known as a widely distributed home pornographic video on the Internet, where she plays together with her husband, the slaughter of the Mötley Crue Group Tom Li, appears as Deva Maria, holding in the cloud languages of Jesus.
In this scene, Peters, known by the Indian Canadian comic, who recently expressed as a leader in the Tower "My cruel torpe of truth" Charles Shana, appears in the role of Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the Canadian Birthshop of CTV participates in the Canadian snake of Bolivia, who was married at the end of March in Boenos Island in the Argentine Model of Louisiana Lopilato, and who also knows the skandals.
The Bible recently called "sweet" American Kim Cardashian during one of its ports in New York
Japan renovated after the earthquake
The GDP increased by 1.5 per cent because of internal consumption and put the end of the fall of March.
Since March of the last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed and has yet been devastated by a devastating earthquake that has been affected by a threat to the terrible disaster of the Sun of the Second World War.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokio were of $300,000 - a shock that seems to be in spite of a world situation.
After the three lost quarters of the currency of the monetary internal product from July to September, it has certainly helped to turn the page: UNHCR increased by 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter and by 6 per cent per year of calculation.
The second quarter registered, the financial year begins in March 2012 also the fastest growth rates since January 2010.
The recovery may be explicitly explained by the recovery of machine equipment for reconstruction of areas devastated by the earthquake and the following tsunami.
In fact, the company has increased its investment at 1.1 per cent against 0.9 per cent of the capital costs observed since January, the first reduction after six months of improper growth.
However, the real switch in the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Kennethian Impulse, which calls for use of a crisis for strengthening or restructuring infrastructure using lies to grow from zero.
Japan has, mainly, developed domestic consumption, which is now 60 per cent of the Japanese GDP.
The rate increased by 1 per cent by increased costs of cars, travels and relaxes.
Clemo different
Tokio provided the internal market when Yen - Japanese currency - became one of the "first-first", chosen investors who want to be removed from a long crisis in the euro area and negative prognosis regarding the United States, the privileges that would give as a stone on the account of export companies.
The more stronger currency of the prices is a shock, which is a serious shock for the country whose economic rate determines the health of large technological companies.
Toyota or Sony, for example, exemptes the mine in its low indicators from July to September.
As long as the market continues to be displaced by EU Perifer countries, the Government of Esiquico Noda does not decrease deterioration.
We should be aware of the remaining risks such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the inducation in Thailand and the slightly increased value of different values, said last night by the Minister of Economic Policy of Motokis Furukawa.
In fact, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that most participating countries had demonstrated clear signs of economic activity in September.
The indicator, which predicts the breaks in the world economy, shows that the main forces are delayed.
Then he dropped at four decades to 100.4 points compared to 100.8 in August.
The euroon even slowed the average value of 100 paragraphs after it was violated by eight decades to 99.13.
Athena's re-e-mail for doubts
Pasomis said that the adjustment would be approved, but the containers would not sign any written obligation
From the peripheral premiums of risk and incertitude in the park, Greece continues to swallow through the lab that leads to a large European long crisis.
Consciousness that the "convention" of the new transitional government of Ellaw has been soon linked to the requirements of Brussels, whether the real confidence of political forces is true, starts to reaffirm the facts.
While the new Prime Minister Lucas Pascaleros yesterday warned that the alternatives of structural reforms were not and that a hundred-day period agreed at its appointment may be inadequate for their application, the leader of the Conservation Party, Antonio Samaras, believes that no new strict economy measures will be supported and renewed by its new elections designated on 19 February.
The main task of that Government is to carry out the decisions adopted on 26 October, said Pascalismo yesterday, opening parliamentary debates that will be able to believe in the new executive authority tomorrow.
The 24-year-old package for people's employment programs, the reforms of the State servants and new measures to combat tax salaries will be the first.
However, the sentence of Samaria does not explain doubts about his position: "We are ready to help the transitional government, but we do not promise anything."
The director of the Conservators made a more step in its positions concerning the EU and the FMI, organizations that would develop 8.000 million, which were urgently required to Athena, and explained that he would not grant any letter of compliance with the treaty requirements.
However, the European Commission, still experienced a discrepancy of the effects referred to by the Papandre referendum in the style of all, repeated last night that its requirements are unique: it will not renew help if the new Government and leaders of the main parties of Greece would not sign "the written agreement without any duplication and as soon as possible".
The representative of the Ministry of Economy Altafay said that the three inspectors could be " soon" back to Athene to discuss with the new Government "what should be done for the payment of the sixth tranche" in the amount of 8.000 million, although the accurate date is still not marked.
In the Greek club, there is still a few days.
Mrs. Sofia: "This is the instruments of progress and hope"
The king stressed the "based" location of Spain towards this type of financial
Spain "developed a visible place in the micro-financing area".
The Queen Sofia recalled the last two decades that the country had become a second donor towards the instruments of cooperation, whose " suicide", was that it was the "instrument of social progress, justice and hope for the best future of all humanity based on faith in people".
The king opened the Fifth World Summit on Military Disaster in Valyadolida with confidence that " there are no doubts" that such activities are "perfectly needed" to achieve the goals of the United Nations Millennium Summit to 2015, and "in particular the aim of reducing the dual number of people living less than one dollar a day, the level of which is defined "quarter poverty".
Spain “all is still working” to expand the network of recipients throughout the world and take this task with all the“responsibilities”, said the daughter of Sofia and hopes that the efforts and achievements that will continue to be achieved by the fourth century will “assure the creation of new capacity and best opportunities for the poorest people, and especially for women who are the basic recipients of these judgments”.
There's a lot of achievement and a lot of difficulties with which we face.
The Mikrodivision Summit is not only a range of disputes, but also a platform that contributes to "two main objectives".
Her Majesty thus explained that at the end of 2015, 175 million of poor families were used by these financial services and 100 million of these households were elected from poverty.
The impetus to establish a mixture system in Spain and in the rest of the world "keep on the way that started years ago," Mohammed Yunus emphasized Mrs. Sofia as a "act of justice and recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as a "religious idealist in the whole area of fighting against poverty" whose work was known for 15 years since the Queen sent to Bangladesh to study his credit policy.
The experience of this year later, the World Summit to Washington and other meetings, such as the events in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and “I have seen the unprecedented development”, said her Majesty, whose link to this project had brought her the title of the "Family Words" assembled in Valyadolid.
Finally, the Queen of Sofia concluded the statement, called upon the attendants to participate in the debate and to find decisions to go forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethic Empire"
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Trinidad Kimenes said that solidarity is the "ethic Empire" for each democratic State.
In this regard, she said that it would be an error to link cooperation with developing countries with the time of economic paper, since it was “permanent commitment”.
Chemistry concluded that micro-education was a " serious and strong course to eliminate poverty " and now " more than ever " has to work in accordance with solidarity criteria and that it does not allow to be victims of reducing expenditure.
For Spain, micro-education is one of the main areas of development cooperation.
The State secretariat on international cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, highly appreciated the success in providing a "certainty" of people who were closed before all the doors, and Mr. Valyadorlid Havier Leon de La Riva welcomed all presents in the city that " opened their doors by the spirit of solidarity".
The HDR proposes to choose the President of the European Union by a general vote
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union (HDR) in Leipzig, on Monday 14 November, had no significant challenges for the Officer Angela Merckel, who is also the Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future Europe has not been planned in the programme, but has come to a decrease, in particular to satisfy activists who believe that government policy is not so strict as today, as to Greece and may be tomorrow on Italy....
The draft resolution on the presidency in the European Commission, which was conducted in the discussion of the guideline, was adopted nearly unilaterally.
From 1001 delegates were only nine votes against and 10 abstentions from the vote.
A few minutes later, Angel Merckel and a few hours later, Volfhang Shabie, Eurofil and the Finance Minister, have not left a place for doubts.
The main idea of the Officer and draft resolution is expressed in the glossage: a faithful response to the crisis is "not less Europe and more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but because "two million workplaces are directly dependent on the euro".
For the officer, "it's been time to pass in Europe."
This may mean changes in the Lisbon treaty which makes the possible control of the European Union on the financial policy of the European Union, but that may also affect the elections of the President of the European Commission by the general vote "to bring Europe face".
In any case, it is one of the proposals for a draft resolution adopted by the Congress, which apparently belongs to Volfgang Shamel.
Of course, it is unlikely that twenty-seven countries agree rapidly with this decision; Greece speaks against this, and the leaders of the CH believe that Nicole Sarkosi also against it.
But it's ready.
Similarly, most delegates rejected the proposal to extend the vote of each country member of the European Central Bank in accordance with the size of the economy, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
The Chairman had increased the number of references to the Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Cole, but did not try to influence the conventions through the "low-European countries" or countries in the serious situations that like to criticize the "least-commerce" Germania.
Although the entire paragraph of the draft resolution on Europe is the importance of the German and French friendship, Angel Merckel did not mention France.
Just walking.
Remember that two centuries ago Leipzig was a scene of blood fighting.
In fact, it was one of the lowest invasions of the Napoleonian army.
What's angry with hospital letters?
According to money posts, the UMP and the Government have started invasion in hospital letters.
Nicola Sarkosi will come to Bordo to visit the fund for the allocation of families and to discuss the issue, which is periodically highlighted since 2007, on the struggle of social assistance.
In order to help this invasion from the desire to seen in a difficult situation, but also a part of the revised legal campaign to the President, most of them want to focus on hospital letters.
First, as regards the budget economy, the Government is intended to impose private companies on the fourth day of the unpauted leave before the expenditure began.
Obviously, without the special consent of the employee, the healthy employee will lose the payment for four days, at least 15 per cent from his/moon income.
Mea that threatens to generate a angry, but which, according to Les Echos, will lead to the economy of 280 million euros.
And that would be subject to other measures with more symbolic effect, namely, to make public servants a day without illness payment (the State officer has not yet been expected to wait for payment, not with the three-day expectation of the private sector).
Now, when these issues are discussed, most reiterates the subject of maliciousness, with regard to abuse in the issue of painful letters.
The control will be more heavy and swimming, if you understand, you must return all the unlawfully received payments", Whey Bertran warned at the RTL channel on Saturday 13 November.
In other cases, the effects of the declaration were insufficient in a number of real abuses with sick letters.
Since 2002, they have been subjected to a constant control and political attack that brings their fruits to them.
People in France are not more sick than anywhere in Europe.
Let's first look at the country digits.
According to the National Medical Insurance Fund, more than EUR 237 million were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute of Health Economic Research and Documentation, daily compensation costs in 2008 were EUR 11,3 million per cent from the general health costs.
The amount of 46 per cent was related to decreased disbursement and unfortunate production cases and 54 per cent of the disease contained in 6,2 million euros.
It was therefore 2,5 per cent of health costs.
France was conducted in a medium of 14.5 days in 2010 compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to the Alma Consulting Group study.
Another study published by Monster.com on the site in 2007 showed that 75 per cent of 400,000 French employees said they had not taken any day in hospital.
Another study on medical insurance claims that 37 per cent of hospitals had been less than 8 days in 2010, 15 per cent from 15 days to one month, 15 per cent from one to three months and 11 per cent has been further.
If comparing these figures with European neighbors, it is apparent that French workers are not more circumcised to the sick brother than the employees of any other country.
A long study carried out by CNRS in 2010 showed that between 1994 and 2001 the total level of lack of work in France (for health or no) was between 10 and 11 per cent, compared to 20 to 28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom and 16 to 18 per cent in the Netherlands.
The level of fraude related to hospital letters is very low in comparison with the “serial” occupation.
With regard to the level of fraud, it is very low.
The deterioration of the law after 2002 has resulted in a systematic verification of diseases over 45 days.
In 2008, from 1,5 million CNAM tested cases established that 13 per cent of 285,000 short-term prisons were "unjusted or too debt", which is 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematicly verified hospital letters, more than 45 days 11 per cent of cases of 1.2 million were " unfavourable or unexpected " (132.000).
In general, 169,000 cases were " unreasonable " for millions of workers receiving hospital letters.
Numbers that show very few cases compared, for example, with a series of employment digits.
According to the Deputy UMP Dominican Tian, author of the report on this issue in June, there are 9 to 15 million euros of unexpected budgets per year, which exceeds the general costs for daily compensation, and therefore unprecedentedly above the loss of fraud.
Patent: Greece must follow the new resolution plan
Greece needs a new settlement programme to save its economy.
On Thursday 14 November, the Prime Minister Lucas Pascaleros said that 100 days of his coalitional government was not sufficient to carry out this task.
"In order to achieve the goals of economic saving, we need to support our European partners and the new budget adjustment programme", said the Head of the Government, who made its first public statement by opening a debate on this confidence to Parliament in the Middle East.
The implementation of the decisions adopted on the Eurostat itself on 27 October should be the "based task" of the new Government, since the presence of the country in Europe was placed on a card", he added.
Consequently, Pacific provisions a reduction in the country budget deficiency from GDP to the end of the year, at 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
The rights reject the new Government
On Monday, Antonio Samaras, the Leader of the Rights, expressed its support for the measures already taken to try to get out of a long crisis, but warned that his party would not support additional strict economies.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at the meeting with Members from his New Democracy party.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing deficit and long-term and combating expenditure, but also with the inadequacy of any rate that prevents the recovery of the economy.
Olly Reno, the European Commissioner responsible for the economy and the financing, who warned that IWF and the EU did not block the necessary credit for 8 million euros without written guarantees from all parties that they support planned measures, responded that his words were sufficient and that it would not subscribe anything under external pressure.
The Committee of Experts should be readily validated by eutanization and self-suicide with bilateral assistance.
Canadians refuse to die, as a result, in the report of the Kingdom Society of Canada
With regard to palliative medicine, the Committee claims that the Government, the health institutions and the doctor work together in order to ensure better palliative assistance, and that is not the case of cancer.
Canadians refuse to die.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to say to their doctor when they want to die and take steps in this direction.
This is one of the impressioning conclusions of the Kingdom Society of Canada, in which six experts had participated in various areas, including ethics, rights and medicine.
The Committee invites the Government to amend the criminal code so that self-assault with bilateral assistance and evatanization when the election is covered by circumstances, and the patient may be considered competent to take such decision.
For the beginning, experts refer to the recent study of the Economic Expert Office, which has compared the quality of death in 40 countries.
Although Canada is on 10 places, the study notes that "the medialization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people fear to face death."
Because of the medicine or not, but 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative assistance, they report experts designated by the Kingdom Society of Canada.
68.6 per cent of them have died in the hospital.
The highest indicator in Quebec, where 86 per cent of deaths are in the hospital.
On the specific question of eutanasia and self-suicide with bilateral help by the authors of the report, the conclusion is that the federal government had already stated that he had no desire to change anything in the criminal code regarding evaganism and self-suicide with bilateral assistance.
Now, experts who have also studied the position of all countries where such actions were legitimated or decriminated, there are no evidence that this decriminalization has been an abuse in the use of an eutanasia or self-suicide with a bilateral assistance for persons who cannot or wish to take such decision.
On the contrary, he confirmed at the television conference Joselin Dawni, which submitted the report, most of these cases were in countries where eutanasia and self-suicide were not legitimated with bilateral assistance.
Eutanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is apparently illegal.
In Canada, where it is apparently illegal, the self-assailed practice explains Joselin Dawni.
Canadians for Eutanasy
85 per cent of Canadians are speaking for avianization, since, according to Angusa Reida in 2010, they believe that it allows people to facilitate their suffering at the end of their life.
And 66 per cent believe that euthanization will not become a sign of the life of older persons or persons with disabilities is less valued.
With regard to people who have helped themselves, 41 per cent of the requested believed that they should not be sentenced in criminality.
As regards the proliferation or termination of medical treatment for sick, the situation is less sensitive, the authors of the report.
They also propose, in addition to their other recommendations, that the Criminal Code should establish that legally stopping medical infringement is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also requires that health experts train the spirit of respect for the refusal of medical treatment at the end of the life without the fear of criminal persecution.
With regard to palliative assistance, the Committee calls upon Governments, medical institutions and doctors to work together in order to develop the best possible palliative assistance and not only in cases of cancer.
Finally, with regard to a palliative or terminal ceremony, which has been widely applied in the Canadian Health Institutes, the Committee requires that it be applied when it does not serve for illness, such as eutanasia, and has been limited to the same.
Notes of other experts
Some health-care legislative experts have already commented on the conclusion of the report of the experts of the Kingdom Society of Canada.
Mr. Pierre Deschan, health legislative specialist, described as the " extreme " position of experts signed by the report, because, among other things, it does not limit the use of evataanism of death cases.
This opens the door to the situation where everyone who has been slaughtered from life and who has more than 18 years may ask for help in promoting self-defence, says Metro Deschan, who has discussed the summary of the report last night.
Metro Desham also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to have an independence above all other values of society.
He said, "The society has warning signs and bans."
The health legislative specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "a Category inconvenience with the conclusions of the report, which it called "Eutanesian Manufacture".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Kingdom Society of Canada, discusses, in particular, the reports on abuse in some countries where euthancing and self-suicide is legitimated, such as in the Netherlands and Orgonia.
King Jordan calls on the President of Asad to enforce the authority
Damascus condemns the "contraction"
Syria is still more isolated
The Bashira Asad demonstrated last night before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Last night, the diplomatic pressure of the Syrian Bashar Assad, which, with Russia's support, opposed him and condemns "contraction" against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syrian membership in the Ligue of the Arab States, the European Union had already established sanctions against Damascus, and the neighbours of Turkey and Jordan have spent for the departure of President Assad.
King Jordan Abdallah II last night became the first Arab leader, who called the President of Basar Assad to power in Syria, where even about 40 civilians and armed forces were killed.
"If Basar would be the ways of interest in his country, he should be departured, but he should also create the necessary conditions for the new stage of political life, said King Jordan, neighbouring with Syria, in the BBC interview.
In his own mind, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Turkey Ahmet Davutogl expressed regret that the medium-sized efforts of Turkey, which began in the beginning of this year, had not been successful.
The Middle East, who does not live in the world with his people and cannot satisfy his efforts, lost the authority, said he, a neighbouring country, in relation to which Turkey takes a more cruel rate.
On their part, the United States welcomes the "expansion of consensus against Asad and the action of the Syrian regime " followed by the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and the countries such as Turkey, continued to take a more severe course on the repressions in Syria, noted Mark Toner, representative of the State Department.
During that period, 16 civilians and at least 19 representatives of the armed regime had died in the Delia region in the south of Syria, reports the Syrian Human Rights Observatory Point (OSDH).
Two other people died during the shooting and shooting in Jobar, in the village of Homs, according to the NGO.
During the Press Conference, Syria Valed Muallem stated that the country was close to the end of the crisis."
He also reacted closely to the decision of the League of the Arab States to exclude Damaskus, which, in his words, is the " dangerous step".
"The Syrian will not be disrupted, and he added that the complaint against Syria is lost."
After its decision, the Syrian League of the Arab States now studys " the mechanism for the protection of civilians and requires a delay in the country of 500 members of the Arab Human Rights Organization, journalists and military observers.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of France, Alan Jupiter, was also issued for the post of observers from the United Nations to help citizens protected from the repression of the regime, which, according to his words, slaughtered into the "parana".
The new emergency meeting of Liga was planned tomorrow at Rabat to discuss the implementation of the crisis adopted on 2 November and, in particular, the outcome of armed forces from towns where the battle goes, and the release of arrested demonstrators.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Russia Sergey Lawrence last night called a "inappropriate" decision on the Liga of the Arab States, while China called for Syria to comply with the crisis plan, but was delayed from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monty requires time in the markets and victims of Italians
The capital of the Italian Government Mario Monty requested a little time in the market to form its team and execute the programme that requires “offs” to restore creditability lost in the past few months of the Berluscone government.
Last night, the former European Commissioner participated in the discussion with political parties before the meeting with Professionals and Employers.
It should be formed with regard to the dead office of technicians that are not in the parliament.
Monty said the importance of a lot of victims, Francisco Nakar, a representative of a number of small parliamentary groups who participated in discussions after meeting with a candidate at the Prime Minister.
Mr. Janfranko Fini said that he would wait to know whether Mario Monti would ask the parliament before Friday to vote on trust to ensure that the new Government had a sufficient support.
The meeting is concluded by Mr. Monty a limited list from the dunes or around the Head of the Head of the country Jorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monty commented on the nervousness of the funds and detentors, requesting them time.
In the context of "democracy is time to prepare Governments and programmes, he emphasized that the market will be patient and understanding."
His appointment was initially accepted by the markets, but the concern was again, in particular after the unexpected fall of industrial production in Europe in September.
The designated Prime Minister should be formed by the team, including the most important, technicians, although he emphasized that he would also like to include “political policies”.
The new Government should act until 2013, date of the following elections, said it.
According to the spy of the Chair of Jane Franko Fine, the new Government will receive the confidence of the Parliament on Friday.
Mr. Monty guaranteed that when he entered into post, he will be strongly working in order to ensure that Italy will be a major acter again in Europe.
The representative of the European Commissioner Olly Ren emphasized that “in spite of the new Government, our evaluation of the Italian economy has not changed.”
The European Union, convinced that Rome would not carry out a budget for 2013, despite the strict economy plan adopted in the last months, needed, in particular, new strict measures.
The Italian "Boss of Boss" Emma Marchegaly, who meets him on Tuesday, also stressed the need to restart the economy, "for the country that has no growth can not comply with the deficit parameters".
Mr. Monty, known as its competence and independence in the event of the European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents the "change of epoch" for Italy after 17 years of "berlucocinum", "Professor", which symbolises the "excepts of seriousity" and "other Italian" as the authors of the transfer.
The great unknown of his teams is long-term.
The President of Napolitano would be glad to avoid rapid elections, since Italy should pay for a period of EUR 200 million to April 2012.
Russian scientist helped Iran ' s nuclear programme
The Russian Scientist Vichelau Danielko helped Iran to develop a detonator used in nuclear weapons confirmed in the lunch of the American Agency specialized in the field of nuclear danger.
The Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) is issued at the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents of the United Nations Agency to establish the identity of this scientist.

According to ISIS, a significantly operated on IAEA documents, Mr. Danielko was born in 1934, working 30 years of age in the Council's sixty-year-old military centre in Chelabinsk (Ural) and was participated in the production of synthetic systems of explosion.
In 1989 or 1991 he went out of the center to build a company produced by the "nano-almaza" in Kiev.
The financial difficulties of his company had led him to contact with the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then cooperated with the Iran programme from 1996 to 2002 before returning to Russia
In its report, the IAEA mentions "a clear sign that Iran's development of nuclear detonators " has facilitated the work of a foreign expert who was not only well known to the technology, but also informed the Agency that he had worked a large part of his carriage on this technology within the military programme of his country. "

The Twitter Mikroblog Monday has changed the presentation of its platforms that allow users, in particular, to see the activeness of those who follow that server is similar to Facebook.
The new "activity" tab and the other "name" allows you to follow more easier and immediately on the activities of other Twitters, the Internet users whose messages you follow and those who are yours.

Twitter, who has been known for a long time as an intuitively unreasonable and as an uncertain term (RT to overcome any other community, #followfriday for recommendation to follow other users), is mainly the satisfaction of experienced users, thus opens himself to a broader audition, representing the users something closer to the popular Facebook and Google+ social networks.
The users have discussed this new development through Twitters in the Internet.
"It's unnecessary, sweet and sweetheart remembers Facebook."

Austria
Introduction in the Constitution of the “solent rules” budget
The leadership of the great socio-democratic coalition and Christian Democratic Democratics in Austria decided to record the budgetary " solid rules" in the Constitution to reduce the budget deficit and thus avoid the possible reduction of the rating agencies of the public credit rating of Austria (third A).
The Social Democracy Officer Verner Phyman has individually announced this decision at the end of the Council of Ministers, while the Austrian State debt is 74.6 per cent, which is significantly higher than the higher incursion of 60 per cent of the Mastritic Treaty, but below the State debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If the ability to pay Australia was only one paragraph, with AAA to AA+, we should pay for more than three million euros each year, bringing the argument of the Cancer and Minister of Foreign Affairs from Christian Democratics Michael Schpandeleger.
As a result, Austria complies with the requirements of the Sumid of European countries members in Brussels; the heads of States and Governments needed reducing budget deficiencies at the end of 2012 and return to balanced public accounts through constitution or equal law.
The establishment adopted by the Austrian Government recalls the "German model" because Germany was the first European country that has accepted this "right".
By 2017, the structural deficit of the State budget should be reduced to 0.75 per cent of the monetary internal product (WFP), and the structural deficit of the federal State in any year should not exceed 0.35 per cent of the GDP, and the land, as well as the Communities, should present balanced budgets.
The aim is to put the State debt down below note 60 per cent set by the Mastritic Treaty to 2020/2021.
Ethiko Noda
threatens the new monetary market intervention
The Prime Minister of Japan Ethico Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities will make new monetary interviews, if the value and cost continued to grow.
We interfere as we did last time when Mr. Nod Senato explained the excessive flexibility of the exchange rate.
On Monday, Yen grew nearly to the historical note that built the authorities of Japan to the interview of October 31.
To this day, Tokio sell a mine for a large amount of dollars to reduce the cost of the Japanese currency, which has established a new recursion since 1945.
However, since that time, Yen has grown continuously, purchasing investmentrs that accept it as a "refugee" in these smiling times of economic falling around the world and long-term crisis in Europe.
On Monday, the dollar falled below 77 yen, and the euro falled below a symbolic plan of 105 yen, nearly to a level that declared the last intervention.
The estimated financial crisis 2008-2009 of dollars was around 120 yen, and more than 160 yen.
The growth of the Japanese currency is harmful to Japan's export, as Japani products make it more precious and reduce the income of Japanese companies because of the shipment when converting into a national currency.
"Japan is fighting to restore themselves" after the earthquake and the tsunamis of 11 March, which destroyed the Toko region (Nord-East), emphasized Mr. Nod, who fears that this growth would kill a slight rebuilt.
The third world in the world has renewed growth in the third quarter -1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in the year, through export growth and consumption of households affected by disasters
However, the Prime Minister feels that the high price and the prices do not reflect the fundamental economic indicators of Japan.
The Ministry of Finance Jin Adzumi invited the Japanese Bank (BoJ), which opened the two-day meeting of its monetary policy Board, to take all necessary steps to deficiency.
However, the Vice-Administrator of the Hirochid Yamwouti warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken the "passing steps", understood that there should be no additional relief in the medium.
The last meeting at the end of October, the Emiliatory Organization increased 5,000 million euros (47 million euros) to purchase channels, up to 55,000 million euros (519 million euros) to buy different financial instruments to sell the market of prices.
Eurozone
Growth rates, funds are collected
The risk of infringement by long-term crisis is of Europe's index.
Despite the appointment of new heads of States in Greece and Italy and the improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in instability countries continue to grow
The EU's stableness still remains concerned, the European coasts went on Tuesday, 15 November, a little further in the negative zone.
In Paris, in the 10th morning, the CAC 40 per cent lost 1,4 per cent and ended the trade at the level 3.064.
DAX in Francoforte was 0.4 per cent, and London was 0.1 per cent.
With regard to new difficulties with the payment of credits by the European countries in difficult situations, the fund markets worldwide continue to lose part of their recent achievements.
"Obeyed investors are just too worried about the risk of infringement," explains Terry Pratt, the institutional IG marketets blog, quoted by Reuter.
The Tokio counterpart has been closed by 0.7 per cent under the load of new certain market participants to the ability of Europe to keep a long crisis.
" Japan, as the rest of the world, has slowed its view to Europe, and the ships will follow each other in the core of strict changes until the investors have confirmed that the situation has been stabilized", states Misshie Akino, the fund manager of Iiyoshi Investment Management.
The return of concerns about the future of the euro is a single currency that continued to fall in the Sunday.
Euro reached its lower note for half a month.
The European currency was $1,3570 at 10 morning, slowing 0.4 per cent.
According to the brokers, she fell after the Chairman Angela Mercel HDS party in the Monday, which was adopted by a resolution which provides, in particular, the possibility for the countries in a complex situation, to leave the euro without leaveing together with the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates significantly above 6 per cent
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at the level of large threats.
Today, in the morning, the arrival of Italian ten years of age reached 6,85 per cent, and the income of Spanish coastals at the same time reached 6,2 per cent.
These complications with the percentage rates in Southern countries, but also in France continue to investigate the fears of participants.
The chief of the future Italian Government Mario Monti requested time to restore the situation in Italy under the threat of paralysis under the weight of its debt.
The new Prime Minister of Greece Lucas Pascaleros confirmed that the implementation of the decisions adopted at the Euro-East on 27 October would be the "based task" of his Government.
Spain was shot by the market before the parliamentary elections on Sunday.
Among the percentage rates of the 10-year-old commitments, Germany and Spain achieved a new historical maximum.
In the expectation of growth rates in Europe
France has fixed economic growth by 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, little better than 0.3 per cent, due to increased household consumption.
Despite this, Insee has revised the part of the second quarter reduction, with 0.1 per cent of the monetary internal product (WFP) instead of stagnation.
Economists are most concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany, on the same time, has fixed growth by 0.5 per cent for the same period.
The first assessment of all euros is expected at 11 morning, the European Commission warns the danger of the new recession.
Energy Policy:
Facts should be overwhelmed by dogs
If there is a theme on which it cannot be decided after an unsuccessful discussion or under the effect of emotions, that is the energy policy.
The accessibility and the value of electricity is directly affected by the purchasing capacity and competitiveness of companies.
It is a healthy trend that the election meetings are a way to think about the share and places of nuclear energy.
It does not bring fruit until all the proposed economic, social and environmental impacts are examined.
France should build its view on objective facts and rational data.
Now, seven million people on the planet, the demographic development is due to electricity needs until 2050, if only a large part of the world's population is not free of vital elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to comply with the higher deficit of escape resources in order to continue to generate electricity, not forgetting the most important need to reduce the emissions of partial gas to combat climate disbalance, a subject that has disappeared from environmental debates.
The accident in Fukushima does not change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains one in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
This is not the case of Belgium, which makes its decision depending on the need to find a source that can replace nuclear energy, or Switzerland, which is intended to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil are only a few of those who are decisively continuing their projects.
The United States decided after Fukushima to add one installation to its installation, rebuilding the station that was stopped after the accident in Tri-Mill-Iland.
Although the German model, based on renewed energy, is sometimes an example, the reality of this argument is in contrast.
The choice of Berlin will result in increased energy costs, increased energy dependence, increased the need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, the coal scanning of gas emissions in connection with the construction of gas and coal stations.
After a few months, all of these unpleasant effects will be sensitive.
The example of Denmark should be considered.
The Champion of Europe for the construction of the turbine from which it receives 30 per cent of its electricity, is the largest consumptor of carbon and gas from the throwing wind, due to the emission of carbon gas and electricity prices respectively to 65 per cent and 50 per cent above the average of Europe.
On the other hand, thanks to the continuing of our energy policy, our neighbors pay 40 percent more electricity than French households.
As the globalized energy price is a key factor for the competitiveness and the loan of industrial equipment in the national territory, the French companies benefit from the very low electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in nuclear energy will lead to a significant increase in the value of electricity that will make illustrative beautiful statements on the new industrialization of our country and the protection of the purchasing capacity.
The price that most French people refuse to pay, and more because they do not reflect this kind of energy in principle.
It should be remembered that the country's energy policy has made it possible to create industrial sectors in 125,000 direct workplaces and 410,000 dispatched.
It is a strong export-oriented part of the entire part of the international trade specialized in small and medium-sized enterprises and creates a lot of workplaces that cannot be moved to another area.
If France decided to reject nuclear energy, it should be offered by a large number of companies and lost six million euros a year from the French export of nuclear equipment and services.
What electric engine will be ordered to EPR to work for sixty years if it is planned to close its manufacturer?
To solve energy equality, it should be recognised that there are no god or divine sources of energy production.
The development of Areva's decisions with low carbon gas emissions, nuclear and renewed gases shows compliance with energy sources.
For nuclear energy to support the higher security level, it is uncertainly important to the issue of nuclear energy
In France, we have a security body that carrys out an uncommon and transparent control of existing energy centres such as Flamenville.
Our teams whose professionalism is generally acknowledged are full of the same security.
In the course of 50 years, the nuclear industry survived three serious incidents.
Only one, Tri-Mill-Iland, has occurred in normal exploitation conditions, but no effects for human or environment
A reactor and an unfair human error in Blackwood brought to the tragedy.
In Fukushima some people seem to have forgotten that accidents have occurred as a result of two natural disasters of unprecedented force that have affected decades of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector is out of the accident, as has been taken from two previously.
The part of this step and cooperation between the security bodies, operators and French and German constructors, EPR, represents a project that allows them to oppose such indications.
As it is considered by all energy specialists who want to build a reactor, it will be a wonderful gift to the Areva and EDF competitors, cleaning them the way to lead in an unforgettable development of atomic energy.
We should be legally looking for the best combination of energy sources for our country, but it would be unreasonable to allow emotions, dogmes and the prescribed manuals to be higher in the conflict, which is so important for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration is a burden or good for the economy?
The immigration policy at Nicola Sarkosi was critical with various parts of the transfer of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the digital policy and the coherence of this policy with the French self-proclaimed status as the State of Human Rights.
Afterwards, the administrative adherence of foreign students who had been launched in news when the Minister of Internal Affairs (Liberacio) stated that France “not needed for foreign talents, stones and officers”.
But it is very rarely analyzed with economic perspective.
The right and left in this issue are manyly agreed.
From the right tone, Jacques Shirak, who stated in 1976 that " 9 million unemployed people will not become a problem in the country with 2 million foreign workers", and from the left, Misk Rock, who explained that France "is not able to take poor people from the world".
Different only at the generosity level
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the country ' s orbit by the Poland water drivers was eating and left and right.
Both parties see burden in immigration for the French economy and the French society.
Differences are only at the level of generosity that they will enable immigrants to demonstrate.
In its François programme, Olland was limited to the banalities, said that "the joint work to solve our immigration problem."
This representation of immigration as a burden and a problem may give electrical advantages, but the economics are very costly.
As we remembered by the economists of Jan Goldin and Jeffrey Cameron in the recent book on immigration data (On people: How the migration has formed our peace and determined our future, May 2011, the publication of the Princeton University, 352 s.), there is a broad consensus between the specialists on the positive impact of immigration flows on economic growth, employed payment and employment in countries that adopt immigrants.
Immigration restricts growth and decreases employment.
The fear of immigrants' influence is based on a substance that they can replace local employees, particularly low-capacized, providing refunds.
However, experience shows that immigrants have more complemented than the replacement of local work force by carrying out work that is not sufficient for local workforce.
Incapacized immigrants are working in sectors that do not touch local work force and the most qualified are in dynamic sectors where education is not related to work proposals.
Positive impact on payments
Like the surgery would be difficult to work in a country where there is a lack of anesthesis, complementing between local and immigrants, resulting in the positive impact of the arrival of immigrants on the payment of local employees.
Jovanni Peri pointed out that the growth in the migration flow was 1% increased by 0.6-0.9% of real long-term wages.
This is without account of the fact that the diversity involving immigrants contributes to the creation of new ideas and economic growth (from the North American Lawrence of Nobel, the great portion of immigrant immigrants, and Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo - all were found by immigrants).
Migrants also have a clean income in the social security system, giving average 1 per cent of the overall budgets of European countries.
The World Work Organization, such as immigrant in Germany, has been 30 years of age, provides the public budget (minus expenditure revenue) in a average of EUR 1500,000.
Nicola Sarkosi was planned to be insufficient in growth at the beginning of his mandate.
The dentists used to defeat immigrants were very contradicted.
Europe has developed democracy and remains aware of the European democracy
Democracy is a valuable acquisition, but the same time is sweet.
The European Continent should remember that in the 19th century he had survived the tragedy of the World War I, the Talitarian regimes, Holocaust, Gulaga, and Franco in Spain, Salahsar in Portugal and military soldiers in Greece.
Some believed that that democracy would finally repress their enemies, sufficiently to vote and to make it so direct as possible.
Since Napoleon's Male knows what happens from the surface of the thought.
The general vote, although it is a binding condition of democracy, is not its sufficient condition and may even become a "formation tool", as ever said by the philosophy of the Republic of Etienne Washington.
No, democracy requires a lot of other public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of authorities, education, provision, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis we concern is an economic crisis, but first of all, this is a political crisis and a democracy crisis.
In this regard, the philosophy of the true-related Greek referendum will have a double deployment effect, demonstrating the need for a serious change in policy, as well as the unpleasant sense of its impossibility and incorporativeness.
This duality needs to be seen in order to overcome it.
The truth is that before the line of fight for democracy is now struggled and many of the Republican soldiers are now not in that side.
We do not win anything, requireing a series of national referendums as appropriate and haotic.
"Cart-Blance" for a absolute European monarch or a shoe with related feet to lose nationalism - what choice for a citizen!
No, we are not dreaming of the gluotine legs, but of the implementation of a joint, clear and unprecedented – the choice and democracy at this time at the general European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and it is not known how many of them should be counted, because there is only one crisis - the European crisis.
All Europe is subject to the dictata of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its weakness and lack of solidarity.
All Europe has been decreased at the international scene.
Many are concerned about the transmission of European sovereignty, but all Europe will slowly lose its sovereignty, and with each of its nations.
It should be urgently restructured by the European project under the national sovereignty.
Because only the joint work of the European people will be able to reduce the heavyness of each person, free from the markets and prepare for the future, investing in it.
The outcome of the crisis needs to be taken at the general European level and cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy without bringing us to disasters.
After a long discussion of the proposal of socialists and Jacq Delor, the European Economic Government is now required.
Let it.
But to represent it without a stronger economic, political and democratic integration, which is engaged in life, is a deterioration and a new smoke.
We have to start a new stage of Europe's construction.
In order to establish a Republic in France, the Republic of the Republic had to be "remember" of the Republic.
Revolutions of interest would not be sufficient.
This lesson remains in force.
We need to build Europe, one at the economic level.
This can only be done by creating more democratic Europe at a political level of the present population of European sovereignty.
To create Europe, let's create Europeans.
Dispatch cards are all wide.
The World Chip Card Exhibition is opened on Monday in Vilpent under Paris in the atmosphere of optimism.
Indeed, 2011, 11 per cent of global microprocessor sales (bank phones, SIM cards) exceeded, according to Eurosmart, 6 million units.
The worst sector of uncontact technologies that allow public transport or purchase to make a map on the accounting device.
This year, 460 million uncontact cyp-cart will be sold in the world against 320 million years ago!
Their share is increased in 2012 (as expected by 580 million units) and is almost 10 per cent of the world Chip Card market (6,925 million maps).
Europe, long-term away from Asia and the Pacific region, is now forward in the area of uncontact payments.
About 26 million bank maps Visa have already been obtained by this function, and 750,000 terms are taken.
France has more modest positions: 400,000 Visa maps are treated.
But the big shops are shocking the shoes.
In this year, Carrefour issued 2,5 million uncountable MasterCard Pass.
To move to higher speed, the banks must be switched by their customer equipment.
"The two large organizations in France have promised to be systematically distributed among their customers of the bank maps that are available for free-contact use,” reported Gerar Nebuy, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
The banks test payments with a mobile phone.
But it's only the first stage of the future payment means a mobile phone.
Only few devices have NFC technologies (Communication of the Neighbouring field) necessary for such transactions.
"These were responded.
"But they have to be deployed in the next year."
"We account for world sales from 80 to 120 million units in 2012, explains Mark Berten, head of Eurosmart.
But the banks are going forward.
Last night, the Agricultural Credit announced the experiencing of the experience in Canadian since December to June next year.
A total of 200 iPhone clients and staff will be obtained by shocks that provide countless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marcel.
And the General Society also stated last night that it was prepared to start a proposal for its customers to pay via mobile phones.
The terrorist front is distributed from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is worried about the connections of Islamic Magraba with the Boko Haram Sect.
Reaffirmed long-term ties between the terrorism group Al-Qaida in Muslim Magrabe (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Boko Haram Sect.
On Sunday, the Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria Abdelkader Messahel even stated that the Algerians are now certain.
" The capacity used by these two organizations, and the secret services reports show that they are actively cooperating, explicitly explained without details.
Paris seems to come to such conclusions.
Two related links were identified in January in Nigeria.
In the restaurant in Nieam, close to Aqmi, Antonio de Leokur and Venice Delors, the next day, with a number of guests during the operation conducted by French special offices, were killed.
Among the locks left after the operation, the French and Nigerian investigators found a number of phone seminars belonging to terrorists.
Here's the terrorism.
The analysis of the calls had indicated a number of partners in Mali, Nigeria and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), students are particularly interested in two numbers; one indicates the Niger who lived in Midigury, the city in the northern Nigeria, the coasts of Boko Haram, and the other to men, as they say, close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This step is forward, but it must certainly be expected to be more reliable evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But that's possible."
" For many years, he knows that the sect receives financial and ideal support out and that it is increasingly active, " said the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuvo.
In the past months, this support became more clear on the action and statements of Boko Haram and its methods, which now include the use of deaths and more complex explosive devices as used by Aqmi.
The international community, in the head of Washington, now shows the pressure on Aboua to take attention to the problems of Boko Haram.
The case is that the Nigerian authorities traditionally considered the group as a community of educated persons that were not interested.
Quick Success
Based on the swords, schools and fondamental Mohammed Yusufe, Boko Haram, in 2002, means "the western education is sin" - preaches the establishment of Islamic emirates in the northern Nigeria of Islam.
The organization has made rapid success in this poor region.
It is politicized and requires strict compliance with the chariot, and its activists have started fighting against the wicked central government.
It is mainly on the church, bars and authorities.
In 2009, activists of Boko Haram demonstrated special activity by a number of attacks against the police office.
Abuji's reaction is normally uncommitted.
The army blocked the city and left 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, who was taken alive, was killed in prison.
Now the secth is radially and goes beyond the borders of its northern crystals.
In the past Christmas she was responsible for the action that was killed by 80 people in Jos, and then another in Abuage.
In June, Abujan Boko Haram organized the first attack on the police headquarters.
In August, the local representative of the United Nations will become their first international goal.
The creation of a terrorist ass in Africa, which is from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is concerned about all security experts today.
Today, when Aqmi strengthened in Mali and Nigeria, and the Somalians of Al-Shabab act in Kenya, Boko Haram is a new threat to the continent.
Last week, at the interview with Presidents Gudlack Jonathan, Alan Jupe warned about the danger of Boko Haram and expressed its willingness to share all the information available.
The world is seeing the Republican candidates to the President
With regard to China, Iran and Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Keen and Rick Perry are incompatible and incompatible.
Can a weak American crisis lead to a complex world through simple, accurate, simple ideas?
If you listen to the candidates to the President from the Republicns, the elections could believe in that.
A few days ago, Mitt Romney, Herman Keen, Rick Perry and others have been sweet, but only details of external statements that are traditionally a strong part of the Republicns.
Lozngis related to China, Iran and Israel are often pleasing to each other.
Mitt Romney, whose best chances were to move from the Star of the Good Party, threatened to bring China's complaint to WTO and accused them in " manipulation of its currency " are a sensible topic for America, which was a migration of the entire sector of its industry in Asia.
It's worse that if this leads to the trade war, he said.
John Huntsman, former Ambassador of Obama in China, and the only candidate who is in a complex external policy, was not able to fight a position that affects the emotions.
He called on a strong but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of Obama).
But Hansman, who holds in the lower part of the ratings, remained unexpected.
Reagan's style
Romani also promised military attacks against Iran if the sanctions could not stop its nuclear programme.
"If I'm going out, I'll stop Iran, he told me."
"If Obama will be re-selected, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to strengthen Israel ' s military assistance, accused of Obama in the fulfilment of the promises for the partner.
Employee Herman Keen, second in the candidate racing, demonstrated that the case was unconscious.
He recently called against the Chinese military threat, because Peking is trying to get the nuclear army, - obviously I don't know that China has already had her since 1964!
Gouvernant Tehas Rick Perry, who supports Israel and seeks military attacks against Iran, said that it is ready to use the American army in Mexico against drug counterparts.
Cain, Perry and Candidate Michel Bachman are also recommended to seek to torture suspected in the terrorism prohibited in 2009.
All of this is far from the Republic of 2008, John McKeyne, the weakness of the external policy.
The opposites of the current President respond that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he wins a cold war.
They recalled that Obama himself was a lovers and that he had to shine the tons against the fight against terrorism.
They are fairly engaged in his slight dialogue with Iran, at the premature conclusion of the "childs" of Iraq, his vows in Libya, which brings him the reputation of a weak policy.
But the invasion is not so simple.
The population considers the positive balance of national security at Obama, which eliminated Ben Laden.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military interventions in the skin.
And as a result of the need to reconstruct the economics to restore its leadership, Obama's right.
The North River, the new doors for Russian gas in Europe.
The North River, which combines Western Europe and Russia, is running directly on the day of the Baltic Sea.
It is estimated for the use of the gas equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, Russian gas manufacturer, wanted to reverse this event with the pool.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of States and Governments, participated in the last Monday on the Baltic Valleys, between the explanation of the orchestra and the scanning purchase, in the opening of the North River, a new gas transport that directly connects Russia and Germany under water.
Cantor Germany Angela Mercelle, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francois Phioon and his Dutch colleague Mart Röthte, together returned a symbolic winter to control the income of Russian gas into the Western European network.
At the new gas line, 27.5 million additional tonnes of gas will be carried out every year in Western Europe on the first pipeline of 1 224 km, which is connected to the Leningrad area with the Meckenburg land of the Mediterranean.
The second pipeline should be prepared at the end of 2012, provided the total complexity of 55 million cubic gases equipped with the total consumption of France.
And the possibility of building a third pipeline is already discussed in the same direction.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this great project is the victory.
The draft met a terrible resistance to Poland and the Aboriginal States.
The North River really allows gas to be transferred directly to Germany, avoiding passing through the third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries lose part of their authority: they will be more difficult to influence Russia by shutting access to Western European markets.
In the most pressing moment, Barshava was not stopped comparing the Northern River with the new German and Soviet Pact, which was an unity between Hitler and Stalian in 1939 to occupy Poland.
That means that the issue is politically sensitive.
In support of this Russian project, western Europe has pursued more security for its delivery.
But the price of Europe's energetic burden is because the project has created a bridge between Eastern and Western Europe.
Russia has been able to achieve the understanding of the direct union between Russia and the rich Western countries that need large amounts of gas and whose own stocks are already expensive.
"This is a part of Russia's cooperation, which is a new artery, which organisedly connects us", said François Fion, opening gas transport, demonstrating, to which extent the major gas contracts are important and political and economic.
All of this explains the wide smile of the heads of Gazproma, representing a large number of gas arrives in love.
The use of the gas drive is also technical shipping.
A subconduct pipeline made from the prison in Beton to protect it from the ships.
He stands on the day of the sea, in the middle of 200 meters.
To build it, the mining fields left from the second world war were needed.
"The hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a warning," said Yens Muller, the secretary press of the Northern River.
It was also necessary to take many steps to protect fauna and fleet.
The trailer is a long metal washing weight, a weight of 242 Eiffel bathrooms, without explosions all over his length, without winds and without service stations.
The control platform was planned in the Sweden area, but the management project was rejected by it, since Sweden was not able to overcome that the Russian government company was permanently located in its beaches.
"In the case of the accident, we'll close the gas flow less than for a minute," says Yens Muller.
In the case of gas flowing in gas, it is going to go into the air.
But this seems to be poor to the constructors that have planned the shoes that were raised only 1000,000 years old.
Gas-condition control will be performed by a subconduct work that switchs the ship, for external monitoring, as well as a circle internal gas driver.
The smoking device is introduced within the tube of a meter of 1 m and is switched forward by the gas flow.
After three full days of travel, it provides accurate information on any deformation of metal.
The gas guide was designed for work for 50 years without the need for a small restructuring.
The gas circulation is performed only through its pressure.
It consists of 200 bars for shipping and 100 bars at arrival.
Five companies have joined the efforts to implement the project.
The leader remains Gazprom, who owns 51 per cent of the capital.
The final is the German E.ON and BASF company (15.5 per cent), the Netherlands and the French GDF Suez Group (9 per cent of each).
These five companies have established a joint company called the North Coast, which was mandated to build and exploit gas driving.
His headquarter is in Zuge, Switzerland, where the loan is particularly grateful.
Then, Gazprom gave the company to the aircraft for twenty-year-old years, with the possibility of extending the whole amount of gas transport.
"The Gazprom will pay for a full amount, independence on the actual amount of gas will be transported", says Yens Muller.
The financing of gas construction was 30 per cent of the shareholders and 70 per cent of bank credits.
The overall cost of work is 7.4 million euros for two pipelines.
GDF Suez investment will be about 240 million.
But mineral shareholders are convinced that they purchase their costs because Gazprom is risking all of them.
The gas leads from the Baltic Sea to the beach of the coast trees.
Intents are 4.5 m higher for the weekend of gas.
The Dangerians measure the pressure, temperature and the specific features of gas prior to changing it into German gas.
From Monday, the terminal receives a million cubic meters every hour.
This will be a total of 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine Bronnette
Moleskine, created by the Italian company 15 years ago, will return to a letter.
He has an aromate decorated, time carried out by a letter on the light of the leg.
Moleskine's block is easy to know about a rectangular black box, a rain, on a white-speed page, like a sweet with time.
However, the book of Moleskine, we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian Mode company in Milan decided to start in sales of design blocks.
Mary Zebelgondy, then the company adviser, was responsible for the launching of a new product.
Bloc is inspired by the old manufacture technique, milk and lacquered, used for the squashing of shocks.
It is convinced that this type of blocks appreciates the writers and travellers.
"Moleskine has brought in accordance with today's old and forgotten substance that was cultural for the Avangarist artists until the XX century," said Mary Sebourne, who has since then become a dominant breed in Mode.
Successful.
From 2006 to 2010, sales increased by 25 per cent and reached 12.7 million tonnes.
We've been far away from the production of the first years when only 3000 blocks were produced.
Moleskine moved the borders of Italy and exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
The profile of a typical purchaser is hard because the blocks are simultaneously affected by businessers, students and persons of free professionals.
The purchasers of Moleskine are spatial, have wide views and education.
A small Italian company who had only 12 staff has now had 100 and two offices: one in Milan and another in New York.
It distributes its blocks in Fnac bookshops, buyers in small cities and has been able to get a wide knowledge.
"We followed the spirit of time and this new requirement in writing, despite e-mail,," explains Mary Seborgdy.
This cultural roots Moleskine's development; brenda has recently organized the "Fourful path", where architecters and artists demonstrated their own blocks.
He also launched a leopard box in August in Locarno.
By using their success and cultural aury, Moleskine has differentiated its products that now include skins, hands, tastes for computers, including all types of support.
Success generated: October 2006, the Mode was purchased by the SG Capital Europe investment fund, currently Sintegra Capital, which wrote a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the share of unemployed workers so high?
About 19 per cent of persons with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week of disabled work is started today.
Despite public welfare policies, started in 2005, the rate of unemployment among persons with disabilities is still two times above average, namely 19 per cent against 9 per cent for the population in general.
Does it smile?
"No, it emphasizes Eric Blansch, Director-General Adapt, organization that organizes the weekly workshop of persons with disabilities."
"For 15 years, a significant progress has been made."
"In that time, the share of the unemployed was not 2, but 3 times more."
"There's still a lot of work."
It should be said that for disabilities, there are still many obstacles to work.
Among them, 37 per cent of older than 50 years (17 per cent in average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80 per cent of the bacalaur and 2,3 million students in higher education are only 10,000 persons with disabilities.
Finally, a long unemployed unemployment is very distributed, which is 85 per cent for persons with disabilities against 38 per cent in the average.
In short, all these criteria are very complicated to return to work and to the problem,” said Christine Graapen, Director-General Tremplin, association established in 1992 to help companies to take up disabled workers.
This is some of the obstacles.
It is not necessary to say about mentality that changes but too late.
A study carried out in April by the Cities Interpreter Association showed that the requested managers had a low level of knowledge of disabilities and "presented disabled persons in colles or psychological or mentally incomplete".
The results are private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from the goal of 6 per cent of disabled employees adopted in 1987.
The recent known figures for 2008 are 2.6 per cent.
“We are about 3 per cent each year,” says the General Director Agefiph, organization responsible for the collection of taxes from companies that do not comply with this law.
Resultate: The number of “budgetary” organizations, as well as the amounts, has decreased from 590,000 to 46 000 organizations (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"Jacon 2005, which has led to tax, creates a strong pressure on the company, explains Peter Blan."
"But this improvement also reflects the growth of consciousness, in particular on large enterprises."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of the organizations with the number of employees from 20 to 49 are disabled employees against 82 per cent with the number of employees from 100 to 199.
Azar: "What a happiness."
Before fighting with the Blue night on Tuesday (2045) Ed Azar and Jorge Leckens did not hide the joy they received from this friend's match.
We're not going to say that there's a secret conspiration among them, but the picture is symbolic.
Situation close to the Stade de France, Jorge Leckens and Eden Azar died.
Five months later, after the exit of his attacker in the shop against Turkey, the Belgian trainer can only honor it.
"I'm very pleased by Eden, his movement and the fact that he's a Belgian."
"I want to go further," believes Lill player.
What is the contrary between its achievements in the club and in the gateway, it is justified.
"I'm finding a round year in Lila, and Belgium doesn't. "
"I've got to pay the shoes."
Late in the reserve, in the warning of this shop with France, in the game against Romania on Friday night, Azar came to San Deny to end up.
Don't forget, but also about the concept of joy.
He supported the Blues from the age of 7 and the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I always supported them, he confirms.
This also increases the particular nature of this match.
And in particular that there are mothers (Djishi), Johan (Kabe) and Adil (Rami) on the other side," he remembers.
"Increased our ways are crossed."
"There's a chance to play against them is a clean happiness."
Leckens welcomely recalled the "goodness."
"God" to play in a "speak match."
"God" also claim as a neighbor, that France has become a team of very high levels all over the year after the trauma in Nazna.
"Loran Blan was like a shooting shooting, he smells.
Now when Belgium is going to pass the next Euro, the technical sporter will fly in one flight with the Blue Guide... in Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians will grow," he stressed.
"We're struggling, ambiencing games, they're hungry."
"You're convinced in the future shops, including this against France."
Portugal is very certain in itself
Portugal, Paul Bent, begins his response to Bosnia (22.00 p.m) in that Monday in Lisbon with great optimism.
The two teams seemed to have lost their feelings of reality.
"In the end of these 90 minutes, we'll be a happy team and that the most important, happy country."
Paul Bent is already seeing himself in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt that the Congregation, which has been rolled since September 2010, is qualified in Europe 2012.
Portugal is about 90 minutes of happiness.
But there's a game to play, and the Bosnie that has to win.
On Thursday, the Zenih's idol is clear that the game has not been completed.
Although Portugal has been mined more than a hour, she could not achieve the goal that would relax it.
"This is a good result, but is a certain risk."
But, at its soft stadium de la Luz in Lisbon, the português are convinced that they will go, at the eye of the public that should be shocked, even though the match will be very pressed," said optimisticly, but raised Bent.
"We are waiting for a very stressed match, but we are convinced that we can win, " said a 42-year-old Portuguese trainer.
"We still have 50 per cent of chances to be held in Europe 2012," said the Prime Minister Carlush Cairosh.
None in the Friday is required from the portuguese winning.
No one could set up the bosoms.
"This is a good result, but some of the risks, is sorry to Ben.
"We will play against the teams with many technical dignities and players whose personal dignity is, " he added.
As was already in Zenja, portugals are going to make maximum pressure on the bosnicians since the beginning, "do not give them time to think".
Good idea, just this time she'd be realistic.
