DFB-Chef Grindel does not see the base for Özil-Comeback
Berlin President Reinhard Grindel does not presently see a basis for returning from Meut Özil to the National Assembly.
"This is a question that of course depends on the conversation that you are talking to him too about why he has obviously found that one or another, as it was covered in his statement," Grindel said in the football podcast "Prrasen Mother" of the "Phrasen-Mother" of the "Placking" in the football podcast.
Despite the current monthly debate on the photos of Özil with the Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan, he regretted the return of the 92-folding national player.
"I would have been pleased if Meut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also came to a certain time that would be so," Grindel said.
In July, the 29-year-old age had declared his return from the DFB team, and it also found that Grindel did not defend him against racial disorders during the WM.
The DFB Chief reiterated his criticism at Özil that this was not prepared for a conversation with the Federal Trainer Joachim Lew and the team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build pressure, but he knows it from the football that "If you leave a manity or change a agreement, you talk about it with his trainer and I think it's harmful that this conversation has not been agreed until now."

The damage raised by the fire must still be identified as well as the burning cause.
However, he would have been worthy, because the owner had a lot of collections in his gardens.

"When an unimmigration-based background is clearly influenced in society and football, and says, "The theme is important, where we need to care for us," it would also be an initiative to provide better basis for our beverages in place where integration must work", said Grindel.

Critics to Germany

Shortly, panic, people crossed each other.
Seven observers were easy to hurt it, said the eventual Hugh Evans.
The New York police and the musician Chris Martin, however, disappointed people from the snake.
"Nobody tries to hurt anybody," said Martin.
You're all in safe.
Tickets for the Global Citizen Festival Concert made it free every year in the Internet.

Press freedom: Federal Government defends the publication of journalists
Government speaker Steffen Seibert has defended the outcome of a journalist from the press conference by Kanzler Angela Merkel (CDU) and the Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdoğan.
In Canzleramt, the Turkish journalist, who lived in Hamburg, had a T-shirt with the Turkish and German account "Freedom for Journalists" and was taken into the first series.
The T-shirt, if it wasn't the problem, said Shebert the image on Sunday.
It was about a deterioration of the end of the press conference.
By the action of the journalist, it was a strong disappointment that was not acceptable.
That's why he's going to make people protected the man out.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Office.
This applies completely independent of whether it is a right concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists are in prison.
Many of them are designed for pleasant sponage activities or support or membership in prohibited parties or the fethullah juvenile movement.
The Turkish leadership is responsible for the movement of the slaughtered slaughter on July 15, 2016.
One of the accused journalists threatened several decades of prison.
Foreign journalists are not safe before the Turkeyn authorities: first September, the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Lastly, the cases of the arrested journalists Messale Tolu and Deniz Yücel for Surveillance.

Munchen: Florian David Fitz fully strike with Ina Müller
So fresh and goodly know him his fans normally: Florian David Fitz.
You have to see that two times: Yes, this is really Florian David Fitz.
The favorite player was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The Talkshow produced by the NDR "In the night" is known for fellow conversations at the theke of the Hamburger Hafenkneipe "Skill fish posts".
Moderatorin Ina Müller with its guests is cut on some beer, some wine or even high-percenter drinks to lock the stimulation and teeth.
There are no few promises to drink for the binding plants.
On Friday, another result of the popular Talks show was recorded.
This time: The shooter of Florian David Fitz is known by films like "Manners", "terror - your judgment" or "The Latest Day".
The Municher went to the high north, but it wasn't good.
On Saturday he posted a sealfie - his face is fully surrounded at night, the eyes only two little shoes.
The bed-sell shows a completely excited Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick. He's just got a powerful castle.
To his fans he posted some - probably not very serious - knowledge that he now won: "Regel ones: NIE goes to Inas night.
Rule 2: never drink the black sau.
And Spritz.
And the rounds of eggs, the Ina rounds around half three, let me go.
The alcohol consumption is actually written to the 43-year-old man in the face.
His fans just posted a few tips to fight the goal.
They were rich from instant browns, fish browns or - most likely the most sweet - head paintables.
Others simply admired the view of the normally attractive cinesters.
As Ina Müller has survived the evening place, it is not known until now.
Since she modernizes the TV space on the theke, but since 2007, the 53-year-olds seems to be significantly tried...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight Vandalism and Unrat
The increase in the 36-kilometer long road road in the Red shopland in Treysa is difficult to find and misleading.
Receptes against the grassing vandalism are searched, but solutions are few.
Cigarette kitchens, mould and unrat, demolated muleimers and medium-widespread demonstrated indicators - this is represented from the length of the increment of the seat group to the radway on the hair's bone in Treysa.
For the preview of Bahnradweg in the Red Cappchenland, a more than an incredible view.
However, the theme is employed by members of the ADFC Group Schwalmstadt, as the Radweg Officer of the city Ulrich West Hagen.
The problem has already been addressed in the Radio Transport Council.
There is no solution to do it until now.
The proposals were sufficient from the shifting of the seat group to the regular reducing of the residues and the cleaning of the surfaces at the incremental site.
"I think the last time would be the order of the hour - independent of possible further activities", says the wilderness.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports to have also introduced the topic in the local council.
Not only the mould takes radars and inhabitants - the seat group is on weekends to celebrate regularly.
This is not only often called, with the plants is also destroyed: phoses left out of the earth, smoothed sleeves, switched switch, sit mublons.
Volunteers had already been more frequently dreamed, reported ADFC-member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are only the speaking troops on the warm stone.
They're hungry that the racing place on the road in Treysa is a train point for the shooting.
"When the whole radway is clearly the grave point of the Haashee heavy is here", confirms the Rad Transport Officer, which now provides for the new rail station in Ziegenhain, which is now opened.
"Let them the same skill, it's going to be precise."
Another idea is a video supervisory on the hill: "That might make the level significantly higher to attack the assembly.
This would, however, prevail that there will be a police target.
First of all, the desert has a desire to develop the hair bird.
It should be more attractive.
With the frequencies of the railway until now, you can be very satisfied.
The tourist marketing is still developable.
Our radway is very valuable, compared to others in Germany," said the ADFC members.
As a extremely critical dangeral place, the ADFC member Susane Klippert considers the situation in the asheride street in Treysa.
There's no shoes on the hair's bird.
It explains that rail drivers have to wait on the road between the two-way trail flows," it explains.
This is not a problem for sports drivers, but for elders and especially for children.
Music Contests in the Cultural Railway: "Kö de Hilltrup" and the sea
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and together.
"D offering a song for Hiltrup" means the apple of the city's participative Hilltrup, in the "Music Content for Great and Small, Youth and Experienced musician."
A composite "with eye winners in the sympathical helper family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family with coffee and kitchen from the honourable officials of the Cultural Court.
Seven formations were taken from the One-Mann band to the great Summit: Alvin Jasic with Pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitarre, Rolf Ihmig, a long in Hiltrup lived alwaters, the nine of the "Hiltraper star colors", three members and three generations of the family Trenbox and Claus, one of the children's gardens, and finally Rike Wesling and the zirty.
This Content, thus declared by the citizensman Joachim Schmidt, is a newness.
We haven't experienced this in other cities.
What were the texts linked?
In the places, the Hiltruper Sea and the market halls were particularly viewed.
Rolf Ihmig urged the only one in his magnificent song to "Kö de Hilltrup".
It was also acknowledged by the Cultural Railway Court.
Once again, it was about the experience of each other in these places, especially at Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke gave the short rebuilding pauses with short interviews with the interviews or instructions on their sheep.
This is how you learned from Humberg that he actually studied chemicals, but now he also taught guillars.
From the Tontechnician Stefan Schemmelmann, Franke knew that the recent event was in Ludwig Chafen - on a great event of the BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has plated all the hands on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," said Franke.
In fact, all participants have a gift from the Hiltruper Gastronomia.
However, for the favorites of the Jury there was something special for others to hear their songs.
A whole CD can play Alvin Jasic and his Pianist Marcel Untied with tontechnic Schemmelmann.
Additional musicians can take a song: Similarly with his hillground slaughter, which France particularly impressioned with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "A very nice adventure" with ten children and two scientists in guitarre and Cajon, Laura Castner and Lina Tölle.
Like all the children, at the end again - and even without electronic support, "really good", as Franke said.
In spite, the Jury was the originality of the aspects, reference to hiltrup, ingestness of the melodie and recognition value.
The jury belonged to Gisbert Keller from the Western Much School, Andreas Slomfaß of KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Economic Association and Jan Kaven, President of the City Participative.
The city's participatory had called the event from a ten-year-old existence in life.
She valued the event as full success.
All were "very satisfied," and "the atmosphere was good" in the very full cultural train court immediately.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game network
The players form two teams that are against each other.
For each side there is a view screen, there are four cards with key words that you can just divide - the old trick with the red folie - when you have cut it into.
Thus it is guaranteed that the side can not read anything from perception.
On the card, for example, it is read from the left to the right: "1. Renaissance.
2. Window.
3. Würfel.
4. Festival."
These are the terms to encrypt it.
Because it should be recommended here not to be the terms, but to codes.
Unchanging a player per team is the crypter.
He gets a code card that may be "3.4.2".
In "Decrypto" the terms are not behind the secret sheet, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: he should - in this series and in this example - describe the terms "beauty", "Fest" and "Finster" - but so that his own team recognizes the correct series and the opposite team may not be possible; because it won the party when it comes to cut the code two times.
The encryptor therefore notes and reads: "Waren" for the desire, "Lose" as a contrary; here, of course, would also be something like "Party" and "Prag" because he has adjusted in the school and knows the window tour.
So it's the round, the team for the team.
Although you don't know the terms of the side, but this can be better combined with any reference that the cryptor has there.
Maybe mystery, but not to turn the records should therefore be, otherwise it is unnecessary to its team.
The most critical of "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rule.
The players will probably have to study it right long and detailedly until they can finally play.
The statement video under decrypto.info in the network makes it easier.
But whoever has ever cut up will be fascinated as much feelings in this unlike game.
However, the total "Decrypto" is not very slightly as translators and Genre "Codenames", which also strikes a agency thematic on a game less words, but it is much better to play in small groups.
And whoever it goes around rates and not about winpoints, it can easily find a version for two.
Kumbach: Man shows the police of Hitler and endorsed guests in the kitchen
A 48-year-old man, the police inspection, Kulbach, was doubled on Sunday night.
First, he showed Hitler's grief in the upper city of an advanced police team, and then he went to the top city in a snake when he shocked other guests.
After he did not clearly alcoholize the given place by the police, he had to move the night at the police inspection of Kulbach in the prison cell.
In a useful state, he must then be criminally responsible because of the use of signs of constitutional organizations.
Operation work Pressig was home of the Schublocks
The station work in Pressig was the shooter in Frankenwald for decades.
1991 ended a part of the rail train history.
"When the puffer was puffed, you heard it all in Pressig," said Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station court.
That didn't make anybody stop.
That's where the brems were shocked and the waggons shooted.
It was clean.
Exhibitions that are sensitive for Dinkels home Pressig.
There was nowhere in Frankenwald that place was printed through the rail trains.
Here was the starting point of the division railway to the north, which has an increase of about 220 meters of height in stonebach on the forest.
In order to control this, previous train and shublocks were needed to have their home in Pressig.
1901 the Bayerian Landday authorized the construction of a station workshop with 21 places, educational workshops, guidance and train meistery.
"The cart was the driving shoes that had a diameter of 18 meters after a 1899 reconstruction," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, Bahnhistoriker and 47 years of professional trains.
From rail operation (BW) Pressig, founded in 1968 Bamberg, were also employed loks for the side lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigstown - Leheste, Stockheim - Sunneberg and Kronach - northern half.
On July 15, 1950, the "Folksblatt" reported by a 160-man's staff file; 13 Dampf and eight Elloks were then stationed in Pressig.
The electricalization of the 1939 routes has already minimised the need for train and shublocks.
Since 1977, they were only used for goods.
By 1991, at least 10 000 hours were ranged in the month.
1982 parts of the operation work, 1991 of the rest were deleted.
Heidrich: "It's regret that you have not taken better use of the location, even in puncto goods, into the eye."
The Nürnberg Railway Directory for Nürnberg was a 50-year-old-old-year-old-old-leading station party in Pressig.
"There were 10,000 spectaculars here", remembered Georg Dinkel.
You're going out later.
On 1 June 1991, the last 30 men were deleted, the Rangerbahnhof Pressig was history.
"The ringers and shooters injured the most difficult works in the road", remembers Dinkel.
Each missing had had a fatal impact.
Why the Pressig-Rothen Church has led to the rotation of the Hierarchie of the two places and many other historical and current images are here in the infra-Plus article.

A little surprising, but the hair announced his return some days ago.
With Tania Angelke and Kurt Newbauer, he put his task in safe, young hands with a good future perspective.
Both in the past have been active in the selection of the artist and have been communicated with Flyer.
In this year there is also one of them designed 70-cent special letters, available at each art station.
This year poster can also be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn welcomes the high right of the special exhibition.
For the musical environment, Max Marcus Stadler was winned from Nürnberg.
In the Gang through the great garden, the visitor is quickly clear that the title "Wind game performance" requires the artistic phantasie and finally expresses it.
It's artificial works of metal or keramic, often sweet with sweet acents.
Ready at the start of the presence, the visitors will expect to be on the right side of the "Glucks tree" by the artist Werner Baur, Ezenau.
It is a tree sleeves, swimmingly, playing with 20 winters, 24 swimming pools and 24 alu roues as a swimming snake.

Why didn't you ever cut it with the men?
Because I wanted too much.

Unfortunately, this vision is not daily.
I've come too much to love."

As they condemned an officer at Mark Nobel's path, they remained all the players of Manchester, and Arnautovic left all the time in the world to shoot the ball on the helpless David de Gea.

VW-marks lacked: Pariser carroom in the character of the Tel-Debat
The Pariser Car Room is located every two years in changing with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - officially no theme, but indeed: The Telsscandale and the rings for driving bans and rents should not leave the German car concerts at the shopping camps in Paris.
During the car hall 2018, they show their news together with the competition from all the world in the French capital city from the next week.
This is not really a major role in this.
However, the possible advertising and rebuilding offers for such owners in Germany, which should still be negotiated with the government in Berlin, should be a important subject at least behind the magnificent cultures of the measles.
A great name lacks in Paris: The people's car concerts are with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the nuclear brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes are there and are among others their first clean electronic models: the e-tron of the Ingoal City will be on the market end of the year, the EQC of the 2019 Stuttgarter.

Holiday offering celebrates great festivities: After the apple, the milk comes
And also at the actual day of action, Borish was active.
She supplied her hungry guests with fresh prepared apples.
Great interest also tried Georg Hartmann-Nimmerg.
He had his apple pressure in the pocket and demonstrated his wonderful spectacle step for step the process of the riff apple to the apple seat.
Then, when and when Hartmann-nimerred the field to the children and left them to fill the legs in the large crowds.
With a little muscle power, it became a fine cut-up mass from the powders.
Of course, many of the children couldn’t imagine how to be a smooth drink.
However, this important labour was also able to look at this late Friday.
In shapes packed and rounded by nets, Georg Hartmann-nimerg shooted a little like a shock-gooth shock for each other.
Thanks to a certain technical support, the latter lack of work has not been so difficult.
The fresh pressed skin went after and after a big shoe.
However, the farmer also had completed specialities.
So he opened his "Chatzbox" and presented the elderly visitors to the new Federations.
The question of the good troop "Made in Fire Orf" was great accordingly.

1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season device: "Reasonable situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Federal Liga shipping, trainer André gathered his enthusiasming professional by Hannover 96 to speak to be courageous to them.
There were many positives to not see at 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Francfurt.

The further seglon niedersachsen, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) has been connected, are fully below with two dentists and are a candidate of derogation in their current Constitution.
Instead, Frankfurt held the first stage squad before Rebic.

Kroatiens Vice World Meister Rebic was almost involved in every dangerous opening of the heavy, and has never been obtained by Hannover Abwehr in the griff.
The long-trained storr showed with his time and ability to implement, why it is so valuable for consideration.
Besides Rebic, also the Brazilian Allan, exhibited by the FC Liverpool, was the first time in the initial formation of Frankfurters who began weakly.
One on the tornet of Luca Torró (17.) was the first time risked.
Six minutes later, Sebastien Haller was stopped in so many positions in the last moment from the 96th-abduce to the Brazilian Felipe, which replaced Kevin Winner (Rocks).
The leadership for the households was almost pregnant and full.
Philip Kostic hob the ball after a swimming edge in the strand, Haller extended by head before the gate where Ndikka was only needed to keep the foot.
It was the first federal ligator for the second-leading players in the summer of the French AJ Auxerre.
And Frankfurt was on the pause.
This time Haller passed on his storm partner Rebic, who was acquainted with 96-Torwart Michael Esser didn't leave an opportunity.
In half-time, Hannover Coach Broadman reacted to the weak idea of his 11th and brought two new open forces in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydendt.
The Niedersaches now played something more mutious after previous, sinful ideas, however, remained unexpectedly before the end of the end.
The hexes were more effective.
After a nice hour, Rebic started a Solo and then set on De Guzmán, who had to shoot the ball only into the empty gate.
The rest was only looking for the Frankfurts against overwhelmed guests, and Jovic also found a minute before the end.

Germany: Severely condemned differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of the unity, the SPD president Manuela Schwesig called on all country offices to not depart from Eastern Germans.
There are differences that suffer about 30 years of unity.
With these differences, we should not be satisfied," said the President of Mecklenburg's Chambers to "day levels on Sunday".
The objective should remain to create equal relationships throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that Eastern German worked more long than people in Western Germany, but 15 per cent less content.
"I can explain anyone about 30 years after the German Unit," said Shreig.
North Korea: Does this crazy dog end the Korean conflict?
The one year of Pensionan Jagdhund is to celebrate the residence between the two Koreans.
In order to defeat the relationships with Seoul, Pjöngung has given the South Korean President Moon Jae in two North Korean Pungenan-Jagdunds a gift.
As Moons office reported on Sunday, the two dogs reached around one year their recipients on Thursday.
Then they occurred the border place of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog feeds to facilitate the animals the "Incondition".
The dogs with the white floor, divided ears and brain eyes are as loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural goal of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The friendship work announced the North at the third summit this year between Moon and the North Korean Machthaber Kim Jong One in Pjöngang in the middle of September.
In addition, both countries also agreed with the international sports fighting, such as the Olympic Games 2020, together for the interpretation of the Olympic Games in 2032.

Austria's moved history in the scene of 99 documents
What is Austria?

New week, new opportunity for the government
Back to work - so the inoficious moto is for the starting night of the Great Coalition.
An interview, a little speech in which the officers and their ministers from CDU, SPD and even from the CSU have not recently sweared the "ruckkehr for Sachwork".
This may have brought some handworkers, doctors, casierers and other general citizens in this country to the right question, which is actually the difference between work and work, but it is it.
If the federal government is now so far to resolve its task - the government -, it should not be held with a definitive debate.
If the Union and the SPD are still able to move something together in the last few weeks, it will be possible to show the Monday.
In the evening, the spectrums of the Government party to the Coalition Committee will be together.
Cancer Angela Merkel now will regularly call this round to develop conflicts early; a teacher from the whole struggle.
First of all, however, there are conflicting topics on the agenda with the such approaches and the Special Inmigration Act.
The CSU deputy Scheuer wants to allow the autoconcerns with retail premiums switching out the manufacturer's responsibilities for the technical equipment of older essel.
While a approach has been made in the same crisis over the weekend, the Union and the SPD are still different in the planned immigration law.
The SPD requires a reliable perspective for rejected asylum applicants who work or training.
The Union is strictly against the "scanning" from the asylum system in the labour market.
So it will be re-interference among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
It is not equal to GroKo, but three partners with very different social images and priorities.
The war is good.
Without the struggle, one of the so many, including opposite interests does not come forward.
However, in order to be constructive, the strict cannot be rebuild again by partitatic reasons for its own or non-profit.
It's still about policy, not the theatre.
The Union and the SPD are to strive - however, people's life-efficacy has always been viewed.
What is skilled and useful?
With this guideline, both the steel and the switch fraction can be pragmaticly clarified - and, so, trust.
In particular, this is the need for the peoples to fight now.
Pilz checks working time at Hartinger
Minister of Vision
Is the Minister of Employee infringement against the existing service law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to look at this.
"Only day and night" would have worked on the social insurance reform, reported an overwhelming social minister at the presentation two weeks ago.
In the list-Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger, the statement of Beat Hartinger Kline (FPÖ) is surprising - she now brings the matter through the question of Parliament.
She said: "If the Minister only wants to express its enthusiasm on the use of their teams and, in any case, pronounced violations against the existing service law before the launching cameras."
However, she has now questions to be free of speaking from any suspect.
The police goes on a street to search for women's bodies
MarxGreen - Lange, the police did not want to express it.
Now there is a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, on the state streets between Naila and Baths are entered.
The route is locked in the Marx Green area until Monday.

But before it comes to Krawaln.
The separators have not forgotten the police use of spring 2017.
Barcelona - Kurt prior to the catalanic Independence Referendum of 1 October 2017, it has arrived in the centre of Barcelona to communicate between separators and police.

Six persons have been arrested, 24 more were easily damaged, as the authorities were called professionally.
On Monday, the referendum of independence is first time.
The Central Government in Madrid Catalonia was under administration in the early 2017 after the vote and a decision on the dismissing of the well-being region of Spain.
The former regional President Carles Puigdemont flew to Exil to Belgium.
Other politicians also moved to the foreign.
However, several ministers of the regional government and other sectorists of the separator movement continue to be held in U-Haft.
In December, new choices were held in the region.
After the official accession of the new Catholic Government in May, the pregnancy administration was completed.
But also the new regional President Quim Torra is the "the right to self-determination" of the Catalyans.
Football: Oberlink Westfalen: Common shortness: FC Goodsloh and RW Acels separate toLos
Red-weishealth continues to go on the place.
Also, at the FC goodsloh it was only a 0:0 decision.
The final light and the third ones were assembled by 438 observers in the homewald stadium as a assembled slightlessness.
The first half was overviewable by the maintenance factor arg.
Hence, someone who would like to take a bird or a breast could do so unfortunately.
It was not the danger to stop a torment because there was no practice.
First shot after a half hour
For the first (harmless) tower of the whole party, Nick Flock was responsible for the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle only real - the electioners had the possibility, than Cihan Yilmaz FCG-Torwart Frederic Westergerling after 32 minutes with a shock of the radial limits from a parade.
The guests were more harmless.
Their most effective action was in an early channel.
Stormer Lars Schröder had to be extraordinarily shocked, for him Sinan Ay Bene.
After the changing, both teams decided to do something against the growing length.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Multzel was 18 meters away from the swimming pool and after a hour the goods of the first time appeared.
After a baller of Matthaus Wieckowicz, it was fixed.
The accurately proposed account about Sinan Ay Bene "krönte" Nick Flock (62.) with a low shoot in the arm of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
They also met with a headball of Wieckowicz (66.) after a ball of the ex-collector Tim Manstein.
RWA interinstitute Angelo Daut first gave Marko Helicka to Martin Fuhsy (60.) and a little later Ene Southey for Sebastian Mutzel (70.).
It did - nothing.
More than optical overcome, thanks to the own initiative, the actors did not have to be allowed.
First in 91 minutes, Cihan Yilmaz had the last opportunity, but they did not have anything.
Angelo Daut tried to explain the positive: "I think we've played at zero." But unfortunately, the null was also standing before.
"We were not as dangerous as we had to do with wood and that our enemy had no joy to play here", observed RWs Interimstrateer.
Openly "platting everything like a bit" against a team, "what just wanted to defend.
In any case, I didn't feel that we could get a opposer," says the end.
However, as a observer, he did not feel as if his team could shoot a door.
It was necessary for this.
Reckenfelder market Thanksgiving: Successfully there are enough surrounders
This welcomes Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the cocktail table exhibition, for which these fees are determined.
The Honour officials assured: "These costs remain in the rear field."
On opening the heavens showed slightly blue, but the place still was empty, but this should still change during the day.
Because: "Here it's so nice, so we are here today", said a visitor.
The organizer of the festival of Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl Outfit as always with a general prize Humor.
For the husband Brockmann, who should actually be covered against food, short-term Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer.
The Verena (Women of Ferdi Kreimer) has become sick.
But there's enough Kreimers.
And the "component" did not take it, inter alia, to maintain the most important visitors.
This was so good that at a later time some people were communicated.
"Everything good," Marcel circumcised.
Major Peter Vennemeyer could put the date of opening this time in his agenda.
He enjoys the many activities with its places, including overwhelming.
"It shouldn't first give it something like a table," he said, however, for the action of the men's chore.
Andreas Hajek pleaded the use of all those in the places and also engaged the other festivals held in September and the "Clean up" action.
Our garden city has a good angry - what's going on here.
Then, the Mayor of Georg Knorr and Gerd cloud was taken with the shooter of fire and put into the winterquarter.
In many parts, it was worked for the physical well-being.
From sweet to heart was to have everything.
Stefan Hagemayar, who lives since one year in Reckenfeld, was creative in his decuperation.
Fournier work, bierckel with reckenfelder reasons and some more he had in the offer.
A speciality offered three reckenfields Imker: "Reckenfelder Hong", composed of Maria-Theresia Smoolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth buss.
The last appointment has still a speciality.
Honey cubes in glass, of course with honey from my own production.
When the small Elsa had to go back, the cup was so well smelled.
The severeness is that the visitors have left long until night hours, even without a swimming program that does not exist at the birthday.
Skills with local political message: No successful advertising for skate
In Lengerich, unbeknown persons have obtained unfavourably a way to build a skate plant.
In several places, Jürgen Kohne says that the WN is demanding the WN.
At least one case, the police has been sentenced for injury.
In large letters the three words "Skatepark for Lengerich" were shown on shields, among others.
Michael Rottmann, the manager of the Halle, reports that after the professional wave site, on September 19, a corresponding post on the advertising certificate was discovered at the start of the camp office.
Since the short message of this time is apparently left "only" with an edition, they have been able to be removed unfairly.
"And a few days later, then it was back, this time," says Rottmann.
He believes that this provision is to be replaced.
A particular note is just understood in this case by calling several large companies from Lengerich on the table.
If the skate plant is built, the realisation is also required by sponsors.
It is already required to explain Jörg Hesselmann from the city's school, sport and culture without name.
But it may be possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical with those undertakings that are on the table.
Since years, local policies and management have been employed with the Skatee topic.
After the older LWL clinic was decreased, some time after some, searching for an Alternative Stand began.
The Council finally expressed himself for the fire park.
Instead, it was not - to many factors, apparently spoke against a construction in this place.
In the end of June, a magistrate follows.
The members of the main and financial committee now voted unilaterally for the Gutenberg School's area.
Jürgen Kohne says, in the state of things, that the management is at the midst of the concrete planning.
The last word has the city Council.
It takes a decision this year, so that it could be built with a positive vote 2019.
Engpass of air security is worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European aircraft chaos in summer, German flights do not see signs for improvement in the coming year.
"In this year we had winds, 2019, we will have a strong wind and then come to the storm," said the head of the Air Safety Office, Matthias Maas, the German Presse Agency before the aircraft at Hamburg on 5 October.
A major reason for the numerous passes and aircraft accidents is the long known staff notes for European aircraft safeguards, for which it does not provide a fast solution.
"The airlines and the airports can achieve rapid improvements for the next year, but the training of new lots is from four to five years," said the employees.
Europe is being empowered by the market for completely trained lots.
Only in the centre of Karlsrure for supervision of the top German airspace lacked around hundreds of people.
Maas again criticized that different air transport companies were not invited to the hill.
On Friday, the representatives of the State, the countries, the security of the aircraft, the airlines and the airports are together in Hansstad, in order to reach the causes of losses.
"If you want to speak about additional labour dispensation and overtimes, it will not go without us," the head of the GdF, who has many members at the firm German flight insurance.
Maas was again responsible for the Commission for the Lotsen Mixer.
The transport prognoses for the period runing up to 2019 have been too low.
The expenditure and staff costs from the national aircrafts are now fully carried out on the operational business.
Maas called to the Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU), to set up in Brussels for arrangements, which "is not yet depressed the air".
Today, the EU rules would agree to 2024 and should be afraid of further confusions.
The EU has been constantly issued by the airlines.
"Ryanair Chief Michael O'Leary and his colleagues now received exactly what they have seen in the last few years," said Maas.
He hopes that the high delay costs in the airlines have been rounded.
The GdF will affect the improvement of the situation only if the German flight security (DFS) offers a "compulsory training and future package", Maas said.
The upset of 120 lots students for the next five years is just expensive in order to compare the older decreases.
The necessary staff construction is not yet connected.
Thyssen-group Advisory Council of Concertation
The members of the Thyssen Group Council have voted unilaterally for the plans for reconstruction of the concert.
Following the will of Thyssenkrupp Interim Chief Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed at the Sunday Chairman's meeting, the critical concerts will be dismissed in two self-employed companies.
Both companies should have their seat in food and be noted at the office.
It is not necessary to give it an additional staff decrease on the already known burdens in the management.
After two retreats, the control body is only eight heads on the capital side.
10 representatives of the employees are against.
However, the final decision should take a main Assembly for 2020.
The new thyssen group materials AG should include the 50% share of the fusioned steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second group of Thyssen Industrial AG, the business is intended to be engaged with reliefs and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence in the Demos of Police and Catalan Independence.
In two temporary demonstrations of Spanish police and Catholic independence speakers in Barcelona, it has given violent interferences with numerous losses.
According to the city administration, about 3000 police gathered from all Spain, as well as about 6000 demonstrators of independence.

What's horrible, how terrible is that?
That's so unpresidian.
But he cares that little, explained trumpet, and urged his twins to the human dimensions: "I've always told you that it's so simple to be prestigious."
But then there would be 10,000 people out there in this beach filled area, but we would have been only 200 people out there.

Peite at Hertha: Required from Reality: Buyers against Ajax requested
The predicty is unfair: the shock in Berlin wants to "non delay the FC Bayern".

The FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its loop-size man-gegen tactics and the Berliners through their player nadeltics over the outside have provided two blue breaks within three days, as the last over-perceived mountains are sweet.
"They who know the FC Bayern know that we don't let it and we'll do everything so that we can't be successful again", emphasize Kovac.

"Yes, that's a good thing," the national player said.
It's good for the liga.

We had to defense the measure, I always said.

"When an unimmigration-based background clearly affects society and football, and says, "The issue is important, where we need to care for us," it would also be an initiative to ensure that our skins should be better based on the place where integration must work", said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the WM-Aus and the Özil-Affer in the next year, he wants to re-advise the office as President of the DFB.

When I learned from the Tsunami, I made me back to Sulawesi immediately.
I arrived on Sunday morning, because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, since the airport was closed to Palu at the time.
How is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport, so that it could also be able to fly with aid.
When I came, I saw the houses on the coast that all have been completely destroyed.

Also, a prison was destroyed, the prisoners spend partly on free and the search is difficult for them.
There are still many bodies, many people have not been found and are missed.

Do you have information about it?
We don't know the reasons, but when the warning came, many thought "Okay, no Tsunami" - and then he came.

Isn't a island like Sulawesi that is on the patient fire prepared for earthquakes?
But every day there's a earthquake, but this was the worst thing here.
We usually know how we react on earthquakes and train evacuations.
But the complete infrastructure is cut together, the earthquake has taken a lot of people.
