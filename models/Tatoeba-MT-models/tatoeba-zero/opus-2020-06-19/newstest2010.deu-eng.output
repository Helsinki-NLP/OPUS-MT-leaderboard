Barack Obama receives the nobel price as fourth President of the United States
The American President Barack Obama comes to Oslo, Norway, for 26 hours, to spend here as the fourth President of the history of the peace nobel price.
He also receives the diploma and the medailles and a check of $1,4 million for its extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The chief of the White House comes tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the Northweg Metropole and will be busy all the time.
First, he will take a visit to the Nobel Institute, where he first joined the five members of the Committee, who selected him in October 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple then planned a meeting with the Norwegian King Harald V. and King Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its highlighting point with the ceremony, which obama takes the press price.
This is obtained as the fourth President of the United States, but only the third who takes the price directly to the office.
The White House has already advertised that Obama will be talking about the price of the Afghan war.
The President does not want to exempte this topic because he knows that he takes the price as a President that leads to two countries in the time of war.
The war efforts have been strengthened by the expulsion of other wars to Afghanistan some days ago, which has not been forgotten by any of its critics.
In the ceremony, Obama also received the Golmedaille, the diploma and the scene over ten million Swedish chrones (c. 24 million Czech chrones).
The money is intending to make good purposes, but on a concrete caritative work he has not decided.
The event programme will then present a banket with the President and his wife, which will also be attended by the Prime Minister and another 250 guests, except the king of Norway.
Obama was very retained from the beginning of the price.
In particular, he found that he felt that he did not get the price completely.
In addition, he repeated that it was not only the price for him, especially for all those who seek the same values as he.
Soon after the advertising, he pointed out that this is "related to act".
Natural protector is accused of pressing
The Leitmeritz-Polizei accused the President of the Citizens Organization "National Protection Community Leitmeritz" for pressing.
In several cases, he introduced professionals against some construction procedures last year, for the delay of his professionals, he requested money from the investors to his profits, said the Leitmeritz Police speaker, Alena Romova.
The President of the Directorate-General's Natural Protection Community Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in prison and it threatens him to a prison punishment of up to three years.
The sorter molding containers in bruns do not rise good
In Praga, people can sort drinking packs, in the Southern Mediterranean places, they will be found on step and tried the sortier plulcontainer.
And in green?
There should be a few minutes to find the suitable milk tons.
I don't want to say that the disappearing in Brussels would never work.
But I am thinking if the Councils are inadequate to care for this problem, even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brann is situated in the residues in the Urwaldliga, not only because we are as citizens here in the sphere containers always to solve papers, glass and materials, but especially through the number of mushrooms for such wastes.
Have they ever tried in the center, for example, to resolve the PET flat in a collection cart?
This is like art, before all, it needs time and strong nerves.
The only place I've found up to now is the shooting place towards the slaughtered gans.
Mr Kaika, his colleagues should not be hungry, but that's too little to me.
Unlike the detergence in other parts, it is not a shock in other parts.
The whole series of my friends aren't going out the disappearing.
Of fault.
Indeed, it is too far to them.
I'm not surprised.
I've offered myself after the party to discover a few glass and plastic flashes.
But on the Conicova Strasse, I haven't seen a color compound tones in view.
Happily, I came to the right place to the road.
But the mould is almost over.
This is still the center of Brann, where the whole city is represented, isn't it?!
However, ecology and any kind of ecologicals probably allows the Brazilian socialists to fry.
You love the city to buy an eishockeyliga that makes us harm in the whole Republic, instead of buying more than a few milk tons and offer other substances for a more cleaner flowers.
I am glad I could also confirm my acceptance with official statistics after I searched for a while on the Internet.
According to the data of the ECO-COM society, Brussels is really the worst in the whole region of Southern Sea.
The 'Parroubek' budget has deleted the money for pensions and hospital payments
In spite of the view of the Government, the farmers and officials had more money, there is no more money for loss, hospital payment and construction parking in the budget.
But not even for State debt or international courts.
This causes further problems that will be at the government in the second half of the next year, says the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota.
When social democracies and communists have implemented the increase in some groups, they calculate that the government pays the money for the ad hoc expenditure, alternatives or for the hospital payment. "This is only a decrease of the problems in the future, mines", says Janota.
The creditors are closely payed higher interests, and the money must be refunded at once.
To choose where the State case is empty.
If the social services or costs for the State business are not reduced, taxes should be increased.
For all whom the left party has now given more money: the fire, the teachers, the farmers.
And later for their children.
To lose the pensions or the hospital payment from which accounts have lost 1,8 billion, people don't have to be afraid that they get this money.
But to the price that the State has more debt - in the next year, in the state case, it will not only miss 163 billion, but much more.
Despite the efforts of the Minister Janota, the debt will grow so faster and the costs and interests together with them.
The State will need the money for compensation, and then it will no longer be sufficient to increase the multi-value tax, or to reduce the maternity payment, as the government has made in its counter-deficit package.
In the following year, five billion dollars are missing for the development of cars and rail trains.
This is, however, the sections gained in the competition that can't be projected and eventually able to be obliged.
At least receive what is not free.
This means the interruption of 30 major construction works, threatening also the European land creature, warnings of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed to solve the impact of money salmonically - it is the CEZ sharers in which the State owner of the majority is, and then the money will be shooted into the transport funds.
The problem is that the height of the divident never is safe and it is no matter an infinite source.
Last year, from CEZ to the budget of 18 billion.
Any year, the dividents are paid the environmental liquidations, the pension account filled, and the money also serves as a reservation for the planned pension reform.
This trick also increases the actual budget deficit on the Nieveau of 5,7% of the EU rules.
But this does not end the carnival of the conversions.
Nearly three billion were the budget for various deteriorations for victims of communism and of criminals or for judiciary injuries, even for the buildings.
If the State is right without this money, it is not sure.
That's a clean luck game.
If we lose an international courtship, we must pay it as well, Janota makes it clear.
The Minister must then abolish the money within or in the worst case, the government budget reserves.
A number of millions have also lacked for the dual-millionary project, which is intended to monitor on lines, for which the individual authorities pay the money.
The first step starts in January.
If the financial ministers do not find the money anywhere different, the project should be cut and in this case sanctions come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will control two operating systems
The Americans receive for the future with a phone where the user can handle a single key between different operational systems by pressing the user.
The plans proposed are very promising.
It is enough to press only a key, and from Windows mobile will be less than in seconds in the Android changing.
This option is to propose the American society VMware, especially focusing on the development of the virtual software for the computer.
We allow you to execute two user profiles simultaneously on the phone.
You can switch between these, they can switch them into two home and work profiles.
Both works parallelly, Mrs. Krishnamurti declared VMware's company at the interview for the Magazine Computer world.
It was presented in November the last year and submitted for the first time a few days ago.
The market will come in 2012.
The Virtualization of the Smart Phone is not a fiction.
VMware has successfully introduced the Smartphone test template with two operational systems.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM player of 128 MB, which delivered parallelly the systems mentioned in Windows Mobile and Android.
The development of the new technologie for mobile phones is in full way.
Now the VMware company works together with the European and American operators at the smartphone-generation and to customers, the devices should come within 2012.
Sneaklessness on the mountains covers the hotel owner
Sneeless pests are not only worried about the residents.
The lacking snake is horrible to the people by ordering the ski residences in hotels and pensions.
This is why you can still receive free rooms in the Riesenberg for all winter terms, including Christmas and Silvesters.
Our pages are often visited.
People go to the offers, set the prices, but there are fears of ordering binding.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if our opinion is to be on the snee of this year's Christmas feast or on "match", the operators of the informationport Spindl Info, Martin Jandura, took it.
Who wants the silvester housing in the skin mould exactly according to his ideas, the order should not be shocked.
Who prefers the spring and where the quality of the stay is only on the second place, he can try to wait for a few days.
The spindel mould hotel owner offers the Silver Day only a weekly stay.
I think they're gonna try to sell them for a while, but then they've got to show, and they're in a shorter time.
And then the free rooms will swim, Jandura estimated.
Free beds at all winter terms always offer the travel office in Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now, most of us are interested in Christmas nights that are not yet sold.
In our offer, about half of the places are still free.
Thus, we have already prepared a few more precious Christmas stays for the last moment, the director of the travel office Ingtours, Petr Schifert.
The Silvesterday in Riesenberg can also offer the Frchlabi travel office, but there are less free places here.
Good paragraphs also find the first fourty days in February, the remaining winter terms are sold averagely.
In this year, the interest in winter stays is also negatively affected by the shadow in ricanebirds.
People's waiting for sneaking.
No one wants to pass the year end into the mountains without darkness.
If the kids are destroyed within a week, the Christmas will also be sold, I mean Schifert.
Currently and something better than last year it gets to use the hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We're up to five percent better than in the past year.
On Thursday and Christmas, we only have some free rooms.
There is great interest in the Poland holidays in Janua, and in February the business will be good, informed the director of the best Pec Hotel, Karel Rada.
The Hotel Omnia is also located at the centre park in Janske Lazne at 80 percent for silvester stays.
Nevertheless, at Christmas in the latest hotel in Janske Lazne, the half of the beds is free.
We were surprised in this year of January, for which we have already been placed at about 60 percent at time.
A little weaker in February, but at the moment, when the snow comes, it also increases the interest of staying in the resort area, leading to the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
At a larger neighborhood, the Riesenbergberg hotel owners were waiting at this time.
On Thursday, it should be coaled and if it comes to snakes, it should be on the mountains snee.
But then Jiri Jakubsky has to come back to warming from the location of the Czech Water Office in Hradec Kingove.
USA: Repeat is Mother of the Beauty
It is almost funny with which school strengy Barack Obama, the President, with his call of the flight, repeats the strategy of his stakeholders in the Afghan Group, which he himself took for the smile.
When he finally expected his sixth Afghan doctrin out of the Afghan doctrine, it showed that he stood the copy paper from the Bush-Irak scenario three years ago.
It is not only that he uses the speech type "come in Iraq" in the text itself, but also the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New Previous Travel" to be used without smiling.
He himself has sent the Bush-Idee - fresh war continent in the Iraqi posted by civil war three years ago - criticized as "unresponsable and in their follow-up Karastrophical decision".
The following months, however, showed that the only possible and very successful Bush strategy by military recommendations had been that today you were not talking about Iraq's news.
The call Bush was not improved because objectively he left his followers a much more grateful starting situation as it was expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hoped that the miracle is repeated.
In order to shut up the troop continent, he again requested the militarys, especially the Supreme Commander of the Afghan Operation General Stanley McCristal, who had a heart criticized despite the subordinating habits in the white house.
He requested 40,000 soldiers to change the situation to improve.
The President took three months, but not a better idea, so he had affected the General for a thousand soldiers.
From Europe he pressed the submission for more 5,000, even if he originally calculated at least 10,000.
The highest problem at the entire Obama strategy is its projects to delay the armies from Afghan in 18 months, and to end this process within three years. The whole Obama doctrine gives more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the half-up will bring the same effect as the measures in Iraq.
Despite the brotherhood of the last few years, the Iraqi community has been relatively well-structured, and its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation has been expressed by the contradiction - no one can be left and will not hold agreements.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces that are used to change their opinion every day.
The political institutions, even if they are formally founded correctly, remain only grain buildings behind which the patriarchal tribal relations will continue to be swallowed.
The balance of interest between the various ethnic groups is uncomplied, especially because of the incertitude of the relationships that continue to be complicated by Pakistan and Iran.
It is also very unrealistic to build a "transactionable State", which is the minimumist goal of the entire operation.
Time Horizon of Obama Strategy, drived by its voluntaryism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only been devastated and now it is at the random of the explosion.
So believe that the small soldiers who are broken in the war on the "Freeheimer" are a wonder here can only create a real romantic soul that can't be impressed by facts.
From the political view, the date set for the armed disappearance is purely inresponsive because the Taliban will take it as the indirect consciousness of the United States.
The last NATO meeting showed that the voluntary of Europeans to participate in the fights in Afghan is a nest.
Europe's politicians can and do not want to explain their elections how the security of Germany or Italy is associated with the war in Hindu-Bage Prevention.
Another possible factor that can affect the situation is the development of the events in Iran.
If the situation continues to disappear and the increased sanctions on Iran are not affected, the United States will be a very serious question whether the problem is not to solve wars.
This question must be answered during the period in the United States to Obama on the decline of victory from Afghanistan.
However, every solution is also a dramatic change in the Afghan situation.
The only conspicuous pool for Barack Obama is the fact that three years old to the presidential election, and therefore remains still enough to take it to another strategy, if it would be a total delay.
The managers of the Goldman Sachs don't receive premiumboni anymore in bar
The leading leadership forces of the American Goldman Sachs bank in this year do not receive preliemenboni in bar.
This has announced the company that reacts to the deep criticism of their reward practices.
A group of 30 spitzen managers is obtained instead of the money share that can only be sold in five years.
Furthermore, the shares may be deleted by the managers in the case when they act overly risking.
Goldman Sachs, according to the Agent Reuters, is to connect the premium of the Wall Street with a long-term performance.
I believe that the Wall Street is conscious of the continuing direction in which she had to go, the former bankers of JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott, reached.
The problem is in detail, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the goal of the criticism after she had made a contribution of almost $17 billion for the first three quarters of this year.
The total height of the premboni in this year will probably exceed the current measure of $20 billion after the Agency Reuters.
The high price boni in the bank sector has become the highest political theme at the beginning of the financial crisis in a number of countries.
In the afternoon, the United Kingdom reported that it was intended to spend the boni of the bankers over 25,5 pounds once with a tax of 50 per cent.
Similar steps are also prepared by France.
In this year, women win the nobel prices in all specialists, except in physical.
Five recruiters today have been in Stockholm from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI. Guests this year's nobel prices in the special categories and literature.
Besides the four scientists, there were also Romanian writers, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Price for Medicine has received two American biologists, Elizabeth Delta and Carol Greider, together with their countryman Jack Szostak for research in the Chromoson area.
The price for Chemicals, the Israeli Ada Jonath, together with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, has been obtained for the declaration of the Ribosom structure and function.
The last Laureatin was the Nobel Price for Economy, which received the American Elinor Ostrom and its countrymen Williamson for the analysis of the economic report.
The only special category in which the woman did not receive a nobel price in this year was physical.
This price today, the Scientist Charles Kao for the research in the glass Fassern Area and George Smith, together with Willard Boyle for the CCD CHIP design, which is the basis of all digital rams, fax devices or astronomic television.
Each of these prices has the diploma receiving the Nobel Medal and certificate on the purchase of the currency price.
This includes ten million Swedish chrones in each category.
If there are several prices in each category, the money price will be divided under them.
Traditionally, the American President, Barak Obama, has received the most expected peace nobel price in Oslo this afternoon.
He has recognized in his words the contrary of his name, because he is first at the beginning of his way, and also stands on the pit of the country that leads two wars - in Iraq and Afghan.
However, in respect of his policy, he added that wars are needed in certain situations to combat world peace, even if the price is high.
Mr. Janota's return, Klaus invited him to the Burg.
President Vaclav Klaus welcomes the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, who thinks about his stays in the Government, since he does not agree with the implementation of the State budget for the next year in the form of which it was released by the Mediterranean Assembly at midnight.
It is accepted that the budget and may also be the remaining of Janota in the cabinet will be the subjects of the freeday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the state deficit is too high, and the crisis of public finances continues to be developed.
On the meeting, the President informed Radim Ochvat.
About his other rests in his function Janota wants to negotiate on Monday with the Premier Jan Fisher.
The Czech Republic should have a deficit of 163 billion chrones after the budget, which is now subscribed by Klaus.
However, on mid-day, the Link Party proposals on monetary reimbursement were voted and the money for state officials increased in the maintenance of social services and agricultural direct solutions.
The Government has noted the proposals of social democracy to increase the budget deficit.
Among the left party on one side and to the Government, Klaus and the law party, on the other hand, there is a huge internal political strict, in which the questionnaire of the further work of the fishermen officer, at which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party were joined in spring.
The critics pointed out that the budget, as adopted by the Parliament, was practically liquidated the package of spar measures which had been implemented from the fishery government in the beginning and that, after their understanding, the debt of the State should be completed.
Claus, who is able to sign the State Budget Act, but must not have, today, at the debate with the employees, has denied the "external problem", the "insufficient deficit" of public finances for more time.
His view is that there is no good solution today.
A improvement could only lead to a strong government that can still build a broader consensus of the political parties.
The ODS President, Mirik Topolianek, pointed out that the budget was green, and the Government should decrease its existence.
The ODS Chairman, Petr Necas, said to the CTK that the concept of the officer's chabinet is apparently not worked anymore with support for the CSSD, ODS and Green Party.
First fishermen described similar words as "star expressions".
The CSSD Chief, Jiri Paroubek, reacted to the Topolianek level that the statedeficit was green that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and over 200 billion chrones.
The CSSD estimated the approval of the State budget for the next year as successful.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans pointed out that the new Hollywood film "Invitus: The Unclean" of the world shows much of the country, from which the fight and wins, despite some critics, the main role of a American shock player.
The story tells us about sports, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The unsuccessful fighter against the racist Apartment System in South Africa and its first black President, Nelson Mandela, is in his life history of the American Oscar-Study players, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was requested by the twenty-year-old Mandela if he could present him in Eastwood film.
Another important role is Matt Damon.
I said to him, "If I'll play you, I have to meet you.
The twenty-year-old player who had received the price of his role in Eastwood Drama from the box "million dollars baby" has already been the leaders of the movement to develop the slave, from which it became a firm president of the United States, as well as God in "Evan All Power", but only rare people who lived and for many people are so important as Mandela.
The former South African State man was in prison for its active activity in the end of the Apartment in the South African Republic for 27 years.
He was set free foot in 1990 and became President of the country for four years.
In 1993, he was exhibited with the nobel price.
"Invitus" is the Latin word for "none" and simultaneously the name of a mention of the English author William Ernest Henley, issued in 1875.
The request was how to talk to him
The movie has a real depth, and Nelson Mandela has his forces with the capital of South African Rugbyteam, Francois Pienar, together with some of the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people are still racial and economically shared.
He believes that he can make his people a few sports, so he decides to make some of the Rugby players, who are part of the world's foreigners.
Finally, the South African team grows to the World Cook of 1995.
Freeman worked for several years in order to bring Mandela's stories to the cinema.
He had no other goal to play this role to approach this as closely as possible to reality, Freeman said.
The greatest challenge was self-conscious to speak as he did.
The player said that if he and the world politician would be in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela, to eat with him at night and to be behind the cults.
The most important thing for him was to protect Mandela's hand.
I found that when I protect your hand, I'll overcome your energy, she's transferred, and I had the feeling that I know what you feel, he said.
It's important for me to become another person.
Matt Damon represents the movie François Pienar, the captain of the national rugbyteam, where the white players overcome.
The player said he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard rugby world.
It was a great surprise for him when he met Pienar for the first time in his house.
I remembered when I cryed to the Turkey that he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienar in my life was: 'I see the film much greater.'
Despite the clear differences in the statue of the players compared to their actual illustrators, he has received positive reviews under the Governor Eastwood "Invitus: Uncomfortable" and is also speaking of prospects on a oscar.
The film critic of the Blattes Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, put his review together in the following words: "This was a very good story, very good film."
In the film reviews on the web site rottentomatoes.com, Invitus 76% has received positive reviews.
Light secret dissolved in Norwegia: Russians have tested a rat
On Norway was to observe a special light effect of unknown origin.
The Russian Defence Minister has just been held yesterday after the testing of an intercontinental ballist rats over the Norwegian border.
But the start was not successful, and the rats called "Bulava" that originally should be the pride of the Russian army will be slowly to the Alptspace of Russian Generality and the Prime, Vladimir Putin.
He also had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava has never been started or has been damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers you've already written about "Bulava" as about a "raket that doesn't fly".
A rat that doesn't fly, but light
This is the 13th trial, please at the normal beginning.
First at the end of the flight, technical damages have occurred on the rat.
The engine probably explosed in the third Raketen stage.
This time, "Bulava" started from the Atom-U-Boot Dmitri Donski, which went under the water of the white sea.
This ratting type allows the switch from the U ship.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by uncertainly flighting object was actually the damaged "Bulava".
In addition, Norwegians have not doubted since the first time that it is a Russian rake.
However, the generality has maintained itself this time and said that it is not clearly possible to speak about a misconduct.
The first two stages of the rats did not fall out and from the accident was only the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged at the first stage.
Even if no test starts without error, the leadership of the Defence Ministry is only six of three to ten to ten to follow.
The almost fifty-percentual success is fulfilled by the generality with optimism and is continued to be observed that the "bulava" will be fleet once without problems and even to ten hyper-scale atom pregnants with a total weight of 1,15 tons.
The Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with the CSKA Moscow with 51 years of age
Vjaceslav Fetisov, a legendary player, has 51 years old in a professional eishockey game.
The former World Meeting, Olympiasizer and Stanley Cup - Inhaber helps his team CSKA Moscow in the emergence, and probably takes place in the freeday newspaper KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who completed his career with 40 years, in 1998, is at the time of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuluja's injury, we need another player.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed that it will be supported by the team.
We just need to clarify some remaining forms, quoted the AP the coach of the Moscow club of Sergej Nemcinov.
In the meantime, it is not clear whether the competitor of the famous Eishockey player is only a game.
I mean, Fetisov is one of these who can raise the moral of other players leads to Nemcinov.
When Fetisov returns to the iron surface, he will be the oldest Russian professional eishockey game after AP.
In the NHL, the legendary storr Gordoe Howe has played a whole season for Hartford and was able to write 15 stores and 26 assistants.

Since 2001, he is a member of the Eishockey Star Room.
Hyundai gave the workshops. All overtimes are deleted
The management of the Nosovice Automobile Manufacture Hyundai agreed with the workshop on the relief of all overtimes.
Because of often commanded overtimes, the association has announced the strike preparation at Monday.
This confirmed the speech of the car manufacturer Hyundai, Petr Vanek.
However, the business management will still take place with the employees in this week.
We should not describe our production plan, which is a principle, which was therefore proposed voluntary oversights on Saturday 19 December because of the reason that two workshops would be worked, said Vanek.
The Sedmicka.cz website wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK workers that would work on Saturday.
The employees are also obtained in the afternoon for the Saturday Summit of 28 November.
The company has therefore decided to change the type of motivation of employees for the proposed overtimes.
Or may they pay the overtime attack or may take a replacement permission on 28 December and extend the Christmas feast so far, Vanek took place.
Furthermore, all workers of the Saturday Summit are paid the bicycle and breakfast.
In view of the fact that the overwhelming times of the most slowest and slowest points regarding demands and complaints of employees who had established the production last week, the business management has decided on the immediate effect of the restraint of all the remaining hours for the month of December.
The employees of the car manufacturer were forced to work almost every day after eight hours after more than 2 hours.
Subscribed by the Agreement, the strike preparation shall be revoked as part of the company.
Additional negotiations between the management of the car manufacturer and the employees should be held on Friday.
The director, Peter Kuchar, said at midnight, that if they can sign some of the requests and a common document, they are willing to resume the strike preparation.
The situation in the car factory has been administered last week, at midnight, as about 400 employees spontaneously stricted for permanent overtimes.
They protested also against the bad payment conditions and skins.
However, the management of the business considered that the employees had to make the remaining hours to comply with the car delivery requirements.
The workshops also requested that the employees who had interrupted the production during the midday afternoon were not sanctions.
In the field of overtimes, the workshops are required to reduce over-time work at a minimum level.
Furthermore, in this year they are requested to pay the payment of 5000 krones.
The Nosovice Car manufacture Hyundai is now employed by 2000 people.
The series of production was started in the company in November last year.
By September, about 80,000 vehicles were produced here, which are currently manufacturing capacity for 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czechic discovery: a substance that also affects HIV virus
The team of Czech and German scientists tests new connections to connect HIV virus to the expansion of organism.
The main advantage of improved substance is that it also affects the virus that are already resistant to medicines.
This involves the fact that the connection to common virus observers is not so strong as one of the physicians already existing.
AIDS can not still be healed.
Patients may, however, extend life and prevent HIV virus in the body.
However, its receipt is accompanied by a whole range of side effects.
Incomplete underpression of the virus reducing has also resulted in the development of force viruses that are no longer effective against medicines.
The work of experts from three Institutes of Scientific Academy CR, the VSCHT (Cheche-technological High School) and the university in Heidelberg opens the way you can interact with the virus resistance.
They have demonstrated that the substances mentioned as metalocarbone affect the iron substance responsible for HIV-virus.
The metalocarbonees are connections of Bor, water, carbon and cobalt.
These connections block the virus measurement in other ways than all the medicines currently used, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, scientists have made new improved connections prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the Moleculum Armaecanism of their accession to the virus-food.
The metalocarbons have a unique three-dimensional structure: two varied coffees consisting of bore, hydrocarbon and carbon atoms and are connected through a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Home Tuck and Responsible Virus
HIV protease is an ironic substance of HIV-virus that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV protection caused by HIV virus, it would not be a ripped virus part of infection.
If we disable HIV protease, we also cover the increase in the virus in the body of the patient, the scientists in the press report issued by the Institute for Organic Chemistry and Biochemia of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the Scientific Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe all the series of connections in which two couples of coffee (see table) are connected by a short organic chat that then will be systematically changed.
something weaker, but more reliable
The impact of this series of substances against HIV-protease was tested in the reagen cell, also against their continuous (residered) variants that were obtained by HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metalocarbona on the usual enzym variant is not so strong as in clinically used medicines, but it does not lose its effect on the force variables that are often uneffective to the use of the medicinal products.
The unique effect mechanism, as well as its other properties such as the biological and chemical stability, low skill and the possibility of other chemical assaults, makes the metalocarbons interesting connections to further development of effective medicines against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, director of the Laboratory for Structural Biology of Organic Chemistry and Biochemia Institute and the Institute for Molekular Genetics of Science Academia.
ODS went to fishermen who smiles
The Chairman of the ODS, Mirik Topolianek, called the approved budget for the next year as "grauful" and the Government of the Premier of Jan Fisher should submit its view to its further existence.
The opinion of the ODS was called the President of the Minister.
It may be time for the analysis.
The Chairman of the ODS, Peter Necas, said that the concept of the officer's chabinet with support of the CSSD, ODS and green party is obviously not more functioning.
According to Necas, the President must decide whether he wants to support minority in Parliament if it is about the fight against the growing deficit, or whether it is about his remaining in the office with Parliament's links.
The incidence of the ODS and social democracy to the problems of public deficit is decreased by diameter, which has noted Necas.
The Parliament adopted the Budget for 2010, however, with Link Party change proposals over more than 12 billion chronics.
Parliament has increased the money for state officers, the maintenance of social services and direct payments to farmers.
In this way, the Government has maintained the proposals of social democracy to increase the budget deficit.
Czechlands should have a decline of 163 billion chrones.
The ODS has left the room before the vote, so it has followed the Government's desire, because the changed budget is only a less different of the budget provisory.
Introduction and senselessness
The Financial Minister, Eduard Janota, talked about his deceasing and feeling of senselessness, where the Prime Jan Fisher stated that the government still judges the current situation.
Necas has been convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened its delay for the case that the amendments would be adopted, the situation would seem to be different.
According to the Czech TV, Janota was registered after the government business at the first.
In this way, he stated that he was talking about his remaining in the office.
That is why it is his conviction about the performance of the budget.
As fishermen expressed for further fighting with the budget deficit so that, according to Necas, the social democracy nominators (CSSD), who had implemented the changes in the budget, would not do anything in the Government.
The first should also clearly say that it will be returned if the Parliament continues to adopt deficit-related laws, for instance those relating to hospital payments and pensions or the new service law.
Topolianek: the minister appointed by ODS did not ruin
This is the first fishermen and the whole government.
The ministers appointed by the ODS have not made a mistake, Topolanek highlighted in a text report from the United States.
It has noted that in some ministers, people in the present functions, who acknowledged to TOP 09, were true against the budget.
Necas stressed that if fishermen decided to reject the fight against the deficit deficit of public finances, "is it completely logically and correct that he is based on the link masterity that is now in Parliament".
Then he cannot accept the support and tolerance of the citizens of democracy.
I did not think about this, and if this will be the moment, then I will take care of it, Mr Martin Bartak said the journalists in Parliament.
First fishermen went to Brussels on afternoon at the European Council's meeting.
The ODS returns to the desire of the first
On the same occasion, Necas stressed that the ODS probably would vote on the amended budget in Parliament on the mid-day afternoon, if the Prime Minister would expressly ask the citizens of the citizens to make it possible to adopt the budget.
We do not think that we are no small children, so he reacted to the question of the ODS in the political negotiation on the budget by the absence of the participatory member in Parliament and the Czech Republic.
I didn't notice that my voice would miss.
Soon as I rejected the mandate, I knew that in the next months, in particular, it would go all positively, reacted topolianek itself in the next months.

A few fast trails are also walking on the road Prague - Pisek - Budweis, basically reduced the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad.
The largest reduction plants the rail trains in the area of Hradec Kingove (Königsgraz), in total to eight percent, may also be pleasant towards an increase in the plan and the environment.
Both night journeys will also be highlighted on the Track Prague - Tabor - Budweis and some days in the week will be reduced by the operation of some fast trails on the Track Prague - Pisek - Budweis.
The introduction of the new direct movement from Milovice to Prague is the largest change, and the people of Milovice in Lysa nad Labem must now grow.

The rapid routes are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, in total, the rail trains are able to compare the so-called liquidity loss in the next year four billion chrones, as in this year. The local travels are able to pay for the total amount of eight billion chrones in the next year, where the State is shocking three billion.
In this year, the regional routes are 200 million Czechic chronics.
A ten-year contract for local routes and speed routes has been resolved until now the contract has been completed for only one year.
The rail rail is the system, perhaps not to increase prices in the major majority of passengers.
Changes are only available for adjustable network drives CD Net and eLiska favorite Internet drives.
For passengers without the customer card the CD price is increased from 450 krones to 600 krones.
The price eLiska will then be declined from the skilled stairs, until now he was for the travel between the favorite district cities uniformly and costed 160 krones.

The history of South Africa relates to everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods comes in the American Kinos "Invitus: the Unlawful", which includes a part of the life history of the former President of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world's famous fighters against the Apartment has received Morgan Freeman, who has been elected by Mandela itself a few years ago.
The side of the Legendary South African Championships in Rugby, Francois Pienar, has received Matt Damon.
The cinestart of the film is also called the reactions of critics and publicity.
Direct pressure on that. It's okay, it's okay. Let me see it.
He was named Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on July 18, 1918, in South African Mvez.
In 1988, he received the Sachar price, then in 1993, together with the Clerk, the Peace Nobel Price.
The Presidents of the Republic of South Africa were elected in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are set in the film because it comes in a time in China, in which the preparations for the world's mastership are culminated in South Africa, but at the same time the media will struggle the world public with an appreciative news about the growing race and discrimination of the inhabitants to be the black majority.
According to the News Agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa first are positive, despite numerous preserves against the establishment of the main roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is yet proud of his own words on the new film.
From this role, I have been drunk for many years and I have prepared for it well.
A number of times, I met Nelson Mandela personally, so I - as you say - can receive his energy, he took up in the interview after the film premier in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can spend with this movie to Mandela's personality and his message.
This is a history of South Africa, but it concerns every man, he added.
In Dress of Rugby Nationalal Teams
The film is based on the book template of the British writer John Carlin, which is freely translated in the role of the enemy ́: Nelson Mandela and the game which has joined the people, portraits the South African defenders of human rights within its first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman seeks to join two race and daily differently limited population groups in the course of the film, and as Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also participates in his role in the South African National Rugbydress on the world coffee at the time of South Africa.
For the involvement of the race in the Dress, which is almost in South Africa as a holy action, Mandela was great ovations for the fourteen years ago, overall from the white public, and thus wins the recognition of the white people.
The Rugbymeistership may be completed to join the people again to a single people, leading to the Rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "share" in the National Team in 1995.
Whether the swimming situation in South Africa improves that will only be shown.
The white South Africans, however, are skeptical, such as in recent interviews for LN of the Rugby-Fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to the United Kingdom.
The Mastership began on 11 June 2010.
In the Louny area transformers for more than 10 million chrones
The burn in the morning, on the transformer of the Society Ceps in the skilled position at the Vyskov community in the Louny area.
During the fire, Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, took six units in accordance with the speaker of the district fires.
Originally, the firewaves wanted to break the transformers, but later she changed the view and now the fire will be removed with a mixing of water - steam and special solutions.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer interface.
No one was injured, the havarie was threatened in accordance with the company speaker, Pavla Mandatova, the security operation of the management system.
The damage was estimated to a number of 10 million crons, and the damage will be more accurate than after burning.
The destroyed transformer must be replaced according to Mandatova by a new.
Over 10 years, Ceps society has not occurred similarly, this kind of error is rare and complemented.
The electricity supply was not interrupted under the speaker of the CEZ Society for North Boomen, Sona Holingerova, and the operationality of household, authorities and companies was not influenced.
A.G. Ceps is operating on the twenty-third area as a single driver of the management system, the electronic guidelines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renews and develop 39 scaled platforms with 67 transformators, with electric energy to distribution systems and drive lines with a length of 4339 km.
Jancura has been struggling with three leaders of the CSSD.
The owner of the University Agency, Radim Jancura, is today punishable because of the rebellion against three social-democratic leaders.
On Michal Hasek from the Southern Maers, Radko Martinek from the pardubice district and the head of the Olomouc district, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said that in a twenty-minute inteview in the radio journal.
The complaint is together with the efforts of the company to operate the regional transfer in certain areas.
However, all regions have finally signed the long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three leaders attack us and say that we're taking the roses, so we've just transmitted the offer about how it was agreed with them.
They said we are more cost than the Czech Railways because we would know the prices of the Czech rail trains that were closed last week.
So there's nothing else left to wear.
Because of this excursion of the Society of Students Agency, Jancura said to the radio journal.
At the same time, he pointed out that he had evidence from all areas that they have taken their steps in accordance with the European law.
That is why we make a complaint for the European Commission.
Haseek is aware of the punishment for further prosecution of the Medialshow of Jancura, who serves to him as a free advertising for his society and for his own person.
I’m certainly willing to defend my good name and the good call of my district, and I also call for another leader.
I believe that it will also be cleared in this matter that it is Jancura, who manipulated the public and used false and inconsistent arguments in the case of regional income.
Janzura reported last week that he had invested several million krones in the advertising that will be shown on the second step of the business.
The Radiojournal said he was going to submit the campaign to Christmas, and he wants to continue after a new year.
He expressed that he would lead the campaign to corruption as such.
The campaign has led to Jancura after the operations of the regional rail transport with the Czechran rail rail stations and there were no records for the task of an updating up to 150 billion krones.
According to Vancura, such a conduct is legally and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of the trail movement in the area, Jancura has threatened him, even a deputy of the CSSD.
The only threat was if we don't refuse to lose bus licens.
He was a deputy of the CSSD, I know who it is, I don't tell his name, said today Jancura to the radio journal.
Infringement against Pneumococks free and voluntary
Inflation against Pneumokokes changes the habitat from January.
She will be the first to be free and voluntary for the family.
But now votes are that the obligation to receive would be more effective.
culmine preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococks.
The Arznee Initial Institute already sets the maximum prices of vaccines to pay the hospital insurances.
The experts are also clear about the vaccination procedure.
New infection
Infringements free for August-Kinder
From January, children can be imprisoned freely against pneumokokes that were born on August 2, last and later.
The condition is that they have not been receiving vaccination.
Those who have started the vaccination in the last year or previously, have also to pay further recurrence income.
The first dose should be given between 3 and 5 life month of the child.
Shortly ago, a fourth of the families were imposing their children against pneumocokes.
The parents paid 1600 chrones and more for a dose.
For the vaccination of the recent children, four doses are needed.
In all, the experts estimate that the hospital insurance for vaccines is 300,000 to 450,000 krones per year.
However, they are shocking in the treatment that the children would need without infection.
To now, the State has issued about 500,000 per year for all the areas of the children.
The binding was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococks cause medications, but also severe infections, including brain infections and blood infections.
Infections of pneumocokine died in hospitals per year to 28 children up to 10 years of age.
In addition to Czech Republic, the obligation of children to combat Pneumokokes was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will the infringement be obliged?
At the same time, it will be said that this infringement may be a future obligation.
From January, it will be voluntary to pay and voluntary by the insurances.
This would be better acceptance, for example, mentioned the head of the civilian association Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky.
His association has already been for the Pneumokoke invasion for a long time.
The experts at the international conference, in which our association was involved, had not been very satisfied to have voluntary vaccination.
That's not very ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy that it has been done to perform at least this.
I think that's the way we have to go now, Kalovsky.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the infection procedure against the Pneumokooks.
At this moment we don't think about this, said his speaker Vlastimil Sess.
The voluntary vaccine has its sides, reported the doctors.
The Chairman of the Special Society of Practical Child Drugs, Hana Cabrnochova, suggests that voluntary infringement has its parts.
If all children were imprisoned, then you could think about the reduction of the recurrence rate "In a situation where the vaccine is so costly, we understand the political decision that this vaccine has been initiated voluntaryly", says Cabrnochova.
The experts hope that more than 80 percent of the parents will allow their injuries towards Pneumokokes from the next year.
The infringement against pneumococks is also inquiring that it is payed as the first area of hospital insurance and not by the State.
Insurances should expend the money for prevention so that they are deployed for further treatment, purchased by Cabrnochova.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines itself.
However, this is associated with a concern of the practical child physicians relating to the purchase of vaccines.
After the original projects, the vaccines should be purchased by insurances and then the doctors receive them on the same way as other from the State to which they are issued.
Some Members feared, however, that the insurances would be “the money from the hospital insurance producer”.
Thus, the doctors will buy the vaccines itself and have to wait until the insurances pay them.
According to estimates, individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 chrones per month, which is a significant amount.
This will not be easy, says Cabrnochova.
US Artist Son participated in "Musual Deal Steel"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Fracetta was accused of trying to steal the shooting of $20 million from the museum of his father.
According to the police of Pennsylvania, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was taken to his vehicle with a member.
It means, Frank Frazetta Junir and another man would have used a bag in to enter the museum in the Pocono Bergen.
The 81-year-old Frank Fracetta Senior is famous for his exhibition of casts like Conan of the Barbar and Tarzan.
As reported by the newspaper Associated Press, the artist took place at the time of the incident in Florida.
AP was quoted by an unnowned police officer, who said that Frank Fracetta Junior could be motivated by a family error.
The Agency reported that, according to a police declaration, Fracetta Junior was stated by his father, "he should enter it into the museum with all means to bring all the places."
The Agency informed that Frank Fracetta's senior had a license.
Labour defends state increases and tax increases
The Ministers have defended tax increases and expenditure reported in the previous report against the criticism of opposition, economy and workshops.
The conservators said that Alistair Darling would have left a opportunity "overcome" to show that he was seriously dealt with the reduction of the deficit by dismissing the decisions to the election.
In addition, the sweet shooter was convicted that he had a low and medium-sized income on employees.
In its main proposals, a increase in social insurance is 0.5 per cent and a 1 per cent of the public loan decisions for 2011.
Social insurance
However, the workshops protested that Niedriglon employees were punished for a recession which they did not cause and warned "problems".
The increase of social insurance - about 3 billion British pounds per year - has increased the private economy, which says that this is a tax on jobs, although the attention should be on the economic refund.
The increase in those who are limited to more than 20,000 £ per year is related to about 10 million employees.
SERPUNCE OF VOREAB EATTERS
Augmentation of social insurance by 0.5 % from April 2011
In this year, the growth of the economy by more than 4.75 % expected
New 50% steel on bankier bonus
1 per cent increased corporate tax for small companies
Taxes for electric vehicles and windturbines
Increased State residents at 2,5 %
According to estimates of the shadow office, someone will be poor with a yearly income of 30,000 £ per year and a person with 40,000 £ per year will be more poor than 190 £ per year, while a person with 10,000 £ annual income will be more richer for 110 £.
The Ministers said that their goal of deficit deficit decreased up to 2013, but 60% of the taxes of additional taxes would be removed to 5% of the top drivers.
Minister of Finance Stephen Timms notes that the skid tax increases and expenditure increases compared to the necessary measures "a troops on the warm stone".
"This are large numbers. They will bring us the deficit half and this is also necessary for the next four years," he shared the BBC.
Timms said he was convinced that the economy would return to growth until the end of the year.
Provisions of the Labour Party on the future economic growth – which influences the extent of the new debt and the rapidity of deficit transmission – were undertaken after the obligation to revise previous numbers.
He said in his opinion, the economy would probably be 4.75% in this year - more than the decline of 3.5%, which was predicted in April – while the debt would be higher than it was previously proposed.
"Passed chance."
The conservatives who wanted to start a new public campaign on Thursday to warn the "debt crisis" of Labour said that the planned debt of 789 billion pounds over the next six years would be untenable.
They added that the ministers had summarized to propose a credible plan how they will be paid back and pressed "cynical" before difficult decisions after the election, the latter of June 2010 must take place.
"He said nothing about what they're going to do," said the Child Financial Minister Philip Hammond. "He had their opportunity to do this, and they've left them out."
"The important announcements will be made only after the choice, whoeverever it wins."
Roger Bootle, Deloite
Labour ensures that schools, hospitals and the police are protected before future scourgements, other than in the proposals of conservatives that see the deficit coverage more rapidly and better.
But the Liberal Democratics said that the money that will be used by tax increases and expenditure to cover the expenditure for the next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore claim that the plans are "building on sand".
The BBC's political editor, Nick Robinson, said that some at the time of the announcements - such as the above inflation adjustment in some invalid in April – would apply the chairman's project, since the money could only be recovered in the next year.
Labour seeks to provide extra assistance when people need it as necessary and to re-examinate the situation in September 2010.
"Hohler State."
Although the ministers have not been informed of state details over 2011, the economists say that pressure on public expenditure will only be in a mid-term way.
The recognised Tax research Institute said that the numbers of the shrine stakeholder would mean strong distractions in many areas, possibly in the fields of transport, higher education, science and defence.
"It's cut the pain only later," said his chief Robert Chote.
"The important announcements will be made only after the choice, whoever always wins", added Roger Bootle, Economic Adviser to the Economic Check Companies.
"This was just the high preab stat report, and the markets recognize it."
The FBI is investigating "Federations of US citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported US citizens because of the suspect of extremist connections in Pakistan.
The men were arrested to a house in Sarhoda, in the East Pandschab Province, with the American message in Pakistan of BBC.
The FBI said it will be investigated whether they are the same men who were missed in Virginia, the last month.
The United States Foreign Minister said they're looking for information about the men.
Three of them should be Pakistanian settlement, one is Egyptian origin, and the other has a gemenical background.
"If they are American citizens, of course, we are very interested in the accused points that are made to them and under which circumstances they will be held", said Spreacher Ian Kelly.
The FBI speaker Katherine Schwi said that the authority was informed about the prisons and was connected to the families of the lost students.
"We work together with the Pakistanian authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay where it is actually the lost students," she said.
The Pakistanian message in Washington reported that the men were arrested in a house that belonged to the uncle of one of the students.
He said that the domestic police had already interested in the house and that has not yet been engaged in an appeal against the arrested men.
The news agent Reuters reported that it refused the Minister of Foreign Affairs to comment on the prisons, but she said that the United States must "cooperate again with Afghan and Pakistan to destroy the infrastructure of terrorism, which continues to restructure and train people."
The five students were reported as missing at the end of November by your families in North Virginia.
Amnesty condemns "Missions" in Iran
According to a report of the Human Rights Organization Amnesty International, the human rights in Iran is still as bad as in the last 20 years.
The report is detailed by the regime as well as after the voted President's election in June.
A man who was sent in the report showed that he was shocked and burned with cigarettes, and another said he was threatened by assault.
Ironics reversed the previous criticism of his human rights balance.
Official offices said that such a criticism is politically motivated.
After the viewed election of President Mahmud Ahmadinedshaad, thousands of people were arrested and killed twenty-five, which leaded to the largest road protection since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Dutch sentences received and lawyers said at least five people were sentenced to death.
The BBC Teheran Correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the beginning of the Protest of High Leaders, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the misuse statements and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak Strongstate.
But since then the authorities had no more tolerance for criticism, our co-responsibilities said.
"Falche understanding."
Amnesty International quoted the report of the 26-year-old informant Abraham Mehtari, who said he was accused of the "work with Facebook networks" and because of the protest against the results of election.
"He shocked me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with smokes under my eyes, in the naked naked on the head, and they threatened me with death, and they decreased me."
After five days he subscribed a false understanding and became, still blown and half unconscious, left off on the street, shared Amnesty with.
The chaired presidency candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrates who were arrested after the election were tortured in the prison in August and other were assaulted.
The Iranian authorities lied the licensing provisions, but they gave the fact that misleading had occurred.
Amnesty also called the case of a former prisoner, who said that he had been held with 75 other than eight weeks in a container in a prison station in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the Judiciary authorities had founded a committee that should investigate the distortions after the election and the reactions of the Government, but, so Amnesty, the mandates and the power of these bodies would not be clear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees would not be published.
The group said that at least 90 people were arrested in the last three weeks to predict further demonstrations.
Skihang was established in the city park
More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow were used to convert a snake in Bristol into a winter camppoint.
The ski point of this park event was 16-professional ski and snowboarder who fighted for money prices.
On the spot of the Hump in Brandon-Hill Park, there was a short swimming song at the beginning of a 100 meter long.
The student John Hickman, who studied in the fourth year of Medicine, said that there was a beautiful view of the chain, but it was also very thrilling.
It's a great view of all the lights of the city, which slow down.
He added: "It's some of the best ski drivers and snowboarder of the country here - some right talents."
Prices were paid for the best artists - or tricks exported on the hang.
After the event on Thursday, the snow will leave the snake.

Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when the Swiss electors have voted for a ban on the construction of minerals and the concerns about the advanced Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, a American academic, wrote a found and welcome report about whether Muslims can be integrated into one of the most declared enterprises of Europe – and integrated.
Some readers will read this new book with admiration for the last work of the author: "Why the French don't Like Headscarves" (2006) read, a elegant and decisive study of a fighting question that shared the country over a half years and has been busy and has still taken up their impact today.
Bowens nieded book offers a more comprehensive and culinary spectrum.
As a good anthropolog, he wants not only to know what the politicians and the media say about the Islam in France, but also what really happens in the area.
He has spent months in Moscow, schools and institutions, which now offers the 5 to 6 million muslims in France, as Bowen calls "Islam Freespaces".
He's a good listener, he gives discussions between teachers and students on the issues which mostly threaten them.
Should a moslim marry in a mosque or a Council House (or both)?
Should young muslims be taught about evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-music man?
Is it possible for a muslim to use a synthesised bank system to get a hypotheque?
It is likely to be profound, and it says that they are life-friendly, in contrast to the political dramas that the media employ.
The author recognises a new generation of images, teachers and intellectuals, no one with a known name, perhaps except Tarik Ramadan, a born Arab-music scholar and academic in Switzerland.
This new generation tries to open the debate on how it is possible to be a good moslim and, on the other hand, a good state citizen in a modern secular society.
You don't have any arguments on your side.
The conservatives are mystical towards the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thoughts and activistas in the Bowen are mostly unnecessary with their salafi pieces – firms of the puristic Sunnitic Islam, which is connected to Saudi Arabians – today show a small but influent presence among the Muslims of Europe.
Bowen is the view that muslim values and French secularism could be agreed.
However, a agreement requires a gift and acceptance on both sides.
He asks how many French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite, which is so vulnerable to the separation of the church and state) really binding the pluralism.
He states that Muslims may have learned a rare treatment as Catholics, Protestants and Jews, which, on the other hand, had to make their historical compromise with the total Republicanism.
He, above all, recognizes a "hispering of the values rabbits" as a growing pragmaticism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, you can say "Yes, but not yet."
The most comfortable view of the world
The Arkite changes faster and dramatic than any other environmental region on earth.
The iron that they mark, slows with alarming speed and takes life with itself that can never survive anywhere different.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have made themselves open water, with diplomas, applicants and now authors in their language water.
Richard Ellis, a author and illustrator, signed in "Auf Dunnem Eis" (Original title: "On Thin Ice"), is a natural history of the northern Icon of the Ice.
In the complex history and policy of the forest, he describes the long tradition of the arctic researchers who have proved themselves at the jagd on the iron barriers.
Admiral Nelson's meeting with a iron snake as a tapferer 14-year-old filnrich to the sea, which only struggled with his muscles, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears that were captured when they spoiled behind the bodys of their recently killed mothers were put into Zoos and circumcision.
A circumcision in the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 ice barriers at a vision.
Even today Zooan plants are still typically a million system of lives of a wild altar. The climate is rarely suitable: the iron bear in Singapore has been green from the algebra that grows in the high hair of its pelce.

Ellis relates to the reports of other authors and historic authors, and often calls back to the threat that the guests represent the survival of the species.
Although it is prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, it continues to be found in Groenland and Canada, where hikers in helikopters and motor drivers are used for powerful storm weapons to spend their shoots.
Ironically, in the waters in the north of these two jagdnations the iron remains the most longest.
In his new book "And the Eis" (Original title "After the Ice") Alun Anderson, an exhibitor of the Scientist "New Scientist", offers a clear and fragrant description of the science of the Archites and a packing view of how the future can develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographs can properly explain the speed of changes.
However, this is not a lack of declaration requests.
The pioneer journeys of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th century, and the beginning of the 20th century gave the confusion of the package.
In the cold war, under the seaboats swimming grace in the skill.
A useful complement is satellite measurements and the large expenditure of measons on iron mountains, but it will still be much to be reached by uncomfortable people who are camping outside the hill.
Anderson takes a view in the unique, changing world of the flow system within the arctic ice, which is formed by salt water salts, which are pressed at the heating.
But, starting from the bar on the iron to the microscopical miracles in the iron, all of them are threatened when the summer is one, which is calculated between 2013 and 2050 during the period.
"In a few months... we could be it."
Marine childhoods were among the 6.000 who led in Arlington crystals
The hotel free De'Angel Robinson traveled seven hours with the bus to put a single round on the grain of a soldier that he never had taken.
For him and the other marine children who traveled in Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Friedhof in Arlington, were a trib of the men and women in which they were in the footsteps.
In a few months we could be taken back from where we were always, Robinson said about the soldiers.
If we were that, I would like someone to do the same for me, so I try to show my respect so.
He was one of more than 6.000 volunteers who had gathered together on Saturday morning to put the crowds on the veterans in several sections of the Arlington Free Court.
Morrill Worcester, owner of the Trauer Journalist Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, found this tradition as he and some others decided to decore several hundreds of plants on the Friedhof in Arlington.
It is now a 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who are traveling these travels every year, keep in different cities along the way to events offered by people at the military and victims of terrorism.
Worcesters also established a common organization, Wreaths Across America, which has also extended the event to other countries.
In this year, more than 16.000 volunteers were on the Arlington Friedhof, in areas at Pentagon, on the Fayetteville National Friedhof in Arkansas, at the Battery Park in New York and at the Memorial Centre for the United Airlines flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Foundation spended for the second time more than $150,000 for purchase and transport of the rings.
Charleen Hunt, 70 of West Minster, said she took the journey to Arlington in the memory of her husband, a defeated professional soldier.
Although her husband isn't buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way to give some of the victims.
She said this is a small contribution to how we can support our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family entertainment.
The voluntary packed in the lake warm clothing turned on the extensive race surfaces and hills of the Friedhof.
Volunteers had older farmers from World War I and the Vietnam war as a goal, as they were not often visited as new farmers, so the eventors.
The smiling was fun, children played, and pairs were holding on the hand, while they swallowed the fresh shoes to the grey grain stones.
Each ronde green was dark with a small red clothing confirmed at the top.
The Section 60, which is near and where mostly veteranes of the wars in Iraq and Afghan remained quiet.
The United Service Organizations spend 1,000 pieces to smile this section, but the deepest stimulation of the current wars complied with this area.
Ones openly wined, other prayers and families and friends held themselves in the swimming air.
Some reads say the names in stone, while others were cut up to small black-sized cards that were shooted for those in the fired smell, whose stones were still not completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who smelled pains before the snake of her son.
She's 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the grain station of marine infantry, David Shane Spicer, who went to the battle in July.
Nobody should ever forget why we're free... my son payed for it, she said.
"If I'm not a long time ago, I want someone to remember him."
Customers of the US government of Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has sell an employee of the US government, the mobile telephones and notebook computers in the country, said the representative of the Foreign Minister on Saturday.
The contractors who have not yet been identified have worked for development alternatives Inc. with Sitz in Bethesda.
The society works on customer projects, such as USAID, US members for international development and the World Bank.
Consular officials of the United States Interesting Association in Havanna try to get access to the prisoner arrested on 5 December.
The specific accused points have not yet been published, although in Cuban law, a Cuban State citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested for almost everything.
All so-called contrarevolutionary activities, including light protests and critical writings, are a risk of detention.
Government feminist graphics and complaints are considered a serious crime.
Kuba has a growing blogger community, which is indicated by the popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, describes the posters how they and her husband of government advisers are persecuted and attacked.
Sánchez has repeated to request an authorisation to leave the country to reverse prices, but this has always been rejected.
The establishment of an American contractor will probably increase the sharing between the communist government of the Castro brothers in Cuba and the Obama government, which had aimed to improve the relationship with the island.
The message of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times.
The new US policy highlights that the United States will have an opposition when the Cuban government takes concrete steps into this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more space for opposition.
Mobile Phones and Notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and employed products in a country where the average service of a government employee is $15 per month.
The Cuban government only allows the purchase of a mobile phone since this year, which will be used for the shipping of text messages, as a 15-minute phone talk would cost a daily salary.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in widespread hotels and there for foreign visitors and to some government facilities, such as universities.
Cubans who want to join the government often need to report their name.
To many websites, access is limited.
On Kuba, the celebration of an Americanian is rare.
The majority of the few US citizens in Cuba, who are in prison, sit down because of crimes such as drug smokers after the guitars, said Gloria Berbena, the pressman of the U.S. interest association in Havanna.
Bebena said she could not give any further information on the arrest.
The arrest and arrest are clearly wrong.
A activities that would be legally in any other free society - the payment of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the United States Section "Human Rights Watch", which recently produced a hard report on freedom in Cuba with the title "New Castro, the same Cuban, a resonance on the office of Raul Castro as the leader of the country, which replaced the older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the accused would often be arrested, sentenced and arrested within a day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban Government often causes a negative reaction in the United States just at the time of both countries to move towards more dialogue preparation.
Pakistani government deck plan to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities discovered a leading head of a conspiration which intended to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. Solutions, and said that they hoped that this case could help find an extensive network of terrorist applicants that looked at the Internet by radicalized young men.
The investigators said that they had been looking for an unexpected localist, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he completed it, because one of them had issued comments on the YouTube video to terrorist attacks.
Safullah was after their arrival in Pakistan, the leaders of these men and tried to help them reach the distant region in Pakistan, which is the home of Al Kaida and its terrorist training stock.
But a representative of Pakistan's secret service, who was informed about the matter, said on Saturday, Safullah could not convince the leaders of Al-Kaida that men are not part of a CIA conspiration for the immigration of the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held on days in the Eastern city of Sardiny, far away from the unreasonable mountains in the northwest, which became a terrorist refugee.
They were seen as part of a covered operation.
It was therefore rejected, said the government official, who wanted to remain anonym because of the sensibility of the matter.
The government official said that the men weren't disappointed and continued to get the right recommendations to get access to the Al-Kaida camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani criminal authorities.
The case of the five men - who are still in Pakistan and are asked by the FBI - is stressing the crucial role of the applicants in identifying future terrorists and, perhaps, more importantly, the decision who is trusting.
Since the appeal of 11 September 2001, the US Secret Service has made a higher urgency to submit human activity posts within Al Kaida.
The applicants of the organization act as a complainant who do not leave those whose commitment to the Holy War is not sufficiently serious and those who could be the spirit.
American Power records are undertaken by A Kaida a special examination, said analyticers.
On the basis of their potential access to US targets and their propagan date values, they will also be considered attractive for the group.
Evan Kohlmann, the highest analytics of the NEFA Foundation with seats in the United States, said that terrorist groups have been much more careful for them in recent years, as the United States secret services have become experts of their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to switch someone in these groups, which better way you could go than follow the recruitment model, whose many have already been followed, said Kohlmann.
The model is now based on the Internet more.
Ten thousand demonstrators requested in Kopenhagen climate "Action"
Ten thousand demonstrators were marked here on Saturday through the streets and requested the undergrounds in the Bella Congress Centre of Cunger Trade in Climate Protection.
Demonstrates said that 100,000 people had joined the event, although the police estimates were more than 25,000.
The event is relatively peaceful, although a handly massive massacred snakes in the nearby some government buildings in the city.
One day, when little climate negotiations had occurred with thousands of transparent activists through the city "No planet B" and one in Spanish, which explained "The Earth says "Genug".
Some stars concluded the protest, for example, the Danish model, the photographer Helena Christiansen, who said that the journeys to Peru, the birth country of her mother, you are aware of what disaster problems the country has to fight because of the already devastating impact of climate change.
This is part of the movement reason why I have decided to participate in the great demonstration - to continue and call for the world leaders to make a right, ambitious and binding agreement, said she.
It is not a light task, but it must be done now and there is no way to do so.
The police declined the demonstrators to get close to the Bella Center and said they had been arrested by 19 persons, mainly because of the fact that they were masked or infringed.
According to the Danish law, these actions are prohibited in demonstrations.
According to a observer who did not want to be called, since it is involved in climate negotiations, massed demonstrates in black clothing several muscles near the Kopenhagen main channel, where several ministers are near.
They were closed to the building, he said and added that they started as light races, but then were followed by "one large explosions."
In the inside of the Congress Centre, people gathered television screens to follow the demonstration throughout the afternoon.
But the Protest has not reached the consciousness of the main officials, such as Su Wie, China's Chief Climates.
When he was asked if he thought that the demonstration had a constructive impact on international considerations, he replied in English: "This is something that I didn't know."
Then he went to Mandarin and said, "When the place of event is great, I can't hear what happens out."
He realized that it would depend on the perspective of the individual whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the concentration of the broad public and various sectors on the subject of climate change, said he.
On the other hand, "I can also say that they destroy the negotiations or freedom of others."
Show test data a hard race club
The Witnesses for the mathematical performance were welcome last week for the public schools in Washington D. C.
Although the Washington district is still far behind the schools of the country to bring maximum benefits, the witnesses show that the visit and eighth classs have made progress in the past two years more fast than the towns of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
However, what has been concluded in the recent numbers of the national evaluation of education force (National Assessment of Educational Progress - NAEP), the hard performance gap between African and white students, both at local and national level.
The average points of the white white clusters from Washington D. C. increased in the last two years of 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), which increased only three points from 209 to 212.
The performance club actually increased from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the African eight-class continued to be equal, and he discovered a statistically disadvantageable point from 245 to 244.
The average number of white students was not included in the data of test, since the sample size was not enough.
The image over a six-year period is not even more encouraged.
The club, which trends the white and black neighbor class 2003, when the first NAEP was taken in this district, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the number of points that children have reached from both groups has grown in this stage of time, the difference with now 58 points has not been reduced.
Some of the educational representatives of the district last week expressed their concern that the results of students Michelle A. Rhee and the democratic master Adrian M. Fenty were predicted in most of the white students, as well as children of the performance.
This indicates that we have highlighted the overall evaluation through the treatment of those at the top end of the scale, which is problemous and difficult, said Jeff Smith, head member of D.C. Voice, a common group that enters for educational equality in Washington D.C..
I don't smell for a spanne of two or three points, said the democratic Washington City Council member, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth class of the Eaton Grand School.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management system, said that the message of the test points is that the central schools of the city need urgent attention.
Of course, I would always like to see the positive signs that I respect.
But what I am afraid is that we do not apply closely the time and energy that we should use for our school.
Rhee said that the district must continue to find better ways to be justified by the needs of the students' career.
For example, some teachers are understood to use a new lesson plan, the Wilson Learning System, which aims at students at the top classes of basic schools and media schools, which have not measured the fundamentality of reading at the beginning of their school trains and which significantly return to their same classrooms.
All-day mathematics, a school plan from the child garden to the sixth class games and live experiences, have been placed under the former headquarters of school inspector Clifford Janey to Washington and this school plan will be reported to some of the NEP continues reported last week.
I mean, we must continue to work in order to welcome the best steps under the note level, Rhee.
Others say that the results of the NAEP highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system, and therefore can continue to provide additional money and resources for skilled schools that are necessary to reduce the cluster.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, Professor for Education at the University of California in Berkeley, studying the urban test results.
The conventional helicopter is to establish its resources and management reforms on the schools located in the most poorest areas of Washington D.C.
The objectives could have a political impact on this important agenda item.
The weakness point, of course, is, like other urban school inspectors, that they try to keep the white and black weight.
Our focus is to ensure that we create a great system of schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the city newspapers so that all families, independent of where they live, may be sure that their children can receive an excellent public education.
Janey, who is now school in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements for the closure of the service class is to extend the traditional public school year, which is now in Washington for 180 days to competite with the Charter Schools.
You have to increase the school year near to 200 days to have the strength to change, Janey, who came with his teacher work last year to a agreement over 185 days per year, which he is considered as a "a milestone" on the way to increase the increase in the next treaty.
High school for more people than future perspective
The travel bus reached the Gettusburg College with a fascinated phefeen.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, grows out and blinzels a moment at the view of the white pillars, the stone fascinates and the smaragd green race.
Gracielas parents have not closed the high school in El Salvador.
Graciela was also hidden in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale until short time, never placed a foot on a college cap.
Its position and the other eighth classs of the group, who investigated Gettusburg, where the education costs $38,690 per year, was more than one of the honourable visitors than the students to be enthusiastic.
"Yes, I'll be soon here!" Mr Graciela, who would like to study medically when the leader announced that they had now involved the building for natural sciences.
"What, really?" she said thinkingly when she was reported the low professor's relationship of the school.
The College in Pennsylvania was the 7th visiting children on their three-day tour, and now they have completely included the requested message: The question is not whether you go to the college.
The question is where.
One is a growing concern about the large number of Spanish immigrants who are born in the United States who are not finished or who are pregnant for adolescents, there are also hundreds of thousands of whom the college training is required to get up into the middle level.
In truth, one of the five of these "width generations" from Spanish Americans depends on the colleague – which is an excellent performance, since many of its immigrated parents, most of their inmigrated parents from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without having completed the high school.
Their success stories are important to tell researchers because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a great role in the workers of the country.
Those who investigate performance-based children say that they often have a natural interest in school and an inhabited conduct to their success.
Many of them also have parents who have high goals and find ways to compensate their lack of confidence with American schools.
But consultation programmes also play a major role by helping Graciela and millions of children to come to college, especially when these efforts continue a longer period of time.
If you consider income weak children whose parents do not have experiences and skills to help them through the system to help through the search, then a single measure will not solve the problem at any time, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at the University of California in Davids, who studied Spanish American students.
We need to think about providing a supporting network from school to high school for these children.
The federal programme, which had financed Gracielas College Tour, is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - Skip up a gang - and provides more than 300 million dollars per year for local school systems to start college preparation programs, which start when income-free students are in the middle school and continue to go until they closed the high school.
According to the United States Education Department, the program has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, from which more than 60% have been at college.
Iraqi Oil Minister concludes negotiations with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite the concerns of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has enabled more oil society to rebuild its damaged infrastructure at Saturday two audiences.
The 10 contracts close to the Iraqi Oil Ministry of 10 treaties with foreign oil companies are prepared to play an important role in renewing the Iraqi oil industry, which has been enabled by war and economic organizations for decades.
American enterprises could only benefit from two of the 10 increased fields for themselves.
Seven American enterprises had paid the participation to the second auction that began on Friday.
The only company, which has ordered a order, has taken the currency.
Two American enterprises could be concluded for increased fields in June.
The last representatives of the American oil mourn in the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
After six years of war, Irak opened his tower and gives an Asian and European business the way, said Ruba Husari, the employee of Iraq Oil Forum, a online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns that were still understood by mass coordinated bombs on Tuesday, and the political instability through the delay of the United States Military Oil society probably have stopped it, so analysts said to engage in Iraq more stronger, with the world's third largest moral reserves.
In some cases, US companies were noted because competitors, especially Chinese and other stately controlled energy companies, have significantly reduced payment costs and risked, because they do not need to take account of the shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Western Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that could conclude contracts with the Ministry.
More US enterprises, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who are closely involved with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and standing up with the technical Council in recent years, have been empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main actors at two of this weekend contracts.
The State China National Petroleum Corporation offered more contracts than any other company and could go home with large packages to contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the speaker of the Oil Minister, Assam Jihad, that China is on the way to become one of the greatest of the world economy and a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can meet its shareholders and comply with his obligations against Iraq.
For the prescribed undertakings, the orders compared with the payment per barrel oil, which was prepared to pay the Ministry to increase the escape of each field over the current level.
Top Planner of Al Kaida obviously killed in Pakistan
In a clear US rake attack from Pakistan's border to Afghan this week, a top-up plan of Al Kaida will be killed, and reported representatives of the US terrorism fight on Friday.
This would be, if it would be confirmed, the second mortal attack on a high responsibility for the terrorism organization in this reign.
Haleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who should be killed according to the U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities in the region by a number of rats who met their vehicle next to the city Miran Shah in the province of North-Waziristan.
The official authorities reported that the rakes were shocked by a Drug type which was used by the CIA in the unlawful stage of Pakistan.
They went to a white vehicle in direction of the Afghan borders when the car was taken, said a member of a Pakistani civil secret service from Miran Shah per phone.
Local assaults that were suspected to belong to the militarys, slovened to the place and quickly took everything else from the "completely destroyed bodys".
The local authorities couldn't confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the US terrorism combated were uncertain to prove that Somalia belonged to the dead.
Somalia was described as a leader of the Al Kaida Military Planner, leading the operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghan Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspirations throughout the world, noted a leading official who wanted to remain anonym, and took place on the heavy character of the US air attacks on Pakistanian grounds.
If you take its central role as given, this includes the planning of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Kaida and implemented it in operational plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second American authorities said that Somalia was rapidly shooted in the Al-Kaida Heerarchia and had better connections with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, said the second authorities, but this is no way reduces the danger he represented for us and our associates.
If his death was confirmed, Somalia would be the second leader of Al Kaida or Taliban, who was killed since September, when a similar attack of Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a military group in the stage area and three other topactives were killed.
The time of the attacks by the CIA has fallen from a average of six operations per month, according to a collection of the Long War Journal, one of the websites maintained by a common organization.
The decline may based on improved tactics of the terrorism groups, which have taken steps to reduce their adversity and to kill brutally in the suspect, reported the page.
Leader United Nations Senders to Kabul will be returned
The leading Sender of UNO in Afghan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would return from his office in March, with a stirmical office that was completed by hearings on broad corruption in the Afghan presidential election supported by the United Nations.
The ice turns after the Obama government decided to send more than 30,000 US solvent data to Afghanistan.
The United Nations Sendment said that he supported the increase in the troops, but he also expressed his concerns that the US Headplan for Military Departure, which was intended to start in 18 months, could allow other NATO governments to defeat their forces.
We need to accelerate the construction of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, said Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also encouraging the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian helpers to assist Afghanistans in political restructuring.
He said that the increased troops on the military side must be increased on the civil side.
He said that he was not insured by his office, but only one agreement against his family in March 2008 to remain in Kabul only two years.
He said he wants to inform UNO.
The Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, now continues to take time to make a replacement.
What I said is that he's better starting looking for a follower, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my preachers and my arrival.
Ban has started searching for a replacement according to UN department.
The UN Defender said that he had taken into consideration the Swedish-Italic Staffan di Mistura, who had led the UN mission in Bagdad before recently, and the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who had led before United Nations peace operations.
The situation in Afghan was tested after his previous vice-president, Peter W. Galbraith, sent him in September to predict President Hamid Karzai in the country's election and to pronounce the massive election.
Eyede rejected all charges, but he also said that the accused of Galbraith was shocked - "the mission had unfortunately added damage, because there was already a great measure of skepsis regarding international infringement in the selection."
He said he recommended the appointment of a leading civil representative to coordinate the aid measures of the American forces in Afghanistan.
He also stressed that the United Nations leadership allowed its followers to set more staff from the United States and other Western countries that were employed for the Afghan mission, and said that this would strengthen their trust in it that their money would be used correctly.
He expressed his expression on the limitation of his forces in Afghanistan and said that the overall United Nations settings schemes have undertaken his possibilities to bring people able to it.
The United Nations rules are so trained that I have been since May, so he said that he could only make a person.
This is catastrophic and it must not continue.
US Defence Minister Gates: Iran must receive additional sanctions
Minister of Defence Robert M. Gates said that the world forces will soon be "additional sanctions" over Iran because he did not participate in meetings on its nuclear plans.
Gates spoke during a seven-day journey through the war areas in Afghanistan and in Iraq to a group of about 300 U.S. Solar Data in North Iraq and played the perspective of a military race against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran there are no good opportunities to choose, he said as a response to the question of a soldier to the probability of such development.
" One of the things I've been on the soul is, if we have learned something from Iraq in the last six years, which will be inevitable to the war."
The Obama Government considers a sanction package which results in the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also relate to the average Iranians.
He said that a "pack of positive and negative incentives" is necessary "to convince the Iranian government that it is in reality less protected with nuclear weapons", because "his people will suffer unnecessary" among the sanctions.
On Friday, in an opinion by the speaker of the White House, Robert Gibbs, the American Government, urged the European Spiritists in warning that the Irani must receive a "credible" consequence if it does not follow the requests of the UN Security Council and its Atom Monitoring Organization, the International Atomic Energy Authority.
Iran continues to emphasize that the knowledge of nuclear technology should only be winned for peaceful purposes.
In the meeting in Geneva, on 1 October, the Irani said that he would re-accepte the discussions to restrict his nuclear programme and reject a significant part of his stock file in the exchange of uranium necessary for urgent nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The US government has pressed this kind of agreement to build confidence between the two parties and win time for negotiations.
However, since this time, Iran seems to have left the negotiations on the provisional agreement - in part, experts - because the Iranian leadership is unnecessary of whether they should be bound to the United States.
The fact that Iran has simply adopted the international community with respect to some proposals that they had already agreed at the beginning of October, has clearly stated that the international community, including Russia and China, had collected a way in which they never had been connected with important additional sanctions for Iran.
President Obama has established the 31th December for Iran to react to these proposals before he continued to follow other options, including the Minister of Foreign Affairs Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "pressing sanctions".
In an opinion issued in New York, the Iranian delegation condemned the United Nations, which it was called on Thursday "unfair and unfunded audits" of some members of the Security Council to the Iranian Atomic activities and said they are willing to continue the meetings with the United States and five other world forces "to achieve a appropriate long-term solution".
Gates, who had to return to Washington last Friday, met the Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki morning before he fled in the oil of the curdic region in Iraq with soldiers in Kirkuk and the curdious authorities in Irbil.
The spectrums between the shorts and the Arab majority in Iraq are still high, in particular regard to borders, property rights and because of the distribution of public revenues.
Gates stripped both sides to turn the potential of conflict to prevent the delays of the US plans to cut the American troop force until the end of August 115,000 to 50,000.
Gates also tried to destroy the curdious concerns about the previous armed disappearance. The U.S. Delegated Gates, who was sent to Masud Barzani, President of the curd regional government, said: "We will receive your security, your welfare and your autonomie within a single Iraq.
We won't leave you."
A course change in older China
Wang Weijia and her husband were rounded by propaganda platetings, who claimed to them that "Mothers of the Earth is sweet to keep more children" and "A child more means a grabe."
These lessons have learned so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, who immediately started by the low-building rate and the older people in this summer, have changed the course and encouraged young couples to have more than a child, their answer was directly and finally: "If no case."
We've already invested all our time and energy in a child.
For a second child there's nothing else, Wang, 31, a personal leader with a 8-month old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the One Child Policy in China, which has produced two generations of notoricly dictic, sweet individuals who are called "picture Caiser" in the country, is a country's crisis.
The average burden rate is at 1,8 children per pair compared to 6 at the time that this policy is enforced, the UNO is in force.
Department for Population Questions has been determined, while the number of population groups of 60 years and older in 2020 of 16.7% of the population up to 2050 to 31.1% of the explosive rate, which is much more than the global average of about 20%.
The inequality is stronger in rich coasts with a formed population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and elders were almost 22% of the reported Shanghai's inhabitants, while the birth rate has been located under a child per pair.
Xie Lingli, Leader of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, said that couples must be obtained in the productionable age of children in order to "assum the relationship of older population and to reduce the lack of the future."
Shanghai will soon be "as old - but not as rich - like the industrial countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A slowly deployment
In the Constitution of the country in 1978, China would likely be the restraint available by the dominant communist party to this day.
Marriages who are contrary to this policy must be accepted with a huge financial penalty - up to their three-year terms in some regions - and with discrimination to their workplace.
Chinese State representatives have stated this policy that the critical claim of natural resources could have been avoided, whereas human rights infringements condemned in the implementation of the policy.
In rural areas, some employees who have already had a child have obligation to defeat their children.
In addition, many couples had led to sexual selective displacements, which resulted in an unanimously high relationship between men and women.
In the past few years, government representatives have slowly declined their position towards a Kind Policy.
They authorized more exceptions of the rules - including urban populations, ethnic minorities and cases where both husband and wife have been individual children - and 2007 has been reduced the sound of many hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institut for Populations of the University of Peking, said that government partners have even discussed radical changes, for example, allow couples of two children in which a partner is individual.
Shanghai was initiated in July to the first Chinese city that has started a aggressive campaign to promote more gentlemen.
Plakats, who taught the families to have only a child, were almost replaced by directives that describe detailedly who ask for a second child and how to request the approval.
The city management has sent city officers and volunteers for family planning to visit couples homes and move information papers under the doors.
It also requests to provide a psychological and financial advice for those who have more than a child.
The reaction was not just comfortable, said family planning representatives.
Understanding reaction
While officials from a small rural town in the foreign areas of Shanghai said that an incentive is to recognise the requests of pairs, which would like a second child after the campaign, but not a change in the urban districts.
In the community of Huani with a population of 115,000, for example, only four to five applications for month.
Shanghai officials say that the number of gentlemen in the city, despite the campaign, is still at about 165,000 - something higher than 2009, but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, director of the Family Planning Committee of the Shanghai Community Caolu, said that financial considerations may be the main basis, why many people don't want to have more children.
They want to give their first ones the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children, and that is also legally permitted.
But they have, as many Chineses, only a low illness and life insurance of the government.
Without a social network, they say that this decision would be inresponsive.
People in the West estimate the One Child Policy fairly as human rights question, said Yang, a constructor whose woman is pregnant in the seventh month.
Yeah, we're gonna have a chance to have more than a child.
But the problem is not just in a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their teeth.
Wang, the staff leader, said she only wants a child because she was also a single child. "We were the center of the family and we lived that everyone was careful about us.
We don't want to care for others, and we do not really want to do this."
Chen Siian, a 42-year-old boy who heard a translation company, said it was unbefore.
For parents from the media state with double carriage, by which the grain rates, he said that it turns out to be successful and that is necessary to be selfish.
The 20-39-year-old group was to see their parents in the early days of China's capitalism experience, and they wouldn't want to live in no way for themselves, said he.
An individual child, he said, makes huge requirements at the time of parents.
A mother must give her social life at least for two years.
Then there's a space question -- "If you have to build your apartment" -- and the life planning -- "When the child is 9 months old, you have to have a life course for the best schools."
Most of his friends are ready to take this one, said Chen, but not two times.
Our generation is the first who has reached a higher standard of life, he said.
We don't want to bring too many victims.
UNO Group develops Plan for Emission Reducing
The climate conference supported by the UNO -- which until now has been expressed by wild possen and mutual accusions -- has re-established on Friday with the publication of a document, which involves a decrease of the greenhouse gas for the next 40 years, with the greatest burden of the industry in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis of a final political agreement on the rule of greenhouse gas, has shown both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But he was considered a major progress in a negotiation that is timely, since the next week more than 100 sponsor politicians from all the world will be reached in Kopenhagen.
The text, which was formulated by the UN working group for its own purpose, is the amount of money that rich countries should give to the poor countries so that this short-term and long-term warming can improve the global warming.
It also provides a palette of options for key issues, including industrial and large weaken countries, to limit their coal emissions and to the higher limit value of the global temperature increase that the political decision-makers would bring.
The process will provide a great flexibility, so John Coequy, the leading representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has designed the sixth document, has a 180-page negotiation text to put it into the central point, which has called the leading UNO climate protection partner, Yvo de Boer, as "the whole".
It shows the fundamental risk of a possible agreement, in which industrial activities together with their emissions by 2020 by 25 to 45 per cent, compared to the border values of 1990, would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent in the same period, while the greater developing countries would reduce their emissions from 15 to 30 per cent.
Countless, countries could reduce emissions by 2050 to 50 to 95%.
The European Community has also provided the meetings on Friday by safeguarding the next three years to prepare 3,6 billion US dollars a year to support countries to adapt the impacts of climate change, from the master of overcome and drunk until the prevention of discharge.
The Friday, however, took the same burned fireworks that had determined the meetings in the last week.
The American Climate Special Deputy Todd Stern rejected formulations that are binding the emissions of greenhouse gas emissions for industrial countries compared with voluntary reductions for larger levels, demanding, if not to be financed by industrial transactions.
This train announced that the Obama government runs a worse line with China as representatives of the Bush government two years ago.
The United States will not sign agreements without taking up larger level countries and take steps, so the stars that also claimed that the text was not enough to ensure that the decline could also be confirmed from outsides.
Star gave his opinion an hour after the statement of the Chinese Vice-Minister He Yafei, who advised that it would eat the leading American climate partners or eat "the conspiration" or was "est inresponsive" by him that he said at the beginning of the week that the United States would not be financially helped to improve global warming.
As the future economic marking of large world forces is on the game, both within the industry and between industrial activities and weak countries have been broken lines.
The present fight is equal to the salvation of separate economies, as well as the salvation of the planet, while China and the United States defend themselves because of their respective commitments, while the more poorer countries said that the two of the most influent countries would ignore the scientific need to take more valuable measures.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the great forces are fighting in order to bring the costs for the burden of the gas expense, since even those countries concerned have been overlooked to continue aggressively to the countries with a very high gas allocation for their dealings.
This is a very clear game, which will develop a new economic priority, so Ulate, also as regional climate change advisers for Conservation International in Mexico and the Mediterranean.
Some of the countries who have been most strengthened by the impact of climate change showed that they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say that the discussions would be in the best case towards a political agreement.
The alliance of the small islands with 43 members has presented a 24-party contract project on Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzager, who is leading to international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the opening of the small islands 'political pressure on the whole political process', partly because they are connected now and call for measures from the weak countries, such as China and India.
The discussions are a new urgency when delegates focused on the fact that most of the open issues are still to be declared before the government leaders arrived.
High Representatives, such as the Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Vice-Minister discovered their flights and slowed by the gangs of the Bella-Center to meetings after closed doors and press conferences to delay Claims that were negotiated during the next week.
The pure scale of the congregation - 13.000 people are in the Congress Centre daily and out of the night shows that have been organized on the countries who are deceived and sell their views, and contract proposals will be made on hand instead of e-mail - is already a challenge.
Intensity is just just up: nearly all the important ministers are here and from midnight will be 60 government leaders in Kopenhagen.
We come to the Oberliga, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President for the Global Policy of the Organization Conservation International.
The weight comes.
Britain first 225 km/h fast train defines the feeling of moon new
Sunday morning at 5:13, a slightly shock will shoot the darkness to announce an adjacent trail that represents a revolution in the transport in Britain.
The first high speed rate in the country will be reached at his bridge from Ashfort, Kent, to London to St. Pancras 225 km/h and get 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, then Mrs. Kelly Holmes will be appointed on the border of the first Javelin Pendent Service from London.
He hopes that the new service of the United Kingdom will finally be connected to an internationally faster, reliable trading network and connected to the largest areas of the Middle East, North and Scotia in London.
The unnecessary province could be living pending cities, the workways would be radially reduced and the change of aircraft and cars would reduce the national carbon emissions and the stage on the road.
In the theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billion British pounds that are required for the construction of a new national ski network, which are inevitably planning assaults and fears of environmental damage, could still lead to the breasts of the British high speeds.
High Speed 2 (HS2), a company founded in January that the Government will present a guideline study, will comply with Lord Adonis, according to the Times, the report on 30 December.
This provides a detailed round card of the next stage of high speed network planned.
The new trail line which London is to connect to the West Midlands will lead to a play space of five meters to urban areas and to places where the impacts on the environment are surrounded.
The plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final road.
HS2 is also to create three options for a higher, northeastern network of high speed.
Lord Adonis will react in the spring.
The proposed option is a Y-food direction which would lead to the West Middle East.
The route would share in or near Birmingham and a distance in the west of the Peninsians to Manchester and Skotland and another in direction to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle on Tyne.
A single line would lead to Skotland.
"It seems to be the best functioning option," said a rail insider.
After the completion, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would reduce at 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first part track that would not be opened before 2025, it would allow travelers to return the London-Birmingham trails in 49 minutes, comparing with today something over a hour.
The designs made the trends the possibility of walking with a speed of 400 km/h, which would be the fastest European shipping network.
The first trail was planned so that 400 meters long trails with a maximum capacity of 1.100 people.
Up to 18 trips could be operated on the road of London-Birmingham by hour.
This would again mean that it would be necessary for a final station in London to be completed at 20,000 travelers per hour.
In view of the space limits in the capital city, an existing station would be developed to submit the high speed network.
Bahn experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will inform whether this plan should be continued or not, but the long-term public consultation and planning measures means that a final decision will be taken only after the Parliament's choice.
But even if it moves the roots, the shift network must be built in sections.
The journeys should first be changed from high speed trails on existing skilines in the north of Birmingham, which would continue to be between London and Skotland over three hours.
This applies as a decisive switch point to ensure a change from the flight to the rail, a direct measure for the shift revolution.
Taxes are paid for hypotheque for 75,000 pounds of a conservative
Alan Duncan, the leader of the conservators, has taken into account the taxpayer per year thousands of funds for the costs of a parentary, which he reads in his residence house in his election circle.
The prison speaker of the party, who was degraded by David Cameron, because he decreased that under-house members must live "for magnificent ratios", has increased its hypotheke at about 75,000 pounds of pounds to allow a cowboy building in Rutland to build its second house.
He tried to take account of the taxpayer's additional interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The responsibilities of the underhouse have been approved at that time and were not investigated by Sir Thomas Legg, which carried out a review of the expenditure of the sub-house members. Last night Duncan said that the applications could not be "unless more clean or more comprehensive".
Duncan, one of the richest sub-house members, has a double house in a village in its election quarter Rutland and Melton.
The nearby houses have reached a price of almost a million pounds (1,1 million euros).
The earthquake has included kitchen, living room and room, but the fees office, a sub-home control station, agreed that Duncan needs more place.
Last year he built a winter garden, which is called "Orangerie" in the plans.
Neighbors describe him as a "Glas House for Entertainment".
Duncan has not also been requested by the Committee on Standards and Privileges during a recent investigation of its previous hypothetical contracts to take a position to increase the monetary recovery.
The Committee has released him last month after the investigation of its expenditure from the burden of the rules.
Duncan has transferred the security for a hypotheke over 271.406 pounds (300,000 euro) from his London house to his electoral house, which he had purchased 1991, a year before his election to the Member of Parliament.
This weekly document shows that Duncan has returned to March for about 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) per month as hypothekenzine.
In April, there were more than 1,800 pounds of euros (2,000 euros) per month.
The interest rate of Duncans RBS-Hypothek has not changed during this time, which closely indicated that the total increase in the financing of the financing of EUR 75.000 (85,000).
The normal RBS symptoms of the normal RBS symptoms exceeded 7.94% in December 2007 to 4% in March of this year, where it is still there.
The latest documents published in the sub-house show that Duncan continued to be entitled to 1.250 pounds per month (1.400 euros).
In September, Duncan lost his posts as an opposition leader in the underhouse, after a sub-cover reporter filmed him after the expenditure channel said that the member of Parliament would live "for master reasons".
"It means if you work for the State that you have to live from major reasons and how to treat S***e."
He said, "I have issued my money for my gardens, and I have led to a disappearing little part, measuring what is heard.
And I could require the whole sum, but I don't do it."
The parliamentary member, from his previous carriage, was the first time in May attacked because of his expenditure, as clear that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden before he explained the fees Office that this could be "experiencing an application".
A aktivist has seen as a protest in Duncans race a loch in the form of a pound mark after being known for a period of three years.
When he was asked last night about the increased hypotheke, Duncan said, "This was approved by the fees office and then from Legg to increase the value."
He added: "There is no debate on the explanations and explanations or a prohibition of the rules or similarities.
Everything is perfectly overviewable and strictly moves within the rules, it is approved and everything.
It couldn't be cleaner and clearer."
It comes all of her believers to admire Brightons Beach Hot calendars
Strand fabrics in Brighton found a new life content for winter months as an interactive advent calendar.

The idea about the beach-feeding calendar began in conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is so fantasticly creative and living and we try to express this by our spirituality."

The cases of geography and history, Chatel, are strengthened from the school reform of Lyceen.
The National Education Minister Luc Chatel explained in an interview that appeared in the Sunday Journal of the Sunday that the cases of geography and history are strengthened from the school reform of Lyceen, even if they are not binding in the terminal (12th school year).
"The students of the First School (11 school year) now have all four weeks and the same program" confirms Mr Chatel.
For the Minister, "muss will be surprised to overcome this grain", because after him, "the scientific profile is no longer scientific profile", but the whole concentration is "the best student".
"The economic and social and literary profile (ES and L) must not be a subprofile of the scientific", he continued to stated, "I have not yet heard many historical and intellectuals that had not been recommended in the terminal on technical lycéens."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey appeared in humanity that nearly seven of ten French (69%) the public project of resolving the obligatory education in history and geography in the terminal S (12th year school with scientific profile) was criticized. Many teachers and intellectors also joined this project as well as the links and some representatives of the rights.
The Minister answered that there was no question regarding a restriction of the philosophy of the terminal program S.
Luc Chatel also defended the educational reform for teachers, while 16 organizations (studys and workshops) were called to protest against the project, which their views were to be sacrificed by the future teachers in Pedagogic training.
The Minister concluded that they were subjected to a special assessment check at Master 2 (M2) at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year of an authorisation test, in which their educational skills were examined.
In addition, they are conducting practices during the year in M2 and then taught a year before the students as a teacher in practice.
He continued to say: "If you all add practical practices offered before the performance test, you have reached more than 300 hours that you have passed before the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
Finally, the Minister stated that he wants to offer the "individual law on education" - a case that does not exist in the public education.
He reaffirmed that he wanted to complete the school card until 2012.
15 minutes for climate at the "Ecole Normal Suerte"
Fifty minutes to speak about the use of the Copenhagen Supper, which is the challenge of the Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change", on Saturday tomorrow at the Ecole Normale Suite in the Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As a journalist of the AFP identified, the Nobel Prize Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Eerest" conferences, with a number of experts every fiveteen minutes with a set of contributions to the public.
You want to do something to reach the people and feel more to learn in them, Edouard Hannezo explained, 22 years and one of the organizations today at the border of the conference. The name of this event is back to the name that students have given the fishes at the base of the school.
"The experts were selected for the twelve discussion participants, even after their charisma," he expressed.
"In climate warming you can speak a long time, but the nuclear goals can also be displayed in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, whose only 50 people were free with the help of shelters.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he said in the hope that the listeners might take out that "the Conference of Kopenhagen is based on an absolutely severe scientific docter."
The videos rounded by these conferences will be found online on the side of the school from 15 December.
The next "Earst" day is planned for February and will take place every two months later.
Payment allocation : Abominable prison warrant, actions planned
The workshops of the prison officials have called on Friday on a general day of action to achieve that the premiums and overtimes whose payment was taken from budget reasons to January will be overlooked before Christmas feasts.
The 2. Workshop of the Criminal Officers ("FO-Penitentiary") requested the employees who had no service to demonstrate and block them on the "the steel of what they are up to them" on Tuesday morning before the Criminal Office.
The 3. Workshop of Criminal Appeal Officers ("CGT Penitentiary") calls for "a strong mobilization in the various prisons" to which the non-payment of the overtimes, night adventures attacked in October, and the sun and holiday events in December will be burned as a "strange and inacceptable market".
The first committee of the Criminal Officers, the Federal Strafstall Unit (UFAP/UNSA), called "general mobilizations (...) to demonstrate the inadequacy and anger".
The Leader of the Criminal Office and the Ministry of Justice declared that the overtimes were strongly increased in 2009 and not all in the budget, but they ensure that the remaining requirements are paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice reported on the night, Michele Alliot-Marie has sent a letter to the committees of the prison officials, in which it is guaranteed that payment is performed in the next month.
"I really know the efforts of the staff to maintain and modernize our criminal system", the Minister of Justice shares in this letter.
"I have indicated the leadership of the Criminal Office to take immediate action to ensure that a situation that has occurred by lack of assessing the overtimes is not repeated in the future," said Mrs. Alliot-Marie.
The decrease of December is therefore more important, except for the managerial, which is in the genuinely high service and target prices, the UFAP/UNSA, for which the "budgetary duties" must be maintained.
"This is a absolute skandal," the interregional FO association in Marseille recommends, and announces that "all congregations and training" will be typical to new instructions.
"The staff does not go to work on sun and holidays when the hours of October have not yet been paid. This is also applicable for their overtimes," the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne threats.
"In a time when we are always more buried, without being set up more staff, the attempt to spend on the staff's money, more than inadequate measure," says the CGT community of Bordeaux.
According to the workshops, the situation is not equal in all regions, some are less affected than other.

Euro-2009/Course Railways: First place for Bousquet on its favorite distance
The Francose Fréderick Bousquet, three-fold medaille winners at the Swimming Mediterranean Mediterraneans 2009, has received an international title on his loved distance, 50m free style, at the Euro-2009 short trails in Istanbul.
On the first day of this struggle, which was allowed the Polyurethane tours last time, there were only three world records while they were expected to be a real record flow.
A record was improved by the Hungary Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m Lagens and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50m Lagen of the Lords.
Injury for Bousquet, who wanted to attack the world's record at 50m freestyle, which he holds in the large cut (20.94).
At one of the two king distances in the sweet, 50m-freistil, the 28-year-old Francose was in 20.53 sec, in a finale with ten swimming swimming pools at the start (in general it is eight) - a premium at international level.
But Bousquet urged the Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), not to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"It can be more likely to believe, and in this case, I said, if the world reset is in my reign, I'll try it."
As Bousquet, almost all the swimming in Polyurethanan trains were prohibited since 1 January 2010.
With 238 World Records since February 2008, these combinations ended their epos in Istanbul, which began in 1999 at the same competitive campaign.
The use of the combination has not been paid this time for the German Paul Biedermann, two times World Master in the cut of this summer in Rome and World Record, at the end.
The young sleeves did not have to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77) but he has implemented himself with the secondest time in his career (3:34.55), before the Russian Nikita Lobintsiv (3:35.75) and Denmark Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I didn't give everything this time.
I knew that I couldn't reduce world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my task."
"Lobintsv will be a serious enemies in the future", said Biedermann.
USA : Graphboard estimated by Zola at $1,5 million
A Roman Grab plate that was calculated at the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated on Thursday at 1.5 million US Dollar over its value, so the artist of Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It is from the IIIth century after Christ and has always been evaluated by $150,000 to $250,000.
The Marmor, in the "treat scenes of Dionyso in a sophisticated architecture of satyrens and bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five scenes in the world," explained Florent Heintz, Vice-President for the Proliferation of Roman and Egyptian Antiquities at Sotheby's, on Tuesday to the AFP.
It was sold under hundreds of pieces.
"The seller still sells, but this part is with safety the most offered to the buyers until now," says the speaker of Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy towards the AFP.
The discovery of this acquirement of the marble part by Emile Zola is far away.
The plate was almost 300 years old in Rome, in the famous collection of the Borghese family, and then she took parts for the French shooter Cécile Sorel, who used in their bathrooms in Paris Hotels, and was at Paul Reynaud, Minister of the IIIth French Republic and President of the Council, before Marshall Pétain came to the power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
In visiting the database of the Louvre, heintz found that this plate was part of a "Earbe of Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of the "thehese Raquin" and Fresko "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelayas Travel Research from Honduras direction Mexico has been covered
On Thursday, Mexico had the conditions for the transfer of the Dutch President Manuel Zelaya in the homeland not more agreed than after it was rejected by the Putsch government as inacceptable.
After a telephone conversation on the night with President Zelaya, it seems to be cleared that there is a single way to implement this transfer, the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa, explained.
According to the immigration authority, the aircraft carried out by the Mexican Government was returned to its starting location at the mid-day afternoon in Salvador for the purpose of transmission of Mr Zelayas.
The Putsch government wanted to need Mr. Zelaya to "bedank" and ask for political asylum in the foreign.
However, the struggled President rejected this because he wanted to return to Mexico as a very welcome, administrative head of State.
The Putsch regime "it was a renewed misconduct by trying to move me to my expenses (...), they wanted to thank you", said on Thursday M. Zelaya against Radio Globo, in which he has been talking to words since the beginning of the political crisis in the United States for five months.
I can stay here a good and pleased ten years, and I have added my guitar, the smooth President, who had fled to the Brazilian message of Tegucigalpa two months ago.
The Mexican message has made us a request for the delivery, which we, however, could not accept, since it does not include asylum, has stated in the midday Oscar Raul Matute, Minister of Interior of the Putsch Government, towards the Hungary Radio HRN.
I'm looking for no country on asylum, Manuel Zelaya had answered in an interview with the telescope channel, whose seat is situated in Caracas.
A possible exit from Honduras, so he had understood, would only be chaired as President of the Honduras people.
The plants for a travel Mr. Zelayas were mobilized at midnight the attendants of the murdered President, who had taken place to the Brazilian message and had assembled around this, where the military had strengthened its use.
The Brazilian Deputy Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the Putsch government.
This, as its appreciation, reveals the marginal character of this Government in view of international standards.
Zelaya, who was closed to the Socialist President Hugo Chavez, was sent on 28 June, on the day of his organized people's survey to prepare his re-electment, with the advisory of the Supreme Court, the Army and the Congress.
From his exil in Costa Rica, he was surprised to return on September 21 and fled into the Brazilian message.
If he leaves this, he will be arrested because of the Supreme Court which he is accused of the Justice, so the Putsch government.
Roberto Micheletti, President of Putsch, has been able to organize a Presidency election on 29 November to resolve Mr. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was acknowledged by the United States in the course of the surrounding election, which was rejected by the Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, the Kogress had voted massively against Mr. Zelayas back to the office until the end of his mandate on 27 January.

In contrast, the unemployment reports in the United States have increased in all expectations in the last week and have now reached 474.000 demands.

Cuba: hundreds of partisans on the power of "Damas in Weiss"
Some hundreds of participants in the Cuban power, on Thursday, have carried out the wifes of political prisoners together in Havanna for the purpose of the World Human Rights Studio, and also joined another committee, as a result of a good doctrine deputy.
For the fourty "Dames in Wiss", the women or the midst of political prisoners, on the open street of the Government's partisans under Raul Castro, just as they were in the Fire March in the Headquarter of the capital to call the release of the political prisoners, a journalist of the AFP confirmed.
Neither with the Yankies!, "South!", "The Strasse belongs to the Revolutionarys!", "It lives Fidel and Raul!", scanted the authorized partys with the faust faust of the dissidents.
The latter were disrupted by civilians that appeared to "turn their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "Damas in Weiss" was played at the pre-audience in Havanna, which has not come to detention, nor to detention.
However, in the city of Vedado, a twelve dissidents, who also attended the Demonstration held on Thursday at the international human rights stage, immediately arrested by civil police, confirmed a reporter of the AFP.
According to this journalist, the police have engaged in enhancing violence in civil vehicles by the partisans of the Government.
The interim arrest of dissidents under such circumstances is normally limited to a few hours.
As advisers at the 2005 European Parliament's prices, "Dames in Weiss" have organized a non-accepted routine for the purpose of the "Bete for the release of all political prisoners", whose number of dissidents' listed around 200 persons, declared Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda has a prison penalty for 20 years.
Mr. Maceda is part of the group of Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, from which up to 53 guests are seized.
The Cuban authorities shall accept the regimen opposers as "South" or "agents" in the service of the declared surgery, the United States.
A rationality is that the Cuban television awaited the report of the demonstration events held on Thursday between military pro government combats and "contra-revolutionary."
The unity party, the Communist Party, is regularly condemned by the European or American NRO of the unification of rights and freedoms, in particular of the freedom of opinion.
Incredibly killing eighth years with the grain and after 5 lost in Clichy-la-Garene
One with two messengers weakened swimming swimming day on Wednesday at the main business time in Clichy-la-Garène (Hauts-de-Seine) killed an eightty-year-old and suffered five other people.
The 28-year-old anxiety had injured the age of eight hundreds of years in or before a pharmaceutical on the Boulevard Jean-year with two messengers and, accordingly, the police attacks were subject to the presence of Witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, has led to the consequences of his infringements in the hospital.
In or before the same pharmaceutical, he had a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, nearly in the triangles, was attacked and been blessed.
The first two victims were sent seriously injured to the hospital where the 18-year-old age died.
The other injury is in life, since he has been obviously affected by political sources, living bodies.
The pregnant woman has become bad because of the events, and she will be hospitalized according to a police source in the "shock condition".
The armed man, who seems to be in a police attack under alcohol or drug influence, should also be encouraging on the streets that the same boulevard Jean Jaure is being the same.
He had had been blessed two other passengers, obviously unexpectedly: a thirty-year-old and a fourty-year-old, and the last ones of two are difficult.
The scenario remained in the dark night.
He was armed with two meats, which he slaughtered behind the back, declared before Arnaud Presse, a responsible person of the syndicate alliance of the skin-de-seine area.
Several passengers, including young people, should have tried to spend on the reports made by the AFP, according to the reports of the AFP.
I saw a guy in the three shifts with a green West.
Three youths tried to smile.
They did not, because the man was well built, reported Alberto, a clever of a close bar.
One horse is over him, he adds, including a city police that shocked the hands.
Still on the Boulevard Jean-Jauren, on the height of the house number 61, have two city polices, including their employer, tried to take the armed man and have been damaged with shoes, so police information.
The event has been played in one of Clichy-la-Garènes' headquarters, where there are a number of businesses.
Passengers have come to me to tell me that there's a tragic person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person on the ground, I put it in the first help and noticed a shocking wound in the magic area, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmaceutical pharmaceutical, the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about three-year-old person has been injured by snippets.
Employment forces of the State Police have uncomfortablely arrested the man who had no reports.
The State Authority of Nanterre has carried out the central report of the Criminal Policevirs of the Lake (SDPJ 92).
The Hospital has been hospitalized on Thursday.
In view of his status, it has not yet been legally entitled.
A police source does not swear that he's put into a nervenheel hall.
As a result of another police source, it was six police police officers to spend him on the police commissariat in Clichy where he was taken.
He was "in a state of transgression" as "all spiritually conquerors of this kind, in which the forces were free during the slaughter."
USA: Polandski's lawyer requests to reiterate criminal persecution
The lawyer of the French and Poland filmmaker Roman Polanski has requested a repeated meeting on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, the United States), to leave the penalty against his mandate, which is at the time in his residence in Switzerland because of a later slaughter of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, lawyer of the "Pianist" in the second district of California, has planned three judiciarys in the negotiation period of 1977.
I call on the place of Strafterlass, Mr. Hummel, before he added that the conduct of the negotiation at the time of the negotiation with the judge Laurence Rittenband "is a cold walks down the back."
He said that Roman Polanski had paid the house of the court before he was slaughtered with a State lawyer who had to say that Roman Polanski had paid a serious error.
This debate was designed in the documentary film "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and adhered) by the investigating lawyer David Wells.
Mr. Wells had finally declared that the authors of the documentarch film "basses".
If the Court refuses to establish the criminal procedure, Mr Hummel requests the direction of a process that would allow him to present the evidence for his arguments.
The complaint has reiterated the evidence already explained in the first instance, i.e. a debate on the restraint of the facts set by the accused to last cannot be severely taken into consideration, until Roman Polanski does not appear in court.
The 76-year-old government was fled from the United States in 1978, but even before the criminality is being carried out for "ilgaal sexual relations" with a child of 13 years of age.
Since this time he's not going to the United States.
The advocate of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, had declared that Roman Polanski had to be there to attend the negotiation.
Do you want to distribute the message in this case, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other detainees, which is a possibility of escape?, Mrs. Asayma asked.
You think that the filmmachers are "by the Court of Justice for a Case and therefore declare its authority".
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days of time to make known their decision – even showed, "it's still made other refugee alternatives".
Hummel was not the only one who had requested the punishment against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also requested the restraint of the criminal procedure.
She recalled that her client wouldn't take it anymore, by re-re-relivering the affairs of Polanski, and added: "Nobody in this room can say that this procedure was right.
twenty-third years are enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on an American prison order.
After two months after he was passed back to the guests, he was sentenced in the expectation of a possible delivery to the house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad.

The tendency was supported by the publication of better economic indicators as expected to have contributed to "achieving the market view to the solvency of the rebuilding of the economy", the analyticals of Charles Schwab together.
In the United States, the sales in the individual trade in November increased by 1,3 %, thus two months behind and far more than expected.
Furthermore, the confidence of the American consumers has significantly improved in December, while at 73.4 to 67.4 in the previous month, according to the index perspective of the University of Michigan.
However, the Index was broken by a new increase in the dollar rate, which has reached the highest stand against the euro for two months, by pressing 'the sectors of the economic situation', stated Owen Fitzpatrick, German Bank.
Technological values have lost something on grounds.
The obligation market has declined.

Selecting Miss World again in South Africa
After a month, the 112 candidates on the title of Miss World will be overwhelmed by South Africa on Saturday, to make their dreams: to be selected to the most beautiful woman of the world and to watch this billion of television.
While this great beauty measure, which is seen for the second time in the area of Johannesburg, has already been cut their ticket to half-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kayane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada have been cut in the course of their African residence towards missing sports or even Miss Topmodel.
This was a real structure of comfort.
Beauty cities, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cap Hoorn, were simply extraordinary.
I have seen many things and done all the experiences!” said Ms. Sierra Leone with full enthusiasm.
This competition is located nine times in South Africa and will live on Saturday, from 17 p.m. (15 p.m.) from Midrand, north of Johannesburg.
I couldn't imagine a better country to send my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have done this experience twice, Mrs. World Ksenia Sukhinova understood in the hotness of South African summer.
For the young Russians, her second residence in South Africa was marked by numerous experience exchanges with candidates and the rediscovering of "landscapes" in South Africa.
After a month of Galas, trials, contacts with the press and Safari, the badness is now focused on the competition.
The Inderin Pooja Chopra hopes to come in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, chosen 2000 and will also be present at this choice, as well as to follow Aishwarya Rai, chosen in 1994 and both Bollywood stars.
Of course, it's the dream of each woman, once as the most beautiful woman of the world, but it's not just about the look.
We are posters of our country, and I want to go home with the Krone, Mrs. India takes a wide laugh.
According to the events, this 59th output is understood with music and dance.
The candidates defil in traditional struggles and not to forget in the bathroom.
The idea is presented by a television-moderator, China Angela Chow, from the former beautiful king of South Africa, Michelle McLean and a responsible member of the Ms. World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has demonstrated that it has been wise to receive the world with an untranslated heart and pride, assured Julia Morley, Chairman of Miss World.
The candidates have made, as last year, a safari, the famous cityship in Soviet, but this time costs the bike and the local kitchen.
However, the meeting with the South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them the hand.
Not usually for a head of State, Mrs. Sierra Leone noted.
Its most beautiful memory, however, remains uncertainly the exclusion in Capstadt (South West) to the football environment in June 2010, to make a kind of country more for this event.
I'm wrong with people that I'm probably never going to get closer to me.
I will return with security to the World Meeting 2010, promised Mrs. Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive" according to his son David.
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "severly positive", assured his son David on Friday at his arrival at the airport of Los Angeles, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital for a few days.
The news is very positive.
He's very strong, it's all very good, David Hallyday of the Press explained when he went out of the airport, where he took from Paris a few hours after the local time (21.00 mEZ).
The son of the songer, who made an outstanding impression, assured that he would "accepte" to the hospital of Cedars-Sinai, was sent to the Johnny Hallyday on Monday because of a bacterial infection after an operation at a band shock in Paris on 26 November.
The songer was "what night in Los Angeles was taken into an artistic coma to lift his strong pains and to carry out his treatment, the press service was known.
Johnny Hallyday was transferred by the doctors of the Hospital Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles in a artistic coma in which he was sent to Paris on Monday because of a bacterial infection of follow-up to a band band board operation on 26 November.
The songer had to return to an operation from midnight on Thursday after the late invasion.
His wife Laeticia took part in a school meeting in the French gymnasium of Los Angeles, where her daughter Jade went to school, set a photograph of the AFP.
The chief of the orthopedic and traumatical surgery office in the Hospital Pitié-Salpesterère, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the songs at Monday in Los Angeles.
The producer has hardly struck the Neuro surgery Dr. Stephane Delajoux, who sang the songs in the International Clinic of Monceau Park in Paris on November 26.
We've been declared he's set up the cleanest masscher.
The Chirurgs of Los Angeles said they were totally disappointed, Mr. Camus.
I have heard that you may be introducing a court proceedings, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus is the view that Johnny Hallyday is "too fast and this is going on with the Permission of Pariser Chirurg to Los Angeles".
I phoned with this doctor who assured me that he looked like this journey is very unfair, which was very surprised to me, since I already had two band board operations behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he was known to RTL that the songer seemed to have left the hospital after the operation "no dragon, without all."
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artlermileue.
He had the magicians, Marie Trintignant, operated a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Newilly-sur-sea, where he practiced at this time.
In 2007, he also operated the magicians Charlotte Gainsburg in order to restore a hammer after a brain explosion.
But he is also a doctor with doubtless call that has been sentenced again because of misleading transactions and not to forget, because of tax interruption and fraud.
Me Olivia Metzner, the lawyer of the doctor's chamber, has called him "one man without skrupel" who has the responsibility of "regularly" before the room, and is "all other than recommendation."
After a few days of the Swedish Dr. Stefane Delajoux gave a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
This declared that the intervention would be "perfect" and the post-operative investigations would have been "normal".
The operation "rides no blood and therefore does not require a dragon", he added.
In any case, the tournament of the songer seems to be questioned, whose health problems have been dealt with since the summer.
It is very clear that there is something to do for the continuation of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens), Mr Camus.
The EU for the French Democracy will be energetic and calls for the Party to use its victory no longer
The Participation, which is oversighted by François Bayrou's Party MoDem, has reacted strongly on Friday at an overseeing of the Sieg, founded by Valery Giscard d'Estaing, on the side of the Chairman of the Party of the New York Centre, Hervé Morin, and asked him to use this seat on no document.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his hope to take this UDF segel, since he believes that François Bayrou would not be worth defending this political heritage after he had the left hand.
The Defence Minister, whose partner is the UNMP, also wanted to strengthen this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In the light of his efforts, he has received the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (hereinafter UMP, now with the NC), which has received a right to the property of the UDF Mark, as he first requested this brand in 2004 at the "Institut national de la propriété industrial".
However, the swimming parliamentary office of François Bayrous' friends observed the Swedish and clearly understood that they did not have the right to leave to the Minister and to the Member of Androng a legal persecution a period of time to use this victory and to bring them to the property rights of the Mark.
In the last few days you have made many statements that you would propose your political movement, the UDF segel to + over+, wrote the party membership in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 officers, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarness, the party Modem and Senator Jean Arthuis of the centralist municipality.
You also thought you had the right to print the name of this movement +Noveau centre+, the slogan + the current UDF +, on their political material and on the start page of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, explained the UDF business office and calls for the NC to "remote the UDF name immediately from all materials and from (i.e.) sites".
Furthermore, Hervé de Charette was requested to transfer the rights of the Marke to its legal rights".
If you reject this, we will raise a complaint against you to respect the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signs warned.
In their letters, they stressed that "UDF" is a full political movement since 1978 and remembered that Morin and his friends "he took the choice" to leave this 2007 to establish a competitive movement, as they had already done in 2002 to found the "UMP" party.
The New Centre therefore has no right to use UDF segel (EU for French democracy) by the Subscribers.
They continue to remember that the last 2007 UDF conference has adopted the three-year-old accession to the Party Modem and the establishment of a business centre for the defence of the material and moral interests, founded by Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
What Hervé de Charette requests, the business office continues, "which was at the time he requested the brand names, not a member of the UDF, but the UMP for three years."
It benefits from skandaleus and betrugeral ways by lacking the interruption of the acronym UDF to carry out this for himself.
Furthermore, remember that this inheritance is the best way to turn into a crime, and ironisize the NC Strategy: "It seems to be more satisfied in the policy and in life to make a name instead of trying to come from the anonymity by adjusting a name on which you have no law."
Near Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Barnier is condemned by exploding weakness
On Friday, the Court of Nanterre decided to judge the artist François-Marie Bannier to determine whether he has the daughter of Liliane Bettencourt used a weak moment of the eighth years to spend part of his property.
The 62-year-old photograph, known for his Starfotos, will be responsible for the exploding of deficiencies in court on 15 and 16 April 2010, which will be sentenced with a punishment of more than three years and a currency penalty of EUR 375,000.
This decision means that in fact it will be given a process in this matter, which is the saga of one of the richest families of France, in which mother and daughters are frozen, and in the same time the clusters of the cosmetic Imperial L'Oreal are in the hand.
However, the 15th Criminal Chamber also ordered a medical investigation of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is conducted together by three doctors.
The head of L'Oréal has refused to undertake such investigation, especially not among the conditions presented by the State Authority of Nanterre.
The doctors called on Friday, before 10 March 2010, should submit a report where you have clearly known whether Liliane Bettencourt could have been found in a state of weakness.
I think she's going to undertake these investigations.
I will talk to her, the lawyer of Mrs Bettencourt, Me Georges Kiejman, after the negotiation.
The lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Myers, Me Olivier Metzner, is very satisfied with the Court's decision.
This is an excellent news (...). The guest will prove that he (Banier) has manipulated this old dame that you need to protect.
Since two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has brought a criminal complaint against François-Marie Barnier, photographs and actors, and has condemned him to have used the weakness of her mother for a billion euros in the form of banks checks, insurance police or employees.
Liliane Bettencourt had always opposed to be handled by photographs that she looked like a long-year friend.
Although the court should examine the validity of the clamps introduced by Mrs Bettencourt-Myers, the lawyers have led to a large family-scale on Friday.
Thus, the lawyer of Liliane Bettencourt called on three of his clients to her note (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she misformed the husband of Françoise Bettencourt.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt adds: "I can explain my daughter that I have written up to two times a day to Banier.
Francoise, I have never been able to speak from her homestate."
The State Authority of Nanterre reiterates that the applicant had no right to react, especially because in the last days, a prejudiciary director has refused to submit a legal protection procedure against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fullly legal, is not protected and has no training.
No one has the right to act on his place," the representative of the State Authority, Marie-Christine Duubigney.
The Court has now decided to make a judgment after the process on the validity of Mrs Bettencourt-meyers.
Manager Revolution or the end of Strategic Breakfast Declaration?
If nothing changes to the leadership of the large French companies has been our fight for the development of economic intelligence...
Since over a decade, the management of large enterprises in relation to its employees, the position of the consumers in front of the Marketing Revolution: it is the best for the staff 'value', as it was to compare with consumers' products in the work.
While you are the customers at the center of the company, the marketing revolution has given the strategies for the opening of the markets in place ... although the authorisation attempts separated products to regularly compare customer preferences!
Demobilization of employees can lead to a mortal demoralization.
The self-mortals in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the pitches of a larger phenomenon, especially touching the employees.
This demobilization affects the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially those of the F&Eund, which is more crucial, on those of the economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economique = Economic Intelligence) requires "of all parties involved (...) a proactive step and an orientated vision"; it calls for employees to oppose the instructions of authorisation.
We therefore call for a business revolution that would exist in the same way the employees in the mixing point of the company's concerns are equal to the customers.
The very requisite benefits of internal opinion questions
Should the internal opinion questions, such as the questionnaire, which the persons have submitted its rewards, encourage this revolution in terms of management practice?
I'm afraid, I'm not afraid.
- First, because I was able to find that the whole composition, in view of a new situation in many ways, eventually began to do this... what it has always done.
It is also because the authorism - one of the pathologys of the power-related power - is to take the importance of its own misconsequence.
Finally, because most leadership forces have a strongly simplified view of human behavior.
It is a mechanical interpretation of psychology from the great engineering school.
They are taking through intellectual comfort the old moderistic theory that recently reactivated by the American "Neo-American Universities" and indeed widely distributed by research institutions and media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to confirm the "hebel" (sic) to engage in employees, a current Le Figaro.fr survey of Ipsos will improve the leadership forces in a position to a mechanistic control system that is inadequate for the present world.
identification and measurement of the mobilization factors
Instead, a operational revolution required for modern enterprises provides the adoption of a final view of human behavior.
It is to integrate a basic protocol in any transmission or practice of the tax: the engagement of the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to implement a part of its dreams, their honor and its projects.
This concept of the motivation of employees is only taking the studies from the multi-functional analysis.
These studies have demonstrated that they shall evaluate their undertakings on the basis of a prescribed doxa, which allows them to evaluate their effective image of the company, which they provide for the achievement of their lives objectives.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, the leadership forces of the companies can control, control, predict and advance, and relocate their human resources management in the right place.
In this way, they create a fruitful land that is favorable to develop a robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The speaking of Oslo: the "right war" brings Obama Lob from the right
American rights welcomed Barack Obama's speech in Oslo on Friday, and was satisfied that the Nobel Prize 2009 defended the term "just war" against the enemy of the United States.
The conservatives who had cut the price allocation to Obama on October 9 applauded this time by the speaking of the President, followed the example of the former Vice-President's Candidate at the elections of Sarah Palin in 2008.
I was glad to say, Palin explained the face of the right flights of the Republic of the United States today and added that he himself had launched the subject of a "while necessary" war in their own languages.
The war is, of course, the last thing I think that the Americans want to do it, but it is necessary.
We need to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who had had two wars from his preacher George W. Bush, tried to justify the use of violence on Thursday in Oslo, a way to explain his decision 9 days ago, to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, is the opinion that the President has done in Oslo "so much good work".
I found that the speech was very good, and I welcomed the former President of the House of Representative, particularly the reference to "the existence of the evil in the world" in the words of Obama.
In some parts, I have completed this speech as historic, Ginrich explained that it was asked in the radio version "The Takeaway".
The previous deputy, who was viewed by some as possible candidate for the Republic of the Presidency for 2012, said that he was pleased to have seen a "presidents of the left" who reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that they weren't free and could not join a price for peace if the use of violence would not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and a half-year editor at Washington Post, Obama has maintained "a very American speech".
Furthermore, he said that he is "cosmopolite" as "he always does", as he said "as a American President," as he stated that the Europeans "as they live in a smuggle that they have not created themselves and not much for their protection," says Gerson.
Under the few, not convinced rights, the former UNO Boatsman John Bolton, a falk of the Era Bush, the speaking on the National Review Online's website as "language, high-training and inspirationless".
To the left of the President, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the restraint against the forces.
If you pack the war under the deck of justice, the massator can justify the innocents.
However, the press of the slightly left remains glorious on the side of the President.
The Los Angeles Times, who is still the view that the Nobel Prize was forgiven to Obama, declared the conversation itself for a speaker like him, who is known for his talent, as "monumental work".
The speaking in Oslo "its an end plan to control international decisions against conflicts, poverty and underpression," says the Californian daily period.
The New York Times is the view that Obama "proclaimed the necessary discours" and describes his speech as "thereth and slightly compared".
Travellers: Three Marathons for an agreement which ensures the supply of Christmas
After a thirty-week negotiation math, the workshops of the road association and the TLF, the only workers organization, which remained until the end of the free day, ended into an agreement that ended the striking order and the threatening severe supplies on Christmas.
At the subscription meeting on the freeday "pleaded" of the advisory State secretariat Dominice Busserwater, which was introduced on midday morning after a number of negotiations weeks.
After a second negotiation night, the negotiators were expected to sign the agreement rapidly on Friday morning.
This had left the meeting of the three employees (FNTR, Onestra and OTRE).
However, more than six hours from the beginning of the meeting at 11 a.m. to the end of the agreement and only at 18:00 a.m. the agreement was signed.
The conflict "the company was very damaged," and "that was to fear that he would affect the holiday at the end of the year," says Busserwater.
The Agreement provides an increase in payment for the lower wages (local and regional road transport) and for the highest payment groups (international transports).
The level of hours for employees with the lower wages increases from 8,72 euros to 9,06 euros.
"It's not particularly much, but we're just getting small one," says Patrice Clos (FO).
Activityists are now stated to not block the supply centres.
"But it will probably always give some opposites that are not satisfied with the agreement," he added.
The TLF President Philippe Grillot said of a "good agreement", although it was "speaking to make these payments in view of international competition."
The increase of EUR 170 monthly for the lower and up to 100 to 120 euros for the high payment groups.
"This agreement is based on the healthy human sense and respect for the employee," says Maxime Dumont (CFDT), where Thierry Douine (CFTC) said of "a historical agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) expressed this regard on "a acceptable compromise".
The Agreement also provides the increase in travel costs by 3 % and the maintenance of the total road transport network in the first half of 2010, which will be enabled, in particular, to address the 13-month term and to modernize the tariff contracts.
Mr Busserwater recalled that "the expenditure for employer's employees in the amount of 100 million euro" object for an amendment by the Government on the draft legislation for 2009, which was adopted on Thursday night by the National Assembly.
The government calls for "a identical" vote by the Senate.
The subscription of the TLF allows the agreement to first apply to the enterprises engaged in this organization and to apply, in the event of the dissemination by the Ministry of Working on the whole occupational status.
This will be "in the shortest time" of the case, secures buserwater.
The opposition of the employees may only delay the procedure.
The FNTR Association proposed a "reserve trade" because the 100 million euros were already promised to the sector for compensation of a part of the carbon tax.
The State Secretariat for Transport has forced us to negotiate as quickly as possible, but not on the basis of a common analysis, but in order to not detrimentize the gains at the near Christmas meetings, the Onestra is declared.
For the partnership Otre, the agreement threatens the small and medium-sized enterprises of the sector in the coming 12 months.
Line RER A: Unpleasing disorders at this weekend, working with the proposals of the RATP
The disasters on the RER A line, the largest speed network in France for the largest Paris space and the islandle-de-France, continued on the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, 2nd trail between the workshops and the leadership of the RATP (Independent Paris) continued to wait for trailers with their calls for loan.
To this important weekend of Christmas, there was no traces between 10:00 and 20:00. On the central trail (the La Defense and Nation) only one of two trains and outside the central trails was prepared only one of four trains.
The connection to SNCF's trends was interrupted in Nanterre prefectures, which forced the travellers to increase.
The purchase chain of Galeries Lafayette, which is counting every day 200,000 customers, welcomed the fact that "if I want the RATP to connect the large business in the transport technique".
The RER A line passes the Parisen Ballung room from West to East.
The RATP strip part connects the Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre sites as well as Boissy-Sint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one of the two trains were planned to transport the main time, and nearly no one during the traffictime.
As on Thursday, there was no human welfare on the stations, as the inhabitants of the island-de-France were on the situation.
As soon as the morning, the train court of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less than other, especially because of the lack of Gymn-Asians.
In Boissy-Saint-Leger (Val-de-Marne) Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), he would have been able to “a few hours ago to come first to work”.
The SNCF, who had planned a care of travellers by employees and order forces, understood that it had not come to an engagement in the Saint-Lazare station.
The SNCF on the line RER A or in direction of Cergy-Le-Haut came to or passed through the Saint-Lazare station to ensure the connection to the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, the main meetings of the strikes were recovered, while the results were reviewed, which the assemblies had entered after the meeting with the leadership stages on Friday.
The RER business manager has proposed the specific preparation of a protocol for RER A line with regard to all relevant aspects, worktimes, professional loopways, etc.
However, this is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud) they call for a long payment attack.
The CGT was recommended that the RATP itself put its loan proposals in clause and pointed out that the guideline "is not possible to solve a problem, while this was possible with the transporters and the SNCF".
The RATP cleared that a renewed meeting for the "complete examination of the working conditions" for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company "is ignored the weekend."
On Monday, about 150 drivers searched for a committee in Paris.
Once again, it was the leading stage that rejected until date any debate during the strike, and closed a meeting after a discussion of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to extend the RER B line after a voluntary announcement of Unsa and Independents.
The associations require a wage of 120 (unsa) to 150 euros, from which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents). In addition, they deteriorate the working conditions on this road where millions of travellers are walking daily.
The drivers of the RER line, which have more than a year of vocational service, include a brutal loan of 2.200 to 2.700 euros and a payment of 600 to 650 euros for shoot services and sun and holidays.
Turkey's Constitutional Court resolves the pro-kurdial party. Decision with serious consequences
On Friday, the Constitution Court announced the resolution of the country's pro-Kurd main party; a decision which followed immediately distorted demonstrations in the Curdial Community in the south of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens the work of the Government to strive to rise the Curd Community to end the conflicts since 25 years.
The "Parti for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was resolved, as it became a place for activities that are detrimental to the independence of the State and its unity", says the President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kilitz four days after the decision against the press.
According to Kilich, the decision would be adopted unilaterally by 11 judges, where a majority of seven votes would have been necessary to address the resolution, and he pointed out that 37 of the leaders of the party, including the President Ahmet Turk and the parliamentary Aysel Tugluk, were excluded for the period of five years from the political events.
Furthermore, the judges announced the relief of the parliamentary immunity, which enjoyed Turkey and Tugluk, as well as the conflicting of the goods of the parties.
The DTP now has more than 21 seats in Parliament (of 550).
The Party leaders expressed that the parliamentary would prefer to leave Parliament as a partial parliamentary.
The decision followed a procedure introduced by the Turkish Federal Agency of Abdulrahman Yalçinkaya in 2007, which accused the DTP to follow the "disciplines" of the working party in Kurdistan (PKK), which was regarded by Ankara and many other countries as a terrorism organization.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legally creator of the PKK revolts.
The Party assurances that there is no connection to the PKK, however, refuses to call them as a terrorism organization and calls upon the government to negotiate.
The Court of Justice of the Constitution, which is intended to join the Curdial Community and propose a number of measures to strengthen the rights of the currencies in order to allow the support of the CKK through the currency and to put the conflicts an end.
The DTP leaders confirm that a resolve could lead to redistribution in Southern Anatolians, where numerous demonstrations were conducted against the prison conditions of the KKK Chief Abdullah Öcalan in the last few weeks with the police.
Since the proclamation of the Court, thousands of demonstrates were gathered before the areas of the DTP in the millions of Diyarbakir city in the south, which is overly populated by curves.
The order forces set up grain gases and water clays when the demonstrators began to cut molotowcocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
Following the judgment, Turkey concluded that the decision of the Court would continue to develop the deterioration.
"The Turkey cannot clarify this (courdial, anim. e. Editon) question on the basis of the ban of a party," he explained the press.
The Government, which was composed of a party who had come from the Islamic movement, also regretted the decision.
"We oppose from principle against the closure of the parties.
This does not solve the problems", says Minister of Energy Taner Yigoz.
"This decision is a torture of democratic opening that has been promoted by the government," says the political market observer Ahmet Island.
"It can clearly be taken on a reaction of the PKK", he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK was known to a attack in which three days before seven soldiers in the north of Turkey lived. It was one of the most brutal attacks of the last months.
The sneebreak can come
A very nice winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not just because he wants to break the citizens, the Winter Service Chief of the FES says.
Especially to enable its employees to try and learn the whole vehicle technology.
On weekend, it could be the first time so far.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to care for snow and iron.
The FES is in line with a precise plan.
When it shrinks in Frankfurt and the temperatures are under zero degree, Brauburger explains the 20-th so-called A tracks.
This includes about main transport and transit roads such as the new road and the Hanauer Lander Strategy.
But also fire drivers, ÖPNV routes, footground zones and trails with accidents, such as the Atzelberg Streets.
The FES service starts at 3 p.m.
The 1040 kilometers should be shocked in order to need at least three hours with feed salt, which is better arrested.
That's why the FES starts at 3 a.m., "to allow the routes to be free until the professional traffic begins".
It's hard when it's only shut up at 7:30.
Then we have a problem to say the winter chief, "for then no one is ready to make the shipping vehicles place."
First of all, if it's not further, there are roads of advertising and resolution, including the Council's share tracks, on the line.
The last priority has side and side routes.
There will be a complaint, white Brauburger.
At 5:00 a.m., the football of the FES is priority on the path, risk points and transfers.
For all Radways, the FES is mostly not able to care.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which holds the bridges from 22 to 4.30 in particular, says Brauburger.
As it goes on this fast floor, when the temperature goes under two degrees, the strike walks.
This is also called by the police if necessary.
The direction of the dinosaurers
Tawa hallae looked like many other flesh-free dinosaurers: The two meters long and 1.50 meters of great animal flew on two powerful skins, had a long shore with sharp, shocked teeth, short arms with sleeves and a long swimming snack.
If the type had lived a few million years later, it wouldn't be special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurers with these body features, reporting Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the magazine of Science on Thursday.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in New Mexico today, which was then in a soft zone of the Super Continent Pangäa at the Equator.
Bawa opens a new window for the previous evolution of the dinosaur, says Nesbitt.
He shows us much about the relationships, the expansion and the characteristics of the early dinosaurers.
2006 Nesbitt and other Paleonologists began with a description on the Ghost Ranch in North New Mexico.
Sometimes we found a twenty-third dinosaurier kitchen, which is unlikely for delays from the Trias, reports the team-member Randall Imits of Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones identified the researchers quickly as a new type.
During the expansion, they met the rest of five individuals together.
Fund confirmed theories about Dino Fruit History
The name "Tawa" is from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an extraordinary fund: "Dinosaurier-fosilies from the Trias are extremely rare, mostly only ones are found."
Other dinosaurier experts do not divid the enthusiasmus uncertainly.
Especially spectacular is not the fund, but he confirms some theories about the early history of the dinosaurers, says about Martin Sander from the University of Bonn.
Following the current education, the dinosauries first took place 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossilians, however, are incomplete, as the arrangement of this ur-dinos is mostly overcome.
Thus, the experts discussed, for example, when the skins were divided into their three most important development lines: the meat thermopods, to which the tyremosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and the birds were known as "Langhalse" and their relatives, and the plants of fresh ornithics, for example, of triceratops and stegosaurus.
After the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropod.
He knows a interesting combination of primitive and continuous properties, says Nesbitt.
In the shoe of Tawa hallae, researchers, for example, found an indication on air chains, such as they also have the follow-up of the theropodes, the birds.
Thanks to the air chair, the breathing of the birds is more efficient than that of the powders.
In the Tawa hallae, the bones of the weapon room were apparently filled in part with air.
Tawa is the oldest and primary theropod with air sacks, says Randall Irmis.
Since the relative line of the huge powders later also had air chains and light-building kitchens, it is likely that the common prepayment of both groups had already produced these useful innovations.
At least three migration hills to North America
Because the most famous dinosaurers in South America lived in South America, the researchers follow that the men were the first time there.
Thus, the three development lines were early and wided from South America over all parts of the earth that were still a single land mass of Pangua as a supercontinent.
For this, the fact that the team, together with Tawa, has found the rest of the other two, not particularly closely related theropods.
The three cannot derogate from a commonly immigred event, the researchers argued.
We believe there were at least three migrations to North America, Alan Turner from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a composer of Science Studies.
There are also contradictions.
A more older, Silesaurus, who heard a sister group of the dinosaurier, lived in today in Poland, says the Bonn Paleonologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could be shown a devastated image because in South America only many primitive dino-fosilies have remained, while there is little to find anything on other continents.
As the dinosaurers made to develop a relatively rare page line of the reptile to the dominating agricultural sector of the earth, it is still strict.
During the Trias, the dinosauries continued to share their lives with many other reptiles, such as the past of the current crocodile and the airlines, and with many other skins.
At the end of the Trias, the dinosaurers were widespread throughout the world and developed many new species, while the association on the border of Trias to Jura.
Success stories not forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this channel, says Martin Sander.
It could have given a mass death that survived the dinosaurers insecurely, but other reptiles were not.
Or the dinosaurers were better adjusted so they could shoot competitiveness from the field.
In any case, the success stories did not deserve forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite invasion of a group of animals to flowers, which had already developed in the Trias, and since then a shootase waste: the seed.
Solidarity from Wien to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signs are international.
Professionals at the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or from Berkeley in California.
Center of Neapel are from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police space of the Francfurter Goethe University of Goethe suggests world waves.
278 Professors and teachers of the Goethe University, but also from high schools in all Germany, Europe and North and South America are solidarized with the protesting students in the Western Campus.
In a German and English declaration "misablers" they are the police imposed by the Bureau.
Uni-President Werner Müller-Estler had left the building placed by students and docents in the training trace last week, because walls and works were shocked.
Five students were injured.
The damages, judge the signs, did not justify the violent resolution of self-organized school events of students and teachers by a police command.
The residence represents a "not acceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on Vandalism depends on the "delictization and criminalization of the Protest" and depends on the contents.
The presidency has dismissed the necessary discurs.
The dozens call for the immediate position of criminal persecution.
The majority of the owners did not support the damage, namely.
Protest legitimated
The young ones of the Verdi Association and the German Employment Association also are solidarized with the students.
The protest is legitimate expression of a growing concern about the future, says Verdi-Landes juvenile Alexander Klein.
Hessens, Minister of Science, Eva Kuhne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the action of the United President and the police.
We are grateful to the United President.
Destruction and consumption are completely unacceptable means, said she in a current hour on Thursday at the Visbaden Landday.
We have a understanding for the Protest, but we do not understand Vandalism, so Peter Beuth, deputy of the CDO.
Otherwise, it was the SPD, Green, and left opposition groups.
The CDU takes poor walls to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of students, you have been disappointed.
The left has made a request to the Ministry of Internal Affairs to provide a report on the police.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, she became a secret city, unacceptable for Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital city of Moscow, was a strict guard place in the Soviet Union.
Today the communities apply to their 216,000 inhabitants, 37 km from Moscow Center, as "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production sites for micro- and nano-electronics are here.
Shortly since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd had contacts with the Frankfurt Scientific State Riedberg - with the Uni-Instituts and the company of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several reciprocal visits, and on midday, Selenograd and Riedberg were signed in Frankfurt a "Protocol for closer cooperation".
The Moscow Vice-Clairman Juri Rosljak and the prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd, the Russian delegation, understood the planning deputy Edwin Black.
2010, representatives of the FIZ and smaller and medium-sized enterprises of the scientific research point for a seminar to Selenograd.
Scientific exchange
It's about a continuing scientific exchange.
But there is also economic relations.
The company of the FIZ is enabled to spend on the growing Russian market.
In turn, Russian Scientific companies want to accompany contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of larger Russian research institutions and companies.
This includes the Moscow Institute for Electronic Technology, the large concerns Sitronics and Rossijskaja Electronics.
The Community was founded in 1958 as the "socialist planned city" for the resort research.
Selenograd (for example "Green City") received his name from the management of the hill country where the research institutions are included.
Stuttgarter Bremsklotz
The size of Stuttgart 21 may not be high enough.
For the favorites of the project, it is simple and simple about "the new heart of Europe".
Right so. S21 is much more than the depth of a train station, more than a monstery building project that will be destroyed by the city of the Baden-Wurttemberg headquarters for a decade in helloses building chaos.
Stuttgart 21 has occurred from the spirit of the 1980s.
Headquarters with sleeves, who ended in the city, were then as a traffic technological fosil of the 19th century, which acted like bridges of a modern sleeves, since it needed a lot of time to switch local motives from behind.
Introduction, shut up, continue - so it must go.
And therefore the head rail heights should be lost: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart, a bicycle station, which is around half the cross-European magistrate between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava, is therefore the Slogan of the "Herz Europes".
S21 will now be reached, although the visions of the 80s are not more compliant with the reality.
Even very ambitious plans have recognized that it is almost unpaid in the Hessian and the Bairs great city to implement the depth.
However, the head stations have no problem, however, since there are modern trends with train vehicles and tax vehicles at two ends.
However, Stuttgart 21 next to the ICE new construction line to Ulm is now reached.
Country and Community Policy has implemented it.
It is also due to the risks of the largest infrastructure project of the Republic of taxpayers and not to the state centers.
The project can still be justified in some ways.
It consists of a new city space that is believed that the computer-generated graphics of the planet are equipped with a lot of green.
S21 is harmful for the transport system.
The headquarters and the rail construction are thought for the person's traffic, which has been typically scribed to a huge growth in the 80s.
There was no competitiveness of the flights.
However, the modern transport policy must first be going to strengthen the goods transport, since transport on the steel is significantly more environmental than by Lkw on the road.
However, the new construction strike does not spend for goods because of strong stages.
More seriously, S21 also tangents many other station projects indirectly.
Good six billion euros should be pronounced in Swedish.
That's the official number.
Experts keep 10 to 15 billion for realistic.
In the next decade, the money is missing from other points and clusters in the network.
In total, sixty larger projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important ones is the construction of the well 180 km long roads through the Rheintal.
Since 1987, it is built at the trasse at the time of time.
Drugly, it would be necessary to press right here on the tube.
But S21 will act as a brems cloth.
The Rheintrail will be the flash for international goods: in the heart of Europe.
Government checks the court for the airport
The country's government has opened in Visbadenn Landday whether it will be revisioned against the Court of Justice of the Hess (VGH).
The CDD/FDP coalition has taken experts to investigate the comprehensive VGH Office of more than 400 pages, said Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Cassel had writtenly found that the country, in the case of the plant of the planned Northwest Railway trains in the Frankfurt airport, had to reset the night flight ban.
The authorisation of 17 flights between 23 and 5 p.m., as the country government provides, is not to agree with the legally provided protection of the population before night airline.
The coalition must decide if it is against the judgment until 4 January.
The opposition criticized this injury and urged the representatives of the Government to reject a review of the Federal Management Court in Leipzig.
The SPD Group of Torsten Scheffer-Gumble requested the CDP and FDP to return to a night-floor ban before the chosen promises, and, in other words, it should be a "wordbroch".
It's so hard when you can keep his word, he said the Green Chief Tarek Al-Wazir in reply to the FDP 'We keep a word'.
Minister Posch returned to the provision of Scheffer-Gumbel, to seek the country government with the "Revolution and Trickseries" but still towards its night flights.
An accurate legal examination requires its time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "accessive first impression".
We need a legal discharge, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As they represent the opposition, the statements of his group to the night flight prohibition had never been.
US banks pay aid back
The crisis protected the US Great Banks strive to strive their public fessels.
In the mid-day, the Bank of America has paid the aid from the Bank Reserve Fund in total $45 billion ($30 billion).
The CCI group also plans to restore state aid after a report from the US Sender of CNBC.
The institutions want to conclude the limitations made by the adoption of the money – such as the limitation of the payment of managerboni and the allocation of high costs.
The Bank of America had been concerned about channel loans of $19 billion fresh money in investors.
The rest of the sum took her from the own cash, which was well filled by sperten sales, among others.
Bank chief Kenneth Lewis expressly thanked the US taxpayers: The currency has helped us over a very difficult time.
The financial crisis was highlighted by the transfer of the Merrill Lynch Investment Bank.
The Citi-Gruppe wants to provide money on the capital market to be free of its liabilities towards the State.
On Thursday, the US bank could announce a series of $20 billion serious invasion of its capitals, reported CNBC in circles.
A citi-group speaker didn't want to express himself.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had paid their aid back.
Quick selection
And then it was more fast than thought.
After two weeks after the management of the ZDF management Board the official director Nikolus Brender from the office, the sender may present a follower.
Last night, the body wanted to vote on the personality.
As Favorit, Peter Frey, head of the ZDF headquarters in Berlin.
However, a confirmation was not officially confirmed by the sender to prevent the procedure.
However, it should have also played a role to prevent the ZDF interviews Markus Schachers, but this proposal should not be achieved by the Governing Council.
Frey, shoes candidate, needs 9 of the 14 grammium members.
The result of the vote has not yet been established in the edition of this expenditure.
Two weeks ago, shaughter has been delayed by the Governing Council with his proposal to extend the Treaty with Nikolaus Brender for five years further.
Only seven members talked to the Breder, and seven voted against him. Broder's displacement was a shooting place for shooter, but an expectable.
Because the Union's Council's master had notified a week before the election to confirm breeding in the office.
Ordered the resistance to the Chief of the Hess Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that, under the Brender, the CDF's advertisements had been lost to share quotas, he refused another official period of the high-specified chief-chairman.
Soon before the election, there were Protests in which the political impact on the ZDF was congratulated.
Lastly, 35 State lawyers had even been in the debate, which were estimated to be the case of cochs as a constitutional basis.
We don't have any use.
For person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied policy, padagogic and Romanism.
Then he worked at the Southwestfunk and the Frankfurt Round.
1983 Frey changed to ZDF, first to the " Today-Journal".
The following stations: 1988 to 1990, a personal referendum of the Chefmaker; 1991/92 Correspondent in Washington; Head and Moderator of the "Morgenmagazine"; until 2001 Head of the Foreign Policy of ZDF; since the head of the ZDF Headquarters Studios.
The green proclaimed a constitutional declaration during the midday and midnight, elected by the Branchenblatt Medium Magazine on the journalist of the year.
In the past week, the Resident of the Administrative Council, President Kurt Beck, declared that the countries should change the ZDF State Treaty so that the personal proposals of the Ombudsman could not be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, a disappearing of participating politicians from the CDF supervisory bodies also concluded.
Broders of the predicted follower Peter Frey had recommended the Governing Council with a pleasant shock - by criticating the body directly after the breeding disappearing.
Thanks to this journalist independence, both assaulters could be named without loss of visibility for the posts of the headmaker and also the Governing Council, without coming in the suspect to help a participant into the office.
Frey is calculated without the link library.
Studio is displexed
Participated to students: After one year of education, the College Ministers of Countries ended on Thursday: at a meeting of Ministers of Cultural and High Schools, both sides agreed to want to improve the studies conditions at Bachelor and Master.
The students should be able to be able to monitor their study as well.
In particular, they acknowledged to reduce the test loads: basically, each study module should be completed only with a single test.
In addition, the labour load of students should be reviewed and ensured "a realistic and reliable measure".
The policy and high schools also want to simplify the recognition of test services between high schools within and outside Germany.
The countries were obliged to build more flexible common structures for bachelor and master studies.
It should not be provided by the dismissing country arrangements.
Reverse tests
Since the beginning of the student protections in June, the voluntary ministers and Uni-Rectors make the vowed word from the best studyability in the mouth.
Now it was first filled with a concrete content.
The assigned Accreditation Council decided to reduce the number of tests in partly: "All modules are normally closed by only a test," means in a 30-side paper that should be renewed in partly to the authorisation of studies.
The "decisive decrease of the test charge" explained the Reinhold Group of the Accreditation Council, aimed at a "fill development, which significantly affected the study".
Furthermore, the "specificity" should be the "decisive criteria" in the future.
Modules such as contents were "strict to check on it", whether "unnecessary approaches to students in the selection of
Events would be avoided.
Students would have "the right to receive game spaces, to allow and promote their own initiative".
The rules for the approval of new, but also for the review of existing studies.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years, but it means that it will duration until 2015 until all studies have been reviewed.
In this respect, ten accreditation agencies are fully undertaken by the Accreditation Council established by the countries.
The Ministers of Cultural had requested the countries "with pressure" in October to affect the agencies that the substance is not too large and the test regime is not too strict.
In some federal countries, universities and schools with the Ministers have already understood appropriate measures.
Once the only country said Rheinland-Pfalz to continue development of the Bologna process.
The money aims to establish high schools in particular research programmes and to strengthen research consultations and to investigate and foreign students.
The country and high schools want to apply ten million euros.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to introduce a new of high school law into Parliament.
After this, only one test is necessary for the end of a study model.
The study training is to be more flexible, and also to ensure the recognition of performance information to other high schools and to facilitate access to master.
To the end of the coming year, all the studies of the country should be examined on their ability to study.
The government and opposition were again fighting on the studies conditions in the country on Thursday.
In addition to Lob, however, there was also criticism on decisions.
The federal headquarters of the Juso High Schools requested the establishment of the education policy to take place in the future, the Minister and High School Researcher's "Close doors".
Later, after education, students should also be involved "a word".
The future academics received support from the President of the High School Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the experiences of students," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the college ministries, with which the HRK focused on a common reform paper.
The Association of Education and Science (GEW) did not have enough decisions: it calls for a law enabled to access to a further master study access to each one with a bachelor termination.
On the other hand, the countries must ensure that there are sufficient master study places available for the today's generation of Bachelor students with best possible studies, so Mr Andreas Keller.
The countries must clearly set more dozens.
However, at a free access to the master, the Ministers of Culture did not express.
More than a footnote at Herta Müller
Introduction in Germany and it is almost no control..." is the start line of Lirikers Werner Söllner, where this is thematicized the arrival of a dissident who wins freedom but has lost his language space in the same way.
The 1951-born Werner Söllner in Romanian Banat had first been German and English teacher in Bukarest and later worked as a reader in a child book department before 1982 he overlooked to Frankfurt on Main.
Slellner was excited with various literature prices, 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurter poetic predictions at the university of Goethe, and since 2002 he is head of the Hessic Literature Forum in the Mouse Tower in Frankfurt.
For considerable extra-literarian view, he was careful at the past Sunday during a meeting in Munchen, with regard to the German literature in Romania in the Spiegel and the level of their security events.
It seems to be insured and leaves Söllner a statement in which he was collected before Romanian writers, e.g. Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Womendorfer, his work as an IM for the Roman Secret Service Securitates.
Within some of the attendants, Söllner had received the German language price in 1989.
The applications would have started ridiculely, first of 1971.
I'm, closed sleeves, "anyone who didn't have suffice with the securities trials of security."
Lyriker Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
At the same time, with the nobel price for Herta Müller and its unlikely literary interference with the dictatory government mechanisms, the literature scenes and, in particular, the Community of the German authors from Romania are assaulted by a case which makes the depth and detriment of a political system, which is based on monitoring and separation.
Werner is a slellner, so far you can say, not only the murderers, but also the victims.
In his Securitate Act, IM Walter played a role, said after the understanding of Söllers of Literature Scientist Michael Markel, and referred to the positive impact of the IM Walter.
He had him in all of his differentious points, so Markel.
It is a moral need to make this note.
However, in the form and before this public, it was unexpected that the recognition of a former dissident and its cooperation with the Roman Secret Service was not completely surprising.
Germany was a reserve for securitate spectrum, Herta Müller had already written in July after she had read her own acts, 914 pages.
The interested ones, so they may be sculpted, and, in some cases, have also been aware of the clear name behind the decknames Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
Rather than in the country here, in this case, very procedural view of the Stasi dossiers is still very diffused.
A systematic statement has been dispatched and disrupted over the past years.
One of the relevant national councils for the preparation of security files (CNSAS) was based only in 1999, but the production of the data was more slow.
First since 2005, there is a law which regulates the management of the files.
The influence of the former security members in Romania was still very large, after announcing the Nobel price for Herta Muller, an interview in which a former security chief of Temesvar was expressed on the prices.
She's got a psychosis. Finally, you just heard her once.
The Infamy of the Power said to be able to express the freedom of view.
Indeed, the case of slaughter is linked, as often in relation to different schulds, inevitable questions.
Why is it now? Who has been succeeded? The reaction of the listeners to the Slellner's recognition allows you to hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined more than by knowledge of debt instruction and shame.
For the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who last night took the Nobel Price, it is more than one footnote.
Rating contribution Champions League
It worked just as an addicted foreign service from a very nice Christmas feast, on which a sportive producer Goodies had distributed, when the new VfB Trainer Christian Gross in conducting an orange colorful plastics of the outdoor a four-hour hour on midnight in a renowned C class.
The man with the marshing swimming swimming up because of his still foreign town.
On the contrary, he could also drive himself - Alcohol was finally not in the game, and the 55-year-old age was precisely little.
It's been an embarrassing night, but tomorrow the work is going on.
Or they're just right.
In the words of the first three days of Swiss, "We have reached the asthlefinal", namely, in the Champions League, thanks to Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we do not have to hide from the success: there will be a brutally hard fight against the disappearing."
The "wise more important task" is before Sunday.
Then it applies to repeat the king class in Mainz in Liga's day.
And again, the weakness after the speed of three doors by Marica (5.), the pressure (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.).
Excluding
The acellfinal of the Champions League (Plugs 16./17. + 23./24 February/Replayers 9./10. + 16./17 March) is excluded in Nyon on December 18th.
Thus, the joy of the fulfiling scope of the Babbel follower remained condemned.
Not only in the incredible heil bringer who had provided the uncertain Stuttgart profession in the short time of self-confidence, impliance and joy.
I came to the players and told them that they should be involved in their powers, and have stopped them to be more mutilating, declared the souls clamps gress the simple success reception that had no more effect under therapeut Babbel.
He has disappointed a certain magic, gave Babbel's promiser Jens Lehmann, "If a new impulse in the football comes, sometimes happen things that you couldn't keep possible."
And Sami Khedira, who had a long-term injury due to his dynamic even to the best player on the place, tried to describe the "phenomen" defined with the word "France Wind" and the work of the new provision: "He is a man who demands exciting and disciplin.
This is what we need in the current situation."
Under Babbel it was obviously missing.
The VfB Stuttgart is not yet over the mountain, warning sports condition Horst Heldt
However, the VfB Stuttgart needs mostly consumption.
As Gross, the players and managers were also encouraging the victory against a replaced and completely overcome of the Roman guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkus at 0:4 the bad observance had come to mind Khedira.
And the sports term Horst Heldt could have been achieved by a seasonal target, but the other was still on television.
We're not over the mountain.
That herdt, on his 40th birthday itself after the first home seventh for three months, was not after celebration, at the events of the weekend that lived in a form of directly extracted television interviews from Torhèter Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions to take and not the Jens, and Heldt contacted the hard Critic Lehmanns.
He had shown the headquarters and decided to change training on puberty fans.
Even that his free day has been stripped after games, Lehmann valued as a sign of lack of sovereignty and fault.
Lehmann's words were "predicted in pure egoism", he turned back and announced consequences for the man's finality.
You're not going to be friends for life, the twoty-year-old years.
However, they were always agreed with all others that without the preparation by the dissolved train team, it would have been possible to play and fight strong ideas.
Babbel and his assistants had been "a large part of the success", said Heldt and Lehmann unionso - and also the man with the plastics.
WM-food in weight
Hitzige duell in Bern: Always reproduced the challenger Kevin Johnson World Master Vitali Clickko with words and beasts.
However, after twelve hard rounds, the Ukraine defended its weighting title according to the WBC version.
The judgement of the point manager was unilaterally exempted.
Hamburg - Vitali Clitschko remains a Box World Meister in weight.
The 38-year-old Champion after the WBC Association, on Saturday night in Bern, the Americans Kevin Johnson agreed with points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko, it was the third successful defence after his comeback in October 2008.
Before the Ukrainian was two times the World Master of the WBO and WBC Associations.
Unfortunately, it didn't shut up with the K.o. who all expected.
Clickko built his balance on 39 seats in 41 Profi fights, he had to be struck on the basis of injuries.
The challenged Johnson had to take the first place in the 24th battle.
Before about 17,000 observers in the Berner Arena, the sight of 2,02 meters of great clipschko wanted to divide the battle, especially with its left leadership hand.
The 11th centimeters of small Johnson, who had proclaimed the end of the Clickko era before the dull, nevertheless turned back to the shoes of the World Minister, so that Klitschko could not impose its dangerous rights.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and tried only to come over the rounds.
Even though he tried clipschko with words and beasts, his shoes found the Master of the world rarely.
On the other hand, he was only the second boxer to Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went with Klitschko over the full distance of 12 rulins.
The challenger had been buried before the battle in the Swiss capital for some weakers.
He rushed clipschko as "the Hospital Zombie", which "not can do it".
At the way, the Champion tried to shoot Johnson the sun bridges from the nase, "to see his eyes."
Fourth Victor to Clitschkos Comeback
Klitschko remained also in his fourth battle after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After almost four years of age, he had shocked the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and returned his "seen" WBC building that he had to be sent without camp.
In this year he asked his title reports Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and in September Chris Arreola from the United States.
I just got a shock in this struggle and I'm physically very good in the form, Klitschko had found the fast return to the ring.
But his dream remains the association of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Wladimir is the World Master of the WBO and IBF Associations.
But the shooting of the WBA is the British David Haye, after this was able to shoot the great Nikolai Walujew in November.
Haye had shocked a fight planned for September against Vitali Clitschko.
Its promotion society is now struggling against Klitschko in the London Wembley stadium.
Fall Kunduz
Frontlantics from the opposition: Head of Green Fraction Jürgen Trittin has called the Defense Minister Goodtenberg because of false information about the customer's appeal as a lie.
SPD and left requests a statement by the officer.
Hamburg/Berlin - After the recent findings on the air attack of Kunduz, the Defence Minister Karl-Theodor to Goodtenberg (CSU) has understood a conviction.
The Minister has said to the dead bomb on two tanks in September "which is inconserved", said Head of Green Trittin, Jürgen Trittin, on Saturday, in the ARD newspaper "Tagsview".
They are called the landwide: He lied.
The order on the deaths was issued under the rules of the International Protection Trust for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the substance of the NATO report, Mr Goodtenberg, said Trittin.
On Friday, it was known that it was not only about the destruction of the slaughter, but also to kill two Taliban leaders.
The US interaction requested by the German client Oberst Klein Commissioner has been killed or affected by 142 people.
Green, SPD and left requested the Federal Officer Angela Merkel (CDU) to express themselves immediately before the Federal Day and also to clarify what Goodtenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel must explain whether a strategy of the targeted murder part of the Afghan Government's federal government is - and whether the Canzleramt, Federal and News Service has accepted this new strategy, requests Jürgen Trittin and Green College Kunst.
Government speaker Ulrich Wilhelm resolved the criticism.
He said that the Kanslerat did not have an impact on concrete impacts of the federal weapons in Afghanistan.
On Saturday, there were also doubts about the exhibition of the Ministry on the reasons for the release of Inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
After information from the SPIEGEL, the two goodtenbergs have corrected and completely informed about the background of the tankclaster attack.
Officially, they had relyed the existence of the Nato reports and maintained sensitive details to the Minister.
However, in the area of the two spectrum officials, they had even indicated the Ministry of Defence on several reports, including a double document of the commanded Oberst Klein and a field report.
The "Frankfurter General Sunday Times" reports in a letter to clarify the content.
He has not received a reply, it means.
The Ministry was not expressed to the prosecution on Saturday and said that this would be declared in the Federal Committee of Investigation, which was intended to constitute himself at the next midday.
Sound worlds
Some see in watching images and voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in psychological nurses and in drug smoking, the borders between immagination and reality fall.
As long as it happens in bed, it's okay.
When we have closed eyes in our dark rooms, we can unacceptablely give us the most wilden ideas and fantasies.
However, those who experience in the wake, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are mostly disappointed or drugly in the modern Western world, at least as specialists.
But such images and voices are not only psychological or drugs.
Debt has our imagination: the same neuron processes that allow us to develop houses, decorate images or write Romans, in addition to ensure that the borders between dreams, wounds and reality disappear.
Soundly changed observation situations can appear in the different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case.
Even if it seems to be different, the visions of mysticin Help of Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophecies Carlos Castaneda, shamanic inclinations, psychopaths and halusinations can be returned to similar processes.
Haluzinations or preconceptions occur when the balance of neuron botanic substances of the brain - all premature dopamine, noadrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholin - is accumulated and the interaction of different brain lines has been interacted.
Complete hallucinations and awesome thoughts often occur during a shocked psychopathy.
The weakness has no power over him.
The connection of angry and dream has been employed by philosophes and medicines since the antiquity.
Aristoteles describes hallucinations as a form of a dream in the waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founder of the modern psychiatries, realized 1861 a "great identity of the Irish with dreams" for Sigmund joy was the dream of "a psychosis, with all of the immorality, awareness, sensations of a such."
It's early 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic figure.
His body is twodimensional and quiet.
The weakness has no power over him, he spends on the room deck.
He feels a trick.
Through him flewed diamonds with blutrod, dispersed fractures, dental.
They kisse him, get him with severe, fleeting shoes, shoot him against the walls, he feels the pain of the whole body.
Sweet, bad voices shine from walls and radios.
He can't take her anymore, the voices that torment and policy him.
Henning T. takes two cables from the stereoon plant, touchs it to a sling and confirms it at a hake at the board.
He stands on a voice speaker and slings around the hals.
Spring.
The slinges will be solved.
This should be a teaching to you, shouting the voices in a thrombole-flood chor, "Go to the clinic and let you heal you!"
Today Henning T. 40 years old, he has experienced six accused psychos, the last two years back, the first 20 years.
She was removed by LSD.
His diagnosis calls pizoefective paranoid psicose, and also is human-depressive, he takes medically against the depression, the Manie, the Schizoperation.
He has learned to live with his sickness since three years he was married.
In the psychosis, I have experienced the worst and deepest disaster, he says.
The trug images are awesome reality
At least one percent of the population suffers shockoperation at least once in life, in psychiatric clinics, it will be treated as the second-thirdest disease after depression.
In a acute discorded psychosis, interested persons can mostly not differ between internal and external worlds, they are in a superflued condition that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or persecution weak.
In particular, the voice is distributed - the voice that commands, comments or dialogues.
Also, optical hallucinations are not rare.
The interested one may not be divided from an incertitude, the brain can't filter the slaughtering signals, the consciousness is overwhelmed by the impressions.
Like the dream, the psychose also opens the clauses for a flow of ideas and phansians, which deeply deeply consciousness.
The permission of reality in the psychose is underejected, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, overseer of the clinic for general psychiatries in the university clinic Heidelberg.
The shooter is located in the center of the storm, everything has an important importance on it.
At the same time, he is in a passive role, he will be, like in the dream, overcome from the events and cannot act.
Thus, shifts often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
They are mostly unable to deal with reality, the trug images are grainly reality, excluding wave.
Once in life, a hallucination is experienced
Rather than in the dream, Fuchs says, "but remain the sensible and space structure of the reality, which is understood in the psychosis, is essentially obtained."
The weird thoughts and hallucinations falled in the reality, the relief of life is in the real framework.
Why exactly our brain capriolen is shocking, researchers still make up the race.
Exemptions can lead to a short loss of reality in each person, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
It seems to have a genetic event on shock operation, but trilling studies have shown that genes are not the only factors determined.
Scientists believe that there is a minimum brain damage in those concerned.
We believe that the neuron reefficiency of the brain is cut in a early stage of development, explains a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, for example, fire.
But it remains a race, such as the disorder of the neuronal system, which first has not been shown for many years.
Environmental impacts also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be solved for a psychosis when the displacement is available.
Pollusinogen drugs can also solve psychoses, since they enter into the transitor system.
If our brain flows warm
The crazy is that psychotics suffer under their hallucinations and smell physicians to get them out, others give money for drugs for which to get, says the Psychology Profesor Erich Kasten.
Whether Trug images are recognized or unacceptable, it is often only a question of the position.
The boxes have been assembled for ten years on haluzinations and appearances, he has evaluated his results in the book "The irreal world in our head".
Haluzinations belong to the typical association of psicose, but also from surprising many other diseases.
In addition to psychological disorders, such as borderline or depression, there are also diseases such as migrees, epilepsia, multiple sklerose or alzheimer and skin space.
Surprisingly, in certain conditions, the brain itself pollues healthy humans.
Haluzinations, such as boxes, are assembled with memorandums that are normally retained.
They come out when hirnareale, in which senses are processed, is overactive or too few; when our brain runs warm or even if stimulation is missing.
Drugs can solve this condition as well as brain damages or a psychosis.
But also the outcome of travel, stress, love chair or other mental exceptions.
In recent studies, until a third of the questionnaires had experienced at least once in the life.
In the summer 2005 Sarah K. 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg and visits the Gymnasium.
A very normal girl, actually.
If the pictures and voices weren't there.
In the pause it may happen that a shocked boy with long, dark hair calls it.
When it answers him, the students are surprised - nobody else see or listens to these kids.
They're holding the shooting girl for a sweet dayroomer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream that she knows.
She's watching, she hears and sees these kids, as she listens to the girl in the bank and looks.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
That's a good feeling that she likes the boys.
I'm crazy, sometimes asking her.
But she knows that this boy and the other trug pictures are not real and disappeared.
Tonight the appearances are most shocking
The trug images are often a loading.
When it is sit in the classroom, it may sometimes not follow the material because the teacher is just a new teacher in their eyes and ears, while he explains to all other mathematical equations on the table.
Tonight the appearances are most shocking.
If she waits in her dark room on the sleep, which comes too rare and too late, she can often not differ whether she is waken or already dreaming whether the pictures that she sees, the frats or the girl with the blown sleeves of arms and kids, appear before her open or closed eyes.
Get me in calm, should the shoots.
Parents and friends say nothing about those who would keep them crazy.
Thursday 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old.
She's got the department last year and lives with her friend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she has been in the Internet contact with the psychologic box, she knows exactly that she's not crazy.
Hahn is also an art work of dismissing
If someone is socially isolated or carried out on travel, he has a great probability after a time of hallucination, says the box.
I feel that the brain is then underemployed and provides itself for his entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, had fear of other children, often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned with 13 that the man her named Dad is not her body father.
As the same brain areas are active in visual and acoustic hallucinations, which also process real impressions and machines, it is difficult to distinguish such as Sarah K., Trug images and Reality. "Each experience," says the box, "that is found in the brain, the reality is out there.
Haluzinations are also images that can emerge to the brain, so they affect so real."
Even evening dream images value boxes as a form of haluzination.
The haluzinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of an acute psychosis.
In contrast to shocks, psychological health can be able to recognise their trug images as irreal.
Casters therefore supports his patients to evaluate hallucinations as special ability.
Limitation between dream and halusination
In our very conscious world, imagine experiences are most pathologically pathologically, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and Chefarzt of the clinic for psychiatrie and psychotherapy of Florence-Nightingale hospitals in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, unfortunate disease, but it also engages positive, creatives - sweet is also a work of art of dismissing.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated the so-called unreasonable experience form, a special form of the dreamly changed observing consciousness.
Oneroids are high-complete, detailed Quasi devices that hold the experience for reality and who can not distinguish from the guard condition.
The inherited consciousness situation consists of extreme situations in trauma or disease, for example, in polyradiculitis patients who experience a motor decline in full consciousness.
If a person is threatening self- and world loss, such as by continuing, full movement inficiency, he replaces the dangerous reality by means of a own, imaginative world, which is deleted by the reality, Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of border situation between dream and haluzination.
Since the detriment of a situation in reality is not possible, a world change is placed, but the real situation is refined in immagination.
Intensive form of sense and sensation in an unreasonable situation that allows us to humans to do with no conscious loss.
Everything is real, even later in the memory
He also describes his uniroid experiences in his book "Change change" as the soul's salvation action.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness is on the journey after a cardiac clapper operation with the heart transplantation, while his body is condemned at the intensive station to movelessness.
Claussen looks at one in a self-created world, visits foreign times and places: He lives as a tragic, old man, on the board of a train analysis, a robot waits for his health.
He lives in the early medium-term age under adligen who produces smokes from blood.
When a Greek on the motor route is shocked in its homeland, his spirit bed is surrounded in the woods of the Alpen and is a corean mafioso.
He's fully on the imagined stories, everything is real, even later in the memory.
These internal travels are fundamentally different for clauses from each dream.
Sound is another condition, he describes his experience.
On the contrary, my memories from mental travels are most clearly for years and in close details.
German and intensive even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience is the horizon of our other world experiences, says the psychiater Schmidt-Degenhard.
Last ends shows oneroids, psychops, hallucinations and drugs, as brüchly our internal figures of the external reality are also in guard.
Each change of the consciousness, resued by the psychologist box, can lead to a transformation of what we call reality.
A experience that can also be a range of interests.

Burden
Childs should take the association with 27 years of age
The new leading box is a intermediate solution: Hubert Burda long-term wants to give his company into the hands of his two children, said to the SPIEGEL.
The holding will also be 100% of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The Trainer Hubert Burda sees his business long-term in the hands of his children.
Both children have been over 27 years and have the strong will to join the company, said the 69-year-old boys to SPIEGEL.
The details have been carefully regulated.
The question of whether they are active in the company is only then.
The question is also whether they are in a position.
No 7500 employees can provide their children if they are not sufficiently able.
This brings the children around and the company also.
Burda was announced on Thursday that he returned from January from the presidency, and Paul-Bernhard Kallen called his followers.
The 52-year-old Kallen is a member of the headquarters in Burda since 1999.
First he was responsible for technology.
Later, Treasury's responsibilities for enterprises and after the separation of Jürgen's dead heights were also the responsibility for direct marketing, foreigners, pressures and finances.
For the first time, there is no family member at the top of the movement.
Burdas are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
The name of Kallen also makes it possible to overcome 10.15 years, says Burda.
The holding should also belong to 100% of the family, said Burda.
In view of the cases of Schickedness and Scheffler, Burda expressed that family companies did not be safe before the department: "It is always the case of families who were shocked by a capital view that had completely shocked up and thought they could get up to the very great player.
My strategy was never.
He had no world power dreams, so Burda.
I don't see me as the political preceptor of this country as Springer, and I don't want to play in the world's link with 'Time', these loads have become too large.

Christmas is always closer and therefore it is a good opportunity to copy the appearance of the stars and take their fellow clothes into our clothes.
The form of the decollection, which is very important to renew the silhouette, is one of the points that must be considered.

Endsa and Barcelona with the electronic car
The electricity company has created the "LIVE office" together with the city of Barcelona.
This is a project for the development and promotion of the electronic car in the capital of Catalonia.
The "LIVE Office" (Logic for Electronic Car Introduction) will define and coordinate the route map for the introduction of the electronic car in the city, including the mobility by the manager, coordinating, supporting, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is to be developed to promote electronic cars and opinions and measures of the areas employed.
This is a attempt to advance the transportation of the future.
3 "Electronic cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electronic car in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla also participate in this project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electronic car.
Finally, the electricity company has signed a framework contract with the Government of Catalonia (the Generalitat).
With this Framework Treaty, you would like to promote the activities of research and technological development in the autonome Community catalonies.
These activities are among others related to energy and, in particular, their performance.
However, it is not the only initiative that is finally involved in the promotion of the electric vehicle.

Zapatero sees "a horizon of peace" for the car sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, is the prophecy of the Spanish car industry, which is the largest exporter of the country, "one horizon of peace".
In the presentation of the economic report for 2009 by the Government's Chairman, Zapatero reiterated again on the interventions that the Government has put to Gang in support of the automobile sector during the year.
"Other than the auto industry's competitiveness plan, we had today a panorama of the degradation and shocking of some of our main production works," said the President.
"Thank this plan and the provision of the car manufacturers, even in future in Spain in a very competitive industry, we can see a tranquille horizon for the cause of this industry, which is our larger export industry," he added.
In addition, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, the part of the Summit for Auto Industry (PIA), has provided 800 million euros for projects of 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 providers, which resurrected for investments of more than EUR 3 billion.
The Head of Government stated that these investments are determined for the development of new models as well as for the modernization of existing products and procedures.
Zapatero also stressed the interventions of the Government to encourage the demand, in response to the 2000E plan, which are implemented in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and the car manufacturers.
According to the Governing Body, this plan allows to reduce the average 6% of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market, which resulted in a "enhanced increase" in the authorisations in November.

Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmental sports
Mazda wants to prove that sports are agreed with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda has recently shown the automatic stop and driver system of the motor, which is baptized on the name i-Stop, a device which is only available for the 2.0 benzin engine with 150 PS at the time.
This second generation of the Mazdas 3 is represented by its good notes in the total image.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its strand behavior, the mechanism, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" at the new Mazda3.
Starting at the front site can be found that the front seat offers an excellent ergonomy and good holding.
Moreover, the Lencrad's game is excellent.
In any further consideration of the unit that consists of the instrument table and the instrument bar, the Mazda can find that there is a variety of clusters and switches in the observing colors red and blue on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a future internal sign.
This style reminds us partly of the style of Honda Civic.
Therefore, without further information, it can be said that both the Mazda 3, as well as the Civic, both Japanese models, of the use of the German cars, especially from the Gulf of Volkswagen, which all want to be overcome.
The bike route of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than the corresponding comfort, so that four adults can first walk with the car.
To all this comes a large space and clearly formatted coffee room.
The stop and driver system is only available for the 2-Liter benzin engine with 150 PS and a 6-gamp maintenance.
This engine, however, is a genius. It is produced by its fainity, by its leisure equipment, its performances and by its low consumption.
And all those who do not walk a lot of kilometers in the year should take into consideration this i-top with a benzin motor because of its great comfort in gangs maintenance and small consumption, even if in Mazda, mostly the models are the sales of these.
As regards the exhibition, the so-called model sport is a speciality, since it has a significant increased number of elements from the series of expenses.
The serial reserve is mainly the assistant for driving switching (RVM), which is designed by the dead switch, but also the components for the traction and stability, the speed, the light-find internal level, the switch computer with a green screen, the sensors to park, a independent climate system, rain and light scenes, Bluetooth and audio bluetooth, as well as the broken 17-Zoll flights.
This version also includes, as if it was not enough for equity, the premium package that contains an additional EUR 1.500: other elements, especially the learnable Bixenon switchers and the sound system BOSE with CD-loading.
Fazite
The Mazda3 2.0 i-top is one of its best compact cars.
It is particularly amazing about the materials used, because of his conduct and the variety of equipment.
Furthermore, those who do not return a lot of kilometers a year may also buy the i-top version that is available only with a 2.0 benzin engine with 150 PS.
The only negative to this model is a little higher price between 21.770 euros for the model luxury and 23.270 euros for the provisional model sport.
However, as a contrary to this high price, the Mazda3 offers us every day to the new highest path.
A Premier with a lot of gl love
L.A. rolls the red pitch of the sensibility of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premier of "Noine" the stars, closed in models, which looked elegant as sexy more than ever. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as always, decided for a dark "Lady".
The discussions of FonPeek
Peek is first limited to a device with which you can only read his emails without a possibility to see or overlook some attachments via the Internet.
It has met his five minutes rhyme when it chosen the magazine Time to one of the products of the year.
It is to see on the streets, it is most likely, but the idea of itself is particularly interested for young people.
On the contrary to the smartphones, Peek has a very poor flat rate, for example only half of the price of the flat rate of a iPhone.
After the company has seen the success, there were two new devices on the market: one that was just thought for Twitter, the other with a lifelong free service for data, in contrast to Peek, where you have to pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek, which was presented last night at the event Le Web, is the European version of this design and thus its third version.
It has the same borders as his American counterparty, however, has a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about 12 euros per month, includes Roaming for all Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone to the world already know what it means to refuse all the data to read their emails when you have crossed the border or if you are doubtless looking for a coffee with WIFI (or a connection with the background).
The idea of the roaming with flatrate is unbelievable and should have been possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for foreign stay, but my experience is already needed to read a doctor title in Physic and a good bright to read all the small printed.
The repeated criticism of the European Commission, as regards the tendency rates of roaming for all Europe, remained almost uncertain.
On the side of the own country, you always have fear of reading his emails and it with right.
This is a small device like FonPeek (but it is always surprising that it has the background name, although it does not have WiFi/WLAN), it means that the telephone providers need to be slow, but safe and start to take into consideration different options how they can use their data network.
Another good example is childle, in his prices, is the download of books and other requests on the Internet.
Without Vetrag and without haken.
This is a Internet-based device and you're paying for it only one time, namely for the purchase, and not for month.
And that's exactly what I hope also a day of FonPeek, a buying possibility with lifelong internet access, as it already offers Peek in the United States.
And that's not because I want to buy it.
I'll read my e-mails with the phone, thank you.
In particular, I expect this because I think it would be an appropriate model for consumers.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The color of Michelle
Well, without doubt, the color of the American First Lady is no doubt.
Soon at Barack Obama's Officer as President of the United States, they appeared in a clothes and a mantel of this color and have re-selected the same color to reach him in his life, without doubt, more dubble moments: the delivery of the nobel price in Oslo.
Michelle Obama had a very similar model on both sides: at least that it was nearly the same color - a brilliant green-, made the clothes of three parts - clothes, Jacke and mantels from the same substance, and then she got something largely shocked or a halsket.
It is even so that at the first time it appeared that the first Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the princess of Asturia and decided to take the same clothes in more than one.
However, the two clothes are very different in the substance of which they are prepared.
In the office, she took a clothes from pitze and in Oslo a modeled seed.
The Accessoires were also different: at first green shoes with half high paragraphs and secondly a magnificent model, but gold colors.
The fresh was also a different time: the hairs were highered at this place as a haircase, she opened the hair at the previous time.
75% of the professional mothers have been obtained because of their motherhood problems in the work
Discrimination in the work has been increased in the past years, especially in the young women who have wanted children.
This results from CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for Women, "Freeability and Career of Women in Spain".
The survey under 9.737 women between 15 and 75 years does not make doubts: 75% of the professional women are seeing their care rates on the labour market as a result of their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are great differences in the decision to found a family and the number of children, after working women or not, and if so, what kind of professionals they are doing.
Those who do not do any other activities around the house, only working half day or have no fixed employment contract, will be more mothers and have more children.
On the contrary, women have a fixed position, especially in the public, the creation of a family and motherhood and therefore have less children.
"Whos in the age group between 35 and 49 years of age receive their first child at average only 3,7 years after the assembly, a number that increases at 4,1 years of firm order, which has been used to achieve this, and who join them and the first child has been carried out a lot later.
The CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado also has a great impact on the maternity, even though less than the calendar for receipt,” said the CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is a further factor that must be taken into account during the age of women at the council and first child.
According to the survey, the age at the time of heritage and the first child is so higher than the level of education.
This difference could also be identified in women’s same age.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, after having only the primary school or a higher education, the average of 25.1 or 32.1 was the first time of mother.
There is also another difference in women after their level of education.
While women with main conclusions have already married to their first date and their first child, they make women with a medium or high school complete precisely different, and only seek a celebration and married later and then get their first child, Delgado is determined.
Diane Kruger is also valuable
The Oreal Paris has recently added a new name of the list of a mailing list: Diane Kruger.
Since the next year, the German shoes will be the image of various brand products and also the generally known advertising term "Why you are valued."
The main designers of "Joyeux Noel", one of the most elegant players at the international level, will become another famous sculpture, such as Linda Evangelist, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last ones who attended this exclusive club were the players of the Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millennium").
With the men, the cosmetic company also has an exceptional committee: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey ́s Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (Grey ́s Anatomy") (Evangeline College College in "Lost").
The price allocation of the British Mode industry
The Britishs have to share a major word in the modern world.
Your Highest Representatives - Models and Models, both last night and today - are at the annual price loans held in London in the Royal Court of Justice.
To this point, they were all appearing.
The ex-Modell Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, chosen for the best model this year.
The poker game of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent represents the "Poker of the Asses" in "Alfaguara, forms of Fernando Vicente" to the three-wheel root pictures of writers who joined him in his literal life (and, in some cases, also in real life).
In this way, he does not use a predictable and horrible gene (courzbiography, life and work), but seeks an identity to the flattering heart of the Creator.
The journey is awesome and the Vicent does not disappear any of the horrors or lights.
As far as this book is a fair reading, it is also a moved call for reading and always reading.
Here are some extractions from the book.
About Albert Camus: "I found at his pages that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but much more a spiritual, almost sensible trib, as I always recommended, without finding words: the joy, in contrast to the unclean, the moral without fault and the innocence without any God."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nhihilist, the Algorian Christ, he wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, between the power and the inconsciousness, with a poetical humor, without any sense, like the measuring that had almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was joined by this woman with a suffering, who had thirty years of suffering, whose emotions were cut into her bath, in which the emotions of the marriage of the marriage agreed with the joy of reue, a spiritual privileg, which was to come in the heavens on the way of destruction."
About James Jimmy: "The Odysseus" was issued in Paris by Sylvia Beach in 1922. This is one of the 8000 summits in the world literature, which must be loaded at the northern port, at the wall where the best mountains are still new."
About William Faulkner: "He was a comma shop.
Sometimes he said about himself that he would be the heritage of a good owner of the Grafship and another time he said he would be the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams created from a certain size."
About Louis-Ferninand Céline: This writer took the smile cry of a bridge out of that personality from München, so that his echo to deep in the night of the 20th century, in his literal way. This he made a journey on which he flyed before himself and with a speak of full violence before the wools.
About Dorothy Parker: "Another day she went and prayed: my God, my proud God, I ask you to do everything in your power, so that I finally stop writeing a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "These verses of Spencer are covered by Joseph Conrad: 'The sleep after the struggle,/in the gate of the ports,/the calm after the war, and after a saved life, they are found cases at death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In her bag she always had her depressions.
The husband took it with full normality when she told him that Eduard VII was spontaneous between the Azaleans or the birds were covered in Greek.
It is not the only other case where the man took so much patience and was loved in a neurotics whose literary talent was still much greater than its crazy."
About Pio Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do not try to pull the Church in Baroja?
What did Benet care when he didn't get Baroja to the guns of Faulkner?
And what did this make to destroy the spirit of that man, except that he could put himself on this power?"
Feed aggression
My 70-year-old mother went through our town in the town of Fuenlabrada last week as a group of young people from 15 to 18 years near her and our dog, our dog is a mixed man that we had helped from the animal home and the only six pounds of the city, and then they passed two footsteps from the heavens, and he was hard to hurt him.
Our deployment cannot be in the words because it is incomprehensible to us, as the path should be against a small and unable animal, which is self-respectively carried out on the line.
In this way, the case of a woman who was pleasantly swimming, when she wanted to justify those persons because of the incident, she feared even her own life, because if such a skin anger attacks a dog, he may also be also with a woman, a child, a older Lord or probably even doing with anyone who is weaker than he himself.
The case was held in a normally quiet town celebration at five hours after the afternoon at a very common service day.
The dog has been over the whole day.
Of course, we have made an indication in a nearby police office, but we have great doubt whether it will take something and to predict any prejudiciary from the beginning, we only want to find out that the fellow offenders were the Spanish.
Our discovery on the event has made it possible to show this incident.
We can't understand what should be done in the heads of these young people, that they find a valuable attack on a helpless animal, on a animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We don't know where the good education and respect for animals and people remain.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the Helm
Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Transport Safety (Fesvial), called a campaign for the promotion of Helm use, especially for the recent motorcycle drivers, as it is today announcing both companies.
This initiative is intended to take note of the importance of heat use, as it is finally the only protective element that can prevent head attacks or even death in the case of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign was part of its commitment to transport security, which "wise covers more than just the design and manufacturing of products that will be more secure every day" and reaffirmed that they also contribute to a step closer to other activities of Beijing and Informative Characters every day.
This new campaign for the promotion of the heavy use on the motorway runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be' will be distributed in a first stage of over 500 motor routes in order to achieve the best possible distribution.
As a result, Michelin emphasized that transport safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and just because it is always obliged to see the manufacturer of rifs for two-related vehicles that one of its main objectives should be the development of more secure products.
The sale of small load cars increases something again
After almost two years, the market for small transporters finally begins to see something light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9.425 vehicles authorized in Spain in November means an increase of 12.6% in 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first increase after 22 months, with a constant decline, as a result of the numbers presented by the manufacturer association and the Ganjam Group.
However, these good numbers are only to enjoy with great attention at the time, since the reference data from November 2008, which was a very bad sale year with a decline of 60 % in respect of the previous year.
However, notwithstanding the increase in the last month, the total authorisations of these 11 months are still 40 % below the sales numbers of the previous business year.
Since January, 95.853 vehicles were sold, but this number contains all vehicles from which the small transporter market consists: switching of persons' cars, pick-ups, small transporters, small delivery cars and smaller cars/facilities.
Moreover, they are still the same swimming waves on the sky, which are mostly involved in the demand, as even if some of the vehicles of private persons are purchased, the large part of the sales is to smaller and medium-sized enterprises that operate in almost 100% of all cases with a third financing.
In this way, these restrictions, which are the consequences of the shifted monetary headquarters of the credit institutions, must be included in further factors, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the deterioration of the loss of the economic situation.
In this panorama and in contrast with persons' motor vehicles, the financial support was little helped to purchase a vehicle of the 2000E plan.
However, this plan is not only intended for private persons, but also for self-employed and small enterprises, if they want to buy a small transporter up to 3,5 tonnes with a CO2 exit that can not exceed 160 grams per kilometer, but the low sales numbers speak for themselves.
Once last night, Ghanamel had reminded that it was necessary if the State was necessary, also a special attention to this small layer and of course also to the industrial vehicles (last car and bus).
The Prophecy for the 2010 year of a similar year, as it just wins, for which it is 19 % of a sales disappearing (in persons' cars and indoor cars).
Support for Bremsmanagers in critical situations is now obliged
As it was already in the anti-blocking system ABS, and as it happens now with the stability control of ESP, the aid systems must be an obligation for emergency in European cars.
In fact, they are already obligation for all newly authorised persons and light small transporters, for the rest of the vehicles, to the end of February 2011.
The measures decided by the European Union are aimed at improving the protection of the flight adjacents, but these broadcasting systems can also help to prevent many accidents.
The task of the emergency assistant is to exercise pressure on the brems in the case of a critical bremsmanager, which recognizes the system based on the bramspecial power carried out by the driver.
However, this system does not end this pressure until it ends.
According to an investigation provided by the component manufacturer for the bosch manufacturers, a third of the drivers in an accident was not anymore cutting up to the Bremspecial and half of them had not been cut off with full power.
Up to 1.100 accidents
However, the brake aid is rolled with maximum strength in the fresh system and reduces the fresh period and thus the fresh distance that a car is left at the break.
According to a EU study each year, death accidents could be prevented if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency assistant.
It would even give a fewer accidents - it would be calculated that every fourth accident could be prevented by person's damage - if the so-called intelligent emergency systems are popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that recognises obstacles (for radar or camera) and warns the driver, which already performs a light pressure on the fresh.
If the driver responds to it, the system will help him to increase the pressure on the Bremspecial if it would be necessary.
If the driver does not react to the warning and even if the constraint is already unfortunate, the bramsayist will make the maximum pressure on the fresh to keep the damage as small as possible.
General Motors moves the plan for Opel to January
While the participation of the Opel-Werks in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) has already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will be started in April during the first week, probably on 8th, the American vehicle manufacturer said that he needs more time to bring Opel's relief plan to end.
Nick Reilly, the new President of GM Europe, wants to achieve that the side concerned already has its approval to each point of the plan.
This may therefore be the final document that will first be submitted to the workers and then to the Governments of the countries where it works will be moved until the beginning of 2010.
This is assured by GM that it will take a decision on the sale of Saab in the following days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish Government has increased the pressure on the American car manufacturers to take a decision as soon as possible.
GM has to be contacted with some possible new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who would like to buy Volvo, but wins the option of the Dutch Sport manufacturer of Skyper, which has the Russian Conver group, always increased access.
If there should be no agreement with this buyer, GM could sell some actives to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to smile at the end of the year, if it has not been sold until then, will continue to be maintained.
The tax of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their new and very tear juwels, engineering used the Boxster S as a basis and really made it make it easier to make it about 80 pounds easier, making it just 1 275 kilos to wage now.
To create something like this, they refused as first on the automatic cutting bathroom that was replaced by a cell-in-law, with a manual skille, so that it was separated only 21 kilos of aluminium doors in this model, as well as the GT3 "switch" 15; by extinction of the climate system still 13; on the other hand, the fuel tank of 64 to 54 litres was reduced, so that further 7 kilos were divided; the construction of sportive Bacquet sites was still 12 and the 19-Zoll Fleeler was recovered.
Then you had also reached six kilos less and by the exchange of doors by the griffes of the substance the lack of kilo by means of the audio system CDR-30.
While it is also available with the double packing PDK, the test was performed with a vehicle with 6-gain hands, mainly on the smallest landscape streets of California, on mountain trails that really were very swimming.
Only the note can be given to him in the conduct of his driving.
The reduction of his weight, however, did not lead in any case because it would now not be so safe on the streets.
It is the contrary of the case: for many years we have not already tried a so small and easy model, which is also a feeling of great safe in the curves, even at high speed.
He's a small athlete to make his muscles warm at a low gang in the necessary time, until we give him the commands to raise, breathe, pick up and then again out of his motor...
He makes everything that you say to him, the car makes everything we eat with him with our hands on the lenkrad, thanks to his lensing, which is precisely comunical and specific.
And he's doing it with the precision of a surgery.
A motor unit for all squashing devices
The sound of your V6 boxers with 320 PS (10 more than the Boxster S) has been completely successful and you can still increase it with the 'sport' option and through a system that can change the motor equipment that has already been used at the panamera first.
The acceleration capacity is unproposedly cruel, unlike whether from the stage or when the new speed is renewed.
The Federations are strong, but not hard or unacceptable.
The asphalt on the landways where we passed with the boxster Spider was already very damaged, but the car was well skilled with the boxer spyder.
Electron Assistants had almost nothing to do on the whole road; and it was, although we found some of these curves in the morning green and roll speech on Sunday.
Comprehensively you can say that it is a extra easy car, a car with which you have an indescriptive path, how it's really rare, and it's much more than just a small improvement of boxster Ss.
The car will come to the market in February 2010 and costs 70.831 EURO.

Basconia gives himself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral celebrated, despite the many deceased players in Dusko Ivanovic's mansion, a wonderful triumph with 82-91 at his visit on the complex flyball field of Maccabi Electra, and thus comes on the first place within his group after the great event of Mirza Teletovic, which was with eight trif-faces of the best of his masterity (29 at the evaluation).
The team of Vitoria could replace the significant deficiencies of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov by a large dose of use and team work, even if they were waiting for the end of their victory.
The great part of the perimeter was out of 16 evaluated triffunctions, but the final victory of them had been involved.
The game began with the leadership of the blue reds that started on the display table.
Since the first four corners of Vitoria were already out of the perimeter, they could already recognize that they had come to the game field with well-warmed hands.
It was English and Teletovic, mostly responsible for the 18-20 end of the first fourth.
The second fourth was little different, just that the mansion from Alaba decided to be a internal game of Barac, and for the game of Eliyahu, who was received when he returned to the manity with Pfiffen and Applaus, which is his home, to continue to build their advantage to the pause (34-43).
Teletovic has already started to highlight 13 points, even if the "minus six" evaluation of slipters has already argued that this would not be the best night of Brazilians.
Nevertheless, the game was not a long decision, despite the clear advantage of the pause, and the macaboers wanted to remember that the Vitorians did not win anybody in their game field, and thanks to the assaulting "Hand of Elias" they came back to the game.
Eidson and Pnini were decisively helped to turn around the ruder (50-49).
Other shares
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but all other than the dead, had to prepare a few games with safety to get the air again and with one of them immediately came the pistoles of Mirza Teletovic, who had almost three matching trials and the support of English and Ribas, to ensure that it was shown in the showing box, which was refined by the guest at the end of the third fourth quarter (57-67).
The alaves were broken in the last fourth, and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to allow them to get the winning they had earned in the first three-minutes honestly.
Nevertheless, the named Pnini and Eidson, who did not try to give their manity again by three points of the line (70-77).
However, and even though splitters were placed for Fouls from the place, the team of Ivanovic did not get up, well defended and even though the Israelites still recovered in the last minute (80-85), the game had already been a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja's slaughter
Unicaja lost the volume in Greece against Olympiacos and had to deal with him with the leadership in the Euroliga group B, and that in a game that was signed by the exiles of the players of Unicaya (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially at the internal game, was marked by the Greek.
The Municipality from Málaga had no fear of stimulating the hall of peace and friendship, or of the opposite manity, which may have one of the most strong Europeans and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their offered games in the first fourth neighbors, the Andalusiers started dreaming. A aggressive defence and three matching trifacts, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, the guests with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the first Unicaja, even though the domestic manner with an internal game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis made it that the showing chair showed in 13 minutes 22-20 to their profits, the minute, in which it had been used by a action nearly to strike between the two American Beverley and Williams and that both were disqualified.
The Greek team began to become warm and his overwhelming on two games, while the distinction of the English country Joel Freeland was caused by an injury and the three mistakes caused by Carlos Jiménez clearly left at Unicaja.
Under their players in the internal field and the Lithuania predictor Linas Kleizas, with its three faches, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute at 44-32.
A reception year was impossible
The third playshop was expressed by many attacks against the massage of Olympiacos, which showed itself, despite his 19 losses, and even created the difference of the game engaged in Málaga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which brought the leadership into the group again.
Unicaja tried to move on the many deficiencies and the distinction of the latest shoten Robert Archibald during the game.
Despite the many parts of the Unicaya, in the 31th minute, thanks to the Federation and the triffunctions of cookies and the use of Lewis, a little hope was made on 66-57.
However, it was not possible, since the Olympiacos, when he attacked and showed his overwhelming with centimeters within the corb area, was not to be breathed.
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic created it in the 37th minute to increase the corb difference on 81-62 and Unicaja had to be shocked and had to defeat the leadership of an Olympiacos.

The Brazilian government has set a deadline to the stay of Manuel Zelaya in their message in Tegucigalpa.
The President from the Office shall leave the diplomatic delegation on 27 January 2010 if its mandate is officially executed.
Francisco Catunda, the delegate of the Brazilian news in the Honduras capital, confirmed the television television Globo that "Mel" had to leave the message before that date, where he had found the asylum since 21 September.
"He is conscious of the need to go on January 27, when his mandate is completed on this day and he has to find a new accommodation."
The sender also cited the former President who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the date set: "It is my position as soon as possible, logically with the backup of the Government of Brazil," Zelaya explained on the phone.
Following the elections on November 29 (which Porfirio Lobo was a winner) Zelaya assured that he will remain in the Brazilian message until January.
However, this week he tried to receive refugees in Brazil.
However, this claimed to the refusal of Zelayas to recognize the status of an asylum demanding politician who wanted to impose the "de facto" government under the presidency of Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much!
After the most locked days since the past spring year in which the activity was the predetermination of the markets, the insecurity of the markets is back to the markets, which is not wonderful because this is its natural condition, in a area where the macker decisions on a nature from the future are taken.
The measure used to stabilize the market was to compare the debts with the direct sale of Activea and to allow indirectly the liquidity of interests to be moved to the null to buy the active banks.
The Central Banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of Activea have been finished as well and, without taking into question their heerodox policy on liquidity, start to pursue some sand in the operations, as the ECB has already predicted with its annual decrease in the next week.
Therefore, investors are doubtful about the ability of global economy, the economic recovery without these heerodox measures, and we will only be witnessing to a change in risk prices.
Refugees of the bridges and the differences in the company's boost are rearing, even though they are still far away from the paranormal amounts they have reached at the beginning of the year.
The States were able to register private risks and re-establish state debts.
Once again, the United States, Japan and Germany are the preferential relief site of investors, which brings back to a increase in the differences in the euro zone countries in Germany.
Spain until now had little affected this episode of instability, but then standard & Poor's came and threatened to a new review towards Spain’s evaluation.
On the other hand, a certain insecurity does not harm to bring the defenders of the moral risk, which had once again tried to make a consciousness of the responsibilities of the world's economic policy, for what they had caused, because they had been decreasing the improved effects that had caused the restriction of credits to lose workers, when they actually had to declare a new day for a share of thanks.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai, is a staminate war between Emirs to restore the power in the Emirates and the development in Greece was also predicted before.
A government that disrupts the State debt, elections and a new government, which is on the same floor.
Prodi did it in Italy to Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
It does not mean that Ecofin Hungary saved the beginning of the year from the non-compliance of its foreign payments and therefore increases a euro-memberland to not meet its obligations.
However, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and its citizens to take up the obligation to maintain the stability of the State money in the need of an authential sense.
Yes, we are as expected to be a episode of normalization of risk prices, after some expenses to too high amounts, that would now be within the expected.
In the case of Spain, no concern should be made until the differences in State debt increased with the same speed as the European business bond.
However, if the European differences are reduced and the Spanish increased, it would be a special Spanish risk.
The standard & Poor's is a factor. While the indicators proposed are a large part of the market research institutions to provide their scenarios for recovery and to correct their scenario for 2011, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which returns to a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all the warnings are not long-term.
Repeat it seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although in the moment "Prepare for the driving."
Connected branches
The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was first before the Subcommittee of the Parliament, where in these days the Spain energy supply strategy is discussed in the next two decades.
After his arrival, following the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán of Presse made some indications on what he had submitted to the Subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the President of Iberdrola, Spain has to invest more than 50 billion euros from that date to 2030, under predicting that the current nuclear powers continue to be operated.
If this is not the case, the investment required would be not at 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that you should not be invested in increased energy production capacity, but in distributors and international associations.
From 2020, the question will be changed and the performance should be increased.
His proposal focuses both on gas and coal works with installations to open carbon dioxide and, of course, on the renewable energy.
In this case, he considers that 18.000 MW is needed, under the predictation naturally by other "supporting energy".
Galán, who is the view that the Sustainable Project for a Sustainable Economy, which was just adopted by the Government, is in line with what his undertakings requested, would, in no case, say something against this law how to create encouragement to national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposition of all political strategies in combating climate change.
His view of "the long-term stands clearly on this direction, despite some" individuals, is called the Chairman of Iberdrola.
It is like that, Galán means that the decisions to invest, even if they are long-term, should be taken, since it will need some time and create a stable reimbursement framework to attack them.
Ferrovial receives the "Handling" from Aer Lingus on ten airports

Acciona competites with high and high-speaking and bowygues for its first car rental in Australia
Acciona fights for the authorisation of his first car trains in Australia, a market where they are already represented as energy and water companies.

The third and last consortium, which is in the nearest election, is called LBRJV, which is formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (Autority of the German Building Enterprise, which is back to ACS), which also belongs to the Inland Baulderstone (in possession of the German bilfinger Berger group) and the French company Razel, who has specialized on the public construction.
The Australian market for infrastructures grants a valuable construction and privatisation, but has a degree that applies to overcome, only by purchasing an domestic construction company.
A strategy that has been followed by the undertakings of high or bill fingers, in addition to Asian references, and must be followed by the Spanish constructors.
Even ACS has reached access to this market only by its participation of 30 % of high, owner of the Leighton mentioned.
Million to Active
Acciona sets the highest importance in this geographical area for the sector where it is already known as energy suppliers and in the discharge industry.
Under another activity, it has already been the largest windmole park (192 MW) in Victoria, and the group of enterprises that have been employed to build and manage the displacement of Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
His hope is now to consolidate these two areas and to use these synergies to receive access to the two building and infrastructure.
The suburbane switch that is promoted by the Brisbane Infrastructure Office and is heating Northern Link (Nordzubringer) is the purpose of connecting the western roads in Toowong with the western streets in Kelvin Grove (see map) at a length of 5 kilometers through the tunnel. This is how the large mathematicy is to shoot up the streets of Brisbane.
The driving scheme issued by the city management provides the delivery for summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Even if this switch is to be opened for transport in the last months of 2014, it is estimated that the construction works will be delayed until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
He has two driving tracks in each direction, an electronic mood system and a complex dissolving system.
The Queensland government is involved in the financing of $500 million (308 million).
For the highest, Brisbane is already a big business.

The initial investment is EUR 75 million.

Application trade
On the other hand, the daughter company of the French company has been followed to the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application market site on the Internet.
In fact, this website is active in France and the United Kingdom.
You must wait until 2010 until this seat will be available in other countries like Spain.

A decision with which she becomes to the first woman, which has a high post in the food company.

On the credit of Salazar, the ex-Berater Ildefonso Ortega and Angel Fernández Noriega (Representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) were held before the National Assembly and confirmed that they had approved the movement of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV authorises the public exclusion proposed by the Investment Company Mer

New programs for observation of vehicles
In these days of accidents and accidents, KFZs are not only changing places.
Each day, thousands of vehicles have been converted into an accident are carried out in the work places where a good advertising has to be evaluated the damages caused and the costs for repair.
No single accident is equal and the calculation of costs for parts and hours may be a long and complex task.
The calculation of the repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros per hand, including the parts and hours of work, may be allowed up to two or three hours.
However, it is a question of minutes with the support of the latest information tools.
This is why almost 100 % of the good newspaper uses these types of systems.
Services and application providers for the evaluation of accidents and instances shall collect the information they receive from the manufacturers to edit them later and provide their customers in the form of a useful programme.
In Spain Audatex is part of the American Group Solera, the market leader; 80% of all guests are designed with their products.
The other two companies that competite with the tool Market for observation and development of a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data available to the manufacturer is everything different than simple.
According to Eduardo Velazquez, the sales leader of Audatex, is working with 63 manufacturers and importers, with each of them available the information in another format.
Furthermore, the quantity of data to be processed will continue to be larger until the point that in the past five years more versions, variants and motorizations came to the market than in the whole fiveteen years before.
When a new car comes on the market, the business begins.
It is a fair task, because each one of the thousand vehicles must be catalogued and set its prices.
Additionally, a "intelligent" graphic image is created by each model, where you can click different parts of the vehicle.
If it is a lot of sales models, the work may be closed in one week, if the procedure is so prompted.
If it is a less skilled car, it can take up three or four months. Audiex is currently available at 99.2% of the cars carried out in Spain with complete information.
They have, for example, information on the Porsche models, but not on Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the car park on the streets, there are more than 99 %.

There works more than hundred technicians (normally mechanical experts) simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in the processing of these databases.
Each month they take 2,5 million data and receive their customers updates every second day.
The development of this huge information flow allows the companies to use them in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use of repairs and installations, however, there are also tools for the management of cracks or for calculating the value of a car or rest.
The only company that informs about a driver that is about the value of the cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex offers this offer not in Spain, but in the United States.
In the supervision of the products offered by Audatex, you can easily see the type of support which they provide to the sector experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star of the AudaPlus products, a standard solution to use accidents for the actors.
It contains vehicles, motor drives and light and serious industrial vehicles.
In addition to the costs for the parts, it contain the reparatory periods or the lacking prices estimated by the manufacturer.
This tool will be paid after use, i.e. for each guest.
First of all, it will be used for customers who are rare, at least 10 times in the month, that is 5,75 euro per month.
However, any insurance company, which offers thousands of guatachten, is negotiating the price with Audatex.
With other products such as AudaVIN, you can be able to identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it is carried out from the assembly band, only on the hand of the driver number.
AudaGlass is employed with the vehicle schedules, and AudaSubastas is a service for the internet's open market market in which you can provide for vehicles explained as a whole.
Their statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, implementing geodemographic analysis or enhancing information on the deferences to mark and model.
For example, you can investigate how many models of a certain automarks were required because of skins or how many of them had been employed into a serious accident in a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company that is the development of this type of computer tools.
It provides among other Gt estimates, which is also determined for good workshops and provides the same type of digital images, access to parts or prices and official working time of the manufacturer.
