What indicates that Russia comes out of the crisis?
Economists have seen the signs of Russia's exit from the most permanent recession in the last twenty-first years.
As noted by the requested Bloomberg analytical agencies, the RFB demonstrates a positive dynamic, in the second quarter of GDP slowed to 0.8 per cent in the annual expression.
This indicator is minimum since the beginning of 2015.
According to the last data, Russian economy was decreased by 0.6 per cent in the second quarter.
The stabilisation of the situation has also recently been declared by the Centre and the Middle Eastern Development.
Previous growth.
According to the CIA experts, the recession in Russian economy remained in the past.
The Russian Index Evaluation states that recession remained behind, and the advanced growth of the economy,” says the Russian Bank Bulletin, “What the trends say.”
The module assessment of GDP for the current quarter of regulators has increased up to 0.4 per cent, the fourth quarter is 0.5 per cent.
As noted by the representative of the Minoon Development, during the second quarter of GDP RF was stopped in the second quarter, 0.2 per cent.
In the second quarter, the purification of GDP was 0.2 per cent to the previous quarter.
However, during the quarter of fall, he was 0.2 per cent in April, and in May and June, the GDP change was 0-0.15," quotes the representative of MED RIA News.
The delay of the Russian economy during the last fifth quarters shows that "his long."
Among other marketmarks that indicate national economy live, Bloomberg calls an increase in electricity demand and iron transport to business.
If an amendment to that year is high, it is understanding that the dynamics in more than 1 per cent of electricity consumption may be covered by half of the working day.
Add to this lower average year temperature in the first quarter.
The following argument is the growth of shipments, but it is difficult to get accurate data, and 0.5 per cent of the half-year amount can also be explained,” explains Kirill Jacobko from AROR BROCER.
Others, however, have more clear signs of the stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, reduction of value pressure.
The user price index was 7.2 per cent compared to 15.6 per cent in the same month.
Moreover, the last two weeks of Rosstat fixed the deflation.
The prices in Russia have been decreased in the first five years.
If you look at the dynasm of the rubber currency, which has also shown strong counteracts at the beginning of the year, the results of August have been increased to 12 per cent since the beginning of the year.
It is also one of the signs of recovery to which indicators should be taken from the real economy sector,” emphasized Jacob.
In addition, from April to April, industrial production increases are observed.
In June, the rate increased by 1.7 per cent.
The decline of the decline of trafficking from -32.8 per cent in January 2016 to -20.7 per cent in May.
The positive dynamic also demonstrates the situation in the labour market, where unemployment levels were decreased to 5,4 per cent.
He was only in September 2015 (5.2%).
Despite the well-being situation in the labour market, the question of the real income of the population is to remain better.
In the annual expression, the indicator is decreased to 4.8 per cent.
This factor may decrease the recovery of the economy, since household costs have a small contribution to GDP.
Normally, their share in the economy is over 50%.
In addition to low consumer activity, the Russian Bank's huge risk factors can also be called.
The regulator keeps the rate of 10.5 per cent, which is not the most real sector.
The inequalities of investment are also insufficiently high levels of industrial capacity.
However, in the general way, it can be suggested that the economic slows up to 0.5 per cent against -3.7 per cent in 2015,” said the GC Forex Club Irina Rhova.
The naturalization process of sports launched recently in Russian football and excellently living in winters at Olimpía in Sochie until it is actively developed in summer sports.

The girl had no choice.
There she decided to go on the stages of her old sister -- to take a easy atletic.
Lisa has chosen six pieces with her sister.
Don't stay in Russia, if it couldn't be able to shoot from the throne, Elena Isnbaev.
Unfortunately, the Olympics in Rio Lisa will be our only terrace, eve and former, in the sixth sector.
The best achievement of her sports is a champion bronze of Europe in 2010 and the silver of the continent in 2016, which she once again in the absence of Elena Ismbaev.

After two years before that, she decided to win the blonde meal of the Olympic Games.
Another gymnastic, just this time sportive, is Irina Sazona.
If the way of immigration mentioned previous sports can be deemed standards, the choice of the Irish family is very unnecessary.

The Plass Moskwa is checking the reason for housing and communication services, since there are little parts of the budgetary support and money for numerous populations.
It's probably all together and explains the peaceful situation in Moscow.
Are all engaged in the will of regional authorities?

Can Erdogan reject friendship with the EU and the United States?
The President of Turkey, Regep Tyip Erdogan, issued the U.S. switch, proposed to make a choice between Turkey and Fethullah Gulen, Islamic preacher accused of the government movement organization.
In this regard, he declared before his partners in Ankara.
Erdogan called for the Americans to reject the support of the “terrorism organization of the phtopulists”.
This is not the first statement from Turkey, in which the United States call for a change of their position.
Experts believe that Turkey's relations with the West continues to be more slow and could try to change the power in the country.
"Amerika will make a choice between Turkey and the FETO ("Terrorist Organization of Phetularists").
Life organizing FETOs or democratic Turkey.
She must do this choice," quotes the Anatolian Task Force of Training Erdogoan, who was called at midnight in Ankara.
The President of Turkey was typically, but he had already needed the United States to comply with its requirements, which they first had received after the murder.
Remember, in the night of 16 July, that Turkey's high-employed representatives had been tried to pursue the legitimate authority in the country, as well as to pursue the heads of the State.
However, after the treatment of the population, the complaint was sent, and his organizations and participants were arrested.
A total of 80,000 people were slaughtered in a number of more than military students.
According to Regipe Erdogan, their employer Fethulls Gulen, who lives in the United States.
Additionally, the Erdogan partners also allowed that the doors can be interrupted and the Americans directly.
The United States checked all the claims in his address, refused to issue Gulene and recommended to change the ton.
The last statement of the representatives of Gossip to this account was called at the time of the visit of Erdogan in San Petersburg in the past Sunday.
However, this does not stop the President of Turkey - that is deeply insisting and also gives the requirements to others to their western partners.
"Ankara stops to comply with its migration agreement with Europe if Brussels does not have the date of the cancellation of visa limits for Turkey citizens," said the Minister of Turkey on the affairs of the EU, Omer Chelico, on 9 August.
In his words, the change of Ankara in the anti-terrorism law, as the EU requires, will threaten Europe's own security.
Note that 1 August, the Vice-Chairperson of Germany Zigmar Gabriel needed to stop the load of Europe from the promises of opening the border for migrants to facilitate the visa regime from the EU.
His words were answered to the corresponding statement of the head of the MID Turchia Mevolta Chauschhol.
Another promulgation statement of Chauschlol made in the past, allowing Turkey to go out of NATO.
The Turkish MID head did not exclude that the country would consider the possibility of retirement from the aliens if it had not been expected to meet it.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defence area is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries who cooperate with foreign States in the defence area - they take missiles", said Chauschhol to the Anadolu Agency interview.
He said that Turkey must now establish its own defence system based on its technologies and cooperate with other countries.
"Turkey has still tried to cooperate with NATO countries, but the results were not satisfied, and we were looking for others," said the Minister.
Experts believe that this is all about the serious differences of Turkey with the West and the transition of the country to the East.
Head of the International Political Expert Institute, Eugene Minchenko, believes that Regipe Erdogan is now leading to its game and could not go to a huge conflict with the West.
He has been very bound to the West and the point of business, and from the point of view of the military (Turkey is a member of the NATO), so I think that Erdogan will try to balance by maintaining rational relations with the West.
Although, of course, the Americans would be better to see the full obedience of this post," Iaf.ru expert explained.
He said, not only that after the statements of the Turkish leader (and the unpaymented compensation of the EU, on the demand of an unvisibility space with Europe and the extradition of Guinea from the United States) will be given to it.
"The Regiment of Erdogan is confronted with the deterioration of relationships and with America, and with Europe, which they will give it just on humanitarian matters, on the dictatoral methods of country management and so further", believes Minchenko.
Head of the Centre of Political Information Alexy Muchin allows the President of Turkey to change its views in Russia as it would be a favorable.
Eight months ago, Erdogan made a extreme strict position towards Russia, and in all ways, he searched for goodness in the West.
At least a small time, the situation was changed to the anti-food.
Garanties that after some time the President of Turkey did not rechange its priorities.
I think Erdogan has entered a slight diplomacy.
He will try to get the maximum benefit for himself,” believes Mohammed.
He believes that the main task for the President of Turkey is to maintain the political authority in the country today, and that the need for Russia and the partnerships with the Gulf of Putium to remain supported by the United States.
Turkey also needs the EU and the United States that control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
The agreement with Turkey will therefore be achieved," is the expert.
Another point is the head of the Asian Centre and the Middle East Anna Glasov.
Now the relations between Turkey and the EU and the United States are sufficiently pressed, and it is in the first way related to the internal policy carried out by Erdogan.
I think that this crisis will be decreased, and on the basis of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to reload policies as well as in the Middle East and in Russia.
Nevertheless, the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, states that they are willing to change their position on the whole issue of Syria, to resolve the relationship with Israel, is an active political relationship with Iran,” explained AiF.ru Glazavu, which allows that the next step of Ardogane would be normalized with the Egyptians.
According to her, the policy now carried out by Erdogan is the return to the course of an external policy concept which follows Turkey before the Arab Revolutions.
"The same time in the positions " no problem with neighbors " Turkey began to develop its relationship with the Middle East and the Asian region.
The very lucky visits of the President of Turkey in Russia and Africa have been ongoing.
The vector of the external policy will therefore develop and contribute to the strengthening of Turkey ' s positions in both regional and international airlines," is an expert.
The Global Committee believes that Turkey will be incredibly difficult to return to the previous relations with the EU, and now the question is whether the EU will begin to respond evilly to Turkey, which could be opening borders for migrants and establish the same serious problems for Europe.
Advertising the youngest doctors: calls to new collective protests
The representatives of the young doctors requested the profession to authorize new collective protesters in their discussion on the new working treaty.
The Committee of the British Medical Association (JDC) is intended to request its full advisory to support more collective protests since the beginning of September.
JDC said that the Ministers could not respond to the working treaty.
The young doctors and medical students in July voted for the cancellation of the working treaty agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58 per cent of its members who participated in the secret vote.
In a letter to the members published in Twitter on Friday, President JDC Ellen McKort said that the Government had continued to “beat” about the problems which, as she said, had led to the rejection of the working treaty.
She said: "Bearing in mind the situation, the leader of JDC proclaimed for rejecting the proposed new working treaty in full, and called for official negotiations on all your matters."
In response to the silence of the Government of JDC, he has requested a formal request to the BMA Council for an external meeting in order to adopt the unprecedented collective protest expansion programme, starting from September early.
The controversial fact that young doctors had participated in six income this year, including the first general exciting in the history of the State Health Service.
The leader of the young doctors of BMA, Dr. Joan Malavan, left after voted on the cancellation of the agreed working treaty, recommended by BMA.
He said to BMA members that the treatment was good that should be taken during the meetings in the prevention of the vote of 54.000 young doctors and medical students.
After the vote by the Minister of Health, Jeremy Hunt said that this working treaty would be used for medical workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: "Aliance wicked"?
It was a jacket that ended the crisis.
The Russian leaders and Turkey met on Tuesday to smile and announce the official end of the eighth-year-old war and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomed his Turkish colleague in the shipping hall of St. Petersburg, I had a sustainable impression that Ankara would like more reconciliation.
It was the leadership, yeah.
But Mr. Putin's smile looked smile, and he was so warmly removed even under his own detention standards.
Regime Tyip Erdogan, in contrast to this, has often spoken about his "good friend" five times, according to one report.
I lost my account.
He also promised that the relationship with Russia would return not only to their crew level, but even above.
On the next day, a newspaper described the acts of Mr. Erdogoan as if nothing wrong would ever happen.
I think his enthusiasm would be back.
But the swimming shock from Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader did not forget anything.
In fact, the first reason for the crisis was that he mentioned in the entry comments: Turkey had slaughtered the Russian destroyer on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction at this time was instinct.
Mr. Putin was disappointed by a angry tired by accusing Ankara to attack Moscow.
The tribulation was even more stronger than the predicted friend.
Resurrection of real trust will be difficult, probably not possible.
The Russian public view has also changed since November.
During the months, controlled media States have conducted an overwhelming, accurate invasion against Ankara.
It was immediately shown that the turk must be considered guilty in all.
The most serious accused of the representatives of the Supreme Leader was that the family of Mr. Ergotan had been engaged in the illegal trade of oil from the Syrian region, controlled by the Islamic State.
He denied this decisively.
But in San Petersburg, it was an official signal that was time to move forward.
At the end, this meeting was only because Mr. Putin received an apologize for President Argogan.
Russia could pretend the victory of its nature.
For Ankara, the declaration of transfusion is clear.
First, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get, after he was almost rejected from his post in the last month when he tried to turn.
The terror attacks against Turkey were clearly disappointed too.
There is also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions shocked strongly — especially the prohibition of shock fleet that usually brings a number of millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast annually.
The number was almost 90 per cent.
As regards Russia, Terrorists and Curter companies here, of course, feel comfortable when the flights are finally renewed.
They put the end of the season on the Mediterranean sea.
And even this week, the public television predicted more sweet fruit and fruit than the Turkish import of agricultural products would be allowed again.
"Turists there, fellow guests back here," stated in the Weddy Journal.
But the visit also had a further political value for Moscow.
Ankara's evil in the West because it is considered a weak response to the attempt to turn.
Add to this the long-term injury of Mr. Putin, which is trying to use the western and to gradually destroy Turkey's connection with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, wins bonus balls with Ankara for calling for support of the elected authorities after the trial of public movement.
You mean, this is the date for Moscow, who has its own deeply endured fear of the change of the regime.
So, the summit in this swimming park on the sea coast allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine that one analysis describes me as "the wicked": two countries who feel themselves rejected and degraded by the West united forces.
However, despite public reconciliation, these two remains significant.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently seen as a peace-maker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It may be said that after almost three hours of the initial negotiations, while two Presidents gave the press conference, they did not even touch this topic.
The President of Turkey was wisely avoided the answer to their differences, while Mr. Putin wished to focus on them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find the general language of Syria.
But after months of open enemy, and taking into account the full possibility of a disaster when the NATO member of Turkey has slaughtered the Russian reactor, it is clearly better that two leaders are at least talking again.
The Kingdom Bank of Skotland will disappear for customers outside the Skotlands
Brad RBS should be noted on the role of the bank office, according to the executive director of the bank.
The Kingdom Bank will disappear for customers outside the Skotlands.
Ross McEvan told BBC that the BBC Scotland was linked to global bank ammunitions.
Bank left them since he almost moved eight years ago and needed to save him.
In that period, the burden strategy used RBS to protect other consumer credit burdens.
He was supported by millions of funds of Pansor International Sport, from the Cub of six nations to the Champion of Wilblondo Andy Murrey.
But now it was decided that it would be appropriate to allow more national burdens to enter the first plan.
The Kingdom Bank will be used with the Skotlands clients, but it will not be started.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the main office and the funds, will be changed to NatWest.
Brand Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, more smaller burdens for private persons who have more influence — Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. MacEvan was interviewed during the tour of customers and staff in Invernessshire.
He said BBC Skotland: "Brand RBS will finally become our investment burden and our staff, because we are now more to be the bank of burden."
As the bank itself became a global burden, RBS became a global burden.
I now say that we don't have global efforts, we have local efforts.
Each of these burdens will represent something different in its population groups, and our staff will work with customers under these burdens.
RBS had already stated that it would not be to continue its remarkable support of the six nations ' s Cube, and that it would build a profile of different burdens in the sight of sport.
"This is a suitable time for us to move the burden bank, as (we asked us) as we focus on the improvement of the customer bank?" said the Executive Director.
It would be very cynical three years ago if we would say we're going to be a wonderful bank for customers and close all these burns.
But with the work we've done, focusing on the needs of customers, not on our own, I think you're seeing a lot of changes.
We can return these burns, so I think it's the right time.
Frankie Dectors reached to 3000 winners in New Market to Pristige
Doctors disrupted shampanics after the double in Newmarket brings it to 3000 wins
Joy Frankie Dectory has achieved his 3000-year British victory in Newmark in Friday.
He came to this extraordinary note using his second victor on his home road - to the Pristy, trained by John Gosdan.
The 45-year-old Italian is a six-year-old shock, which reached this extraordinary mark in shoes.
He should be following Sir Gordon Richards, Dougom Smith, Lester Piggot, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-class champion of the Doctor, who previously wins in Ghayyar, said, "It's something special."
I'm very excited because my family's here too.
I'm so glad that this happened in New York, so I've been here 30 years ago.
This isn't a great light event, not Royal Ascot, it's a normal evening of 20,000 people.
I'm free of business and very unconscious.
Doctors accept approximation when they bring the Proposal after the victory
Two shocks reached such a note in boxes with obstacles: the champion of Richard Johnson and the upper twenty-five champion of Sir Antony McKy, who had more than 4300 wins for the record carriage.
Lester Piggott, Nine Darby winner, 4493 winners in the carriage
Franky is one of the best jokes in modern times and is unexpectedly that he had reached the mark that so little had reached him.
He's a style and strong, but his tactical shock is different from others in the wedding room.
He was a magnificent representative for scatchs, his enthusiasm and carrism in this sport year.
I told Franky a few weeks ago to Eps, he would have brought 6000 winners if it wasn't just a shock of weekends and big shocks!
And if serious, Franky has brought winners in Britain a large part of 30 years, which is good to see.
He's a powerful person that's good for the British scacks, but moreover, he's an incredible shock.
Frankie Dectory replied this extraordinary note of the company's voluntary cousin with the horses
From the finishing finish to the striking shoes, Franky Dectory is a symbol of British shoes for two decades.
They were flews and falls.
Many winners of large scannings, including his famous " Great Seed" in Ascot in 1996, also survived aviation catastrophus and had been disabled because of the end.
Three years ago, he first faced difficulties when he returned after the six-month disclass, but showed the great will to leave skeptic calls and return to the form.
And maybe he wasn't done at any time - the doctors previously said that I would like to continue to participate in the relief at least until the age of 50.
Putin is a head of the Sergey Ivan
The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, unexpectedly authorized his head of the Sergey Ivana Administration.
Ivan was part of the confidence neighborhood of Putin for many years.
This 63-year-old was now appointed to the representative of the Environment and Transport matter.
The Declaration from Kremell claims that Putin " had decided to release Ivan from his duties of the head of the Russian president " but did not call the reason.
The Vice-President of Ivano, Anton Weino, since 2012.
Mr. Weino, 44, former diplomat.
He finished the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (IMO) in Estonia Talline in 1972 and served in the Tokio Embassy.
Afterwards he was the head of the President's protocol and Government instrument, reports on the Web site of Kremell (Russian).
When he was appointed, he said, "Thank you for your trust."
I think the most important task of the Administration is to support your activities as heads of States in order to develop legislation and control on how your instructions are implemented.
Putin reported a Russian TV canal on Friday that Ivan asked to release him from this post and recommend Vino to replace it.
Does the Sounds Remember?
That's the step that gave Moscow back.
Sergey Ivana was one of the closest partners of Wormira Putin and served as well as the Council Security Service, the CB.
He was one of the most powerful people in the country as head of the administration.
At the meeting with President Putinus, which was shown by the public television, both men said that the head of the Administration had gone to his own desire.
However, despite the smiling of the camera, there were little people who were convinced here — especially now, directly before the parliamentary elections.
So that's the unexpected consequences of any struggle for authority?
Not until anyone knows it.
However, the official statement is that a person who has ever acted as a potential President has immediately wanted to manage the Russian environmental policy, was met with a great skepticism.
In the comments of Pauline on the website of Kremell, Ivan said: "It is true, at the beginning of 2012, I requested you to trust me in this very complicated position, even for four years.
Well, I was the head of the President's 4 years and eight months.
Ivan has entered the post in December 2011.
Before he worked as Vice-Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and the former member of the State Security Service of the CBB, as well as Mr. Putin.
At the end of the 1990s, when Putin was the head of the Federal Security Service (FBI), who had arrived at the change of the CBB, Ivan was appointed by its Vice-Chairman.
When Putin arrived to the authority, he called Ivan, including five people whom he mostly trusted.
Sometimes Ivan was considered to be the President of Russia after the second deadline of Putin, as the third time for Putin would oppose the Constitution.
However, the task was taken by another close partner of Putin, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became the Prime Minister before returning to the presidency only three and half years later.
The star Search as a Criminal, Thomas Gibson is released after the dragon with the producer.
Gibson was a member of the show shoot in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce series, declared its release in a joint declaration.
Gibson, who played the Special Agent Aaron Hotchera, regrets to the Friday before he was declared that he was dismissed.
There was a creative difference in commodities and divorce in views.
I'm sorry that it happened," he said in his statement.
Detailed information about how Gibson's personal will be extracted from the show that is expected to follow the FBI agents' teams later, according to the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios statements.
The 54-year-old actor, who had played the main role in the Darma and Greece network, was in the show of the first season in 2005.
"I love "I send as a criminal" and I contributed to my heart and soul in him for the last twelve years," said Gibson in his statement published on Friday.
I hoped to be present before the end, but that's not possible now.
I would just like to thank the scenarios, producers, actors, our great team, and the most important, the best worshipers of whom the show could only dream.
It is noted that the show returns to its 12th session on 28 September.
Note: Fishes were landed in the Banfa garden
The man from Banfa was called for the recognition of the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bayn believes that 75 fish could be skins left by water mortality.
Bain, a 500 meters from the sea, put the shooting of this snake in Perskop in hope that someone could shut the light on the appearance of twenty-food fish.
Quinsferry Crossing: The Bridge is now connected to Fif
The project for 1,35 billion feet must now be closed to 2017
Engineers have connected the northern snake and the Winsferry Crossing Virade, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fif.
It's the first of the four mixtures between the pounds, which are now on the end of all three pillars of the bridge.
The Fif Bridge Section now is 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
There were 10,000 tons and 20,000 tonnes of beetons and 46 ten tens of the bridge.
The project for 1,35 billion feet must now be closed to 2017.
The Minister of Economy of China Brown has visited the area today and was including the first ones who walked from the ground to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of Quinsferry Crossing.
We've all witnessed in engineering art in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of beetons were used only to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the shift between the vial and the bridge, it is a virtual operation using extremely accurate permissions for collection.
A total complex of about 79 per cent of the whole bridge at the place now, for the last section, the beton shoes are reflected in Russia today, which means that it is totally ready to switch up on the shoot.
Michael Martin, director of the Forth Crossing Bridge Builders project, said, "It's always a significant season for each bridge project.
This exciting project represents the most modern building art.
After installing the last section of the road tower and connecting it with the extensive Northern Pilote, we remained closed to the northern, or treated to the beach.
This was made by the shift of the northern approach to 700 miles south.
It was wide, and at the same time a very excellent operation.
The largest, since the glass of 222 meters long, weights about 6000 tonnes and should be slowed up to a 3 per cent of the cycle.
It was spectacular because the permissions over which the team worked were small — just a few millimeters in every direction.
Happily, it's been very good.
Safety in Sale Molephre: Twelve men were willing to stay in the lives
Twelve men had 'good to stay alive' after they had gone from a fishing vessel in England.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station was at 13:20 on the British summer in Friday, after the team had seen an emergency in Salive Moelfra.
Three men from all forces tried to reach a safe place while their ship continued to walk.
"We saw their ships crossed close to them and predicted worse," said the rule of Moelfre Vince Jones' savings.
"Freely, when we went down to the water, the strong wind took him into the side of them," he added.
Two men were saved by a local fishing vessel, and the third man of 60 years of age was found unable and invaded in the bomb without a rescue.
All of them were taken up on the board of the beach rescue and put to the rescue station.
Johns said, "The three men elected in the water was glad that they lived and were completely harmful.
The ship engine had an accidental switch, but he was somewhat shocked from a man who managed the ship when it was shocked.
Somebody took care of these guys today.
Pokemon Go, a good pursuit for health and happiness
To see how the world changes.
The fact that adolescents and children do not go on the street to play, prefering their free time to look at the screen, was a complaint of many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go dismiss people from wonderfulness and engages in some physical activity.
The time at the screen was markedly limited by television, then video graphics and recently smartphones.
It is so glad to see that technologies and activities on the street are not inter-exceptive.
I, of course, mean the full involvement of Pokemon Go, an annexe based on the originally created video games in the 1990s (in the result of the generated series of multifilms, game maps and other responses).
As well as many other pop-cultural manifestations, all of this has been lost in a few years before the new game was available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
The start in other countries was then detained in connection with the mass reloading of the servers.
In the following days, Pokemon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In two words, Smartphone games are going to search for Pokemons that follow GPS and, being discovered, they may be "food" (focused on your phone) or "Poymans".
The generation played in the game, being younger, joined the full involvement, cutting out the looks for the search.
In the United States, the game has increased significantly the number of steps passed by a normal person daily.
Cardiogram, annex for Apple Watch, which follows 35,000 users, recently reported that in two days from the start of the game, the number of persons that were monitored every day from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company doesn't know who plays in Pokemon Go, it's just seeing the primary data of the level.
Many health-care campaigns that convinced people “in 30 minutes”, “shoot from wonder” and“speaking every day” have not found a call, because most health-care messages are disappointed and expressed to people who seem unfortunate.
Nevertheless, the importance of physical training could not be assessed.
Those who are regularly trained reduce the opportunities of development in cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps adjusting weight, high artificial pressure, diabetes and long list of advantages, too long to bring here.
But Pokemon Go's worthy is that she throws people on the street to do what they love.
Thus, there are three basiss for health: movement, swimming air, sunlight and joy.
Some people even bring new friends to their pursuit.
Of course, there are smells that are looking for what to be grateful.
Yeah, someone can shoot on the door.
Well, what?
There's been a break.
Despite the applications for smartphones, such as Fitbit could and before follow our physical activity, they didn't give us a career for employment as this game gives us.
The news will come, and the use will be decreased with time.
However, the success of Pokemon has become more games that will combine applications and virtual reality with physical activity in a real world by helping many people to be more active, well-being and healthy.

Simone Bailz wins the gold of absolute primary in the women ' s genius
Forget the pressure.
Forget the shoes.
Simone Bails is unlawful for all this.
Dynamic on the opposite shock.
It's a lie.
He's on the floor.
It's a great world.
And now, finally, the Olympic Champion.
The 19-year-old American giant has been shocked to the title of the Champion on the absolute primary date on Thursday, in order to pass between himself and the rest of the world to a convincing demonstration under the adjusted Olympic attention.
Her general bar 62.198 was sufficiently removed from the silver meal and friendship by the Final Petterk Team, Ali Raisman and the Russian Brons Brons Mealist Ali Mustafin.
Bylez from the United States speaks on a hymnistical blue during the finance of a women ' s absolute initiality for artistic genius in the 2016 Latvia Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Bylese became the fourth part of the American woman who wins the champion of absolute primary and the fifth, strengthening its reputation as the best of his generation and, perhaps, if any.
She was shocked when she showed her final ball and her long journey to that moment.
This achievement is the same as the only rare lighting boards, such as Michael Felps, who took their types of sports to new heights:
Bylese has been in the past three years, housed in his sport, wining 15 measles of the world champion, including 10 golden programs, with such an exciting work love and accuracy that Mary Lu Retton called her "the greatest genius that I ever saw".
One last test was expected in Brazil, not so much between the Bayles and the rest of the area, as much between it and the load of higher expectations.
Any less than returning to the house of your family in Spring, Texas, with the honour of gold meal, would be considered as an unjust expectation.
Simone Bailz from the United States, left and left, and Eli Raisman, after the winning of gold and silver, respectively in the end of the individual women ' s original genitality in the Late Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, August.
Bylese paid the first gold on Monday, which became a fine akcourde for the private celebration of the National Collection Coordinator of Marta Caroli.
While Birds insisted that she had never observed in the future during his long path to the top, it was not exactly true.
part of her voluntary program — including its company – was established to the Latin American music, which would be directed as a house on the street outside the Olympic Arren Rio.
It's not a match.
The girl, who was daughter of her grandmother and grandmother, starting to walk with a child and opening the mother of Amy Burman’s train during the visit to the hall where Burman was training, became forced.
It has not played any of the absolute initialisations since the summer 2013, the shipping pool, which should continue as far as the Bayles wants.
Despite the small advantages received by Mustafin by two tours, it was peace.
The giant and voluntary training, where Bailz protects the name of the Champion of the world, is located in the garden.
She returned from 15.433 to January and ended from 15.933 to field.
Raisman was very slightly shocked to her until they were waiting for a final account — a clean formality — and the lips appeared around a blue red and blue white and blue shoes for the Bayles, when the sight she had ever recorded in the album for extraction was carried out.
Raisman's statement was a small place for the four years ago when she shared the third place but lost the Mustafian burn on the Tay-Black.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, which the Americans called "Babbling" was a great advance.
She sent pools after its voluntary training, a return that sometimes seemed to be subject to the question.
With regard to the Bayles, the 19-year-old twin has now been completely new:
Police: 3 victims of serious murders were shot during the hearing of music in the car
Two women and the 12-year-old girl who died during the death attack in the first series of murderers of Phynicos in the last decade sit in the car, talked and listened to the music when they were shot, according to the police reports published on Friday.
Angela Roshel Layner, Stefani R. Elis and the daughter of Elise, Malia, were shooted on 12 June when their car was equipped on the past.
The crimer has made about eight shots from the gun, standing with the passenger car, after which the vehicle was locked on another vehicle, is reported in the report.
The police claims that the three murder is not the result of the rape, since the injury has not received $2,900 of an adult victim.
The representative of the police of Finicos, Sersan Jonathan Howard, said that the shooting was struck by investigators to check whether he had been linked to four previous attacks.
The total of seven people were killed and two other were assaulted by nine attacks in two most importantly Latin American regions within four months.
“ This happens in the living area before the house,” said Howard KPHO, the CBS branch, in the beginning of this month.
The suspected vehicles were used by a number of vehicles, including the short Nissan, black BMW at the end of the 1990s and white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The followers refused to reveal witnesses that the attacks were linked to the same murder.
Elise, 33, was hosted with wounds and later ended.
Layner, 31 years old, and her daughter, Elis, Malia, died in the place.
The Witnesses told the police that there was nothing innocent in their headquarters, listening to music.
The authorities also publish the police report on the shooting, which was intended to be empty for half an hour before the three murder, and which, as they believe, was the case of a serious murderer.
The followers found a shock and shooted a shooter from the seat and a shooting shooting.
Mother of a six-year-old child with microcephaly:
As most of the children of six years, Edmund Pixivat loves drinks, games, and of course her mother.
But notwithstanding the majority of his overseers, Edmud's microcephalia is the result of a genetic violation that his mother Elizabeth Pixvito had not known during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was: I couldn’t do that.
I can't do that.
I didn't sign it.
What isn't true, surely you're signing it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent said that Edmund may never know them and that he couldn't even survive.
Some doctors even invited him to place it in a specialized treatment institution.
“ My first answer was, “I didn’t think people do this yet”," explained Pixiveto.
Edmund's walking with the drivings.
Edmund wasn't sit and drunk until three was completed, and he's still not talking about it.
But he's slowly walking some stages.
He goes with multilateral help and shoots on the bicycle.
He also likes to play with his two brothers and sisters.
Elisabeth shows the jacket that Edmund's planned for "Good, get me.
"We're teaching him to the jesting language," said Pixivato CBS News.
But not just a common language of wheat — she says that Edmund has developed his own jars.
Microcephaly may result in a number of different circumstances: genetics, such as Edmud, infections during pregnancy of virus such as core and Zica.
Symptoms and prognosis may be significantly different.
It's too early to talk about how it will be said about those who are infiltrated by the Virus.
Pixally remembers emotional losses because of the undetermined future.
I've always said what's going on?
What's going on?
And she doesn't know yet.
I really didn't ask for prognosis all over my life, because I'm not waiting for someone really to tell me.
But Pixvito has a pleasant advice for the mother of children with born defects because of Zeca.
It's gonna be better.
You know that everything will be better for you.
You'll love your child, and your child will love you.

Mahage Brown, 6, "Received Boats" remains in the lives after the bomb in Filadelphia
The police reports that Philadelphia was shot at a six-year-old boy, registering the second shoot in the city on that week.
Grandma and her grandmother identified him for the CBS Philadelphia as Maggie Brown.
Her grandmother and her grandmother said that Brown received a number of firearms, including his legs, feet, hands and animals, but he was aware of him when they moved to the hospital.

Why we need Simon, Gabe and Larry?
That's what I call the woman's Olimpiade Collection for the Gymnastics of this year and for a number of reasons.
First, I was at each Latvia Olympice since 1984, and the United States never were so householding.
And second: There are three key roles in this collection: Simon Bails, Gaby Dukkoull and Larren Ernandes, who have already inspired so many white girls.
The collection of this collection, complemented by Ali Ryan, is a Jewish, and Madison Coshan, who is Catholic, makes all pride.
This collection seems finally like America.
This also strengthened the black and Latin American women’s presence on the top of this sport.
For the past four years, a woman's giant number one was an African.
In the past year, Simon and Gibby were No.1 and No.2.
That's powerful.
At the past, the Olympics Gabi Duclad was unexpected by the Olympic Champion, and the United States welcomed.
The world could now be an unbelievable witness of the three-craft Champion of the World Simone Bayles, Dwwight and Lori Ernandes, who are unexpected, but yet virtuous genital training.
Simon became the fourth American ship that wins gold in a woman’s absolute initiality.
And a colleague for the assembly, Eli Ryan, paid gold.
We become a Witness of this kind of sport, but it doesn't look like that in the hymnastic sections throughout the country.
Simone, Gabe and Laury have all chosen the same way as Eli and Madison to form the Olimpiade Collection.
They're the "final fifth" because the next Olimpiade Collection on Gymnastics will have only four gymnastics in the team, and that's the last year of Marta Caroli's training.
But indeed, the geninastic is a road sport, and the giants are trained first in private gymnastic clubs supporting parents who pay the value of education, awareness, traveling, forms, contributions to the rebuilding, guest payment (for trainers and their families) and the list continues.
Most of these gymnastic clubs are located in rich reward areas which can support this business.
These clubs are where the jinnators receive everything from their training, and this is a precious and long-term responsibility for the giants family.
Aimee Burman, trainer Simone Bails, and Maggie Hanni, trainer Lory Ernandes, trained both their sports channels since they accepted the hymnastics.
We need to create more acceptable and available training to the communities of the unexpected number of young girls inspired by Simon, Gabe and Lori.
I found my gymnastic fund 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already offered free and disappointment of hymnastic employment in Harlem for more than 150,000 city youths (in the main, black and Latin Americans) and have established national and international champions.
In September, we will extend to Detroit (my family city) to provide a high quality genius of young people who will be able to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
The geniusism develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as sustainability to enduring work, disciplinary and sustainability for mind.
This is a positive impact on good health, success in school and work throughout the life.
That is the inspiration of this collection to send thousands of girls to be hymnastic, and that's beautiful.
Sporting is so important, especially for girls.
That's a great time now.
Thank you, Simon, Ellie, Larry, Gaby and Madison for this serious demonstration of the Genetic Force in the winning of the command of the Olimpiade gold and for the motivation of so many different girls to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
The young doctors received a declaration of further appreciation after the rejection of the proposal of Jeremy Hunt
The Ministers hoped to conclude the changes agreed to a changed treaty with the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 young doctors who had participated in vote were rejected.
In July, Hunt generalized plans to introduce the treaty, said that NHS was a "near land" and that any delay of the delay would damage staff and patients.
The first young doctors have been transferred to a new treaty, which includes changes in work at night and weekends to improve service at an emergency time.
Dr. Elen McCott, Chairman of the Committee of Youth Drugs, said last night in the statement: "The young doctors still have severe concerns on the proposed treaty, in particular that he asks for the crisis of workforce and that it cannot apply to all doctors fairly."
Only eight weeks before the first physician group was transferred to the new contract, the progress needed and the time.
The attempt to authorize the negotiations has been gathered, and sometimes the Government has been fully calm.
This is despite the promise of Jeremy Hunt in the last month that his door is always open.
" The Jords of Hunt must act now, encouraging the introduction and react to the threats of the young doctors.
If he doesn't do this, the young doctors are inevitable that they are ready to organize the afterwards.
The last article at the end of April led to a delay of about 13,000 planned operations and 100,000 nurses receiving, while nurses and advisers were subjected to the replacement of doctors in the pickage line.
The Ministers hoped to conclude the changes, agreed with the changed treaty with the leaders of the British Medical Association.
WMA wants to pay better for 54,000 young doctors who are under the treaty.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General NHS Employers, called the youngest doctors not to continue to be skilled.
Mortimer said: "Ambassadors have not reached little or nothing, but are pressured to work at the front of the teams and services, and cause concerns, physical pain and disorders to patients, seeds and their families."
Over the past two months, we talked to the Committee of Teenagers, together with the Department of Health and others, positively responded to their fears relating to the role of hospitals and corporate information policy.
The workers hoped that the continuing support for other important topics, such as staff distribution, flexibility, additional education for those returning to the carriage, the value of training, mutual recognition of the training plan, academic departure and gender differences in medical payment, had been aware of how serious workers, the Health of England and the Department of Health were to comply with the conditions achieved by the WMA in November, February and May.
Preparation for 2 pounds per day may reduce the threat of heart attack
Thousands of patients with heart attack will be used by 2 pounds per day after the authorities recommended to give it more and more than a long time.
The anti-protectional ticgrelor precaution reduces the risk of repeated attacks for persons with heart diseases.
The preparatory has already been designated for 12 months after a heart attack, a lower risk of insult or a new attack.
The NICE National Health Service recommended that people give it for four years to continue to eliminate the risk of heart-respective problems.
However, now the NEC National Health Service recommended that people give it for four years to continue to eliminate the risk of heart-conciliating problems.
The heart attack occurs with about 140.000 people in England annually, and four of them have another attack or insult.
The heart attacks and insults have resulted in the recovery of grain materials in the shoes of art and the preparation of the shoes.
If the skin is cut into part, it may be a cause of the transfusion that blocks the access to the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the thromboe moves, he can move through the blood flow and lock blood to the brain, calling insults.
People who have already come to one attack are more risked to get another.
Chicagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold by Brilica, reduces the risk by making the transit less credible.
The NICE instruction project, published today, recommends that people give 90 mg of ticgrer for 12 months, then 60 mg with aspirin two times a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, the director of the Nice Medical Technology Assessment Center, said: “Over the existence of effective methods of second-proliferation at about four people that have already been a heart attack, there is another heart attack or insult, often with destructive consequences.”
Repeat fears may have a significant negative impact on the quality of human life.
There is evidence that a ticgrer in combination with the effective aspirin is under the risk of following heart attacks and insults to people who have already brought a heart attack.
We are pleased to have the opportunity to increase the treatment options available to many thousands of people who are ready to use it.
As information on the efficiency and safety of ticgrellar — especially the risk of blood — has been limited for three years, the instruction project does not recommend treatment over that period.
The CCC ownership culture allows to promote the flexibility of the vote accounts in the Islamic regions
Mrs. Taher-Hamelets Lutfuur Rahman was discarded from posts in the past year because of corruption, with a full account of the Government
Political adjustment culture has been closed to the eye that the total flexibility of the votes in the mulman communities had been covered on information about the destructive report of the Government, which has been published today.
The former member of the Office of Ministers, Sir Eric Piklas, is inflicted with the criticism of the police, the election observers and the administration of the cities for ignoring the evidence of violations of the elections because of "extreme feeling about racial and religion " .
The former secretariat of local communities, now the anti-corruptive king, reported that the fear of electors to religious snake was so strong that the police had to be allowed to put borders beyond the borders of the election places to protect the feared electioners.
He proposes that the electioners take the personality's approval to prove who they are when they vote.
At this time, the electors should only specify their name and address.
The report is even proposed to put the smells on the fingers of people when they set up their offices in order to eliminate a person to vote two times.
The best protection should be provided to the observers, said Sir Eric.
It calls for a major access to documents of the local council and decisions adopted by informal committees or working groups.
“It is not only to protect the electoral fair, but also to protect the local government from the more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes with her,” he said.
The report was ordered to Dunning Strategy with a vote in Tauer Hamlets in East London.
In the past year, a special court on election issues decided that Mr. Luftur Rahman had to be dismissed from posts on the long list of corruption and illicit activities.
The Court found that Rahman had “ciniciously expressed” the religious feelings of his Islamic community and urged them to silence their critics, accusing them of racism and Islamicity.
Rahman, as he said, "he said his campaign, based on the responsibility of the Muslim believers to vote for him."
To 300 votes were questioned or resulted in a person's vote, representing someone else.
Sir Eric said that there were witnesses of torment throughout the country.
He expressed special concerns regarding mourning with the e-mail vote, in which senior members of the Muslim community, as they reported, pressures on people to vote for their elected candidate.
Mr. Eric, on the photo, made several recommendations on the cleaning of the vote system, including the requirement to make personality certification to prove who you are.
The report states: " There are evidence of the pressure provided to vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, in particular women and youth, to vote on the will of older people, especially in the communities of Pakistan and Bangladesh.
"The fear that... public institutions have closed their eyes to such a behavior because of the excessive sensibility of the political adjustment on ethnical property and religion."
Sir Eric gave 50 recommendations on the cleaning of the system, including the elimination of political activists from the work of post officers to vote in order to stop the “collection of votes”.
The report also calls on the post-registered checks at the registration to prevent the use of the election list for immigration and privileges.
The option is considered to require the voters to proclaim a personality certificate before the vote.
Use deceased smells on the fingers of people only when they leave their burns to prevent someone to vote two times.
Systemic checks of nationality to ensure that they have the right to vote.
Introduction of a three-year-old vote on applications.
Delete political participants and activists from work with full votes and convergences with e-mail votes.
To give the police authority to establish borders around the election places.
Amend the Law to facilitate the proclamation of the accused persons in fear in accordance with the Act of 1983.
Delete an illicit photograph on the elections.
Exemption for English only to be used in elections (excluding Wells).
Enhance education to ensure that the staff makes voters go to the building each other.
Sir Eric is illly attacked by the city police, claiming that it was "repectually" that no criminal accused has been sentenced after the case of Taher Hamlets.
"The Sudow that considers the elections has dismissed Luthfur Rahman and his agent for a long list of corruptions and illicit action," he reported.
He was acknowledged in the absence of a reasonable suspicion, a criminal standard of evidence, on a number of basis.
He also criticizes the unreasonable " verifications for the chambers " offices of the Cities Administrations Registration.
Sir Eric stated: "The last sentence of the court in Tauer-Hamelets was a sign of trial.
Our nation has the honourable inheritance as the mother of the parliamentary elections, and however, the proliferation of electoral fraud and the decline of certain bodies threatening this good reputation.
Cate and other two of the Olympics of Olimpiade in Rio
The Olympics of 2016 in Rio were in the Rio this week with the smell of the French bicycle Paullin France-Prevo, which, as it occurred, seemed to be an impressed herogy of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic Games is not the only sporting channel that struggle for gold this summer, which can be honored by their own famous double, at least, according to the social communications.
So, in the honour of J.G. Rio and all the famous people at our screens, FEMAIL had a list of olimpiers with more than the surface of the Hollywood stars.
Challenge and ship: Member of the United States Training Team Brady Allison, the left, compared to Leonardo DiCaporo since he was a child
In addition to the bicycle of Kate, many online people were able to indicate how a certain trail could be the closest of Leonardo DiCaporo's superstar.
The member of the U.S. M. Brady Ellison was the cause of a uragan in Twitter, after his images appeared to be a scared look like the Wall Street star from Wall Street.
And in fact, the channel learned about the suicide of the family and admitted that he heard that he was like Leo since he was a child.
"I'm not personally seeing a large part, maybe except the growing nature on the face," said Brady Huffington Post.
"He's an appreciative guy, so I think it's a compromise."
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 will, uncertainly, be further indicated in this year: the remarkable comparison between the British Greek Deserford and the popular Nila Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnastic Alia Mustafin, with its great expressive eyes, is the exact copy of the Cuban and American Pearl Gloria Estefan.
And in the South African Cameron Van der Burga’s basin, Horo Matt Morrison was compared to the star for many years.
Passing to an unexpected one: this user believes Nathan is a "sporting version" of the "Nachala" actor.
Another long-term comparison was between the tennisist Rafaelum Nadar and the actor Josh Harnett, who could be able to swear like a heavy brown and smells.
The silver melanist from Russia, Eury Ethimous, can not only be shocked with sweet hair and light hair as the actor Annalin McCord, as Nathan Adrian from the United States team, like a sporting version of Joseph Gorgon Lewit.
Dark Women: The star of Hoop Solo, the left, and the actor Jennifer Carpenter from Deckster, right, have the same forms of face and eye
Not only: one of the Twitter users was very pleased that others also had seen the path
Created theory: According to this user, there may be a reason to be seen on the basis of the externality of the couple
One Twitter user recently returned to a website to generate his reward that "the island of Internet thinks that Hoopo Solo and Jennifer Carter are actually identical".
In fact, the star of the U.S. football and the actors of Dexter have incredibly similar forms of face and eye.
Other popular comparisons included Carry Walsh Jennings and her smile, close to the identical smile of Lora Liny, and the winned gold meal of Gabe Duglaw, which can be able to swear a beautiful wide smell that looks like a smile of the "Bell Success" star Gabriel Yunion.
The commenter of the CBC Olympice's comment was sorry for the Chinese pool "death as a pornographic."
Analysis of Bayron McDonald's fourth place at the end of 14-year-old Ay Yanhhan, on the women ' s free style 4h200m in the medium of the CBC to the direct transmission of the Olimpía
The Canadian public company of CBC was accused to apologize after one of its comments said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimming powder was slaughtered as a sweet.
The commenter Bairon McDonald thought that his microphone was disabled when he began to express his own view at the end of the final woman's final stage of 4 to 200 meters of free style.
It could be heard as McDonald, who joined the CBC's comments to "delete her color," said, "The 14-year-old Chinese kid has cut meat, baby."
It was too shocked, old as a shock, died as a sweet.
Thank you for it.
The Chinese powder, Ay Yanhan, who was 14 years old, slowed the second stage of this stage at 1:57.79 to 1.61 seconds lower than the Canadian Taylor Rack, allowed Canadians to remove the displacement from China.
The Canadian authors quickly reacted to the network after the tone and the use of expressions
Emmitt McFarleyn tweeted: "As the CBC Dictator just said that the 14-year-old kidnapper of China was dead as a sweet?"
This idiot didn't understand that they were still in the eternal."
About Ai Younghan from China in the finish of a woman's stage of 4h 200 m, he said, "There is a small 14-year-old Chinese kid."
The criticism of Twitter was immediately violated by Bayron McDonald, and many were called to let it.
Twitter users did not stop when they heard how uncomfortable Bairon McDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradise wrote: #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us like a racist kit. #disgusted.
Shortly after that, Scott Russell, who gave the CBC transfer, declared directly for the comments of McDonald, said: "We should forgive us that the comments on the swimming explanation were in the eterne."
It was an unexpected word. We're sorry that it happened.
The UNHCR concluded that more than 90 people were excused in response to this statement
The commenter Scott Russell had to apologize for the face of McDonald
CBC then copied and sent them for excuses to more than 90 other Twitter users who wanted to comment on McDonald
The televisory was also urged to apologize and publish the statement.
We are sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to leave the eterne.
Last night, we were operating to apologize for our slaughterers in a direct ether and our signators in the sociétés.
By clarity, the comments of Bayron refered to the explanation of powders, not to her personality.
And yet it was an inadequate and unexpected choice of words, and Bairon very regrets what he said.
On Thursday, McDonald declared directly and tried to clarify his comments, saying that he did not think that his words were terroristized as an attack on personality.
"I would like to use a moment to apologize for the comments I made last night after a woman's stage," he said at the translation of the Olimpía Games on CBC.
'I've spoken about the shelter, not on her personal.'
"We know that there was no respect for us, and I'm very sorry."
The purchaser of Primark was depressed by a woman who had uncertainly illustrated the low whites through the shop
The buyer didn't know where to take care of some woman to illustrate the tragic steps through Primark's shopping.
Whatever worse, she illustrated how she looked at them, put them up and put it back to the field.
She continued to search and finally died four couples of lower whites in the Bowerie Place Trade Center in Fallston.
The Primark Trade Center of Boubery Place in Falkstone, where women had a tricotative trace before they returned to the field
The mother of the two children, Jennie Davidson, who was at the time in the shop, said that after the example of the underlying white, the woman "covered and left out of the shop and didn't buy anything."
She said, "They couldn't believe in what they saw."
She took a pair of strikes with the shoes, removed their own shoes and shoes and snakes.
"It wasn't trying to find some hot place to do that -- she was just standing there, unfortunately."
"It's all up when she took the strike again, and they seemed to haven't liked her because she put them back to the field."
She did the same with three other couples before finally decided that there was nothing that she liked, again and out.
"It doesn't seem to be careful who looked for her, or that she thought about a man who would finally buy these bodies she illustrated."
The 33-year-old Jenny Davidson said, "It's the opposite to think that someone's going to take home a body that somebody else has already shooted, and they weren't seen."
The event occurred on Thursday.
Davidson adds: "I'm going to conclude that the staff, in all the visibility, tried to remove these objects from the sale, after she went out, and so better."
"I wouldn't want to come home with a new couple of women's bodys and find out that another woman's jobs and cut them out, and they were not buried."
The representative Primar reported: "Primark knows what happened in our shop in Falloston on Tuesday 9 August."
All items on which it is said were extracted from the sales.
How to protect yourself from a gun by using a magic claw
The surrounding world is dangerous, but it's a video from Dailymail.com, perhaps helping it make a little more safe for you.
We talked to Ron Mizrachi, a master of the Crue Magic Federation in New York, to find out how to do with armed players in close distance.
If you're in front or behind you, this video will show you how to shoot his weapons.
If you go back, according to the Mizrachi, the first thing you need to do is turn back so that you have seen the attacker and "free the fire line".
Then you will smell a weapon between your throat and your shoe, before you shoot them into the face of a free lok.
Then it should be rolled into the pocket, and until the assaulter dies from the pain, you cut the gun out of his hand, shoot it into the face of the skin and go back, keep the weapon put on it.
For the army that is right before, the way to do that is like it - take your body from the fire line, quickly take the gun and cut it out so that the wicked cannot shoot.
At the same time, move the weight to the gun and shoot the shooter in the shooting, then turn out the gun out of his cup, before you get back and shoot it.
Do you think it's complicated?
Look at the video to see what the Mizrachi does.
But remember that the safeest way out of any shipment -- if you're not a magic-magy -- is to give your own.
For a traveller, Jan Riet is on the most delicate part of Europe
The British traveller took its immune system and a root reflex of serious testing, cutting some of the most sweet and refreshing places in Europe.
The reliable and author of the Yan Riet travel book, 51 of Saphholk, conducted a euro banknote language, the Chirca Piccadili, the button of the university on the train and the Russian public phone to demonstrate its immune system.
Before we covered each object, he used ulminometers to show us and what he uses.
However, the experiment, which should be a film called "The Training of the Lisbourg of the Internal Shield", gave some wonderful results.
The mouse is to remove the swimming button in the train that uses thousands of others may be extremely angry, but indeed there are more bacteria in the kitchen cancer.
During the whole journey in Europe, Ryan spoke to the doctors and doctors about increased bacteria and his own health.
Happily, nothing of the sweet has brought him more than a bad shooting.
Reit was known by the tests for the slightness of his kitchen, traveling to peace and eating strange and surprising things.
From the public wings to the kitchen button, this task was uncertainly tested by its immune system.
In the movie he cut, he said, "I was perfectly uncertain about my health, and I was swearing a lot of different things in the mouth of the earth, eating dark and clean water."
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only one to which he refused is a russian public toilet.
His test mask showed the significance of the luminometer exceeding 4.000 units.
For comparison, only the measuring hands must be within 60.
But there was a Russian public toilet that he refused to smell, after his munômeter's significance was more than 4.000 units, while the extinction of hands showed less than 60.
The Valio and the Finnish Manufacturer of Milk Products have deleted a film on a travel named " League Road of Lizine Internal Shile " which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the toilet
In the film, he said, "It's close to one of the worst things I've kicked in the toilet."
There's nothing more damn than that!
I'm not going to smell anything, because it's awesome.
The "Reproduction of Lizine Internal Shile" was cut together with the Finnish Milk Manufacturer Valio.
The company provided Rait Valio Gefilus, which contains oxygen bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, in order to facilitate the growth of human bacteria and develop immune systems.
The Old Vice-President Valio on Buy, Sounds and New Categories said, " We really wanted to propose a new consumer.
What would be interesting to see, and at the same time it could explain the benefit of the biobiotics.
We had a brain shop that finished the idea "I'm calling Yanna."
They claim that the interests of the kitchen's health are a global manifestation
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to place them in large context: good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of the pocket health and how it related to the immune system.
The increased interest in the health of the kitchen is a global revelation, and through this documental film, we have been able to provide consumers more information about this in an interesting form.
I also think that the film shows that we have a good feeling of humor!
Tom Hakal, who was a film register, added: "I would say that I would have lost respect for Yan, if he would have covered some things I requested, for example, a Russian smooth towel that is shown in the film."
Of course, some things were easier and some were quite cruel.
I'm glad some of these pieces have been able to sleep on the floor.
During the 2015 survey of Valio, 84 per cent of the respondents had linked oxygen bacteria exclusively with the good condition of oxygen and skin, and 58 per cent said they used at least sometimes, products containing oxygen bacteria.
The family of the Huligans destroyed Saltash, a municipal house of Cornool, which was discovered by the exile
The vulcanian family left their municipal house with a loss of $50,000, after they were displaced for the fear of their neighbors.
Tana Skelldon and her partner, Shana Trebilkok, have dismissed from their object of unmovableness in Saltash, Cornusol, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forced to be displaced from an unmovable object, shocked housing and construction cooperation officials have found this object of inmobility in the condition required to repair.
The walls were left with smiling drums, the seeds were hidden, the floor was shocked on the floor and the walls were spaned.
The family is now overlooked and, likely, lives in a private apartment
Donna McEva, a population in Cornwall Housing, said she's afraid not to save him.
She said, 'It was a absolute cosmetic for people here, and I don't think people should live like that.
There are many things that must be found, because this object of immobility may probably be known as a very good aspect of Cornell.
The family benefits from a stupid glory, and their name is used by a stupid glory.
A couple of three sons who lived in an unmovable object from time, and the police reports that the rule of the family has included dragons in the street with bathsbol baths, the pollution of neighbouring areas, the use of drugs, the trafficking of drugs, the excessive crys, the conflict and the rule.
Sceldon, 47, whose name was on the aircraft treaty, received order for the anti-social behavior in June.
In several house rooms, which could be covered, there was an old shooting
Until the case in the house in which drugs were sold in the past,
Neighbors say they saw a dragon on the street and called the police regularly.
Cornwall Housing was deeply displaced from her home and her partner on that week, after they had been granted a period of 11 weeks for voluntary departure.
The expulsion was welcomed by the neighbors who said their lives were transformed into the universe.
One said, "He didn't worry anyone."
We lived next to them 20 years, and that was always bad.
Number of times when we saw the police here, it's incredible.
"Thet morning we couldn't sleep."
We wake up because we were so calm here - we didn't be able to do this!
Now when they're finally gone, it's gonna be beautiful.
Adam Fitzpatrik, Head of the Cornwall Housing Neighbouring Group, said that the family had not been able to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house of 20 years, with the police, and regularly called the police
Musor and old games were displaced below the growing part of the municipal house
He added: ' This is a shock that the arbitrator could not take any responsibility for her and her family, since the expulsion is always the last method of action that Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very complicated case, since the behavior was limited, and their actions should be terrible for her observing neighbors.
I appreciate all my team, police and members of the community of Devona and Cornusola, who have made a crowd to give us information.
I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbors and send a signal that the associational behavior will not be allowed.
Physpatrick reported that all three sons lived in the house for a different time, but he said that all of them were a little more than 20.
Small matrix remained on the floor in one of the houses after the exile
Divorce workers will now be cut off the shoes of the house.
In 2014, police searched in the house and found more than 70 g of the convol, as well as the pertinent weight and $1700.
Sceldon was disappointed after he was condemned to be responsible for the ownership of the class B for delivery.
She declared that the money passed for her son, Le Sceldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After their homelessness, there are evidence that Tanya and her partner are now living in Plymouth.
The walls of many home rooms were spaned over the entire surface.
The police says they will try to spend an ardenators that are not subject to the location rules
Angela Crow, from the police of Devona and Cornell, stated that the exit had sent clear warning to other ardenators that continue to violate the rules.
'This is a message for those who feel that they may be able to carry themselves without a accused accused, and for those who do so,' she said.
Crime and anti-social behavior will never permit the police of Devon and Cornell, which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal came to fear when a low-level military aircraft was not cut off the beach
In the city of Aveira, Portugal, the tourists who loved to smile on the sun, feared their lives
Aircraft C-3C Orion Aeroports Portugal was incredibly low
Military aircraft reported that he had performed a train flight but stressed the absence of the security risk
This is the moment when the fearful tourists start to be packed, while the low slow shocked over the swimming beach.
There is a military aircraft on the dramatic cars, which is not at the distance of swimming pools from the beach in Avoro, northern Portugal.
The relaxing shocked on the feet when they were understood by the reasons that the aircraft sound was worried, but it was not possible to see what moves to their side through the board.
The Inspector occurred last night near the city of Abigail in Costa New.
Daniel Fernandsh, one of the restrainers who published a video of shocking flow in social networks, said, "He passed lowly twice, and it was a moment when he showed that he was shocking."
Noah Arroja added, "I've been working with a serphant and swear, it was a feeling that the flight was going to fall on me."
Tourists on the Awake beach were terriblely scared when the aircraft was shown from the tsunami and flyed at an emergency low height
Portugal's military and aircraft today stated that the pilot of P-3C Orion had performed a train flight to discover fishing courts in the beach and was required to be low because it was the only way to check them.
Pilot said that the aircraft was a little lower than normally in the sense of the inadequate visibility raised by fire from the nearby horrible forests, but the military aircraft insisted that no one was undermined to be dangerous.
In those years, forest fires damaged the material part of Portugal, and lived four people on the Madeira Island.
Portugal's military-aviation forces today made a statement that the pilot had to fly so low in the circumstances — a heavy thumb and a help from forest fires that have deteriorated the visibility of the planet.
A train flight was carried out and the pilot was forced to find fish ships within the task
The Hassp system has been required for a more years, but most of the coffees and restaurants of Petersburg have not yet been entered.
The tests are increasingly active and the business threatens to 1 million rubbers.
The Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP, Russian HASP option) system has been more than a year - risk analysis and critical control points - are binding to the use of food manufacturers and transporters, as well as social companies in Russia as a member of the Taliban Union (TFP).
In February 2015, the Russian Budget Surveillance Checks began in Petersburg.
But until the responsibilities are sent down the trap only for individual violations of the regulation (see " Documents Preferences " ...).
The incompletion of the regulations is generally in the company of 600 thousand rules for the first violation and 1 million rules for the second.
ASSP was considered in the 1960s to the United States as a system that takes into account the risks in working with food products and preventing them.
Then it's the shock of food security for astronomies.
Now the system is used for all food companies, not only in the United States but also in Canada and Europe.
Since February 2015, HASP operates on the Territories of TS.
4 years of development and integration of the business system (HASP's income was reported in 2011).
However, both entrepreneurs and employees recognize that most companies have not even heard of this standard.
We, unfortunately, had long been sure that the standards relate only to food production, not to reformers, have explained the chapter of the Elena Ceretarian Joint Council.
Now they're all trying to get up.
The expected deadline of the renewing of the carters in Turkey, the end of August, starting September.
But they will not be called for a smooth question, as their targetaudit - the family with children - is already ready to school, notes experts.
The Alliance of the Tourist Agency last night sent a letter to the Government, with the request to authorize cards.
" For many Russian tourists, the collection of quality and access to marine distance is unreasonable, since the Crowndar region and the Greatest Republic of Location objects have already been covered to the end of September," notes the authors that the opening of carter transport in August is not significantly affected by Russian marine products.
As noted in the Northwest Regional Office of the Russian Tourism Union (RST) in the case of the Russian and Turkey aircraft, the renewing of cards in Turkey may be expected for a month.
Some understanding when the cards are renewed until no, this depends mainly on the aircraft authorities.
Technically, aircrafts can fly in September, even in August, if tourists operate with the aircraft competing on the necessary routes,” said Paul Romanians, Vice-President of Communications and international projects of the North-West Regional Office.
In his words, the possible renewment of the carders is a good news, but is not too affected by the market force because the main purchasers of the card towers - the family with children - have already returned from a distance and are ready to go to school or to leave in other countries.
In the bark season, travellers and pairs have mainly been purchased.
Charter programs can take account of those who have the opportunity to relax", says Paul the Romans.
"Turkey has the opportunity to join many tourists, if it now gives very budgetary proposals - 50 to 60 000, because there are people who are targeted to wait for very low tours," says Valeria Central, Director-General of the Optio-Travel.
In other cases, it is not precisely planned to calculate on the heating; the main mass of travels is already planned.
Paul also believes that, since the regular driving in Turkey is demanding, the carders will also be displaced, but the glass is not expected.
"To Turkey the launch of cards now is the replication of the next season," said Paul the Romanians.
"Clarifying cards in Turkey is a positive news for the next season", according to Valeria Ruby.

The Moscow Gasstroybank has remained without the CB's license.
On Thursday, 12 August 2016, the Russian Central Bank resigned the licence for banking operations in the organisation of the International Community Bank, registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, the ACB HASSTREBANK has conducted a high-level credit policy related to the allocation of money in low-quality assets.
Adequate evaluation of the risks taken by the supervisory body and the proper reflection of the value of the bank assets has resulted in the credit organization to implement banking prevention measures.

According to the reports, the AAC's larger assets for 1 August 2016 had been 335 places in the banking system of RF.
A London school, joined to IGIL, died in Syria
Cadiza Sultan, one of the three British schools who left London last year to join the IGI, as reported, died in Syria.
The lawyer Tasnim Acunday said that her family had learned about her death in Rack, Syria, just a few weeks ago.
It was proposed that she died from a Russian aircraft in Rakqa, a grouping in the country, as reported by ITV News on Friday.
Sudan was 17 years old, and, according to her family, she died as a time when he planned to leave a divorced country of war and return to England.
"It may only be hoped that the only advantage of this is to be the overwhelming and advertising of others, that is the risks of traveling to the military zone of action to kill people ever the same choice," said Acundi.
In February 2015, Sultan and two other school schools from East London were a village in Turkey and then to the Syrian border.
The family of Surtan said that she married the IHL fighter in Syria and became a widow for a few months.
Rid claims that Clinton remains loyal to Harland as a candidate to the Supreme Court in the case of election
The leader of the Democratics in Senate Harry Rid says he is convinced that the democratic candidate to President Hillary Clinton will be appointed to judge Mercy Harland in the Supreme Court if he is elected as President.
The Senate Republicns blocked the approval of Harland, and as President Barrak Obama appointed it in March.
The Director of the Group of the majority in Senate Mitch McConnel states that the next President will choose the person who can replace the last judge of the Supreme Court of Antonio Skyle.
Rid declared at the meeting on Thursday that he predicted that Clinton would choose Harland with a certain basis of confidence.
The representative Rid later said he didn't speak to Clinton directly about whether she would move Harry, and just built proposals.
He praised Harland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to "have a ship" with a new choice.
Harland is the principal court of the Appeal Court of the United States on the district of Colombia.
Rid stated that the Republicans, who blocked the name of Harland, were "fellowships" and "personnels" of the Republic of the Republic of Donald Trump.
He said that Tramp wasn't coming to the office.
Treats states that the erotic calendar for women as well as for men
The Journal of Treats cooperates with the photo of David Balmer to issue in the calendar for 2017, inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
However, instead of the remarkable representations, they are intended to find the next generation of fuel models for their calendar for 2017 with the museums.
The President of Treats Steve Shaw told us this year that his magazine with a large number of skilled models is different from the old playboy, because "Playboy is for men".
I'm doing it for women.
Obviously, he thinks that the calendar is also.
"We need to return to the demonstration of an eternal and classical sculpted figure where women, as well as men, feel comfortably and inspired by these images of the woman's body," said Shaw in the press-relicense announced on the calendar.
Women want to be part of the project because it is a beautiful art.
Models can provide online photos or personally on open casts in Los Angeles and New York.
Moscows will spend the memory of the unexpected internet magics.
In Moscow, there is a remembrance that tells us how to be a victim of the Internet magic.
This was reported in the Russian supervision, writes M24.
It is reported that state specialists have a memory that helps citizens to select the Internet magic properly and to recognise possible fraudulent schemes.

The memory is done at the present moment.
It will then be placed on the Moscow Rosk Surveillance website, and it is also planned to issue a print version and to divide the mocks.

The Federal Antimonopolitical Service of Russia (FAS) has appointed a administrative trace for Google Corporation in the size of 438 million rubbers, reported on the state website.
The Google Company Race for antimonopol legislation was 438 million rubbers.

The New Book's Network was shocked for the sale of the book "50 days before my self-smoking."
The New Book Book's Network is extracted for the sale of Stace Cramer's book 50 days before my self-defence, reports the Moscow News Agency.
As reported in the Russian Summit, unspecific of the amount of trap, the book may be considered as "producing or motivating children and adolescents towards the socidian behavior".

In Moscow, there will be a memory for Ernsta's unknown sculptor, reports TASS.
The activities will be held in the Central Literature House on August 15.
Unfortunately, everyone will not be able to communicate with the unknown in the United States.

It was previously reported that Ernsta's unknown family plans to sculpture panicians in New York, preferably until 14 August.
The final consumer was guilty: Who actually purchases the plasts?
The only men in the middle of the mid-year love guilty.
And until you disappeared the section of comments by cruel distortions under the Middle Eastern Mediterranean, this approval comes out of the actual data.
According to YouGov, so much discussed rebuilding of plastics is not a bleeding among the generation of twenty-year-olds who want to come into a new material object, but notes for medium-year-old years.
Those who have recently purchased a large amount of wine albums are likely in age of 45 to 54, according to the data.
Moreover, those belonging to the age group of 18-24 are less perceived.
This is also not just an act of collection of favorites - it has an emotive importance: more purchasers have condemned a number of more likelys to keep their feelings (56 per cent against 53 per cent) and enjoy the unity (69 per cent against 66 per cent).
But is the results of youGov faithful?
If this blog was a television newspaper, the camera would follow me until I was going to the center of the living street of Soho, in a modest heart of cosm and a bunchling before the stop, composing the hands, and say something angry, "Yes, let's see."
Yeah, let's see.
While the heart of Soko slowly lacks its ears and smells — hotels, coffee, paperchase shops have now been designed to build buildings when independent salers — a number of musical shops with fantastical specialists have remained.
I would like to ask the camera to stop the next scene, in which I find close to different people in some of these shops and try to evaluate their age and emotional attitudes by monitoring.
Grazgo Stuart, 55 years old for I went from Sister Ray, two young women, three men in the mid-year-old years, to Reckless Records (data accounts: eight mid-year-old men, one woman probably a 20-year-old woman) in London to take a meeting, and walking on shops to take a few hours.
He's a collectioner, can I ask?
"I think so," he said.
I have about 3000 or 4000 plates.
These plates that were pictured above (he sent me by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), they go into lines on his guest walls.
His reason for purchasing such a large number of albums and symptoms, he can now purchase plastics that he couldn't allow himself when he was only out and purchase objects he had sold when he was young.
"My more of the things I'm buying is the end of the 60s, the beginning of the 70s, the things that came when I was 11 or 12 things that I probably was too young to buy," he said.
He agrees that those who purchase the plastics are most likely, the introvers who love their own company, adding: "I'm not smoking, I don't drink too much.
It's my lack.
Wees, 25 years working at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers whom he meets are corresponding to the YouGov profile.
However, he noted the new concern of people who had been under the influence of the media, people who heard the return and felt the responsibility of purchase their old platforms.
Judging on the discussions I had, people were discarded from their collection, normally in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who ever sold their fault to purchase dishes, are now sell their ski compacts to purchase their platforms," he says.
This may explain the blue among the rebuilding persons of a certain age.
What about the emotional importance of placing?
A few seconds in the shop, such as Phonica, are sufficiently conducted to understand that placing shops offer a comfortable society with similar views.
According to Wess, some more guests, in particular the unfair payment system, are detrimental.
Some of the guests may feel disappointed from the digital world and prefer to be removed in the constant convergencies for the placing, objects that have the memories of immature youth.
"I think it may sometimes be filled with whiteness or material things as their kind of calm," says Weather.
Because I'm the collectioner, I have it, and I think there's also a lot of people.
That's a simple way to take your head.
"We're as their social workers!" said a colleague from the platinum strike.
The ICM survey showed that almost 50 per cent of those who purchased a virtue album in April have not yet heard it.
The survey also found that 41 per cent of the player they have never used, while 7 per cent of those who purchase guilty, no placing player.
At this stage of the news report, I would probably have seen a seriously delicate, cutting up the board with the assemblies of Boshanova.
"Trofe" aspect of recovery is what Johnny noted 42 years of age working in Sounds of the Universe (counting: three men in mid-year-old years).
"Another one came recently and said, "I don't have a plastic player, but I want to buy a radiohead plate so we could put it to ourselves," he said.
It's not a big percentage, but it's definitely happening.
It's the most typical, less music.
We've got people who say, "I don't have a player."
These are young people older, less than twenty, who are only aware of this.
Fopp, who now opened almost all the stage of the wine, is much more diversity when I'm coming.
There are couples for 70, tourists photod, adolescents and women in the middle of the age.
Although the atmosphere is less innocent than the stories mentioned above, the last Sint and Sexy Pop Wild Beast, and not a jazzle introduction, is sweet to see the difference in its customers.
No one seems particularly unique, but the painful psychological trauma is difficult to establish 30 seconds close to someone.
Eleanor, 27 years old, went to Fopp for a few minutes, considering the various platforms available in the sales.
She looks like goods, not money.
It doesn't pay much, as she says, so it's not a very suitable option.
That's pretty good.
Listen to a music on a computer or another device -- but the beauty swears it -- it's swearing into the dreams with a smile that is completed by love.
I don't know how to explain it is really unbelievable.
My last stopping is the shop that, as he says, has helped the appearance of a new generation of favorites, because the people's models were in the village.
As I create the illusion that I'm considering gymnastics, I'm looking at a group of adolescents, every minute to gather around the Polaroid camera, before my father and his daughter start to discuss the purchase of Crosley player.
The left is a shoe with the wall set by Adele, Jephth Bacli, Amy Wynhaw and Flytud Mack: the modern style and classics, required platforms for any medium collection.
Nobody looks — perhaps because they are just a shooting, some places are so high on the wall, that wouldn’t be able to touch them.
It's a real artistic guilty.
However, considering that any attention to these objects may mean more money to the industry and send several other customers to the Soho deep at any time, not almost what to be complained.
It is not surprising that the lion of people who have more likely than most of them have more time and money than most of them is a shelf that loses most money on the raw materials, such as the guilt.
But until my conclusions show that the results of YouGov are accurate, at least in Soho platforms, they do not exclude the existence of a large number of collective women and lovers who are in reality, in placing shops and online forums.
These people probably work in school or offices.
But they are apparently not taking place on the morning on the shopping in Berwick Strit and avoiding the views of an unpleasant 30-year-old false leader, which depends on the shoes of men who are not suspected for medium-years.

The French Court rejects the proposal to purchase shops in the Jungly refugee camp
The French Court rejected the proposal of the Kyle’s authorities to take ten individual shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees live.
In the court hearings this week, the authorities of Kyle expressed that the State should be able to make a total complexity of 72 single shops where people sold goods from smoke to energy drinks, propose to switch or sell a tea for 50 cents (40r) or a few euros in an independent restaurant.
The Prefecturer Cale expressed that these places should be covered because they are a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they have a fire and sanitary risk.
The Guarantee Groups told the court that the purchase and restaurants are vitally necessary, claiming that the free observations proposed for the government association and other groups do not provide sufficient amount of food for growing numbers in the camp.
They expressed that single sales and restaurants often provide blood and free food for those who need it.
The Court of Leil decided that it was not a legal basis to evacuate people who managed 72 single shops, but said that the problem of the prevention of Kyle 's being completely understood.
Judge Jean-Francois Mollah said that bacalyes, cafe and restaurants had played a great role than simply the use of people who " live in a very thrilling conditions".
He said that spaces have provided the peaceful meetings of refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that were threatened by the report was a children ' s book of Junglee at a camp which does not work for benefits and propose 200 dinners a day, English and French, and refugee consultations for hundreds of vulnerable adolescents without association in the camp.
More than 170.000 people were signed for the protection of the coffee of children.
The letter sent to Guardian stated that his closed " would be a catastrophic for those children, some of whom not older than eight years".
Two well-being institutions, the assistance to the Beiges and L'Auberge des Migrants in Friday, estimated that the number of Jungle camps growed and increased 90,000 people — the most higher than the whole history — after the slight increase in new arrives during the year.

Britain is stopped in Regby-7 in January, after the master-class Fiji allows them to take gold
The impressive series of Great Britain in Regby-7 was slowly stopped at the final prevention of Fiji team in the finishing night when they were fully disrupted 43-7 in the Deodor Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave the master-class for the ownership of meat, squirty, strikes, swimming lines, and cruel force to win gold — their first olimpholic meal of any color.
The view was not too poor in the form of silver, the third in Britain, and they could be proud of their efforts in the first Olympic tournament in Regby-7, which won by the way New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
Boks ill, 7-5 in half-five in the same day, could be returned to the end.
But no matter what, Fiji has winned as far as it couldn't be a team of 15 persons.
This may be some comfort for the United Kingdom — but it is probably not — that at least one British man will spend tomorrow on a gold meal: the main trainer Fiji - Ben Ryan, an ex - shirt of England from Wymbledon.
It was a few trips to Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game on Adelaide Sevens.
They've lost the whole one here.
These shocks will cause pain, but the progress is positive.
Fiji began greatly, because of the pleasing, the attempt of Britain to overcome the meat.
It was like to touch the driving bus column to Captain Tom Mitchell and company, and the Championships of the World Series went up from 5 to 0 when Ocea Coleissa sloped in the edge.
There were four minutes at Jerry Tuvai's time, a further tachdown on the right fleet, which was implemented.
12-0 and Great Britain had to go to the bottle.
The great attempt of Mitchell's overwhelming was to hold Leon Nakarawe from to forget the third, but that's only to Fiji.
At the seventh minute, Jas Veremelalaw did Tachdaun in the right edge, and the United Kingdom played 17-0.
Nakarabaya added another after renewing, and in the hour there were still more minutes... in the first half.
In the meantime, Ravo was cut through some other long-term attempts to overcome the Great Britain and the storm to obtain a shock.
Implementation has led to 29-0 in suspension.
It seemed that Fiji had been born for the game in the Regiby-7, while Greece still owns a rhythm.
What's going on in a significant way.
The Great Britain made mass replacements in half of the game, and they shocked a physician... at all four minutes, that the standards of the first half were good until Joshua Tussov passed after a number of fraude fysic interactions.
Dan Norton accepted the attempt for Britain, making a tank in the left angle to make a count of 36-7, but a long walk on the road of the islands of South Sea, whose skin fans were shocked and danced on the courts.
It could not be satisfied with Fiji’s full joy.
Mate Willham slaughtered a physician torch that did not need to switch, another attempt in the last seconds.
The results were called, the physicians were dealing, and the United Kingdom was shocked into gas, completely convinced.
On the same day, Fiji wins Japan from 20 to 5 in its half-five, and the United Kingdom was a little bunch of South Africa in a tensive half-first attempt to everybody, the difference of the British implementation.
Kyle Brown puts Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton helped a fine work with a slight leg and shooted the balls in the second half.
The last attempt to overcome from Marcus Watson, the 15th part of the team of England, Entony, provided the victory, and finally a silver meal.
Helen Glover and Hiser Stanning are inspired to win in the struggle of cancer training
There's no more worried gold on these games, and that's something about it.
From the first move to the last, 220 degrees in history, Helen Glover and Hizer Stanning found that their golden moment at the Lagoa Station was more important.
Although they were the two of the weights, there were three voices in this ship, the trainer Robin Williams was always until they tried to the second submission of the Olympic gold in women, the first woman in the British sport analysis that reached that height.
Their superiority was absolute, the 39th unbelievable statement, again unprecedented.
What we're seeing is that two brain sports switching on the surface of the lebedies are not fully reflecting the nature of the triumph.
For every gold of the Greek Batalon, prepared hands that contribute to the slowly swallowing winnings that are important, and no hands that were more important than the trainer, which 30 months ago when he had placed a cancer diagnose, did not know whether he lived before seeing that day.
As he said, it was a dangerous case.
I've got a smooth puzzler cancer, which is one of the things they can operate, and they've done it.
If they're not doing this, he's going all over there.
This could be a very bad situation.
She's a little changed your species in the future.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
Triumph was glad that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, maintaining a minimum graphic, if it could be a correct expression in such circumstances as those.
I needed payment, so I had to run fast.
It was smiling.
I was in the hospital and driving at the office — 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet per hour, although they were talking enough steps.
That's how it starts.
The beach itself is a journey, but it makes it a little more.
The next mom after the winning of their first thoughts were Williams, who held the nervous morning, speaking more than normally in trying to overcome their own challenges.
Stanning, Capitaine of Artillerian Services in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional disappearing this week, perhaps a little sweet, but that's so important."
It only confirms how much this means for me, how much Helen and I worked, and Robin also.
These were fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we would be no one, so great thanks to him, he's the best trainer in the world.
I couldn't even ask for a better partner to train or a better trainer.
Helen Glover and Hizer Stanning haven't lost any honey for five years.
This couple has a pressing ritme that their competitors never could match.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the New Zealand and Denmark teams began approaching, Stanning and Glover had too much in the safe.
We were strong in the phase.
Helen said, "Let in the process, stay in the process."
It's very important now not to get out of here.
We had a good time, and at the same time we weren't trying to do something funny.
We weren't waiting for feverers today, we just expected that we could be well able to go out and win this gorge that we did.
A couple needs a year to decide on their future.
The Globe must be married in the next month, in her own television scanner by Steve Bakshell.
Now she just wants to enjoy a moment.
I didn't want to say that it's my last throne.
That would mean too much pressure.
We needed some six months to understand that I became the Olympic Champion.
It was so new, and I was so painted.
I need some four minutes here.
"I'm so much better," she said.

The Poland State Oil Company does not exclude that a few years later the GF gas supply may be inacceptable for it because of the transfer of fuel from Norwegian and other countries.
The Vice-President of the Polish Finance Company was reported to God's Major.
His words are transmitted to TASS.

Remember, the Poland Government on Gas and Energy Infrastructure, Peter Namiki reported that the Poland authorities decided not to extend the contract with Gazpromma for gas supply.
The Poland contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expired in 2022.

The UN Special Meetinger on Syria Staffan de Mister said to the journalists: "Declarations that this really happened is much."
The invalidity of the use of chloro for military purposes is set out in the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.

As soon as he said about the purpose, he added, but "the countries are convinced that they are not associated with the international extremist groups".
Soon soon, Mr. Patanacharon said.
But we know exactly that these incidents are not directly linked to some kind of terrorism, actually these are local divergences, and we are trying to establish the personality of those who are behind them.
Explosions occurred on the day of the Queen of Thailand Sicret.
The Thai Hunta considers the protection of the monarchy one of its main priorities, so that the incident may be directed against it.

How Bangkok was in an emergency situation
The Government of Thailand, in the head of Yinglak Chinavat, announced in January 2014, that an emergency situation was introduced in Bangkok and the capital of provinces.
The special regime has been extended 60 days.
Like two explosions in Bangkok.
In January 2014, in the Bangkok Center of Pobeda, where one of the main protest actions had been carried out, two explosions resulting from 28 people suffered, five of them were critical.
Explosions have resulted in unknown motorcycles.
The authorities have strengthened the security measures in the capital and engaged military forces to protect demonstrators.
In Sohma Logue, there was an development of conditions.
As it was known, the Government was proposed to agree on the draft conditions for the counterparty of the Suha Log with the maintenance of two key limits.
It is proposed to not allow the company where 25 per cent and more foreigners and the claims in which the capital will not be at least 25 per cent of the host.
Participants are not expected that the Government will write the conditions, noting that many games are not risked by a complex and road project.
Audience can announce in August and take place in October.
The mines were introduced to the Government in the project of allocation and conditions for the largest unfavoured gold-cooperation in Sohai Log (Irak area, stocks and resources), reported two sources of " . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The project is introduced in midnight, specifically one of them.
In the Minoprofeders, they confirmed that the project was introduced to the Government.
The representative of the fuming non-smoking Vice-Premier Alexander Kloonin said that the functional project was not done in the device.
" The audience may already be declared in August, immediately after the Government's disbursement, and taking into account the deadline for the collection of applications for potential participants (not less than 45 days) may be held in October," says the Ministers.
According to the project, there were two key requirements for the potential participants, which were set out in the option, which was sent to the Ministers and IFOs in July.
The first is the capital of the candidates, however, 25 per cent of the guest participation.
Second is the refusal of access to shopping companies under the control of foreign investors, from the understanding of FG-57 on foreign investment in strategic society.
According to two of the FG-arts in the project, as already written by "e.g." on 2 August, the company whose beneficiary (25 per cent and above) does not have a double citizenship by RF.
The Government is engaged in such limitations, as the Suha Log relates to the emergency of the federal value (more than 50 tons of gold).
The Minoprofeders confirmed that the project “contains the restrictions for foreign companies” but refused to comment on the details to the Government's allocation.
In December 2015, the Chairman of the Sergei Lewchenko's officer was sent to the Minnesota area, said in Minnesota, and later reaffirmed the Governor of the Sergey Lewchenko region, noting that it was addressed to his former Sergeem Eroceanco, the "ancient investment contract with the "Rustok".
Those who imposed the restrictions for foreigners are not cleared.
"But this is in the spirit of time, but not to control the most largest gold place in Russia on the back of the Western sanctions," discusses the co-conciliator who knows the shopping preparation.
The Head of Minor Prostitute of Sergey Dono, of 1 August, stated that foreigners would be able to go to consortium, if the claimants were bound to them as the financial structure, the technological partners.
Congress believe that the Government is adjusting the conditions.
The main candidate on Suhaw Log is considered the consortium of the largest gold adventure of RFPA Paulus, the under-controlled son of Sullyman Kerimvo Said, and Russia.
As stated in July, partners have created the "Zollot" SG, where 51 per cent of the percentage in the Russian RT-GR structure is 49 per cent.
The Russian ' s rejected comments, as Paul stated, "which is " interested in this asset " and have all the necessary competences and resources for its development.
"But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be adopted after the declaration of the conditions, " added to the Police.
ALRA may participate in the shopping, but a decision by the RF Government, the sources were called ".
The possibility for the development of the Suhgo Loga was declared Russian Gold and Canadian Kinross, which develops as Polymetal and Northgold, is not interested in active.
Head of the Golden Industry RF Sergey Kashab in December 2015 estimated "earns" investment in Shua Log in $2.5-4 billion.
The majority of potential candidates is not only the number of investments but also the complexity of the project: they need a serious training of resources and technologies with complex equipment, explaining partners in the sector.
At the pension market, the UK Finance Pension Administrator launched the process of association of four sub-controlled NFPs.
As a result, "Gazfond Pension Coppers" will be created by a number of NFF collected by about 373 billion rubbers.
On the launch of a combination of four pension funds, "KIT Finance", "Promford" and "Gazfond Pension Collections" last night, reported the owner of 100 per cent of the CHIT Finance Administrator of Pension.
"The reorganization is implemented in accordance with the CB, in compliance with the requirements of the conditions of the treaties concerned," states the company.
The combination is carried out on the Gazfond Pension Collections.
As noted in the DG of the NFF Oлег Bylishsky, the combination of funds allows a number of tasks: the enhancement of geographic presence, the concentration of development resources, the reduction of costs, the trend of the best practices of each fund and the optimization of corporate management.
In his words, the oriental term of the consolidation is the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the combination of NFs, the Pension Coppers will become the larger player on the POP market.
According to the data on 31 March, the amount of counterparts of joint funds exceeded 373 billion rubbers.
As reported on the funds website, the beneficiary of their owners, " IKT Finance of the Pension Administrator ", are currently Anatole Gavrienco (65 per cent of the sub-control OOs belongs) and the " Gazfond" NGOs (35 per cent).
However, the association of the group has been very late competitors.
Yes, the under-controlled O1-NFN-Bood-Down-Food-to-Stall-Food is still in the beginning of the present year.
This Joint NGO is currently joining the Uralssib Funds and the Russian Standard.
"Introduction in a single structure, including reducing costs, is necessary to solve structural tasks", notes the NF-generator Nicolay Sidors.
The active work on the consolidation of funds with April is also in the Safmar Pension Group - NPF Europe, Description and Science - should be included in Safmar until the end of this year.
In 2017, the GNF is joined by the Dead.
"Combination of Funds will effectively enhance risk control, operational processes and expenditure", noted in the Safmar Pension Group.
A number of reasons may be made to the experts to the ICF Finance Administrator of Pension.
Before the last time, NGOs could not purchase more than 40 per cent of the infrastructure expenditure in which the group was actively located.
After amendments to the CB in March of that year, on a number of employees relevant to the regulator ' s requirements, such limitations are no longer available.
The director of the Financial Institutes' Rating Group of ACRA Jury Nogin, if necessary, can buy one large player.
A number of NFF leaders from the fuel-15 assets are called the separation of the effects and, as a result, career designations in a single fund that should agree to the owners of the group.
Last night Anatolius Gavrienko was not allowed to comment.
On the request of "Hasfond" to the NCP, they did not answer.
Although the consolidation of the funds is a job and unfortunate event, this decision will be justified at a long distance.
As he notes, the director of the Consulting Company Sergey Okoleson, the Pension Collections Gazphones, has a decrease in the stabilising the basis of other group funds.
This will be a more successful experience in the ICF's Finance and Promotor Fund in the construction of smaller SAP sales, as well as in the use of more modern PP.
The requirements of the CBC to processes and careers of NPF will continue to grow, so to double infrastructure on four funds in the single investment policy, as a director of the expert RA expert Paul Mitrophans.
" The effect of duplicating functions will unilaterally complete the possible unit costs", states Mr. Mitrofan.
The costs for the combination of four funds of Sergey Okolesne are estimated to 30-50 million rubbers.
" The costs of four such funds are approximately 400 million rubbers per year, with a medium-term budget realizedly reduced two", said Mr. Osolesn, as a result of the consolidation of the medium-term budget.
In the Russian procate, Pete and his Dragon was the best discinic film.
The beautiful species of New Zealand, the fascinating dragon, the soul-friendly history and the songs in the canter style are sufficient to believe again in the ancient magic.
The scared little was a dragon that became a human child and a swimming girl and a loyal friend.
Pete calls her friend Elliot, who is honoured by a snake of the book, plays with him in a box and slept in a film.
Six years later, his growing and preserved connection is not yet different from the other industrial forest sovereigner of Maula.
In that way, Pita finds a blossom woman, Grace (Blace Dallas Hovard), while the Brigade of Gavin (Carl Urban), her husband, agressively fled the forest.
Now she must not only believe in the existence of the Dragon but also help him saving him.
Pete passes a rapid course to "be a man" in the universe of the Indian Americans who have a cowboys, a moral code in the heart and smile more clearer than any advertising.
No person looks out and does not work too terrible that the slaughter actually begins to hate or fear him.
Even Gavin, who was locked by an untypical village of his sub-sized forests, is far away from an injustified abuse.
The shocked dragon was also unterrorized, with a good bouldog, the aircraft shoot and the ability to become invisible.
Dragon is awesome, smiling, even smiling, and, happily, he does not always want to swim, so it is usefully different from all known cinematographic dragons.
The visual image of Elliot and his manner are maintained in such a high sense of emotional involvement that at the pressing moments, not only smaller, but also adults are in a position to smell in three hands.
Awesome good and young Oux Figur in the role of Pete, who was interrupted between the family and the real friend.
Robert Reedford is a canonic grandfather who would like to have literally every child.
How did the director David Loury have been able to remove a fantastically forgotten disciple film Dracon Pita in 1977, which was meant from the noise to the end of the hot and mentioned only by a mix of animation and game movie, and to make it the most soulful movie of this summer?
Not like a miracle helped.
In his picture of Laurie from the original, in fact, only two things were taken: the pirate of Pita and the dragon.
The board remained musical numbers and the largest part of the strange shoes.
In this good statement, we read the shoes from "Bambi", "Implantian" and many other kind of children's paintings.
The Disney study continues to expand the gallery of high quality rings in the 21st century.
Of course, "Pit and Dragon" is not so deceptive as the "Jongley Book" and there's no artistic abuse that Kate Blanchet had been in the role of the mache in the new Golden.
However, this film has successfully helped to believe in wonder and good in the best disciple traditions.
On the other hand, the keys from the magnificent store of Disney's register Laurie will be obtained again for the artistic film adaptation of Peter Pane's history.
David Lawre and the scenar of Toby Haelbrooks have entered a new ambitious project on an unbeduled boy on a single James Barry's message.
The journalist of RBK Alexandra Sokoloa proclaimed a new accused
The journalists of RBK Alexander Sokolov, accused of the organization of the extremist structure, declared that the prosecution had not been counted in the case of their subsidiary.
We learned from the investigators last night that the prosecutor had presented such a presentation.
We were planned to participate in the judiciary on the limitation of knowledge with criminal matters, but the meeting was not held, and the investigators reported us about the prosecutor's presentation.”
She told the prosecutor that the investigators had indicated that the qualification of cases and assembled materials was inadequate.
The investigators now have to be removed in the proof base and proclaimed the new accused to Alexandre Sokolo.
Another article of the Criminal Code (OHCH) remains the same, but with other evidence and new evidence, Mrs Dynz declares.
As he reported, Alexander Sokolov was arrested on 29 July 2015.
In June the current year reported that the results were excluded from the accused of the RBK journalist on the "Political Review of Instability" and the "related enforcement of the authorities".
Aleksandr Zilbert, a counterparty in the Olympic village, has investigated the Russian collection house, eated in a local table and even made the WADA test after it.
It seems that life isn't going to die in seconds.
Even even night.
The latest older times have been completed, after which the sports have been needed to return to the Olympic village.
Furthermore, there are seats and displaces from the village, since some attractors have completed their statements and leave Brazil, and some of them are just coming here.
Well, at 7:30 morning, one of the temporary tests is taken by all the Olympic delegations.
In these congregations, we are generally discussing some operational matters, reports the director of the sporting delegation of Russian Jord Casics team. - Despite the fact that our houses in which we believed that our sculptors have taken it in the exploitation of one of the first and have demonstrated all the controlers, even some of the cases.
So with a hard water problem, I'm sorry, with vultasies.
We've been fighting for cleanness for a long time.
First, nobody had to get away.
Then the clinics arrived, but they're just swearing some substance on the ground, yes.
They've got, see if some innovations are innovative.
Mol, you can't touch them humanly.
We know these fields are the channels!
In general, changes of the clining company have been made and now all of this has been done.
The Olympic village is the South Buto, a bed area that is covered by one side of the mountains, and the other swimming wheel, the places of the living water.
Well, for the hope, there's still a two-milling ice board over the whole perimeter.
All in the village can be placed to 17.000 persons in 3604 apartments located in 31 houses.
One of the 18 stages has a large Russian flag -- this house is completely dedicated to the needs of our collection.
In view of a small incentive, you can immediately determine what problems are to be for the most pleasant team.
Two statements are declared on the long registration: "Priminist, don't leave the paper in the toilet!" and "Prime in the icon gift."
It's the same shoes in the browsers.
Their funeral race is contrasting with the brochure: "Remember of Infectional Diseases for Retroverse to Rio de Janeiro", "Search for help in the shock, the fall of the foreign body in a respiratory way, the loss of conscience is the stages of heart-leading reaction", "Healing in flights, warm shocks, shocks and blood tests".
The text is in a generally pleasant.
For example, “indication is conveyed to a heavy and post-sequent outcome.
Nevertheless, it is not all good.
There is certainly a healthcare in the position of the Russian collected, who is ready to provide the home-based assistance, including the deficit and sporting mass.
Instead of the physician, our delegation's headquarters.
The doors are inspiring crystal, "Only we win!".
Well, of course, the texts:
All arguments are absolute burden!
They believe only those who fear.
Let us be less than winning, and Russia won't go away, and it's not broken!
In order to further uphold the spirit, the statement states: "Awesome brothers and sisters!
For the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and all the Russians, the spiritual bearing on the sports of the Olympic collection of Russia performs the prototyper Andrey Wormlovich Alexandr.
Put your prayers and other requirements on the phone...
Indeed, it is the Meditation Center and Religious Training for the representatives of all the conferences.
Well, the Russian is obtained, in the privileged situation, they have their own hour.
With regard to the burning of the lift from the nineth stage to the fourth stage, I decided to go down on the leaflet recommended to use during the fire.
And in the darkness, the body was shocked on her.
As a whole, they were sleeping workers of the new clining company.
I believe, at any time, they decided to set up a quiet time directly on cold steps.
At the fourth stage, I was waiting for a meeting with Vitalia Fedorovich Dudoko, the trainer of our baths, bringing them to the Olimpiade gold 16 years ago to Sidney.
He and the student, the Champion of Europe of the Yan Paul, agreed to show his rooms.
- We live on two, of course, sleeping is almost slow, but it's not critical.
One of the four, but it's very spacious.
Scop, of course, sweet, from the shoes, confidence does not call, but something can be put.
"No, you're shooting, the tea have finished!" - he develops the tennisist of the Svetlan Kuisco, who met me in the main table.
It is called, even though, because it represents a space of 2,7 thousand km and is ready to take 50,000 visitors simultaneously.
There are 600,000 portions in the swimming powder completely free.
The options of the menu are: "Luke from Brazil", "Cuchney of the Peace", "Asia observations" and "Pizza, Macronics".
The last option I've seen is the great popularity of our volunteers.
That's what I'm saying, I haven't found any of the gigant restaurant units.
What are you kids?
It's good that I've got a Chinese shooter with me.
And the cheese.
But if you understand, we're still worse in the cortex.
There's something you can choose, despite an unexpected unity.
I personally chose a pair of pieces and fractures in tomate soß.
Each pool is a table with its name in three languages, English, French, português, and the food value of the product and its existing allergens.
Well, it's all right. It's a good thing.
I don't even know why this is always in McDonald's local.
The networks that are disabled can say the "Templens" sports from the restaurant are expected to be our best friends, the representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
They have a victorial ball, a winner that has a football.
Come on, you can say!
To obtain a gift, it is necessary to respond correctly to eight questions from ten.
- I attacked a girl of WADA.
But it wasn't attacked.
I mean, I'm in the patriotic explosion, naturally.
The second question has already been addressed: "If I have received a notice of the arriving duty, should I immediately go to the end-control point?"
I stopped by the B option, "No, I've got one hour."
I've lost, so I say, behaviour.
I forgot that the weakness of WDA would not be expected.
Indeed, you must be immediately.
Well, at the seventh stage, my situation was very critical.
I was thinking that if I'd be hard to observe the balanced dial because of my flesh graphic, so I can use bioboats to get "adding food substances to improve my productivity."
No, they're not allowed!
Exactly, the answer is made so that Category is not prohibited, but in a number of proposals are denied.
This WADA plays injuryly!
What's going on, Russia?
Get away from Ethics, Isnbaev and all our firm team.
So I focused on the last force, and I wined an unfortunate football.
Find what you say, ours!
In the victory, I entered the Fitzing Center.
The trainer's count.
It's over 250.
It was surprising that no Russian sportor was found in this threat.
But maybe it's right?
Let the one who does not play!
And here's one of our guy's sit down there.
In the way to the ocult.
Don't worry, not a shot.
In the polycline, as well as in all the villages where the pool is, the device is to extract preserveers.
On the morning, the enthusiasming call is: "Come with the end."
Furthermore, it is only to move a iron that remembers the door shell, and the preserving made from the natural late Amazon, which is ready to get out of the device.
I took myself alone in memory.
It's not going to make the sports -- they've brought them 450 thousand.
As a time for celebration and celebration in the Olympic village, there is a total dilution centre.
In any case, it should be a marking table, recalled that the International Olympic Committee costs $3.25 million per day.
The centre is introduced by videographs, bill and tennis tables, on a football and a cookie and some strange devices like video repository.
- I'm interesting in the Ukrainian collection that actively uses dicovine games.
Of course, it could just say that you don't want to talk to someone in the form of the Russian collection, yes and all.
There, in some strange circumstances in the eyes, they are saved from the men in the western blue.
The most playing gambling is shown.
In order to spend the whole village, we need not less than three hours.
But if you go, not traveling on the electronics, you're opening and the house of the Canadian shop with the income and chamber with the rebuilding bathroom, and the bicycle office, the work, and the chemistry, and the parking, and the color shop, and the box with the goods of the daily consumption, and the e-mail with unique markets (that you can't still survive from Chinese firms), and the bank, and the buses, and photos, and photos.
And after the night you're asking, you're coming to the air of the olive tree, sweared by different lenses, in the memory of the abandoned world of friends and parents of the atlets.
And you'll be under the company of the machines, which are uncomfortablely smooth to die insects, to think forever.
I mean, the Olimpiade movement.
Someone in this village isn't stopped for a minute.
As long as the rest of the Russian world was breathing, the Australians were not commanded by the American Dream Team, which had been in the network.
A little person knows: the news that Inna Deliverow wins gold in the XXXI Olimpian Games, I received the first.
Maybe I'm even the only mocky who saw this happening - not considering those who looked out that evening in Carioca.
This can be understood only the real baller.
Imagine: The deep night of Moscow.
The neighbors down down, as always to the night, are smiling and starting unfortunately, but very much to smile each other.
And it's threatening to move the house.
On the kitchen, cran is no time to go to the market and buy how he asked a new sandwich.
There was nothing understood in the television schedule, so it was just the control of the Matt channel, the "Peace" and in any case of Russia, although it was almost unreasonable.
Russia is the family of repeats, all the sports there's something in the record.
There are serials translating directly in the ethers.
Hope, of course, to Matt's whole night, a young man cryed in newspapers first about the great half-fill of Delivela, Shanaev, then the gorgeous battle for gold.
It would be logical to show.
But instead of this, the United States, Australia.
I can't say anything wrong about this.
Australians were equal, the first half of them had been winned.
They were placed on the place of the guards from their own large Americans.
As a result, they have been lost, but, as they are now expressed, the Basketball Olympic Tourner will never be previous.
It's all right, but it's close to the battle with De France and on the screen without changes.
In a easy panel, I'm starting to post the channels.
This feeling, the second time the shock is shocked.
Okay, let's go down, to the cable.
There's no thematic "Matchy" phenomenon.
Oh, my feelings, the battle will start.
Some sporting websites do not affect me.
The court Cerfing provides an unexpected but unexpected result.
The Pervoy website provides a direct technical transmission of all restraints that are in that time.
I click on a phenomenon, I'll get gold units.
The degree is very contracted, goes forward to the eye - and it is obviously starting a long time.
Italians are almost totally reacting.
We're on one point forward, to the end more than two seconds.
De Franciska is shocking to Deriegov, and it turns away, the time ends, the Italian shoes.
Get!
After a few seconds, the Olympic messenger reports about the fourth gold meal.
It's out, I'm the first one who saw it with my eyes.
Insensitive, faithful, afflicted.
The Musulman ' s spiritual management (DM) Tataristan is rejected by the use of Russian language in the sword.
Last night, the DOM forced his ancestors to carry five-year preaching only on Tatarian to put young tatars “to study their own language”.
The government claims that it does not harm the Muslim's right to other nationalities.
Some Kazakhstan's dreams say that Tatarian language does not understand to 60 per cent, among whom foreign students, migrants, and its own tatars.
The people are afraid that their preaching in the Tatarian "is not going to the whole audio."
Last night, the D.M. Tataristan decided to carry out fifth preaching in the swords of the Republic only in the Tatarian language.
As the muffin of Tataristan Camille Samuellin stated, this should be a stimulation for young tatars "to study their own language."
"To those who say it's hard, we want to organize the tatarian lessons absolutely free", said Mr. Samuellin.
He added that "decision has already entered into force" and today in all the swords of preaching "debt to be already in the Tatarian language".
He recalled that D.M. Tataristan issued a "Sura" magazine with standard preaching in the Tatar language.
The name that's not enough to say in Tatark, "that may be prepared for it."
The DM Tataristan combines more than thousands of income in all the municipalities of the Republic.
According to the Muffatia, the fifth preaching areas are exclusively carried out in Tatar language.
At the same time, in Kazakhstan a number of swords were previously used as Russian.
In particular, as he stated, this was practiced in Burnav's sword, Zacabana and Eniler.
However, he stressed Mr. Mohammedshin, the leadership was the task that all students have the power of both public languages of the Republic, independent of nationality.
"Don't matter what distress the Muslim-Netator can't be", emphasized Mr. Mohammedshin, explaining that the preaching itself "is not a binding part of the nams."
This will continue to read the swords in the swords and lessons in Russian language.
At the same time Raphik Mohammedskin said that there was no serious threat to extinction of Tatarian language from the sword.
In addition to Russian and Tatarian other languages, such as Zambic or Tajik, it is not used in the preaching of the Republic.
The decision of DOM was actively supported in the Tatar World Congress Committee.
The executive head of the WCT Rinat Zakiros said "The men are a major part of our national life".
It would be painful if the Tatarian language was gone.
He noted that the preaching was only the "speaking of the smuggles" in the Tatarian language, but in the executive ICT, "that is right".
The names of the Russian preaching are ready to make the decision of DM, but they believe that it is difficult to understand the priests.
The sword goes and the tatars and the Russians.
Many do not understand language.
They will, of course, be disappointed.
"It's supposed to be overlooked," says the Burnav's sword Farhat Mawletdin.
In his words, preach in Russian language even many tatakers because "Russian and schools, and in children, the radio is an indicative."
However, he believes that the swords will continue to learn and learn in Russian languages that are conducted in other days.
We trust in God.
And Allah will show out of this situation."
But about 60% of us don't know Tatarian language.
It's too sweethearts, twins, and azerbaijans.
Many goes to us foreign students: Africans, Arabs.
"We've been four years old as we've passed Russian," said they.
He believes that the preaching in the Tatarian will "be closer to the circle and will not go to the whole hearing."
But we will submit to the full decision.
Only the results of the preaching work will be different.
But it's time to show.
"My, for example, will be easier because the Tatarian is my family," said Gabulla Galillyn.

Anomy Snapchat Effect criticizes as a career on Asians
Snapchat claims that this filter is inspired by ane, but some suspects say he is racially free.
The Snapchat tool allows approximately 150 million users a day to change the reality and play personality with ways that are limited to the absorption.
You can turn yourself into ananas, dogs, or persons to make up the picture of Roy Liechtenstein.
Lines are the pieces of instruments that make more than 30 million rejusted villages a day.
Any mistakes are rapidly known.
The Snaapchat Lines were sent to criticize in the past when they were accused of the application of the dark skin of the person or promoting the elected persons as the ideal of the beauty.
So when some users proposed a lympe that made them out of space, dentists and tissues, some critics found this racist cardure in Asians -- the Jeltolians.
They asked whether these repeated contractions were towards a more serious issue of the company related to diversity.
In the midst, communications and results of the reports in The Verge and Motherboard were distributed, and the next day after Snaapchat stated that the function was deleted.
The company made comments: Linse was considered as an anam, not as a card in Asians.
But experts who know racism not heard, Linz recalled the distressing stereotypes in action.
Others fully rejected the comparison with ana.
In the electronic letter of Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student who was actively shared on the photos, said that the lince was "awesome and at least smooth".
She added that " was hard to face with the comparison of the side of the Asian carriage and the effects of the filter.
This shows that the filter is not just ironic, but the upper level of ironics.
Snapchat is not the only company through these cultural bridges.
The American culture seems to have an integral fight for diversity and inclusiveness, starting from corporate meetings to Hollywood and girls, which we all have.
And the great hearing of young people in Snaapchat, which are racially multidimensional than their old generation, may mean that they are more able to expect understanding.
When one of the Snapchat's rings created a painful image for the user, he said in the 25th-year-old Catty Jo, "the path of events is much harder to remain unremarked as it was before."
On Thursday, Ju, the product manager and engineer working at the Medium decided to remove its accounting in Snaapchat and called others to do the same.
In the Medium and in the phone interview, she said that racial oppositions were the cause of an inadequate diversity in the Sunday.
Jhu was predominantly discovered by a white company that was only a man and ended her article by the hashtego: #DeleteSnaapchat.
Juu, who is the American origin of China, wrote: "If they have no sufficient number of non-white people in the State who could take such decisions, or work white people, they do not work as a position where they can be safe and openly expressed."
Other questionnaires divide the view, expressing unheartedness that Snapchat did not respond to the majority of its questions.
The company does not publish information on the presentation of national minorities in its State by emphasising its status of the private company.
The fourth Snapchat refused to discuss the racial origin of his staff, but, according to the reliable person, the company recently initiated a publisher to concentrate in the unsufficially represented areas and to active efforts to integrate internal resources.
To his side, John said she will keep his accounting record in Snaapchat closed, adding: "I'm interesting if they really need more users like us to say that it will not go."
The Military Directorate has been informed of the IGI, reports the Committee of the Congress
The officials of the United States Armed Forces Center have changed the information reports to submit a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the basis of the event on the place, reported the Committee of the Conference in the report issued on Thursday.
The interim report of the operational group established by the Presidency of the Palestinian Committee on Affairs of the VC, the Research Committee and the Subcommittee on Military Assignments has found "widespread disadvantagedness" among the analysis of the Headquarter Commanding Service, which claims that the leaders have sent their evaluation of American action to win against the Islamic State.
The Central Commandment, known as Century, is the main military administration in the city of Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
" The information documents identified by the Centre's High Command, generally, gave a more optimistic image of the United States anti-terrorism action as confirmed by real data from the place of events, and were stabilly more optimistic than the analysis provided by other special servants," said the report.
“What happened in Century is unacceptable: When the Supreme Guide is an invalid analysis, our military sufferings,” said the member of the Chamber of Ken Calvert, the Republic of California.
The mainstreaming problems in the Centre are reached by the most higher organization.
Decimal reports have been identified in the decrease and analysis of the American Actions for the training of armed forces of Iraq provided by the Central Commandment in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not contain the final evidence that the Ombudsman Administration members have commanded to fail the reports, he claims that analysis felt that the Centre's leadership needs to represent them more optimistic towards the threat of the Islamic State, also known as IHIL or ISIL.
"But during the first half of 2015, many presss, statements and witnesses of the Center Command in the Congress were significantly optimistic than real events," reported.
For example, the official of the Centre publicly stated that a large military attack aimed at returning Mosul could already be started in April or May 2015.
Mosul, second to the largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
“ In the months of the investigation, it is possible to be known,” stated the representative of the Party of Mike Pompeo, the Republic of Canasas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the United States Headquarter Headquarters has shared commanding information to reduce the threat of IHL in Iraq.
The Republicns have established a operational group when they learned that analysis had expressed concerns that the Islamic State disclosed were phalised.
In promoting the investigation, by the report published on Friday, the more developed data will be followed.
The main inspector of the Ministry of Defence is the main inspector of the Centre of Inspectors that have not been completed at the time of the investigation.
The representatives of the Democratic Party in the Palestinian Representatives of the United States Congress have published their own data, agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republic of Operational Group.
"In the year 2014 and 2015, Center has established a excessive evaluation procedure on the IHL and the Iraqi troops", states in the statement of the members of the Party of Adam B. Shif, the principal representative of the Democratic Party in the Committee.
This procedure, under the words of Shif, "depended on the outcome of the disclosure documents", has harmed the moral status of analysis and "insufficiently reflects expenditure".
However, Shif and the Democratics claim that the White House had not found evidence that the Century House had tried to blame analytics to shoot their arrests under "destined or political interpretation".
The preliminary results of the Congress investigation were presented on Monday The Daily Beast.
The New York Times last August reported an investigation of the main inspector Pentagon, open after the complaints of Centkong analysis.
Leader-Commissariat Patrick Evans, representative of Pentagon, said that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the report of the Assembly until the investigation of the main inspector continued.
But he said that “experts sometimes disappear in the views of the complex data process, and the Services and the Ministry of Defence welcome the healthy dialogue on these vital issues relating to national security”.
The results of the investigation are a question of whether the purposes of the American Bombers in Iraq and Syria are achieved (which is now more than the representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
However, the last year's statements have been considered whether President Obama may believe that the Central Commandment provides true evaluation of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other critical points.
The critics made by the Islamic State will repeat the controversies that were placed over ten years when the investigation analysis of Center Gregory Hucker wrote a research article in which he stated that the Administration of George Water Bush, because of many protesters, had supported a small number of armed forces in Iraq and did not think that it would be after the invasion of 2003.
Hucker also played a key role in the protest identified by the Islamic State.
Last year, according to the officials, the Hucker team concluded that, despite the public claims on return, oil aircrafts from the Islamic State did not cause a significant deterioration of the financial situation of the terrorism group because it had built temporary oil insurance to sell the black market.
However, opening was not distributed beyond the Central Command, as reported in the Times September.
The first commander of Centko, General Lloyd J. Ostin III, was criticized last year after witnesses in Senate, which many deputy viewed the extreme optimistic evaluation of war.
General Ostin went to the departure in April and was signed in the Hen Joseph L. in the Headquarter of the Headquarter.

Then, 2012, when it wasn't over her and her team partner.
The next year, Coeg Parnham, was appointed as a trainer, and it began to change.
"Cultural change, psychological change, physical training change," said Bam.
We did not have such productivity in London now.
We have completely changed our views.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the first half of the shipping game at a short distance.
India came to the game without a single victory in the tourism, but the team showed himself to the surprise of the shooting and maintained the amount of 1-0 until the end of the third period when Baam took the initiative in his hands.
She made a long walk with a layer down the left side of the field, then split into the midst and sent a smooth to the door, so the Americans gave the advantage of 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez added a final hole in the midst of the fourth period.
The winning was the first to the U.S. tournament of Jacky Briggs, who spended on one floor in each of the first three winners.
She's in the shooting.
Like Bam.
"We are in a good situation right now," Parnham said, but how good it depends on the outcome of Saturday Game.
Without the Olympic Game, "Dzen" basket
Whereever you were, it's Olimpiade.
The events in Rio-de-Janiro are not safe, and it is a better combination of conspiration and efforts.
It's like the olympic fire, and there's the horrible fake that is transferred from the cheese to the giant to the triatlonist.
You can't enable TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the cafe and don't listen to Simone Bails, Kate Ledeki or the angry between Michael Feliples and Chad de Chloe.
There's another Logan Duley.
Duley, the first part of the Olympic Games, a beauty with sweet snakes, could be among the remarks shown in the slope-times that speakers and advertising advertising roles, if he is a plumb, ginost, or even a fectalist.
But the 28-year-old Duly from the city of Lake Force in California is fighting for gold in the olympic coasts on the bathroom.
The Olympic fire does not see all the events similarly.
Besides the center, partly in the dark, there are the types of sports that are not commonly recognized: a gun from a plumatic gun, a shooting, a badminton and a thokowondo.
Brass will always be with us, the long time of his kingdom.
But if I have been allowed to protect your personal skin, let me take your attention to the modest smuggling of bathrooms.
Although bathrooms are an olimpy species since 2000, when they were playing in Sidney, they received so little recognition that many of my requested people were not aware that they were really related to sports in the past 16 years.
This may be regional inadequacy.
The United States wished and sent sports to shipping, they never winned bathrooms, and their sports did not go to the finish until 2012.
Chinese and Russians are generally shared with male rewards, and Chinese and Canadian women are women.
Dun Dun from China and Rouzi McClanan from Canada will protect their London gold meal this year.
But bathrooms have an autsyder sharm, in particular because they are rather associated with a circle college than with the Olympic games.
I have to recognize here that I'm not an expert, but just a landed enthusiastes.
They really have a comic capacity, the carcase of unfinished shoes, but also the extraction of guinnas and water shoes, two sport species which are mainly combined in themselves.
The word "batut" comes from the Spanish word "el trampoline", which means "trumpling for water rings".
The candidates are shocking on the guiant bathroom, flying nearly 30 feet [30 feet] in air, and have to fill a series of acrobatic tricks (turns, slows and salt) to the final landscape on the feet.
They are assessed by the implementation, complexity and the " time of flight " in accordance with the official Olympic Games.
Thirty-two sports from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will be in Rio.
The most distributed Olimpiade Kurs is first.
The applicants should go forward, faster, above and above, and above by gold, sometimes to the finish, and sometimes back and first, there by field.
They are not only trying to finish or older stone, but also to switch TV cameras, to another swimming swimming ride: a world or olympic recursor.
This is a deep temptation to be kind, worthy, even fanatic — and it is enough to make a swimming even the slaughter.
But I think it's a few of the games in my mind.
He's got a shooting shooter.
Batuist shipping up.
Move forward is not target.
He or she points out that it seems weak as a astronom, fly up, then down, and then without efforts again up.
And of course there is no competitive or difficulty in them, but there is no ridicule in all the programs to finish, no long-term thresholds, just a strange, extraordinary disappearance of time and degradation.
It's the closest to the telephone of the olympic species.
Women's qualifications, and then finish on Friday, transmission at Eastern European time; husbands in Saturday, also at the time.
NBC will transfer the finance within the daily programme, starting from 14:00 to both day.
The olympic sumaceration is expected to be a peaceful, beautiful moment that can easily be viewed in the whole sheep.
And if the growth of consciousness can only be achieved by a male sports and objection, as stated in the Wall Street Journal, recently suggested men from the United States, Duly is only waiting for their new excited fans.
Generation protests in Ethiopia, former United States Union
Year protesters in Ethiopia
The demonstrations required to political change in Ethiopia faced a angry opposition by the Government.
The witnesses say that the tens of protesters were deadly blessed during the police clamps.
Is Ethiopia actually on the grain of shock?
In the past decade, she was one of the most stabil African countries, the solid Union of West with the rapid development economy.
But in the past months, the anti-governmental protesters have shocked the country, distributing its territory in a growing number.
Only the last week, thousands of people went on the street to require radical political changes.
The Government ' s response to human rights was cruel.
The witnesses claimed that police officers had shot tens of unarmed demonstrators.
Video records from Protests, which are intended to be deleted at the end of the last year or at the beginning of this year, show that the security officers kill young people with balls when they put their hands to the wall.
The United Nations High Office on Human Rights now calls for a careful investigation.
"It was always difficult to keep this country away and will continue to be more difficult", said Rashid Abdi, head of the African Rog project in the international research group.
Ethiopia is a second African country after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by Western.
American military and intelligence services closely cooperate with ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and almost no country in Africa has received such support from the West.
Ethiopian economy is developing with impressive speed.
Her infrastructure has significantly improved — even a new reward travel in Addis Abbe.
And its streets are normally quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia was a picture of democracy - human rights organizations regularly mention government repressions - the opposition on the territory of the State was presumed by dissidents had actually been able to silence.
Many of them were sold, sentenced in prison, murdered or abandoned in the remote desert.
But that can change.
"If people are constantly able to give them any other options except to protest, the resurrection is up", said Seum Teshmae, the director of the university in Central Ethiopia.
All young people are protesting.
The generation is protesting.
The complaints are many, starting from the earth-use, financed by the government's power.
After a widely critical election in the past year, the Government and its unions have completely strengthened the opposition and now controlled 100 per cent of the Parliament.
At the same time, the tension around the border with Eritrea grows; the fight for this undefined, confronted border has led to hundreds of lives in June.
Analytics are afraid that separater groups who have been destroyed in the past few years, such as the Liberation Fund or the National Liberation Fund of Obama, may try to use the concern and transfer of arms.
Many factors explain why he has a painful feeling, a few years smiling in the depth of the soul, are now smiling.
First, it would seem to be completely unfair: smartphones.
Only in the past few years a large number of ethiopians have been able to share in social networks, since low smartphones have become common and internet services have been better.
Even when the Government closes access to Facebook and Twitter, as it is often happening, especially during protests, many people still find the opportunity to share through server proxys that hide where they are.
Many young ethiopians said that they were organized for protests.
Second, there are more solidarity between Ormo and Amhara, two major ethnic groups.
Ormo and Amhara are not natural unions.
Over the centuries, Amhara, from the best Christian high-east regions of Ethiopia, has prospered in policy and business, Ormo, which many of them are musulmans and live in lower areas.
But that's also changed.
"We will act at a single start", said Murata Gemeich, leader of Ormo.
The major protesters went in Amhara and Ormo.
Many of the Amhara and Ormoo feel that Ethiopia is injustly dominating members of the Ethiopia ethnic group that represents about 6 per cent of the population and controls military and discretional services, trade and policy.
The third reason for concern is the loss of Meles Zenaoui.
Meles, former leader of the Ethiopia Prime Minister of 17 years of age, engaged in the death of an unknown disease in 2012.
He was considered to be tactical, a man who could predict the danger.
Analytics argued that he had particularly identified the first signs of injury and used researchers to obtain data and reduce opposers.
“The current regime has no sense of meaning,” said Abdi, analysis of conflict situations.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalney, appeared there and took place with Melisa.
Unlike Melesa, which was the birth of the Tunisia region in the northern Ethiopia, Yalemariam, Southern.
Analytics say he does not use confidence in the security services controlled by Yougae.
Many are afraid that this would lead to further bloodprostitution.
The last time, Ethiopia had survived such concerns in 2005, after thousands of people protested against what analysis seemed to have been elected by the Government and then made results.
Many protesters were killed during the following repressions, although less than the last months were compared, and that period was relatively fast.
Development experts expressed appreciation to the leaders of Ethiopia for a daily development of infrastructure, such as a new trail trail and significant success in combating poverty.
But it is obvious that it has not stopped the growth of internal illness by the Government of Ethiopia.
And it takes a dangerous ethical form.
Last month, the protesters in Hongariya, the city of Amhara attacked the companies belonging to Tunisia, and the anti-Tyghurian hatred becomes a comprehensive number of social networks.
Analytics claim that the Protestants are the United States and other Western Unions in an unfair situation.
The American Government used Ethiopia as a base for unpilot ships over neighbouring Somalia, although recently declared that the base was closed.
From one part, it is clear that western wants to support democracy, but he does not want to lose its unstabile force in the region.
"And it will be hard to go over this pressed Canada," said Abdi.
Donald Tramp explains his statement that IHIL was founded by Obama, "sarpam"
Donald J. Tramp tried to forget the last conflict covering his predicted headquarter on Thursday, claiming that he was smiling several times this week that President Obama and Hillar Clinton were "building" of a terrorist group of Islamic State.
It explained new questions regarding the opinion of the candidate on the President of the Republic of the Republic of America.
It also set his Vice-Chairpersons who tried to protect him during the angry period because they had to explain the statements he probably did not mean.
He expressed this proposal on the midday night, Trump urged his approval on Thursday, repeating the interview that he really wanted to say that President and Clinton founded IHIL.
But in the afternoon in Twitter, on Friday, Tramp wrote that he was just shocking.
This post was a direct contrary to the approval made all day before Traamp claimed in several interviews that he was absolutely serious in his accusation.
When the Radio-Organist Hue Huit tried to help Trump to relieve the statement, he recalled that Obama wanted to destroy IGIL, the candidate at the position of the President of the Republican Party did not use the opportunity.
The last scandal was discovered when Trump tried to reorientate its economy on the background of the rail reduction.
Tramp and Clinton have been discussed with competitive issues about the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Tromp again tried to return to this subject.
And again, he warned that Clinton's plans would lead to tax increase, and said that she was sweet.
The trampo has used sarpeds as a correction.
At the end of July, after he urged the whole criticism, he almost expressed the idea that the Russians should cut the e-mail of Clinton later explained his comments, saying, "I'm swear."
This approach allows the Trumpus to go beyond the limit of the permitted in the political speech and his brothers to return if necessary.
"I think that's his way to test the communications between his worshipers, look at how they work, and then explain them in the other part, depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert on the language analysis of both candidates.
But I also think he's careful in his statements and knows that they're sufficiently dispatched to treat them differently.
Instead of shutting expressions for a wide electorate, Tramp has taken more legal tone in the past days, while his racing continues to fall.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Thursday, showed that Tramp enters Clinton with a large overflow in Northern Caroline, Virginia and Colorado and goes with it in Florida.
Although Tramp is generally trying to forgive the prostitutional things that he often condemns his critics in the wrong interpretation of his words and inconsistent of his humor feelings.
But as Trump was an object of higher attention in the last months of the President-Chairman's campaign, his sweet smilings were put to his faithful unions in unfair situation: it should be publicly supported by what kind of statements it would have been.
Rudolf W. Julian, former Mr. New York, who is one of the most famous Vice-Presidents of Trampa, has made serious efforts to protect the candidate in the interview given by the CNN on Friday.
"I think he said is an acceptable political comment," said Julian when he asked for the approval of Trampa that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
That is true that IGIL was almost an unknown small organization, and he called it an unrepresented threat, which was absolutely injustly, and that is why it happened, because he issued the army from Iraq.
The majority of the Mediterranean Republicans believed that the Obama Administration, in which Clinton was employed by the State Secretary, allowed IHL to disappear, since he was not grateful to control the situation in the Middle East.
Before the minute in Pennsylvania, Traamp continued to attack the media in Twitter for the discovery of each of his words and forecast.
He was aware of the "functional" television experts that tried to mention him, and said, "He's weak!"
Some democratics expressed the justice of Trampa as the most reaffirmed that it would not be paid to the Presidents.
Sometimes the extraordinary coffee returns to Greenpoint
The Verb coffee was a whispering, which was only a perfect place in Williamsberg, where it wasn't Wi-Fi, but gave a good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, it was removed from her place with the vitrine at the Bedford Avenue.
The Soup Sheri Magazine, which took the Verb Year 2014, is sell a mile in the cases form.
Local people pleaded it as the last loss of the updated city.
"New York is always changed, I know, but I can't believe that CBGB's dead, the hotel Chalsey is destroyed, and the Varb is now a shopping."
But some New York is constantly changed, he's up-to-date.
The born coffee "Werb" was opened in November last year in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original place.
The new "Werbe" has Wi-Fi and takes credit cards, but some of them remained the same staff and the same simple atmosphere.
Cafe is still good.
The new "Werba" chapter is Simon Rodriguez, an old official of the old coffee, who is the owner and the general manager at the new place.
He started working in Verbe in 2001 and was there until the end.
When one of the customers suggested that it was a new place, he said that it would be joyful.
Rodriguez, 36 years old, left a lot in the previous view.
"Werb" works with the same bagler diploma and buys the same model of coffee.
It has even been established by the old Verba.
But Rodriguez said he would also want to experiment.
He proposed new observance.
The sandwichs are presented in the menu, with becon, eggs and sweet, and are available in a swimming pocket of caps or a smell.
There's a guard from a bleeding quality.
The coffee doesn't get a drink anymore, but now they're preparing sweet sucks.
9 months later, Rodriguez said that he had focused on the unmarried flow of old permanent clients.
"A few former customers have also issued prices from Williamsberg," he shared.
One of the recent resurrections Rebecca Olivier was one of these customers.
Oliviera, 34 years old, lived in Williamsberg and often visited Warb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she was still in there.
After the Verba closed, she said she stopped drinking coffee at some time.
"I understood the coffee and the atmosphere put me in the Warbe," she said.
Now she's drinking a coffee again, even though in that day she ordered a coffee purchased, another news.
Tom Cental, another old customer, was dedicated to visit Verb since 2003.
He was in front of the work and ordered the same.
"In 15 minutes of the eighth, every day, as at hours, I came, and for me prepared my bag with a mass and with all the starts," he said.
Rodriguez made what he wanted to experiencing and introduce new observances in the menu.
Cental still makes a common order today, but he has ever changed something with the bicon, the egg or the bag with all starts.
Rodriguez said he wasn't on the dinner that the winter had ever had a old place.
Moreover, the Soup Sheri owners suggested to make a special milk for "Werba" using coffee coffee prepared as an ingest.
"I think we may agree on their proposal," said Rodriguez.
The permanent inhabitants of Greenpoint of Poland also loved this coffee.
One of these new clients moved the menu into the Poland language, and Rodriguez said that he plans to find a place for him to make his new neighbor feel wishful.
The new place has other benefits.
The local sugar point is planned to differ on the bottles and to sell the coffee prepared in a cold way.
There is a possibility that the coffee will join its neighbor building.
For many customers, the new Verb includes their favorite observances in the menu.
Joseph Whitt was a permanent client and told him he was killed by a pain when they closed.
When the coffee opened to a new place, Whitt said that I entered and commanded the coffee, he feeled like it returned home.
"When long I wanted to feel this aromatic," he admitted.
Depressive food of depression in "Pluto Trapey"
In March 1933, as soon as the Chairman's post, Franklin Delano Roosevelt would eat at the Olympic Office.
As a gurman, President Ruizell loved the Fifth Avenue, for example, the Fifth Avenue and the Mediterranean Capital Soup.
His menu was more modest on that day: sweet eggs in tomate soße, sweet powder and sweet powder.
"This was an act of culinary solidarity with people suffering," said Jane Gigelman.
Her husband Andrew Cow added: "It was also a message to the Americans about how to ask."
The couples living in Brooklin-Hites are food history specialists.
The last book of the Coua, "Lagu Po China", was dedicated to the Chinese kitchen in America, and Gigelman told the history of life in the coal apartment in the low East Side by eating in his book The 97 House on the French garden.
The new joint work of the "Please Trapey" which will be published in the Sunday of Harper is the history of American food in the Great Depression.
When they showed their own culinary solidarity, they met a dinner reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small shopping area in the Flatian Quartal, which works since 1929 in the Birdshaw Bay.
Giggelman, 54, assigned a slipper and a butterbow with oil shoes, and Cou, 57, took an indic, a cartone and a fruit smell.
When the reporter ordered a meat route, the couple read the appropriate shipping point for the discussion of the food at the Depression era.
"The rolets used a larger question," said Gingerman.
There was a swimming routine, a swimming routine, a bomb routine.
They were made from the main ingringant and milk products that allowed the ingredient to increase.
Imagine that you eat so much as you need for dinner.
Cou's been threatened.
"It's sure he was in a stone fat," he said.
In the years before the American Table Depressed, especially in the rural area, the Swedish table was represented.
Women's groups were prepared for farmer men, and the swimming swimming snake was set at breakfast, dinner and dinner.
The Americans have sent food to the hungers of Europe during the First World War, and the "Please Trapey" describes how the country has seen soon as the country has stopped being a nation.
"It was time when food became a central and unfair topic for the Americans," said Cou, explaining why he and his wife decided to write it.
The new budget ratio was so simple: remarkable observances, such as routines and safes, became the main food products; the insurance is " a good way to clarify food", noted Gingerman, because the shoes could hide in a deep soup shock.
The fresh fruit was replaced by more decoratives.
The meat has become the economicly distributed forest during many years of the former American food.
People were worried about strange shocks because energy and food values were more important than the skin and even the culinary sense.
In the study of the book includes receptives, Gigelman prepared the bloom of that epoch: a sweet squirrel fabric.
"This addition to the dinner table was not successful," said Cou.
Zegelman added, "This was very strange."
The skin oil is perfectly not going to the smell.
This was characterized for many household receptives.
As never before and ever since, household specialists, including Louis Stanley, head of the Federal Office of households from 1923 to 1943, have managed food addictions in the country.
Public receptives and articles in newspapers and magazines recommended women to become “budgetary constitutors” to accept calls and to convert the snake of loss spaghet with marble sights.
"Pluck Trapese" is the pitch of loved experiences historical facts.
Specifically, the reports of the Government's reactions to the hunger citizens, such as the position of President Gerbert Gubert, in the spirit of "the powers of the pigs".
It was publicly transferred by a simple farmery state of the Iwa State by its childhood, and was a million of people who had become.
"He liked the continental kitchen, for example, a fish with a sweet soup," said Cou.
He eats almost in a shocked table, shocking.
He was fantastically distracted from reality.
The President Rutzell could make the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not recommended to give him an example of his own desire.
As says in the book, Eleanor Roosevelt launched a economy that was not perfectly interested in the shooting, and that resulted in that the White House had "not only used the most unique food in Washington, but sometimes and even the most reversely prepared".
Many of the culinary receptions of the Depression era were forgotten when the country was back to the feet.
Their heritage is our continuing focus on calories and food, says Gigelman, and how science was used in the preparation of food.
The couples say that during the writing of the book, they have better understanded the nutrition of Zegelman’s mother — that she couldn’t eat, for example.
"It was seriously afraid of an uncomfortable relationship with food," said Coh.
Zegelman recalled: "He's fully seen people."
It was one unfortunate case with profiles.
When the torchs in Eisenberg's past, they and Cou got the department that prepared the house: a department from a sweetheart that President Ruizell eat at the dinner.
"This is called a sweet smell," said Gigelman, adding that it was distributed to give modest brood receptors.
It was not only bleeding, but also little swimming, swimming, water, and swimming.
All of them were loaded a lie, sweet, sweet, slightly.
It was amazing.
Two times, they requested an additive.
He said to her wife, as a reliable budget provider, "It wouldn't be hindered by no ruling Greek orbits here."

Gilead company will pay costs for law enforcement services during the discussion of the patent of Hepatite C with the Markk company
The company of Gilead Sciences Inc has the right to repay the costs of law entitled to the case of the patent for Hepatitis C with the producer of the Merck & Co Inc, decided to the Federal Environment Court.
In June, Gilead company was released from $200 million for violation of two market company patents with regard to the drugs of Gilead companies, sales leaders, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the American Court found a number of violations from the market company, including false convictions and other non-ethics.
In the case of the court in the fourth court of the US Federal Environment Court, Beth Lebson Friman said that Gilead company had the right to repay the expenditure carried out during the sampling.
Merck is trying to administer Gilead, which is a new generation of drugs from hepatitis C, which can cause more than 90 per cent of patients with piracy disease.
In 2013, when the Gilead company and Merck gave one another to the court, he declared their rights to the labour work that was based on a confoxuvior, an active anti-mediterranean of Gilead company.

Clinton paid $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of federal tax rates
Hillary Clinton has published its tax statements for 2015, which showed that the candidates to the President of the Democratic Party and her husband had $10.75 million income and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent in this year.
In 2015, Clinton received $1 million in the Clinton Fund, mainly the former President Bill Clinton received about $5,3 million in the form of expenditure soldiers, and the former government secretariat declared the income of $3 million from Simon & Schuster for its book of residence in the State Department.
The Potential Vice-President, United States Senator Tym Keen of Virginia, together with his wife, Anna Holton, has made tax statements for 10 years.
In 2015, they paid the effective federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
“Hillery Clinton and Tim Keen continue to establish the financial transparency standards,” said the advisor of the predicted stage of Clinton Jennifer Palmier.
In full contradiction, Donald Trump is hidden by details and violates its last promises to promote its tax declarations.
This is the general case for candidates to the President of the United States to publish their tax statements, although the law of them does not require.
The New York businessman Trump and his lawyers called a verification of the State Tax Service as a reason for his refusal to promote their tax statements.
"Our path," wrote in Twitter the predicted stage of Klinton Yan Sams, as a matter of the declaration of the candidate from the democratic party.
In Friday, the Special Adviser Michael Coan said the CNN would not allow Trampo to leave them before the verification was completed.
The Trempa Critics, including the candidate to the President of the Republic of the Republic of 2012, Mr. Romney and other Republicn meetings, said that he refused to demand his status, his welfare contributions, his business operations and other links, including Russia.
Clinton was dismissed for this issue, and on Thursday, a online video was issued, where the main place was deleted to the Republicns who avoided Trampa to generate tax accountability.
On Thursday, she addressed this issue during the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what everyone did without the exception of the candidates to the Presidents for decades: to publish its tax statements," she said to be gathered.
The Political Journal reported that Traamp had not paid any or almost no tax in the 1990s, and New York Times' business adviser had quoted many tax lawyers and buggers that may still remain in the case.
The federal taxes were a object of conflict on the presidential elections.
Clinton supported the rules referred to by a billion investor, Warren Baffitta, which would ensure that those receiving more than one million dollars would pay tax rate at least 30 per cent.
The Chairman Barak Obama also supported the proposal.
At the meeting of Clinton last week in Omaha, in the Nebraska State, Baffitt, whose Conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based there, proposed to meet and exchange tax declarations.
Baffittet said he's also under the IRS control, and that Tramp was scared not tax collection agency, but electors.
The Clinton Previous headquarters has generated tax declarations until 2007.
Clintons, who are now living in Chappaku, New York, have paid the average federal tax rate of about 32 per cent from 2007 to 2014 and the effective co-acquire tax rate of about 40.5 per cent.
The Clinton Declaration for 2015 showed that only $100 of their revenue was paid.
Their main investment was an inadequate index fund, and the Clinton stated that the capital was $109,000.

Conservation of Chile and Fairverks increases the protection of dance slopes
The trafficking in the environment in Tanzania uses an untraditional way to prevent the sleeves to swim into the population items — they slow the preserves filled with a swimming chile.
The method was effective, and the organization of Honeyguide Foundation, which had been headed over this idea for a few years, together with the American Nature Protection Committee, has taken its promotion by training volunteers in northern Tanzania to use the non-weapon-weapon-weapon-weapon-fighted steps to protect their homes and visits, without prejudice to animals.
Many of them used cops to protect themselves.
Thursday, the World Day of the Sloans, dedicated to the protection of animals.
"When we develop instruments ..., we look at the change in the relationship within these communities, because they are much more convinced that they will not be able to put shoes on their fields without caused harm," said the executive director Honeyguide Damien Bell.
The first two steps are in the shift of the fake before the slopes of the slope and the signals with the corner.
If it couldn't be delayed, they're going to cut the name of the "that."
The cheese of the e - mail is shocked with the boy in the preserve, and the end is covered, but the fleet is only outside.
When the swimming swimming snake is shocked with a smooth shoe, a small powder slowed in the air.
One dunning is normally enough to turn the ring into the other side.
The main measuring is a launching device that shoots Roman floors in the air by making soft, light explosion.
In Turkey, 32 Turkish diplomates have not yet returned to that year, who left the country after the trial of torment in July.
This was the head of the MID Turquia Mevlut Chauschöl in contact with local journalists.
At the first stage, we called 208 officers to continue to work in the center.
32 persons without objective reasons and explications have not returned", said the head of the Turkish external state.
Let us recall that in July the attempt of public shift has occurred in Turkey.
The Governments of the country have officially stated that the detention of more than six thousand people had been detained, among which the military duties of the higher and medium-sized link.
As a result of the trials of the slaughter, Turkish data of 290 people died.
The Jewish register closely discovered the Berlin hotel for the removal of the Israeli phone code on the Arab "Probe" channel, reported the RT News channel
The French director of the Jewish origin launched a scandal in the media, discovering that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin is not in the list of the phone codes of Israel, and the servants are referring to "prosections" from the Arab clients.
Crow Lanzman, author of a documentary film on Holocaust Shaw, expressed his gratitude by Kempinski Bristol in Berlin, wrote an open letter in German FAZ media.
During his recent stay in the Lanzman hotel, Israel tried to find the phone codes provided by the hotel.
However, the country was not mentioned among the States where it could be called directly from the room.
How could it happen that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of New Germany, Israel was excluded and eliminated?
Lanceman wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol provides the opportunity to take Israel through its own phone service center.
In searching for the explanation of the register, the question was addressed to the housing administration.
The answer he received there, as Lanzman said, "shocked him."
Clark's hotel said that this measure was "decided by the Kempinski network leadership."
The point, standing on this step, called the wrath of the regainer.
“The majority of our Arab guests, and they needed Israel's code to be removed,” said Lanzman, the hotel servant.
Israel's embassy in Germany Jacob Hadas-Handelsman called a case of “terrorized struggle”, reports the Southdeutsche Journal.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's actually a terrible shock.
What happened in Germany, and that is, in this network of hotels, there is still a larger struggle.
I don't need to explain here.
We hope that the hotel will make the right conclusions," said the official.
The situation called a small resonance in the Internet; people called it scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski hotel was simply "going on the subject" in the prescribed Arab clients' requirements.
"It would be shocked," said in the other floor where it was indicated that the hotel situated on the glorious Kurfurstendamm Street is close to the synagogue.
The El Spiegel newspaper reported that the hotel itself was slowly in place of any accused accused.
“There was no direct order to include Israel in a fast list,” quotes the representative of the Kempinski newspaper of Suddeutsche Journal.
She adds that code is now added.
The police uses smooth gas and resin bottles against Brazilian protesting students
The students gathered the police in the Brazilian city San Paulo, on Thursday, when they were gathered to protest against government reforms of public education.
The police used smooth gas and rain bombs against protesters.
The degree began when police officers tried to shoot students, resulting in the use of rain bombs and waste gas.
A number of hundreds of students participated in the demonstration to express their concerns on plans.
In accordance with the proposals of the Governor of the State of San Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, almost 100 public schools will be closed, and 3000,000 students will be redistributed to seen money.
Some protest participants could have been seen in writing on the walls of graphics that were aimed against the temporary execution of President Michael Theater's responsibilities.
The last protest took place only a few days after the protesters were on the street to support the distracted President, Dymo Ruseph, when Senator of the country proclaimed for its inscription.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71 per cent, reports the RT Business port
The decrease of trade sanctions between Moscow and Teheran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the previous year, as the Russian Ambassador in Iran in Jagaryan.
As international sanctions against Iran have been deleted, Russian companys have seen an interest in conducting business in the country, he said the ambassador.
Russian companies are re-linked with Iran, and new companies are ready to get market access.
Of course, the further enlargement of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,” said Jagaryan.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016 the trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 and was $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports in Iran increased 91.5 per cent and up to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased 16 per cent, up to $158 million.
The increase in trade has been achieved through machinery, land vehicles and weapons,” said the police.
Jagaryen also predicts that Russia is visiting the recursive number of Iranian tourists in this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic representative in Iran issued about 350,000 Visa, mainly tourists and citizens of Iran.
Furthermore, Iran first entered the number of tourists visiting Russia to the stream of 20 countries.
It can be said with confidence that the last year's refund of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be killed,” said he.
At the same time, relatively a few Russians visit Iran, which hopes that a soldier will change.
"I personally recommend to visit the city of Isfahan, Shiris and Iron, in which the memories of ancient Persia civilization are in good condition," he said.
The State continues to shut up the hikes in the defence-industrial complex.
The "Sistematic Incompletion" of the Congress General Almas Antheus, "Audience Exemption" and "Deliveration of Confidence".
In the nearest three years, the NGO manager was appointed by Gennadei Benders.
Only Friendly Relief information appeared in the night and did not call a wide media resonance.
What should such silence be explained in the conditions of enlargement of the army?
Indeed, the RF leadership does not want to distribute any hearing or negative proposals in the public environment.
This reaffirms that there are numerous problems in the defence-industrial complex (APC) and the State does not want to attach its increased attention to society.
The elimination of the disadvantages is, of course, the important events in the area.
"Almas" is the main company of the concert that specializes the production of sea- and land-land-based tanks (COD).
Actually, Almas has work on the establishment of CRC Poliment Reedot and Morpheus, which are planned to establish new roots, frozens, smilings and clashes.
The founder of the Military Russian, Dmitri Cornev, believes that the release of the slow-scale of the projects was expelled.
This version is the most logical.
For example, the development of Morfeia began in 2007, and the entry was predicted in 2013.
The " Roadcast policy " should be the main system of OMS on the new IMF ships.
For the information I receive, no tests have been made for a few years.
The truth I can judge is that there's no unique Almaza, said Cornev.
The expert is afraid that the delay of the exploitation input may also occur with the CCD "S-500".
Experience-building work has not yet been completed, but in 2016 the first complexs must be in the army.
In the Minoboron, " work is planned and all will be completed in the deadlines " , although the State has recognized the existing problems with the development of P-500 in 2014.
It is difficult to evaluate the professional quality of Nestradov, guided by Almazuma since 2011.
Cornee stated that project ruptures may be both the cause of freeship.
He believed that in recent years, it was extremely difficult to get information on internal processes in the COP and undertakings plans.
The section has received long-term orders for tens of thousands of rubbers, and large money, as it is known, love the silence.
In general, the director of defence companies include posts on their own desire, on the contract of the parties or in another work.
In that case, the elimination has not been received publicly, or not.
This emphasizes the fact that Almaza's leader may have been a strict structural and resisted to the above-based "reactors".
As a result, the State is not intended to be peaceful with such a manner.
The shareholders will defeat those who prefer to oppose the Minoboron installations and do not perform the tasks laid down.
At the same time, RF leadership is trying to punish the slaughtered managers (the maquination of the Star).
A higher attention to the sector is the President.
Vladimir Putin calls on the Military Industry Commission and regularly held meetings dedicated to the transition.
Kriml protects several COP Administrators, trying to have a loyal composition of directors, which will be carried out above.
This is a far unfair policy, but it has not been the absence of corruption and the absence of normal competitiveness in the COP other instruments in the State.
The situation in the defence, of course, is not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical situation encourages Kremell as soon as possible in order of armed forces.
In parallel with the "purpose" Administrators in the COP, RF leadership has taken successful steps to enhance the Russian military professionalism.
The army's headquarters acquired a new quality with the seat of the Minister of Defence of Sergey Shaugu.
It is the impression that the President has taken on the weapon the famous speaker "Peace is ready to war".
During the cold war, the USSR military force and the nuclear party reached in the 1970s have brought to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which strengthened the Moscow influence area on the continent.
In all lacks of bipolar system, she worked effectively.
The absence of war in the European Continent and about the stability situation in the Middle East.
Tradition of “winners” in the cold war was finally enhanced by international terrorism.
After a series of terrorists in Europe and the United States in the civilized world, I hope there was no peaceful cloud.
Despite the general disaster, the West refuses to talk to Russia at the same level.
In such conditions, the only fleet and army of our country remains.
The strengthening of military power allows Moscow to remain more effective for the national interests and to go into the new parts of the world policy.
The Skotlandian Calum Skinner spends on the finish line, resulting in the shipping gold of the British
Scotland, Calum Skinner, was a triumph in a man's bicycle team at Rio last night, resulting in which the team triumph was protected from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old borner of Glasgo was the most powerful of his cousin, Sir Chris Hoy, who had made his own, and the young man was honoured in his history, spending on the final line to escape the victory of the Favorite team from New Zealand.
Britain declared the right to an unexpected victory four years ago, wining, when he declared the right to five of its six Olympic gold meals.
And they repeated the trick, since they were modestly finished in the sixth Mart World Championship in London, despite the end of the carriage since then.
The question between Peking and London was replaced by a member of James Staff.
They did the same time when Hindes appeared.
He also created a whiteness that Kean Emmadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Scinner was a man who held the British trains, seeing the capacity in Skotland, which is now being implemented.
Hendes, Kenny, a champion with Hoy four years ago, and Scinner set the Olimpiade refund for qualification, but the standards were overlooked in the first round of New Zealand.
And the British trio wins the duel for gold.
Hindes was exactly behind his circle, but Kenny shocked the team forward, and Skyner supported.
The change of the strategy was a larger part of the reform where Hindez went to a greater transfer to Kenny and, in particular, to Skinner keep the time.
He looked at his place as an invitated BBC expert and took the view of Skyner, Kenny and Hindes when they entered the beach.
23-year-old Scinner from Glasgo said, "This is a simple comparison."
I'm here to make everything possible and make my own name.
We set the Olimpiade Record in the Final and win the Champions of the world.
That was incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After the triumph in London in 2012, Kenney and Hoy acknowledged Hindes to be a train after an unexpected age.
He later refused to comment, and there was no way to appeal from the Great Britain competitors.
There was no question at this time in the greatest victory.
He said, "I felt like in London, with all the flames of Britain on the court."
We've all met the team in the last three months.
We have played in so many of the world's name, that the oil was just awesome.
This is one event, one gold medal for the country who wins seven of 10 named hole in Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of progress made in the past five months, the wheel will wait for five successful days.
With the demonstrated Kenny, it is not possible to imagine how he repeats the Hoya ship, wining three olympic gold meals in one game.
It would be possible to see how Kenny, a 12 - year - old boy of Hoy, was also born 23 March (the sacred date in the British sport, which is also the day of the birth of Steve Redgreev, Mofarha and Roger Bannister), has reached its account to six gold meal and one silver.
That would be like Hoya.
The next time Kenny is in the snake that begins today and has been shocked for three days.
28-year-old from Bolton said, "I just like that now.
The commands are always the best.
You're coming to win your friends.
A little one to win one if honestly.
He said, "If he wins two other gold meal, he must get the market."
It was the only day of the medal playing, but it was the following good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Cranes, Steven Berk and Owen Dull are qualified for the fastest four-kilometer command chair.
They finished at 3:51,943.
The world refund established for the winning of gold in London in 2012 is 3.5.659.
The first round and final (10:42) are held today, on the second day of the event where Wilgins will be exactly in the centre of attention.
He had a debate with the Commissioners last night referred to a qualified train when the officials needed to measure his weight.
In the relevant event, which is renewed and completed tomorrow, Laura Trettot, Joanna Roysel Shand, Ellior Barker and Kate Archibald, showed at 4:13.260.
The Great Britain command was trusted in the powerful bicycle team to acquire the Olympic Games in the average period and pay a number of meals.
After the real exceptional demonstrations of full overcome in Beijing and London, the expectations were slowed in a progressive preparation for Rio.
The second plan was the dramas, not the last time, with the head of Shane Satton's technical position in April, because of the accused of sexism and detection, and the exits of large figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, on the basis of the first weekend, however, it seems to be the legendary of the glory of Britain to reach the top at the right time, maybe again again.
Increased português Metallurgic Industry threatened by the distortion of electrical contracts
The português Aluminium in Victoria, as well as the workplaces of hundreds of workers, are threatened by the fact that the electricity company that uses the company, according to one of the owners of the company, will be planned to switch the delivery contract: it is planned that all delivery contracts will be switched.
This step is the result of the decision adopted by the Government of Victoria this year not to extend subsidies granted to support the functioning of the plant.
The fixed subsidy for 20 years expires in November.
To 2.000 workplaces may be threatened by the Alcoa company in Portugal.
The total of 2.000 workplaces, directly and indirectly, may be in the risk zone as a result of any closure.
Additional outcomes may also be, as the metalurgical plant requires about 10 per cent of all the electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed a metalurgical company in Point Henry, which led to the closure of electricity in English last year.
Portugal Metallurgic Company Alcoa loses money and risks closing.
These actions have resulted in the consideration of the future industry that has continued a few years, in particular because of the strong positions of the Australian dollar, and later, because of the prices for the production of the company.
The AGL company, who enjoys a large electricity plant with Loy Yang A, its electricity station in Latvia Valli, reported that the other three owners would also take steps to deal with the treaty.
The control share of the company belongs to a joint short-term company of Alcoa and Alumina, and the Chinese CITIC and the Japanese company Marubini Corp belong to smaller parts.
" The AGL committee expects that the Portland object will continue to work, namely, that the physical electricity demand from the metalurgy plant would not stop", said it.
According to the AGL company, the contracts mentioned are such as the 'hedged contracts' which should be entered into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month disappearance period, so they actually ended in 2017.
"In line, AGL company still expects that these contracts will bring their income in the financial year 2017", said the electronic company.
Whatever the potential impact of the AGL company has been income from 2018 to the financial year is limited to a strong feed market for optical electricity prices.
The AGL company stated that the amount of contracts had already been reduced in its account of $187 million in terms of "twenty disbursement".
According to the company of Alcoa, the decision to trade contracts "is not influenced by Alcoa's ability to manage metallurgical undertakings or to provide electricity to the metalurgical industry."
The American company stated that, in 2010, Loy Yang's company had a 20-year contract that had to enter into force in November this year, but she still had to explain why it had defeated the contract.
Analytics were concerned about the possible closure of the Portugal Metallurgic Industry in Victoria, as well as of the Tomago industry along with Newcastle, because of the unpleasant economic situation in the area.
As a result of analytics previously, AGL’s exploitation service chief Steven Mickelsen said that Portugal uses about 600 megawatts annually and Thomas was about 900 megavates.
If these two companies go from the market, there will be a significant reduction in the market demand [electronics].
For us it will be bad for the producer," he said.
Not only a reality-shale star to Kardashian, Kendal on the box of the September Vogue
Kendal Jenner, 20 years of age, model and fourth daughter, Kardashian-Denner, the mother-manager of Chris, appeared at a fellow September of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendal, who was the face of the Estee Lauder burden, has reported this news in the outcome in Instagram on Friday.
"I was in the room together with my favorite people, I looked at this box and smelled," wrote Kendal.
The news on the board was awesome (or just in the spirit of the Family of Cardashian?), prepared by the reality-video, where the entire family of Kardachian-Janner (deboshir Rob and Katelin, also joined with him the most loved grand-master of the Show-Biznes, the producer of the Cardashian Family), forgotten the appearance of the sisters on the board, and at the end of the classical tour: they planned the evening of the Kardashian family.
This is the standard surrounding line of almost all the episodes of children's television shows dedicated birthdays (Skirre expressed: "Do you think we forgot about you?", with the honestity of a multiplex crystal from the 8th morning, but Chris had to be necessary that this glory could be achieved as well as other girls.
Because with this episode dedicated to the September Vogue, we were uncertainly in the new era of the Cardashian show.
Let the old sister Kendal Kim gets on the board of Vogue before (he came to her with her husband Cannie Westom in April 2014), but the seventeenth magazine box is its own achievement.
The September is the most sales issue of Vogue for year.
It seems likely to the giftal publication than the model magazine, it is a large number of advertisers (as reported by the Fashionista port, 615 pages of the last year of the 832-strategic publication).
The news about a star on his board is expected that in the last two years the pictures of the magazine have been covered to an official anonymous.
The number of previous women cast on the floor includes Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In the past few years, it is obviously that there were more "renocentances that work models" than "models that are famous".
The Laureat of Oscar and the face of Dior Jennifer Lawrens was presented at the board in 2013, after the year after the prize of Ledi Gague was gone.
But even in the poor case, if Jenner, whose magazine describes the model of his generation, is in the first category, it is in a bad company.
These representations are not the parents of famous people, the reality-show stars or modern children who know how to make a good video in Snaapchat (which Jenner wants to fall in all these categories).
These are truly talentous women who are in the industry of disappearance.
For the Bayonse last year, this year was one of the most lucky carrières in relation to the Lemonade album.
Of course, it's not all happy to get the success of Jenner.
Gerner's situation in the world of mode, as her last shoes of television reality show, had always been shocked.
In June, one of the first models of Victoria's Secret Stefany Seamor discovered Jenner and her colleague, Jilly Hadd, called them "the moments."
These settings have again been broken after Jener's news on Vogue's board.
But it doesn't mean to smell in gratitude.
Kendal Jenner's headquarters of the Vogue.
It is a supermodell in all the meanings of that word.
She's defiant for Mark Jacobs.
She's gonna sell you a tonic krom from Estee Lauder.
She, yes and all her sisters, sell your photos in the same applications available for pay signature.
She sells his own photos of the LOVE magazine, Sindy Crowford.
And in a free time, maybe still seeing her sister Cortney and her children, she participates in the television reality.
Public legal centres refused 1600,000 people per year
Each year, more than 1600,000 defended representatives reject the service of the public legal centres, as this sector is prepared for the effect that will provide further financing for and as long as it has been done.
In Quinsland, three of five people, in the main part, old, immigrants, unprotected works, victims of violence, persons who have no possibility to combat unfair ownership, and so on, have already been rejected by trying to obtain free legal assistance and representatives.
The public legal services that are already under the possibilities are prepared for further reduction.
Since June next year, these legal centres should lose more than 30 per cent of federal funding.
The Director of the Social Legal Centres of Quinsland James Farrell said that, according to the recent records of the National Laws Association, thousands have already been rejected each year.
Farrell said that if the federal government decision was not cancelled, the situation would only be worse.
" The legal centres of Queensland are constantly funded, which means that thousands of people are rejected in their vital lively important services, " said he.
Persons from violence, persons with uncontrolled and distorsive debts, families who have divorced unlawful work - all of these people have legal problems, and this shows that they cannot receive assistance that they need.
The Federal Government will retain financing for 30 per cent since June 2017, which means that thousands of protected people of Quinsland will be forced to address complex legal issues without assistance.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Senator Quinsland George Brandis to immediately decline these reductions in the financing so that people can receive necessary assistance when they face legal problems.
In the past year, the Government fulfiled its commitment to fund free legal assistance to the average country indicator.
It has now been time to focus on the needs of public legal centres and communities, their customers, and the Government of the Palestinian Government to take place in this important work.

Britain should be sent into the necessary ring of the olimpholic spirit and expanding Hittro
Heatron will also provide rebuilding and prosperity not only in our coastal population points and in the whole of London but also in the whole country.
As I think, this was the great advantage of Hytro, as it was with London 2012, where we made all our efforts to make our people and regions benefit from the game.
The Olympic Games benefited greatly for Strategy and Eastern.
And we're doing this again, creating the possibilities for local people and the company close to Hittro.
Only for our local populations, we will create 100,000 new shops, 400,000 new jobs and put the end of young unemployment around the airport.
As was before London 2012, those who think that Hittro's challenge is too large.
They told me that Britain will never be ready to the Olimpiade games, and that we are in a difficult situation of world airline.
Sceptics were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong with Hittro.
There are always obstacles to survive, but Hetro responds to any question raised on it.
Like the Olympic Game, it's a infrastructure project for most, not only for a circle.
Advancement is the possibility to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion feet of economic growth, remaining a heritage and employment around the airport, as well as throughout the United Kingdom.
We have a nice team in Hitro, which entered the 11 billion infrastructure investment schedule at the time and within the budget, from T5, the best terminal chosen for the airport five years, to T2, built in the middle of the two most busy flights in the world.
Now they are ready to ensure the third aircraft field, confirmed by 16 billion feet of private investment.
The Olympic Games in London in 2012 was a great success for Britain, and I am sure that Hittro will also be expanded.
It was time for us to send the Olympic spirit into the necessary ring and enhance Hittro, to ensure our trade future and to create a heritage of opportunities and employment that Britain could be honourable.
Lord Paul Dayton is Chairman of the Hetro Council and former Trade Atlashee of the Championship
Adblock Plus, Facebook plays in a "meek" on the issue of public locking
For enterprises who pay money on the Internet regulations, the attempt to purchase the program for the locking of the advertising is a game in a "cook-cook", as one of the company who creates such a programing assurance.
On Thursday, literally after a couple of days after Facebook announced that the advertising blocks would be blocked on its website version, Adblock Plus published a blog record that users could update their program filters to block the public again in social network.
On Monday, the Facebook declared that the website's exact version changes the breakdown around its advertising to make the publishers more difficult to recognise what parts of the newspapers are.
But Adblock now states that he can get a new code.
In its publication, the representative of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "a kind of counter-related struggle between the public blockers community with an open source code and those who try to take it is continued since the discovering of the public blocking" and that Facebook may submit its own decision in the nearby time.
The fact that the largest social network has entered in the world is clearly recognizing how large it has become the blocking of the advertising for the industry.
About 200 million people have been using public blocks, according to the last year study of Pagefair and Adobe, and almost four times more than those used in 2013.
In view of 1,3 billion daily active users who are on the Facebook via mobile devices, the mobile advertising now represents 84 per cent of the Facebook income from the advertising.
However, the company is intended for advertising publishers on the current version, as mobile publishers are inefficace in mobile Facebook applications for social network and Instagram, as the representative said.
However, the advertising in the same version represents a sufficient article to make Facebook a valuable step of investment.
The Facebook also announced that it would be updated by its "regulated preference" tool to provide more control on how the advertising has been subjected to them.
On Friday, Facebook stated that Adblock's new filters were worried, as they will also block some unjustable content on the website.
"This will not be a positive experience for people, and we plan to solve this problem," said the representative of the Facebook in an official electronic letter.
Advertising blocks are a cruel tool, so we focused on the creation of instruments such as Declaration preferences to deliver control into people's hands.
Women moved to Switzerland's Autostrate to the episode of apparent self-assault
The victim stood on the bus in the middle of the night.
The police calls upon witnesses after the woman moved several vehicles to the road early on Thursday morning to a clear suicide attempt.
The university occurred at A1 next to the sea in the Canton A immediately after midnight on Thursday.
The woman slowed on the road in the darkness of the disappointment and shooted several vehicles, reported to the police in a statement.
A number of vehicles, including a car, were slaughtered by the Switzerlandn woman in the age of 49.
She died in the place.
Some involved drivers have already been investigated, but some have not yet been established, reporting the police that calls them and someone else who was a witness.
A criminal case was sentenced, a "logical" step in such a situation, declared a lawyer Jill Hoffstetter Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it should still be cleared whether some of the engaged drivers will be pronounced.
Could it be possible to avoid a shock?
That's what the prosecutor should determine,” said Hoffstettter.
Two other similar cases in the past five years are allowed to suggest that drivers will not be recognized responsiblely.
Each case, both of whom a person goes in the dark road, has been condemned that automobilists can not wait for an accidental meeting on the road in the middle of the night, reports the newspaper.
Last year, the officer was justified by the cause of the death of uncertainty, after it attacked and killed a man who was on the A1 at Piern at the night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim of drink and lost awareness on the road, heard the court.
The Court found that a police woman, who responded to the extreme calls, managed the vehicle by a means that was found, and that the existence of a man on the road was " perfectly exclusive and unpredicted situation", said the judge.
Someone who owns information on the event on the Moon is to call at the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Climate model NASA: Vienna was ever known
Venezuela may have ever been known according to the estimates of the new NASA climate model.
Scientists from the Soviet Institute of Space Studies have developed a model for the study of Vienna's past study, using tools and algorithms similar to climateologists.
The model was developed to determine whether Vienna could, with its sweet surface and the atmosphere transferred by carbon gas, ever existing conditions such as the earth.
The scientists predicted that the small speed of Venice’s return was explained by its fleshly atmosphere.
However, the last model states that Venebra could probably have a decreased atmosphere like the earth, and still slowly turn.
The model also examined the fuel of Vienna's early.
On the planet, it is likely that there were more surprising regions than the Earth, but there was a time enough water and enough geographical change in order to create conditions for life and to prevent rapid elimination.
Rane Vener also benefited the sun, which was 30 per cent of the smoke.
“ According to the GISS model, the long-term return of Venice submits it to the daily side of the sun almost two months per month,” explained the report of an scientist from GISS Anne Del Henio.
This increases the surface of the planet and produces rain that creates a slight slee that operates as a zone which protects the surface of the planet from the substantial part of the sunwarming.
The results are the medium climate temperatures that, as a surprisely, at several degrees more cold than in our day on Earth.
The model shows the history of Vienna, similar to development that previously predicted planet researchers.
Despite the possibility of having been contained by Venear, it has affected too large jar and ultraviolet elimination during a few billion years.
Her oceans have been defeated, and its water pair was survived with ultraviolet extraction.
When her hydrocarbon flying, it remained only a fleshly atmosphere from carbon gas with the mortal park effect — that is, Venear, which we know today.
Researchers have shared the results of their new climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters magazine.
Patrick Roy leaves Abalanche's train team
Patrick Roy left the train post and the vice-President of the Colorado Avalanche on Friday, referring to the lack of influence during the decision-making process.
The Executive Vice-President / Chief Kolorado Commander Joe Sack confirmed the news and noted that the club will start looking for a new train immediately.
"But over the past three years, I have performed my responsibility for the main training and the Chairman of the Colarado Avalanche of the Colorado Abalanche with energy, stress and determination," said the 50-year-old Roy in the statement.
During the summer, I have long thought about how I could improve the team to bring her the necessary depth and take it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this goal, the vision of the training and the vice-President of the Hooky activities must be perfectly compatible with the vision of the organization.
He should also have the right to vote when making decisions affecting the work of the team.
These conditions are not implemented at this time.
Sake, who took Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," said Sack.
We appreciate everything he did for our organization, and we want him to be successful in the future.
Roy became the prize of Jack Adams Award as the best liga trainer during its first session with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014.
He brought a club to 112 views and wins in Central Division, but Colombia was disrupted by Minnesota in the first round of the Offs and was played in the past two years.
The Avanche team announced assessment of 39-39-4 at the 2015-2016 session, and at five points the Wild team was abandoned in the fighting of the second valuable journey to participate in the Western Conference.
Roy wins four Stanley Cub, two from Montreal Canadiens and Abalanche.
North Sea ocean neighbors renew negotiations and prepare for availability
Workshops on the payment of oilers in the North Sea have been suspended, and all the parts of the debate start to the new negotiations have reported the leading representatives of the parties.
The winners against the oil company Wood Group were cooperatively organized on platforms in the North Sea, which were conducted by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group and Unions and RMT may confirm that we agreed to renew the negotiations for the authorisation of existing disputes,” states the joint statement.
We will hold a few meetings over the next few weeks, starting from the beginning of the next week to consider a quiet view.
Professionals reported that their recent action, which was the first than 25 years of age, was addressed to the potential reduction of payments to 30 per cent.
In this year, Wood Group has reduced the rates paid by contract officers working in the North Sea for about 9 per cent because of negative market pressure.
The reduction of taxes from the company has occurred in 2014 after 10 per cent of the rates for contract officials working on the beach.
According to the company, additional reductions will give it the space necessary to overcome the market fall.
She has decreased thousands of people and announced plans to stop oil activities in countries up to 10, as it rationalizes its activities as a result of the UK energy company.
Energy companies are pressured by the decreased prices of non-reserved oil: the economic situation was worse because of the decision to get out of the European Union adopted in June by the United Kingdom.
The Skotland Parliament, Dave Anderson, met with professional leaders this week to discuss one of the largest working conflicts in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea said that it was vitally necessary for the regional economy.
"In the North Sea, yeah and throughout the country, we need an economy that would work for most, not only for some," he said in the statement.
Mining $1.4 billion for new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, with a average amount of $7 billion for the past five years.
Kepler measures the speed of the sterling of the Plyed
The last mission of the Space Telescope Kepler helped astronoms to collect the most complete directory of the slope of the sleeves in the collection of Praids.
New data help the astronoms to understand why the stars are converted to different speeds, as well as the return periods are focused on the development of the planet.
"We hope that comparing our results to other star collections, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass, its age and even the history of its sun system," reported in the press of Louis Ribal, a Scientist of the Inflation Centre and analysis at the California Technology Institute.
The collection of Plaid is in 445 light years from the Earth.
Many of the stars in the sculpture are now only reached by shocks, which were born about 125 million years ago.
They're angry as fast as they're never going to.
In their slow speeds, these growing stars select large numbers of star winds.
The winds switch around the magnetic stars, and the stars are on the stars of a shock.
As the stars are old, its shift speed begins to late.
Kepler measures the speed of turning each star, over the time between the appearance of the known five stars — such as sunfire.
The new directory of return speed suggests that more massive stars are slower than less massive stars.
Ribal compares the stars to the dancers: larger pirates make slower than smaller.
"In the "plaid" we see that those who turn slowly are usually more massive, while those who are slower are usually relative to very slow stars," said Ribal.
Since the collection of Plyad is close, it serves the perfect space lab to compare the properties of the star with the speed of return.
"Plajada's summer collection provides a shipping point for theoretical models of turning the stars as young and older," said Ribal.
We still want to know how and why the stars slow the speed of their turning and slow to their "thinks" shoes like that.
Ribal and her colleagues have detailed their last analysis of Plyad ' s returning speed in three new articles that will soon be published in the Astronomy Journal.
A study related to the activities of the group detained in the Ukrainian divergence in Crema, writes "Commercant".
The ECB has set evidence of the responsibilities of detainees to prepare diversity in the Krue.
As previously reported, thankful exhibitions were given to the inhabitants of the Ukrainian city of Energydar Eugene Pana, who agreed to cooperate with the consequences.
He said that he was a diversity of objects, and he considered the chimpanzee of Titan in Armenia, the petroleum in Feodozoia, the Kerk Party Transformation, the Gas Guide and one of the military aeroports.
The safeguards believe that it is not possible to keep the distributors far away.
This was, in particular, a basis for arresting suspected in the Kiev Paradise of Symphere.
The main trainer of Russia's football collection became Stanislav Cherchez
At the plenary meeting of the Russian football Union, a decision was taken to designate the headquarter of the Russian football train on the Stanislaw of Cherchesus.
The contract will be calculated for two years - before the completion of the CM-2018.
On 11 August, the RFS execution was appointed to the headquarter of the Russian assembled football by Stannigrad Cherchesois.
This is a well-known footballist, who was previously played in the Moscow Spartake on the position of the angry, as well as a trainer with soil experiences that have been a Russian team as Spartack, "Jimjuina-Sochi", "Terek", "Amcar", "Dinamo" and "Legie", which became a victory of the national primary and cube of the country.
It is reported that the contract with Cherchez will be signed in the nearest time and was raised for two years.
Hence, he was responsibilities to prepare a World Championship in 2018.
It is known that in his train head, Miroslav Romanzaco, Hintaras Stauche, Vladimir Palarus.
There is information that the total training stage is 2.5 billion euro per year.
According to the media, the RFS guided the Cherchem ' s goal to test the Russian collection to half-fills.
As the trainer himself stated, he considers the establishment of a competitive environment in the team and would give the footballists the opportunity to prove themselves.
Also, in the words of Cherchez, he was glad that the choice was on him.
The first shop under the Cherchez assembly will take Russia on 31 August in Antarctica, which will be a partnership with the Turkey team.
Remember, previously, Leonid Slunchy, who was the principal train train in the CSCK club, was Leonid Slutchki.
He declared his department after the post of the Russian national team in Euro-2016 in France.
He was responsible for the bad result of the collection.
With the desire of Angola and South Africa, Namibia suffered very much during the long-term fight against the apartheid.
However, after the decrease of the independence of South Africa in 1990, the country with populations in 2,4 million have achieved huge success, especially in the past few years.
The main reason for Namibia ' s success is that the Government highlights education.
While people in developing countries have been acknowledged as their own comprehensive primary and medium-sized education, in many poor countries in the middle and even primary schools they require for education.
Furthermore, Governments are often advised to introduce training payments for expenses.
However, there is free education in Namibia in primary schools.
Furthermore, since 2015, the average education has become free.
The authorities of the country also work actively in other important areas.
Malaria ' s destruction efforts have reduced in the past 10 years, including annual diseases for 97 per cent.
Infringing the international trend of inequality, Namibia is decreased.
In comparison with the 1993 coefficient of Gini, the standard income distribution inequalities, was 15 paragraphs.
Then, 23 years ago, this indicator was one of the highest in the world.
The poverty level has reduced from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (not less than $1.90 per day) has also reduced from almost 53 per cent to less than 23 per cent.
Namibia also has the highest ray of freedom of words in Africa, according to the "Reporters without borders".
The country has significantly warned the United States and other rich States.
In addition, the country has a favourable racing, one of the highest Africans, in the Index of Corruption, which is the Transparency International.
Even now, when the prices fall on the base, Namibia is able to keep the high levels of growth.
At the same time, GDP debt ratio is about 25 per cent, which is less than 1/3 levels of debt in the United States and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
The unemployed level, at least traditional assessment methods, remains sufficiently high - almost 28 per cent.
As well as other countries in the region, the high level of HIV/AIDS is in Namibia, almost 17 per cent of the population.
According to the assessments of the World Bank, Namibia relates to the number of countries with the income above the average, but the authorities claim that their State is actually a developing country.
Indeed, there are some difficulties faced by the low-developed economy.
The State must develop a very large and devastating country with a small population.
In the territory of the wilderness, isolated tribes of countermembers, which should be integrated in the modern society without loss of identity.
The integration of people who had been on the peripheral of the world economy for the fourth century has been an unfair challenge for any country.
For Namibia, it is more difficult: as any other country in the world is, it is with the consequences of climate change.
Nevertheless, Namibia did not think to leave the hands, but the country decided to face the problems.
Shortly after the deterioration of the independence, the establishment of a diversified economy and a collected society was taken.
It is notably that competitive political fractions have gathered together in order to work together.
Indeed, Namibia provides peaceful medical services not only for its own citizens but also for its neighbors.
About 15-20 per cent of the medical institutions in the northern Namibia citizens.
No one in Namibia speaks of the construction of a wall that would separate the country from the poor and corrupted neighbors.
The Namibiates understood that neighbors were not elected, and therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate with deficit water resources, to participate in regional medical projects, to promote investment and exchange students.
Furthermore, the Government of Namibia had justified that rich natural resources could easily be disfellowshipped by helping poor people by many.
The authorities understand that Namibia's income from natural riches must be contributed to infrastructure and production power.
They also acknowledged that it would be unreasonable to avoid obtaining the maximum arrival from the sale of countries, and to revitalize investment laws and contracts to ensure that it is.
Transparency has a crucial importance for this process, therefore the strong support of the Government ' s freedom of words is so important.
As the head of the Hague Gangeb State noted, the media often speaks about what he did not like.
But after fighting for the freedom of apartheid in South Africa, Namibia should protect the freedoms received, says the President.
Not all the key resources of Namibia are expensive.
Some, such as fishing, are related to renewed, and the Government has made all efforts to maintain and strengthen them.
Another million foreign tourists are visiting the country every year.
The Namibia shows that even those who begin with serious deficiencies - racism, colonial structure, inequality and low development - may be a way towards general prosperity.
Its achievement benefits from international recognition and reflection.
Many have heard about the Star of Warna, the ancient gold objects created by man (4600 to 4200 years before our era).
I hope it was the most thrilling archaeological sensation of the 1970s: in Bolgaria, when the barnean non-cropole, there was a fantastical number of gold artifacts, more than three thousand over the total weight of 6 kilograms.
Only one detention known as "power No 43" was extracted by 990 gold objects in general weight more than 1,5 km.
However, the official status of the ancient world's gold could soon be moved to a kind of busin found by archaeologists in July that year.
Once again in Bulgaria, it is known as Tel U.N.C.
Unlike Varna, the port city, Tel Younaccite was displaced from the sea, near the village of the Pazardjik area.
Busin is a golden pool that turns back to a row.
Yavor Boyajiev, a shooting leader in Tel U.N.C., has been given by 4600 years before our era and said that she was the older of Warna gold at least 200 years.
The Barna's throat is given about the same period, 4600 - 4200 gg before our era.
Technology that enable the data of metal to be given in absolute accuracy is currently not available.
What is the confidence of the older gold?
Of course, Professor Boyajiv knows more than reported by Reuters: "I'm very sure that the gold of the United Nations's older gold. "
This is an outstanding point of importance: this is a cruel object, but it is enough to take the same place in history.
In the interview, Reuters Boyajiv reported that scientists analyzed the composition of metals in the nearest time, as well as repeated and more carefully studied archaeological plastics where gold artificial was found.
This helps to date the browse with the maximum accuracy possible.
There are also many explanations.
Tel, U.N.C., is a famous place, even if you have never heard about it.
At present, Tel U.N.C. is considered the former "reward" of Europe.
Tel was founded by the posts of people migrated in Europe from Anatolia (Current Turkey) in 7000 years before our era.
During the following centuries, burning processing of metals has been developed in this region, from the restoration of the first metalurgical skills to the establishment of the fullest industry.
A particular name is: Balkano-Carpath Metallurgic Province.
In the five thousand years before our era around the metal processing centres, the population of the urban type began.
Now they are called the ancient towns of Europe.
Of them, maybe the oldest one of them, because there were 4900 artificials found here before our era.
I would call Tel U.N.C. prototype of the modern city, although it is very old, even compared to Mesopotamia.
"This is the place of the older Sumer for thousands of years," said Boyaji, with a general accepted view that the urban culture was born in the south of Mesopotamia, the modern Iraq.
There was the first city in an accurate understanding of this word.
The scanners of Tel, University, have been carried out since 1976.
At that time, archaeologists have discovered almost 12 hectares, which is about third of the general population planned.
The rest of a strong wall was found, which has never reached three meters higher.
From houses and masters, however, archaeologists clearly distinguish streets, public buildings, a rewarded medium, a business center and a living area.
There are decades of bird fibers found here.
All birds are pictured in a calm state, so that they were not decorative objects, but an object of local culture.
The "this city" was destroyed about 4100 years before our era, perhaps by the Indonesian tribes coming from the northeastern.
There were no cities, horses and weapons.
The three-metre-third walls have not stopped them.
Archaeologists have found the clear signs of a cruel fight: the rest of older, women and children had been found within the houses with the slaughter of the slaughter.
New incidences and new facts appear to be made annually, changed with regard to the ancient history of humanity.
Bulgar Archaeologists are often speaking not of individual cultures but of the first "persistent" civilization of Europe, generated in Balkans.
The powerful stimulation of this civilization was the "sol Barna" found recently in 1972.
It is logically that the Barna's gold blowing should be predicted, something like a crochet gold sweet created in Tel Youncite.
In Porsche, models 911 Targa were artificially covered
Officially stated that the preparation of 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is carried out manually by units working with series machines.
For example, the "retro luxury" is a particular color of Etna Blue, which has been developed in 1960 for the Porsche 356B model, which has even been designed in this color.
In addition, Targa received a company white graph on boards and special RS Spyder wheel disks, as well as some details of the white-zole metal formatting.
In the retro-third interest, it is noted that, in large account, it is different from the gamma-formation series, new cresses with extensive electrically-regulated diameters and separated black-notified steel with the logotype of the unit.
Furthermore, when purchasing a special version, each purchaser will receive a checal gift for the car and a rich distributed album with photos of the production process.
The powerful installation of the Porsche Exclusive specialists has not become tough: the retroval of characteristics is fully consistent with the series.
It is a six-cylindrical engine with a careful amount of 3.0 m, developing 420 cm and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version 911 Targa 4S can be speeded up to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be executed by a limited quote, but no amount or value of each specific sport chair shall be reported.
Facebook and publishing advertising have linked the weapon box.
The recent inclusion of the Facebook technologies that prevented the hiding of the newspapers on social pages has been proposed by developers of decisions to block the advertising to answer action.
In AdBlock Plus, it was "protection", but Facebook is planned to do so soon as it is not useful.
So AdBlock Plus projected its new technology that may have remained effectively long.
The social representatives noted that, trying to inflict a new "non-blocked" advertising, the decision by AdBlock Plus, together with commercial statements, also blocked many common mails from friends or pages.
In Facebook, the AdBlock Plus was regretted and promised to solve the problem soon.
As the source of the source among the social developers of TechCrunch, the code that makes AdBlock Plus free on the Facebook decktop will be ready for the next hour.
So, socialists and blocks have divided their kind of " weapons" by trying to play one another, the same side has become users who have lost the interesting records from friends or the advertising where they were not acceded to see it.
The ethical aspects of the public blocking have recently caused a distressing conflict.
In Murmansk, the violencer is before the court of the Murmansk Evening.
His case has already been investigated in the next Committee of the Russian Federation on the Morman area.
The accusation of 54-year-old man is very serious towards sexual violence.
The results were that, at the end of November 2015, Paul’s street area in Murmansk has acted sexually with regard to violence against 20-year-old girls.
The sanction of this article provides maximum punishment for the punishment of freedom for six years.
Dongfeng will bring to Russia Crossvan Fengguang 370 and Picap Rich New website On page www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a renowned representative in China of a car class that combines the dignity of mine and croscinars.
Another russian prize is Picap Rich New.
Many western companys of the Moscow International Autoshop this year have decided to ignore, so the white exhibition halls of Crocus Expo will be filled with the Chinese companies.
In particular, a powerful front will be the Dongfeng Motor Corporation, which has great species of Russian market and intended to provide a number of interesting news to our automotives in the nearest future.
One of them will become a kroswan Dongfeng Fengguang 370, sold in China at the price of 55 900 yen (of less than 550 000 rubs on the current rate).
The Russian value is not lighting, but the question of delivery in our country is until it is in the stage of the debate.
In China, on the other hand, Fengguang 370 was intended to reach the 11th place in the list of most sales minerals, although it is a large road education of (175 mm) and a protective platform in the lower perimeter of the cow can be attributed to crystals.
Crossvan is built on a pre-produced platform of the Fongguang 360, in the 370th round base of the same 2725 mm, but the skins are longer (4565 mm against 4510 mm), the slightest design, and the slightness of the richer.
The salon was shocked by tree planning, but the large vertical sensor screen showed on the Tesla's central console was only on the early slopes of Crossvana, and cars were made with music simply.
Five of the seven floor sites are easily composed by a low loading area of 1650 mm long, the maximum volume of the bagazine is 1500 m.
Fengguang 370 engine prescribes only one to 1,5 litre binary atmosphere power of 115 l.s. from a 5-year mechanical transfer box.
On the dynamic quality of the machine, the manufacturer is modestly grateful, since it promises the pleasant budget of the owner at the level 6,7 m/100 km.
Picap Rich New is a well-known Russians Nissan NP300 Navara for the previous generation, but with the hot Chinese designers.
Despite the morally swimming construction, this model is still used by a stable demand in the Chinese consumer as a reliable and inconsistent slaughter.
At the eastern price, Rich New probably interests Russians because the modern Japanese picapans have become immensely precious.
Rich New is covered by two machines for choice: benzine 2,4 l (137 ls) or carbodiles 2,5 l (116 l).
The transmission box is only a mechanic, the machine is back to the row, but there are modifications and the strictly connected "forward".
The New Flagman Sedan A9 will be at the Stind Dongfeng, his Russian first representative of the Chinese company was still anonymized in June.
The mine-based skiss on the Chinese market is increasing, one of the last news - Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
Today, the Russian Dongfeng line is of two models: the S30 Sedan and the H30 Cross.
In this year, the Chinese company’s divisions were performed in our country 696 cars.
Transport tax publications stop mailing on the www.zr.ru rule
The tax inspection has changed the list of notifications on equipment taxes.
All Russian automobilists were inclined to unchanged years of schedule: they receive a quote for the transfer of transport taxes for the past year.
However, in this year, many of them are not expected.
The case is that tax inspection has changed the order of notification of the citizens.
Those registered in the Public Payment Office on the official website of the nalog.ru, the publications will come electronically.
In the inspection, such Russians were automatically viewed by online users and cut them out of a standard, "boomer" list.
The newness consists of all vehicle owners and non-motiveness.
All remaining letters will continue to be received.
However, the possibility of return to the old scheme is also of the owners of the website account.
For that reason, they must visit the tax office and write a statement in August.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and better.
The notification appears in the "fair office" immediately after the preparation, while the letter is going to go a few days and may be perished.
In addition to the number of Internet users of tax inspections, over 18 million people have been overcome, which allows the state to seen seriously on shipping.
On the other hand, modest news on the website is apparently not enough to inform citizens of changed standards.
Some could be registered in a regular office to obtain a single service and forgot it for a long time.
Those people are not expected to learn from e-mail and, however, will be in the category of non-employers with all exciting consequences.
Access to the Life Payment Office is performed in three ways: through the accounting port gosuslugi.ru, using electronic signature or login or password specified in the registry map.
The last is available in any tax inspection office (unless there is a place for accounting).
Remember that the transport tax must be paid up to 1 December in the present year.
The reporting began in July.
The Tuning Mercedes-Benz G-class, which aims to achieve a very high deal, is something in itself.
But the opposite concept did not cut the G-Power company masters that were taken for the modifying of the sport version Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power is known by its BMW cars, but no human masters are foreign.
Really, why wouldn't G 63-571-powery aircraft with aerodin tank and swimming up to 5,4 s?
The "muscles" of the sweet "gelic", the master used by the advantages that opened a 5.5-litrous "shooter" shooter.
And that's the dynasm of the dynasm of the twenty-first has improved by 0.1 c, and the flight of a flight can be 5,3 cs.
However, the speed of average speed must be clearly better.
The speed flow affects: If the standard G 63 is not slower 210 km/h, the tuberculosis of a deactivated electronic " driver" can survive 250 km/h.
Out of the car are almost uncertain from its original system, except other rail disks - the Urricane RR value of 305/35 ZR 23.
The Mercedes-Maybach Unit anonymous 6 m long-term conceptual purchase represented under the Concourse of Eleanty in Pbbble Bich.
Mercedes-Benz companies will competite with the "very-sub-Subrange" BMW i and will move their electric models under a separate trade market.
In the nearest years, at least four environmental news is expected.
