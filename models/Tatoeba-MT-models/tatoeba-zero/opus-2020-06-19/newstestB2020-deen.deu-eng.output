Branded in French chemistry
The big burden in a chemistry that was particularly dangerous in the northern French city of Rouen has been removed. This shared the prefectures of Normandia on Friday. The fire was broken on Thursday night. No one was blessed in the past. The fire shooting was with about 200 drivers in use.
The fire could be ordered
Anrainers were called to not leave their homes. The building was evacuated around 500 meters, schools and child farms remained closed on Thursday. In the chemical work at its west are produced additives for smooth substances. The manufacture belongs to the US-millionary Warren Buffet company and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive of the EU, which provides strict security stocks.
In the work, about 400 people worked. Chemistry manufacture has already been careful in the past for slaughter cells - about 2013 by a sleeve the gas methanthiol was developed and the environment was widely shocked by faul eggs. In 2015, the city was shocked around 2.000 litre mineral oil in the water system.
She announces her job to search for 57 days after her lost hair
Two months ago, a woman from Washington searched for her lost dog - and announced more about her job. The seven-year-old border Collie was cut from Montana from the hotel room. 57 days lacked from the hair every spur - but Carole King did not open.
"I was horrible." Carole King said to the "Daily Inter Lake". She and her husband had left Hindin Katie in the hotel room while they went to the dinner. After then they returned to the hotel, Katie was gone. They were looking for the animal but without success.
Donner had translated the dog into panic
In the hope, Katie could still stay in the hotel, Carole King went to reception. "The commander said, "He's gone for about four, four and a half hours," remembers Carole King against "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie was immediately shooted. A slight donor was slow to the dog in panic.
With flyers and calls in Facebook, the Kings searched for their favorite dogs. But from days, they were never left. "I have never lost the hope," said Carole King, "Daily Inter Lake, who announced their job as posters to continue their search for Katie.
"From the winds."
Fifty days after Katie lost, Carole King called: a man reported himself and said that Katie was invaded in his court. But when King came there, Katie was already disappeared. She searched for neighbourhood and suddenly stood her dogs under a tree. "I just wanted to let them go," remarked King, "Daily Inter Lake." "The clouds flew."
Losses in the federal weapon: machine weakers lost
Friday, 27 September 2019
Six machines of the MG3 type have been lost as before.
In the past years, the federal weapons have lost numerous weapons and ten thousands of shoes, including three machine weapons. The remaining remains in the majority of the cases. The opposition speaks of a "fashioning" expansion.
Among the federal Weapon, weapons and munitions have always lost. Since the beginning of 2014, the troops reported the loss of 39 weapons, 39 parts of the weapons and about 20,000 shoes munition. This is a list of the Federal Defence Ministry reported by Germany.
According to the paper from the Office of Defence Secretary Peter Tuuber from the CDU, two weapons have been recovered, a part of a weapon and 3474 shooting munition. After the extinct weapons and weapons, there are six machines of the type MG3, 11 weapons of the G3 type, four shoes of the G36 type, six signal pitols and two of the P8 type.
The overwhelming of weapons and munitions losses at the Federal War was "awesome," said the left-day deputy Martina Renner. This was so much more, because in the course of investigations, it was uncomfortable. The left politician said of a "functional bill". Renner criticized that in the listing it was not recognisable if the missing munitions were also found to be under the missing munitions that were related to the investigations against the terrorist offenders of the federal warrior Franco A.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the Iranian port
More than two months after his establishment by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the ports of the city Bandar Abbas on Friday. As a result of Refinitive Shipping data, the tank moved and left the Iranian port. The target port was given by Port Rashid in the United Arab Emirates.
Indeed, the tanker was already released by the Iranian government on Monday, but first he remained in Iranian waters. From the Riederi it was called to wait for an official decision from Teheran.
The "Stena Impero" was introduced on July 19, by the Iranian Revolution Gardens in the Hormuth Sea Strategy, in order to have disfellowshipped security arrangements, but it was noted that the Iranite reacted to the strict, interim establishment of an Iranian oil tanker before the United Kingdom.
The street of Hormuz is one of the most important waterways in the world. It connects the Persian Golf with the Indian Ocean. A majority of the global oil exports is disappeared by the sea. The swimming in the region had fallen in the past months. Trade ship was entered into the conflict between the United States and Iran.
Merkel appeals the courage of people at the peaceful revolution
The federal blogger Angela Merkel acknowledged the commitment of people in the DDR who had been on the road 30 years ago at the peaceful revolution. In April 1989, the former DDR regime had been able to impose the DDR regime, said Merkel at a Festival of the Thüringer CDU Group on the day before the German Unit. The Cancers, among others, recalled the establishment of the Stasi centre. "The state security was taken to the horrible", she said.
Musk aims at delivery records
Teslas Quartal may be ready to record. Despite the extraction tree, there were last losses in the electronic autoconcern.
New York.Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given its electronic auto-concerns with the view of new record numbers. "We have the opportunity to reach our first quarter with 100,000 delivery", wrote Musk in one of the "electric" blogs of Tesla.
The question is strong, so that Tesla could use 110000 orders, it continued to write in Musks rounds. The challenge is to bring the cars to the customers slowly. Thus Tesla should provide as far as many resources as possible.
As a result, Teslas shared with more than six percent of the trade. So strongly the course has not been added for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had produced a good 95000 cars and thus reached its best value.
Musk needs recursing to achieve its high targets. 2019 he wants to deliver totally 360000 to 400000 cars. This requires six-year-old numbers. Especially the most favorable Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here is less than the winning rates. Despite the boom’s losses.
Residue solved: That's why we can't kisse ourselves
A kind of brems in the big brain prevents people to kit themselves. This found researchers of Humboldt University in Berlin with the help of experiments on rats how they shared on Thursday Monday. In addition, progress is made on the question, why children are so strongly fighting against the kitchen only to demand more.
Finally, it has also shown why only the nearness of a kitchen hand has been dissolved before the driving laugh. This lies at a deep speed in the big brain that already solved the laugh at the expectation of the kitchen.
According to the information, previous research showed that rats react with "Lachen" in the ultra-scale area when they are kitchened by people. This "lake" is measured by the part of the big ceremonial brain whose central processing of haptic authorisation is given.
Laugh is undermined during self-training
Before it has been found that the brain between self-training and conducting can be different from others, so people can't be able to kitchen themselves. The Berlin researchers now find the experts to the rats that the laughing as well as the activity of the area of the big cerebral during self-training, and that is also the case if the lives themselves are cut. During the care and the kitzel by the scientists were to rise the activity in the hair and the impuls.
But pass the self-training and conducting by others at the same time, it also understood the laugh. This indicated that the brain of therats could not be between self-training and driving by other different ways. The new knowledge closed that people could not kitchen themselves because self-training active a brain in the big brain.
The rats were also trained to kiss themselves. In order to make this initiative in the experiment a time before, they showed the behaviour or shock stars. This ambivalence is equal to the behavior of children. The environmentality of the Kitzeln is a behavioral reaction that is equal to rats and people.
Catastrophe used: Big Brand removed in French chemistry
The big burden in a chemical work that was particularly dangerous in the Northern French city of Rouen has been removed. This shared the prefectures of Normandia of the news agent AFP on Friday. The fire was broken on Thursday night.
According to the authorities, there should be no health-risk substances. The samples taken don't give a reason for an inquiry, as prefect Peter-André Durand said on Friday morning at a press conference. No one was blessed in the case. The fire shooting was with about 200 drivers in use.
Schools and children were closed
The inhabitants were called to leave their homes. The buildings were evacuated around 500 meters, schools and children were closed on Thursday.
Manufacture belongs to the firm lubrizole of US-millionary Warren Buffett

Munmal at the suggestions of Oslo and Uûya is enthusiasmed
More than eight years after the appeals in Oslo and Uucciya with 77 dead will be enthusiasmed on Saturday in Norwegia. The monument "Jernrosene" (South: the iron rose) consists of about 1.000 prestigious Rose narrative training. They recalled the Roses that thousands of people were in the days and weeks after appealing before the Dom in Oslo.

Iran has a British tanker free.
The United Nations general debate did not have a solution in the Iran conflict, but now there is a less problem: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" held in Iran could return to the sea; it could be a puzzle in the Iranian president Ruhani's peace plan.
The British oil tank "Stena Impero" which has been held on the street of Hormus in Iran has been returned to international waters. After the release of Iranian authorities, the ship is on the way to Dubai, as the Rideri Stena Bulk reported.
The "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas and now the crew runs for medical investigations to Dubai, explained Reedereichef Erik Hånell. On midday the ship left the Iranian waters. "That's finished," he said to the Swedish television SVT.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London called the establishment of the ship as illegal. "This is part of a template of attempts to threaten the freedom of the sea. We work with our international partners to maintain the shipment and international law," said in a communication on Friday.
The Iranian Revolution gardens had established the tanker on July 19, under the provision of the law of the sea in the Persian Golf. Seven of the 23 employees were already released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crowd members were in the same way, said Hænell. They would have been professionally able to join their families in the last ten weeks.
The British government reacted to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar following the establishment of the "Stena Impero": there was the beginning of July a supertank with oil from Iran, which was intended for Syria, to be set to the chain. The delivery requested the authorities against the EU sanctions against the Syrian War. The reference to the ship was received from the United States.
The Iran spoke of "Piraterie" and threatened the consequences. In the middle of August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. The courage, it has been dealing with a smoke business to be freed by the "Stena Impero", which was then returned to London.
The street of Hormus is one of the most important seaways in the world. It connects the Persian Golf with the Indian Ocean. A majority of the world's oil exports is disappeared by the sea. The swimming in the region had been slowly slowed in the past months. The trade ship was entered into the conflict between the United States and Iran.
Among the shocks between Teheran and Washington, the Atom Force of both countries and the Americans will want to build the Iranians to build nuclear weapons. The Iranians returned to it. The United States in 2018, in all parts of the International Atom Agreement, were cut off the Iranians to prevent the construction of a atomic bomb, and they should also end their political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government sets up the lead in Teheran with massive economic organizations against the country to strictly evacuate agreements on other areas. The Iran is opposed to the pressure.
In view of the fight on the "Stena Impero" and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Golf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the United States works for a coalition for military protection of trade ships in the region.
The Iranian President Hassan Ruhani had presented a UN Voluntary Meeting in New York a Hormus's security and peace plan on the street, which would like to ensure that the Persian Golf coalition will be able to ensure, together with the Arab Golf States and without foreign protection forces for the security of ships in the Persian Golf.
Indeed, with its Protectionist Economic Policy, a better future will be made.
In view of the criminal rights associated with the US President Donald Trump against Chinese producers, foreign producers in the People's Republic, it is intended to redistribute. Financial chiefs of Asian companies who intend to make their production from China in a other country, call India in a survey of UBS as one of the preferent alternatives. This has not only to do with the uncertainty of Chinese trade wars.
But now India has been divided in Trumps focus. From the wheelhouse as a "the King of the Zools" referred to as "the Kingdom of the Zweenland", the United States has deleted trade benefits for 2000 products. The U.S. is prohibitively banned India and demands a better market access for farmers, mobile phones, spiritists, motor leaders and others.
On the world map of trade wars, the riberies with India are freely a side view. The United States also considers the world's largest democracy through the security policy. Delhi and Washington linked the concern about China's powerful laws in the South Ocean. Before this background, an uncertainly save American punishment against India. In India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who took place as a two-year-old office, should be safe.
The problem is in another place: the imperially encouraging those that open markets accelerated the economic development in the Socialist Republic of India has been a serious position in the Socialist Republic of India. The reformers also aimed mainly on the bureaucratic Irish, which has so long renewed all enterprises' spirit in the multinational state. Firms now receive rapid construction grants for buildings. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure and enhanced insolvencies and concursion legislation to ensure that companies are likely to be able to liquidate with high schools.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rakings, which is an economic optic in India in the first five-year-old years, but it does not apply to trade policy, but to protect small international competitive enterprises against foreign providers, the national conservative government has even created new pains.
In the West, the model of the Nimbus of the energy reformers renewed its country economically radially. However, this impression is not debt to the state that the Carismmatic Prime Minister is only to know what vocabulary of the Western Managers like. In the Kern, the "India First" Advocat was never declined by a Protectionist Economic Policy, which prevents that Indian companys would be able to resolve an accromistical exhibition and to make the global competitive.
Adoption of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
The former French president Jacques Chirac will be introduced in Paris in the next week. The previous head of the State will be placed on Monday at the Friedhof Montparnasse in the south of the French capital, reporting the AFP reported in professional care to the Chiracs family. The location will be held in the closest family circle. To Sunday was a public trauma in Paris Invalidandom, as reported media.
The competitors are targeted: Dabo is the first home herd of the lightathletic WM
The world's skin was a long time at the time when the exciting Khalifa International Stadion was shocked. In the first time of men over 5000 meters from Aruba, Jonathan Busby was shocking dangerously. He could still be able to swim over 300 meters before the goal, slowly swimming on the legs, as a braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau, and supported him the last half stadium rounds in the goal. The forces were in both, yet to stop the goal of the weapons. As the snipers were not enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same", said Dabo after the beach in Mixed Zone, when he had completely unexpectedly expected the attention of the collected journalists to himself. The shooter would only want to speak about his heritage. Finally he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he noticed that this would be hard to help only a suffering partner. And unless he would only be proud to represent his country that was invited to the WM from the world's group. In normal circumstances he couldn't start.
He did that at the night with a lot more intensive than he was thinking about it. Because this herdentat will be remembered. At the time, Dabo left his competitive busby even on his goal and was voluntary over the latest place - the other five minutes after Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who wins this loop. At the end of the end, it was nothing to do, because only with much helped busby was disqualified in the end of the world light-based association.
Dabo, who lived in Portugal and studied there in Lisbon, took place to set up a personal best time at the WM in Doha. This was often official data with 18:10.87 minutes, but he himself was depressed: "I wanted to run 17.55 minutes. I was just a minute at 18 minutes."
Million machines: Egyptians are for wild Protest Tags
In Egypt, the security measures have been strengthened in advance of possible regulatory critical protests. In the centre of Kairo, an increased police presentation was observed on Friday. Many U-Bahn stations remained closed to the central Tahrir plate.
Last days the police had strengthened their road controls, and the phones of footholders were in part searching on news and photos related to the protests, and hundreds of organizations were arrested.
Opposite of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, it was in Kairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura to protest with hundreds of participants. They opposed the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critical corruption and misconduct. One such open protest against political leadership had not been given it for years in Egypt. In Spanish exil, the Egyptian manufacturer and shock players, Mohammed Ali, who made the demonstrations with video-boats on Facebook, had not been given to a "millionary mars" centrally in the country. Alit calls for a revolution "Vollux".
The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) continued to comply with the number of prisons relating to the Protests, and the Egyptian Centre for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the Human Rights Watch of Human Rights (HRW) said of more than 2.000 prisons. Independently, these figures were not first confirmed. The Government also confirmed and commented the numbers.
Volunteers
Many people were "weakly arrested" only because they were "fake to time in the wrong place" shared with HRW in vocational lawyers. The lawyers against the prisoners were able to have the information of their lawyers of "distribution of false information" to membership in a "terroristic association". In Kairo, Alexandria and other cities, they asked for security forces in Uniform, but also in civil clothing, after HRW's instructions.
HRW also criticized the centre in the North African country. The government blocks Kairo websites and online services to connect further protests against Sisi.
Online employees: Senders should be able to send back
For online shoppingers, many lost packed products are lost. About 20 million return countries so on the moon. But there is a alternative.
The Financial Ministry has shown online hosts such as Amazon and Zalando a way how they can sell returned products instead of destroying them.
Although the companies could not be freed from the transfer tax to Sachspends, the Ministry explained a question of the Green Day Group which reported the newspapers of the Funke media group on the freeday. But the handlers could apply the market value of the non-produced returns so low that they should not be paid or not only a few reimbursement taxes.
Scientists at the Bamberg University had identified that the federal citizens return to their sixth package on the Internet. round four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - would then land in the mould. They would be funded after the current legal situation additionally, as the financial authorities evaluate the debts as a transfer to the taxes then.
The Green Fraction Chef Katrin viewing eckardt requested the Financial Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify that companies can evaluate non-producing products in accordance with and free of charge to common organizations. The enterprises should not be able to be punished for costs. This was not only for the online chain, but also for other businesses from the model load to the construction market.
Banksy rate for auction: There was never a better time to sell this meal
The known work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", is to first be enhanced.
The Banksys work underlines "Reformation of the oldest parliamentary democracy of the world in the foundation expressed by animals and stages".
The work was first issued in the 2009 Museum of Bristol in Southern England, where Banksy lives. In this year, the artist had re-exhibited the event, as well as the original Brexit date on 29 March. On this occasion, the work called "Fragestune" was called "Devolved Parliament" (Delegated Parliament).
The image could change the owner for a million amount.
Lastly, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had given himself a hard slaughter with the opposition at the first meeting of the subcontinent after the resignation of one of Johnson's passions by the Supreme Court. Johnson would also like to comply with the two-member brexit already moved on October 31, as well as without agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, is in the Brexit debate. In Dover in South England, he called an image that represents a man that storms a star of the European fleet. The work is seeing thousands of Lkw farmers and other visitors at their arrival to the United Kingdom.
Brexit-debates are like a "space walk on the park"
The huge attacks of the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit's enemy in Parliament have not contributed to a climate of hate. In comparison with the election campaign before the Brexit Referendum 2016, the current contraverse was a "spacegang in the park", said Dominic Cummings on Friday at a book presentation. "We will enjoy this. We will come (of the EU) and we will win".
Johnson had attacked the Brexit opposite in Parliament in the past days and predicted them, among others, "training" to the people, and accused that he could threaten the Members because they could be a goal of murder threats, he did as "humbug".
Cummings said that the only way to make it quiet, is if the Members would finally respect the decision of the United Kingdom for a department from the EU, and it is not surprised that the people have been covered that the United Kingdom had not yet been out of the EU for three years after the referencedum.
In view of the loaded smiling, even the bishops of the English Church were to retain. "We should talk to each other with respect", he said in a statement. "and we should also listen."
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan requests one entry in Kaschmir
With a emotional appeal, the President of Pakistan, Iran Khan, reiterated the United Nations to reiterate the Cashmer Konflikt.
On the other hand, it would be a renewed war between the Pakistan and India, probably, said Khan on Friday at the Un-General debate in New York. "If it works bad, you hope to be the best, but prepared to the worst." The United Nations had a responsibility for Cashmir. "If you should prevent it."
Independently from the British colonial rule in 1947, India and Pakistan have led three wars to the shared region of Cashmir. Both nuclear forces control a part of Cashmir, another part of China. At the beginning of August the Indian Cashmir regions had led the autonomy status and increased the spendings in the relative to Pakistan.
Not even a flash water
The demonstrators in Cairo demand the slaughter of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
With the present protests in Egypt, the government reacts with a hard hand, and it can shoot the population with a deep shooting munitions, shooting over 2000 prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners that already were in place. Protests were never in danger in Egypt. However, since General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the State apparatus makes everything to avoid a scenario as at the time of the Arab spring.
But one of the protectives in 2011 was the bad economic situation. Poorness, perspectiveness and feeling to be justified by the own government spend millions on the street. This is a problem that the regime of el-Sisi does not get in the face, even as the hardness of it is against the opposers.
Today, every third in Egypt lives under the poverty limit. Since 2016 the currency has lost more than half of its value, the inflation rate is 10%. Those who want to buy a float water in the Supermarket must decide whom he finances: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the Military. Lastly, it is not only responsible for the subscription, but also for the largest economic actor. The military builds streets, houses, football stadiums, produces food and many more. This was already before it. With the authorities have a lot of experience, the dilemma is an alt market. It will always be critical if a large part of the population has a slowness.
Tv tests in the terminal: BER-Chef: No "showstopper" more for the main city flight
Two months have been examined whether the complex installation in the BER-broad protection works in compliance. The operators are satisfied with the loop. However, the TV is not yet done at BER.
Following large Twiv tests in the future headquarters, the operators have confirmed the opening planned in October next year, and this is sure, the Supervisory Board of Bretschneider said after a meeting of the Control Committee.
Airport Chief Angelbert Lütke Daldrup said about a successful test, but he also said that there are still misses in the terminal. "We have a lot of details, but we don't have a real shower." He assured the time schedule to enter into the end.
However, there is evidence that the temporary reserve should not be too large, and the construction sample should now be introduced during the first quarter of 2020 at the Bauam, at the beginning of the year, it was expected for this origin.
Hundreds of electric cable misses are still to be accompanied; the Tüv wants to examine it until February. "In order to create the conditions for the adoption of the aircraft, it must continue to work intensively in the processing of the missiles," said in a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said, in many cases it was lacking evidence, less about the new cable. There is no deliverance for all the cable trails in which the cable trails are slaughtered. The airport chief expects that these are present until the end of the year.
In addition, the burning protection is not satisfied with the transfer to the station station under the terminal. The problems of the project had already been in a further crisis three years ago. This time is about smoking smoking shoes that were swallowing at a brand like a swimming swimming swimming swimming off. 36 motors should therefore be disrupted. This is the beginning of the year to give new attempts to cook.
Problems with burning protection and other trees and planning errors have been delayed the opening of the airport for years. Originally, it should be operated in 2011. The costs were from two billion to about 6,5 billion euros for opening in the next year.
Because the passenger numbers in Berlin have been significantly increased, the responsibilities planned the construction of the airport, and it should be announced at a summer meeting of the Supervisory Council on October 18, as the President of Bretschneider announced.
The airport company now searches for two new managers. Finance Chef Heike Fölster changes the end of the year to the German Bahn, Personal Chef Manfred Bobke-for Camen takes the next year in Rent, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She set the airport finances on a fixed feet.
Chemnitz: Drug automated - police takes a man fix
He needed money for drugs - and hired some cars in the Chemnitzer city area in the air! Now the killer ended in prison!
In the past two years, the number of smoking and parking automobiles in Chemnitz and the region was significantly increased.
The police took two detonations in the end of May at the civil street and on the other street in Chemnitz a 33-year-old German.
Police speaker Andrzej Rydzik: "The course of the investigation because of the driving of pollutant explosions in tate unity with specially severe cases of the shooting steel conducted by the Chemnitzer Criminal Policei confirmed not only this suspect against the 33-year-old."
Confronted with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer had now a total of eight acts.
The police speaker: "That the beute has obviously financed its independence." Four times the bomb was taken from 20 August 2018 to 31 May 2019 park cars on the civil streets.
The overall damage is at least 60 000 euros!
The automate bomb is now in investigation, and the police investigation continues to go against him.
It is likely that he was responsible for further automates in Chemnitz and border land crystals.

On the analysis of 9000 people's heritage, Hamburger and Swiss scientists want to get more detailed on the scene the causes of cardiac cycle diseases.
The research project is the largest type of this in German space, shared the University Clinic Hamburg Eppendorf (UKE) on Friday. The Queen Foundation promotes the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland, the High-Birgsklinik Davos, which belongs to the Foundation, and participates in the university's university pital Zurich.
Overweight, smoking and unsuccessful food includes the essential impacting risk factors for cardiac cycle diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. The match between genes and external effects is only unreasonable. Now the scientists want to compare the entire assault of 8000 healthy people with the UKE of 1000 former patients.
Currently, more than 4000 of about 20,000 relevant human genes have been known with DNA's potential changes - as called mutations -, it was called by the clinic. Each year, about 200 adds.
The aim of the five-year project is to develop new options in terms of precaution, recognition and treatment of heart rhythmus disorders, heart weaknesses and heart infections. The data could also benefit from research of other people diseases, such as Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University's heart and blood centre.
The Chairman of the Cowne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kuhne (82), also stressed the vast will to use the data to investigate other diseases. The Clinic of the Fundation in Davos has been treated until all all all the more allergians. Now, on the site, a centre for cardiovascular precision Medicine is produced and was created a professor for bioinformatics. To establish his commitments, he said that he was opened in Hamburg three years ago and was very thankful to the open hearts of the physicians.
The bioprotections of healthy participants are from Hamburger, who also produced in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 probands, it is the largest local health study of the world. In the heritage encryption, the strict regard for the protection of the data anonymized, the scientists were safed by a petabyte (1000 terabytes) to data, said Holger Moch from the University's psychal Zürich.
The heritage of a person today may be decrypted within 24 hours. The clean expert costs are at EUR 1300. The first gene sequencing world, which was published in 2001, have also costed hundreds of millions of euros. The study will begin on 1 October 2020, and all 9000 samples will be analyzed in the year.
Nigerian police frees hundreds of mistreated boys
In Nigeria, the police freed more than 300 people who had been tortured and misused from a coran school. After the instructions of the people, the security forces in the northern Kaduna city discovered the victims of even less age, as the police speaker Jacobu Sabo reported. "The victims were missed. Some of them gave their teachers to be slaughtered," said Sabo.
The kids were maintained under the front of teaching in the Korean and to be "excepted". In fact, the protectives of their teachers were maintained under the "the most appreciative and inhuman conditions", said Sabo. Hundred students, including the children of nine years of age, were in a small area.
The Coran School showed the details for about ten years, and the authorities had not been observed by the authorities on repeated irregularities in the establishment. The parents had shown themselves shocked when they were taught about the situations in the Coran School, said Sabo. They hadn't heard anything by the suffering of their children.
In the most Muslim Northern Nigerias, there are many private coran schools. They are replaced by the often unnecessary state institutions. People in the region suffered in a common attack of armed bands. According to the information of the United Nations Refugee Help work over the past ten months, more than 40,000 people over the borders in the neighbourhood.
Angekettet and tortured: Nigerian police frees 400 children from school
Police officers freed almost 400 students in a northern Nigerian school. "The many of them were casted and some had visible injuries that were cut down on punishment," said the police speaker Jacobu Sabo in Kaduna City.
The children were discovered there on Thursday after a reference in a Islamic high school. The situations were "humanless" and the officials took the school leaders and six teachers after the release action.
The children, all of their children, were in their schools like slaves and were put on chats. Some of them were sexually misused. TV images showed disappointed and affected students in an acknowledged health condition.
World flight selection: Additional forecasts for messe and clopps core
football "not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe
With a gala in Mayland, the World Fussball Association Fifa is the best player, the best player and the best trainer of the year. For Lionel Messi it is the sixth food and then record.
After Nicaragua's captain explained that he never agreed to the World Fussballer Whale, other countries have come to the Fifa. Egypt was not assessed - with a curiose foundation.
In the past years, many of the Fifa has proved that the WM's dubble plans of their President Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of different corrupt officials. The Fif-World Fullballer's WM has not yet been suspected of spending on an unprofit - if you see that the stimulated national train and national membership capitals of membership are often under sympathy because, according to an objective assessment, it was not possible.
However, after Nicaragua's captain has not voted, he has now made further independence: Egyptians claim that the votes of the National Train Hossam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account.
The Fifa regrets that "the signs on the selection forms were deleted in large books and therefore not valid". You have contacted the Egyptian association more times to clarify the situation - without answer.
Sudans Trainer also wonderful
In the case of Egypt, the Sudan’s association has not agreed as a result of the choice. While the position is complete in the case of Egypt, the Sudan’s association has not agreed that Trainer Zdravko Lugarisic has not agreed as finally been evaluated: Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three of the same basis. According to Fifa, the vote was in the same way, with signs and official stamps of the Sudan Association.
In his case, Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera said: "Don't vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All information about my voice is wrong, thank you," he wrote. In his case, it was sweet that the Nicaragua football association just agreed in his name.
From the association, the message was now held on Friday, but it was not, of course, a purpose. The completed chosen documents were "unfortunately" with the name and signing of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan selection, called in a communication of the association. However, in fact, the second captain Manuel Rosas had chosen. "We take the responsibility for the administrative error," said in the Communication. While Rosas and Managers Henry Duarte had agreed for the Messiah, "as it is in the official list of FIFA."
The other cases allow the Fifa to check in a investigation, but it stresses that the outdoor selection process was monitored by the PriceWaterhouse Coopers. As long as Lionel Messi remains the only uninterfaced winner of the world fireballer and Jürgen Klopp World Trainer of the year.
Ukrainian Africa: Ranghohe Republicans speak for official investigation
Two fraternal Republicans have opened themselves for an official investigation against the US President and party Donald Trump. "I think that the investigation is important," said the Republicn Goal of the United States Vermont State, Phil Scott. "If it comes from here, it is determined by the facts that are determined." He wants to know more about the Whistleblower affairs before the action was taken.
Scott said he wasn't surprised by the enthusiasms, which showed that Trump had once again asked the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskys to investigate the activities of the Democratic Chairman and former Vice-President Joe Biden in Ukraine.
The Republicans have retreated the Trump crisis because of the Whistleblower affairs, only few have recognized uncertainty. Scott's statements are now a first sign in the Trumps Party, and Virginia's moderate governance had already been applied to Trump's policy, for example, against the locking of environmental protection and the strengthening of immigration rules.
When other random Republicans, Charlie Baker, Gouverneur of Massachusetts, also said for the investigation. "It is a deep devastating situation," said Baker. "The right step and responsibility for the conference is now to investigate the matter and to go on the basis."
Scott and Baker formally have no discussion in the anti-trump procedure, which will be decided in the Congress, and their statements are particularly symbolically important. However, the first Senators of the Republic of the United States have also been critically criticized about the situation. The state of Utah in the second Parliament chamber said that the case was "extremely devastated, deeply devastated".
The business could involve in the introduction of an official detection procedure against Trump, which the Democratics in the Representative House have announced a investigation, which will make him use of powerful misconduct for the purpose of a foreign impact on their own political benefits.
There is no precise schedule for the office; with its majority in the Representative House, the Democratics could emphasize such an impact, but the decision on a real office was made in the Senate where Trumps' Republicans have the majority, and the perspectives of success of such procedures are therefore less.
Should he go to the board of Rackets "Sea Watch"?
Three men were arrested in Vienna, they should be assaulted and murdered in Libyan refugee pools.
The German Captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after she was arrested with the Sea Watch 3 ship and 53 libyan refugees on Border, unable to control the port of Lampedusa. After a strong protest and international criticism, also by Austrian Federal President Alexander van der Bellen, her home prison was returned to a few days from a Italian judiciary.
Now there are new severe prejudiciations against ratches. So three men who were subjected to torture in Libyan refugee pools would have arrived in Italy with the "Sea-Watch 3" of the "Sea-Watch 3". The suspects are taken into an acquiring camp in Mexico (Syria), after migrants had recognised their penners in Italy. "We can't exclude it, but they have no safe information on it," said "Sea Watch" speaker Ruben new constructioners of the German Press Agency.
The police was called by the police in Middle September that the suspects were assaulted, killed and even killed in the North African country. It was Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically discovered and executed, by repeated and permanent physical violence," said at that time, in the communication.
NGOs and aid organizations now point out that they can't know exactly who come to the ships. "We can't scan who are the people. They come without pass," said the new building. Folder is one of the main reasons why people run from Libya. So it's likely that the murders are also on the ships. "It's therefore very important that it comes."
Italian former Minister Matteo Salvini requested rackets that were still identified for an illegal immigration aid in Italy.
Musk seeks the delivery record at Tesla
The Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given its electronic auto-concerts with the perspective of new record numbers.
"We have the opportunity to reach our first quarter with 1000,000 delivery", Musk wrote in a email issued by the Branchen Blog "Electrec" employees.
The question is strong, so that Tesla could benefit 110,000 orders, it continued to write in Musks rounds. The challenge is to bring the cars to the customer. In order to provide Tesla to the quarterly as many resources as possible.
As a result, Teslas shared with more than six percent from the trade. So strongly the course has not been added for almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had been equipped well 95,000 cars and thus reached its best value.
Musk needs recursing to achieve its high objectives. 2019 he wants to deliver totally 360,000 to 400,000 cars. This requires six-year-old numbers. Especially the most favorable Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here are less than the winning rates. Despite the boom’s losses.
US Budget Street: Re-financed only a bridge
The new budget year will be started in the United States on 1 October without a general budget. The Senate has followed the Representative House on Thursday and has decided to transit finance until 21 November.
While the United States Congress and President Donald Trump in August have agreed to increase the expenditure limits for the financial year 2020 and 2021, the United States have decided before the new fiscal year starting October, once again without expenditure plans. The Senate has followed the Representative House on Thursday and has still taken a transitional financing (Continuation Resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without such decision, the Monday would be held on Monday on Wednesday, a partial department of the Federal Management.
Shutdown interrupted
The Federal Management will now be funded at the level and, according to the priorities of the expenditure plans for the end of the financial year 2019, which is not possible at the same time to the 12 expenditure laws that the various departments and authorities are funds; therefore, the federal administration cannot first benefit from the extent framework for the new financial year of 1.3 Bio. to $1.4.
Democratics have completed ten of the 12 laws in the Representative House, but the expenditure laws reflect priorities of the Democratics who have no chance in the senate dominated by the Republicns, and also have ten of the 12 expenditure plans, which are less likely to be more or less prepared.
The Spirits are mainly the theme of the resource allocation for internal security and border security. In the Senate, the Republicns are trying to strive $12 billion for the wall construction, one of the great priorities of President Trump. Democratics are cutting on the wall plans and their funding, which are actually for other military buildings and projects. The fight on the wall was already calied and led to a 35-day shutdown in December 2018.
The spirits are divided on the wall construction
It is unexpected to how the parties want to approach this issue. Probably as an agreement to all 12 expenditure laws in the coming seven weeks, the extension of transitional financing on November 21, and a shutdown is not then excluded.
In the context of the continuing incapacity of the conference, some of the twelve expenditure laws at the time, and the pertinent risk of a shutdown wins ideas on the automatization of the process to the publicity. Proposal S. 1877 for avoiding Shutdowns, the financing of the Federal Management would automatically continue at the previous year level, connecting the relevance of the parliamentarys and retaining their wages until the new annual expenditure plans are proposed.
France allows artistic freeze for lessons and Singles
In France, the artistic flexibility will also be opened by single women and lives: the Paris National Assembly agreed largely with a majority of the laws of the Government, after which all women are able to make an in vitro exercising in vitro, and the demand for anonymous seeds should be significantly increased.
The presentation also requires the approval of the Senate. In the three-day periods of emotional debates, critics had warned that in the right place there could grow a number of "children without father" in the future. The French Bishop Conference is also against the renewal.
The new arrangement is the main part of a bioethic sequence, which defended the Minister of Health Agnès Buzyn as "Chance" for society. It was the modern family, where children with only one part of their parents or homosexual parents are given. After their opinion, the costs for artificial experiences for all women of social insurance are required.
Prohibition with Sperma of all husbands
With a great majority of the national Assembly, the widow should return to an amendment for an artistic relief to the sphere of their dead husbands. In Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom, the artificial movement of "post-mort" was allowed. In Germany, there were cases where women were injured to the exit of a dead man's sperm.
Many deputy members of the Government party La Republic en Mare (the Republic in the movement, LREM) by President Emmanuel Macron and the deputy of the opposition had, however, expressed themselves on the artistic movement with the sphere of the murdered partner, and they pointed out that a widow would be a "double trauer" if the death of their husbands still remained unpleasant.
The initiativers of the current amendment are injustice that a widow can futurely be able to condemn the specimen of a unknown person but not with their own partner.
Before now, the artistic freeze in France only allows theeroexual pairs that cannot witness children. They must be married or at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that the maternality was still prohibited.
In Germany, the art flexibility of all women is theoretically open - for single or lesbian pairs, however, it is often difficult.
Equipment for climate: call for airlines for Uniteds will be slower
The high schools will be flewn, and therefore the country will also make a climate allocation there, and the rectors say that they had no money for it, but now they are also under pressure.
The high schools should also be limited to flight. Photo: dpa/Julian Street Schools
The discussion before the summer breakfast was held on a climate allocation to flights of universities and high schools. After the country rectorial conference skeptically reacted to a corresponding post from the green-free coalition, the plans are now supported from high schools. In a common statement, the doctors of six bath-wormberg universities and a padagogic high school for compensation of service flights. This is as a very "needly necessary step" in the same time, a broad debate on the flexibility of the fleet is stated in their opinion.
Russia reiterates North Korean fishermen
According to the secret service FSB, the prisoners were in the Russian waters to be covered. 10 days ago, 161 fishers from North Korea were arrested, and then there was a shooting between border protectors and boats. The three Russians and a North Korean, the fishermen later slaughtered their serious violations.
The Communist North Korea leads to chronic food shortages. The North Korean fishermen were then walking through Russian waters, where the Russian coastwaters runs, according to their own information on the protection of their multi-biological resources patrouilles.
30,000 thinfish swimming pocket
In the renewed controls, 30,000 pounds were discovered and invited to the boats. In addition, the information was invited after three fishermen and two motor boats and carried out after Suodka and Posjet at Wladiwostok.
The Russian fishermen also had not issued fellow licenses to the northern Koreans, and thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been arrested in this year.
The head of Russian fishing companies' association in the Province of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently condemned high environmental damages by the Northern Korean fishermen. They fished close synthetic networks that were prohibited in Russia, which would also help small lives from the sea. In addition, the networks would be simply covered in the sea where they needed 200 years to be destroyed.
Currently only 18.000: US depending on the asylum level
The "greatest nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with the selected police advisors in the White House.
The most rich country of the earth is shocked against protectors: As the Foreign Minister in Washington confirms, the upper limit for the legal access of refugees will continue to be deleted. In recently, it is important to receive threatened believers and Iraqi asylum.
However, the US government wants to cut the lowest borders for the adoption of new refugees, but in the year 2020, which is in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, at least 18.000 people should be left in the country, as the United States Foreign Minister stated.
The Government of President Donald Trump has triumphated the adoption of protective demanders from all the world in recent years.
The highlighting level of 18.000 refugees would be the lowest since the United States Refugee Programme in 1980. However, the United States minister called "the fullest and most powerful nation in history", a formulation which is strongly reminded of the use of the official US President.
A "responsibilities-conscious process" with refugees was able to describe that refugees can return to their homelands to help them rebuilding there. For his hard courses in migration policy, he receives a lot of right to the attendants, but there is also a massive critic.
In order to finance a border, Trump had the national emergency. If there is an temporary link between the current measurement and the current internal developments in the United States Headquarters, it is unexpected. Trump is currently under press because of the Selensky's employees and a possible threatening official restraint procedure.
The US government wants to concentrate on the adoption of two refugees groups in the future: people who are following because of their faith - and Iraqi who have helped the U.S. military in the country, and have been in danger, as the Declaration of the Foreign Minister is declared, with a maximum of 1500 refugees in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
The United States wants to achieve that in particular people from this "North Trieck" Mediterranean in other countries of Asylum, which have only concluded with Guatemala and now with El Salvador and Honduras migration agreements in order to develop migration to the Southern America border in Mexico.
The Court orders the release of individuals from Zoo to Zoo
A person-Utan woman was invoked on the desires of the Argentinan justice from the former Zoo of Buenos Aires in a Headquarter for Humans in the United States. The "Sandra" born in Rostocker Zoo in 1986 was bound to the rights of a "no-human person", therefore it was forced to be freed. The animal was brought to Dallas, but not as a passenger, but in a fraction, as the lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez declared.
Since the 53 kilograms of serious human efficiency is not able to adapt the life in the wilderness, it will be necessary to live in the free of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 more people and 31 smumps, including "Bubbles", former household of Popster Michael Jackson. "Sandra" is still a 40-day Quarantine in Sedgwick Zoo in Wikia in the United States.

Register for Swiss Extremberg Round: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extreme hills, Dani Arnold, have been a new husarenit at the nearly 3,000 meters of high skin in the Italian alpines.
Without the network, double land or other tools, the Swiss was 550 meters high of the big skin in a new record time.
Beat with Jeans, T-Shirt and only supported by absolute swimming freedom, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the resort. So he took the old Bestmark for almost 19 minutes.

Lifelanges Stadion prohibition for Racialism in Italy
For racist comments on football prophecy Juan Jesus by AS Rome, the United Nations from the capital of Italian city had a long-term stadion prohibition against a fan. Jesus, a defender from Brazil, was imprisoned by the fan on instagram. Jesus published the private news and asked his club to take steps.

The Italian authorities now have had 38 randalious fans of the register Juventus Turin with stadion bans. Four of them should not be involved for a period of ten years, they shared the police. For the exiles, they apply the prohibitions of four to seven years.
The fans are connected to launching investigations against 12 leaders of Ultra fans in the area of Juventus. The 12 are designed among other severe pressures, money weights and private violence. The club had made the findings with an indication last year.
Ultra leaders should switch out Italian media reports behind the black traffic of tickets. They would have been "military controlled" for the fankurve and have had to have pressed Juventus-military workers in order to come to more later cards.
Generation Z: Is it really different from Generation Y?
Millenniums are narcist, generation Z is political - all the years will be considered with valid names. If you look more accurate, the marks are full of contradictions. How do you really describe these labels the everyday life feeling of young people?
"The craps are coming!" On 21 September, officially started the crowd at the Gucheng Sea in Gaochun, which also declared the opening session of 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as it was announced by the Department of Public Working of Nanjing-Gaochun District Committees.
Gaochun, who is the Southern Exploitant of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental areas. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and is also the Chinese site of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has an environmental view of ideal conditions with a mixing of "30% mountains, 20% water surfaces and 50% fields". The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all the conditions to be rich.
In the early 1990s, the people in Gaochun have started with the rabbin snake.

Conflict between Iran and USA: Ruhani speaks from the end of the sanctions - Trump opposes
The Iraqi President Hassan Ruhani, after returning from the United Nations Volunteer Assembly of an appropriate offer of the United States to repair sanctions, declared Ruhani on its official website, in contrast to conversation with the Teheran leadership, that was the end of all sanctions.
However, President of the US Donald Trump was opposed to the Iranian Officer on Twitter: "The Irani wanted me to put up the sanctions against him so that there is a meeting. I said no."
Ruhani is the event: the Federal Officer Angela Merkel, the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the French President Emmanuel Macron had been present in New York, and would have struck that a meeting was held. "And America says I have taken the sanctions," added Ruhani. The type of crimes that should be completed has been held at the debate. "And they have clearly said we were on all sanctions."
However, if this is not acceptable, the criticized Ruhani. In view of the current criminal measures and "the dismissed atmosphere of the maximum pressure" no one can predict the start of negotiations.
In the beginning of the week, Kanzler Angela Merkel met Ruhani in New York and was the hope of the European people to save the nuclear agreements negotiated with the Iranian and the Islamic Republic to develop nuclear weapons.

Black earthquake near Istanbul - Fast 200 suites
After the western Turkey in a short time of two earthquakes, the fear of a catastrophy increased. 34 people were affected at the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the sunday, there were almost 200 posts, the Turkish Vice-President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
14 schools in Istanbul were closed by security reasons, and hundreds of buildings were damaged. The earthquake of the 5,8 had been shocked on Thursday, the Marmara region before Istanbul, and the Panic was dissolved in the millions of meters. Now the government wants to set a Commission to prepare a better country on earthquakes.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been prepared sufficiently on beasts, said Istanbuls Citizens-Master Ekem Imamoglu. In the city itself, the latter danger will always be ignored. Each year, badly built households - made by many smaller earthquakes that are regularly shocked by Istanbul.
Cities planners such as the famous architects Mucella Yapici have been warned for many years that large open areas in the centre have been built as refugees. First at the 20th anniversary of the Golcek Beds in August, the building chamber of Istanbul warned that estimated a million buildings in Istanbul were not a slaughter.
The Epicentrum of the beach from Thursday was located in the Marameer area of Silivri and around seven kilometers deep, as the Afad Protection Authority shared. A smaller neighbouring surrounded a few minutes later for more panics on the streets.
The Istanbulan citizensman Ekem Imamoglu was first not reported on Twitter, lost or damage. TRT showed people who were cut in panics from the houses. Schools were brought from the Silivri district for security reasons for the buildings. Some students wined as they were seeing images.
Istanbul is particularly threatened to the earth; under the maritime sea, a part of the so-called Northanatolic disaster is marked by the borders between the Eurasian and the Anatolic Earth Platt. Turkey will always be shocked by earthquakes. One of the most dead was the beast in Istanbul in 1999.
Researchers fear that a earthquake of 7.1 to 7.4 might threaten. But when it comes to the earthquake, it is not clear. At the earthquake on Thursday, there was again the west of the country and Istanbul.
Enterprises develop emergency plans, private bags called Go-Bags with all the needs finished by house doors, and schools make children help as they have to be taken when the earth wakes. When the next big beast comes, it's not clear.
The Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan said after his return from New York, eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered slightly damage. The Estonian citizensman Exem Immoglu followed the developments of the Istanbulan Catastrophe Coordination Center (Acom). After this information, two miners of Moscheen in the area of Avcilar and Sariyers.
Warning for afternoon in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users of Panik. buildings watched. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Phone guides were interrupted. It was stronger than the service day, writes a user. The chief of the Turkeyn red halfmonds, Kerem Clinik, warned by Twitter, called the people to stay close to the buildings that had had had perpetrated visible damages.
The time of the beach is specified according to official details at 13.59 p.m. Only a few minutes after the first beach, there was CNN Turkey's post that has been given with a strength of 4.0 on the direction scale.
First, on Thursday, a earthquake of strength 4,6 had shocked the Turkish maritime region - it was to show it until Istanbul. The Epicentum also has located in the sea west of the millions of meters, the Afad Protection Authority has already shared on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that was careful for slaughter lines on this Tuesday: Pakistan was also taken by a serious earthquake.
Scientists believe that it could come early or later to a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the sharing between the Tekton plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that they will ever be deployed - and massive damage.
The earthquake researcher Ersoy calculates that the earthquake is now a warning. If it became more likely, he said to CNN Turk. "This might be the signs of a larger earthquake", he said Ersoy to sender. "Free or later the great beast will come."
A few weeks ago, there had been an interference - the beast also solved great concerns in Istanbul. In Albania it had also given a strong earthquake just a few days ago - it had been 68 lost.
Parliament: New Drinkstoff in Ukraine
Two brinc documents are to ensure new substances in the U.S. appealing to the possible use of powerful misconduct by President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible official detention procedure, the US democrats see increase: the complaints of an anonymous referendum on Trump and its surrounded telephone with the Ukrainian President have made major points for investigation against the Presidents. Trump itself seemed to be more than the victim of a "Hexjagd". In addition, he decreed the credibility of the Whistlewer.
U.S.: Aeroports in United Airlines in Toilet - Flighted flights
Because a passenger was locked in the board toilet, a United Airlines flight was moved. The WC tour was blocked from Washington to San Francisco during the flight 1554 from Washington to San Francisco, the airline was shared with US media.
In a extra-planned inter-landing in Denver, the woman could finally be released from the close kitchen. At one hour she had been locked there, the U.S. media wrote to other passengers. To continue to fly in San Francisco, passengers had to change the machine.
In a video distributed on the Internet, which says that the US media of 1554 should be shooted, it is to see how many people try to free the woman. "We work at the moment to open the door, Ma'am. We'll get you out soon, okay?", says a man. The aircraft regreted himself at all flights. Open was opened first if the woman gets a delay.

It seems to be his mission to make the people's will to do, and it is decisive to stop anything and no one.
McEwan was sent to the words: "When the parliament is closed, the government can not be requested in a critical moment if the Minister is sweetless as the Soviet leader in high positions, if the Brexiteers were to spend the disaster of a No-Deal, then a writer should ask what he can do. It's just a answer: write." From McEwan was just in the early year of the Roman "machines like I" about artistic intelligence.

"This applies immediately and under the conditions that Thomas cook travelers of these hotels are immediately not immediately requested or needed for individual payment of hotel accounts."
Insurance reacted to the reports of hotel guests who were able to pay their accommodations on their own place, and some have to put up more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had criticized this very seriously.
As many hotels have been involved, the insolvent travel provider will be voted on Friday with the insolved traveller, said the insurance speaker.

Insolvency managers want to continue in Germany and find a future solution to the three Thomas Cook companies.
However, the current announced payments to hotels by the Zurich Insurance helps only travellers that are still walking. For Thomas Cook clients who are still wanting to fly in the holidays, it seems bad. On the late Thursday, the company shared all travellers, including October 31, shared it. This also resulted for such bookings that were already paid.
As it is about traveling starting from 1 November 2019, the company was opened. In vote with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure is tested, called it. In particular, it is responsible for this case also for the insurance of the insurance. The sale of new travels is stopped. dpa.
The company refers to the Zürich insurers that can be found by the company Kaera. clients may inform the possibilities of refunding the travel prices and apply their requirements on the Caera website.
Prince Harry destroyed splengmine in Angola
For a long time, Prince Harry continues the commitment of Lady Diana. In Africa, he is now walking directly on the spots of his mother.
With a blue slipter protection weight, the British prince Harry in Angola has cut a spring mine and destroyed.
In a camp of the British Halo Trust at the Dirico place on Friday morning, he launched a quarter of the TV cameras. In safe removal, the spring body explosed in the Savanian country without damage. Although only the Halo strip has destroyed more than 100,000 decades of pushing conflicts in the African country, there are still more than 1000 mining fields that are threatening the population.
On the fifth day of his African journey, Harry wanted to walk directly in the city of Huambo on the springs of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same Sprengmeister, who first joined his mother, he wanted to turn the way she went back.

Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have since Monday on a ten-day African travel that began in the South African Tourist Pole Capstadt.
Stockende Brexit negotiations: The danger of a No-Deal remains acute
In fact, Primer Boris Johnson had clearly determined: it will not provide a third decrease of the Brexit negotiations; but what explanation is possible to carry out at the polarising British forever. The recent sentence of the Supreme Court in Britain would be as a decrease of the Blondschopf. His suspension of Parliament to carry out its Brexit course until the date of arrival has been annuled.
Boris Johnson keeps the case for it.
However, the pressure seems not to be spoiled, and in this way he made it possible for the visit of a hospital Andeutings that, in the case of non-license until the end of October, he supported a prolongation of negotiations:
You know, we'll hold up the law.
At the same time, however, we are convinced that we will leave the EU to the 31th century.
I'm carefully optimistic that it's crazy.
And the time of the Brexit Manufacturers in Brussels all over the time, and over six weeks, the EU and the British Sub-Brittanians have had the difficulty to prevent the outcome of the European Union without agreements. However, the recent discussions have not been completed. A agreement seems to be present until the end of October. The British Prime Minister does not have the law, it is a renewing date of arrival. The opposition is not the words of the Prime Minister.
US officials: Additional mortal accidents by e-Zube
The number of losses related to the use of e-smokers in the United States has increased to 12 years, and in this connection, 805 adversely damaged in the United States, shared the CDC Health Authority with. A study in the New England Journal of Medicine has already been more than 900 affected, confirmed about 500 of it. The cause for lungs damage is still totally unclean. In Europe, there is not a similar increase in losses. The applicants seem to be limited to users in the United States.
The fear of new protests in Egypt increases
A million times, Mohammed Ali's videos were shared in online networks. The manufacturers and players in Spain calls for a "volks revolution". For the volks revolution today, he called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Egyptian militarys who offer critical corruption and miscarriage. Ali is expected to be massed with a million participants in central places of the country.
In any case, the security authorities are alarmed. In the centre of Kairo, there was already an increased presence of the police. Many U-Bahn stations remained closed, locked roads around the central Tahrir plate. In recent days, the police had strengthened their road controls and the hands of footgrounds were divided on news and photos related to the protests.
On September 20, the demonstrators also gathered around the Tahrir plate.
Last weekend, the security forces had been held in Kairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura to protest with hundreds of participants. A such open protest has not been given in Egypt for years. Successfully reacted to the security forces. According to the information of the Human Rights Watch of Human Rights (HRW) have been arrested for almost 2000 people since last week. Many of them had been recently arrested - only because they were "for a false time on the wrong place", they shared HRW in vocation to lawyers.
The organization also criticized the centres in the North African country. The government blocks Kairo websites and online services to bind further Protests against al-Sisi. The General governments the country since 2013, after he had destroyed the Islamic president Mohammed Mursi, thousands of Islamics, government enemy, bloggers and aktivists have been arrested and partially condemned in the past years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs from Grönland-Expedition
The Polarforscher Arved Fuchs was returned on Friday by his Greenland Expedition. He was welcomed at his arrival in Hamburg port, among others by the Skipper Boris Herrmann, the climate activist Greta Thunberg with the "Malicia" renard over the Atlantics.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs studied and documented the consequences of the earthwarming in the past months on his "Dagmar Aaen" ship on the Coast Islands and Greece.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the Polar researcher. He has expected for years that the youth generation was reporting to words. They knew that the earth was warming for decades. However, many of them did as a planet B.
"What happens on the sea is often found out of publicity", said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of the earthwarming and the destruction of the sea. When the expedition was improved with a droid of Greece and was pesed with microplastics, it was said.
For its "fighting for a sustainable and respectful use of the world's sea", the polar researchers from Bad Bramstedt, in the Hamburg climate evening, expressed the "Seadevcon Maritime Award". "For all those who survive the oceans in the heart, Arved Fuchs is a great example", said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the prices. "He is a testimony of changes that have been brought to the Arkites in the last decades."
There Spaghetti in Rome: Tourist payments for Nudeln 430 euros
430 euros for two tears Spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near England in Rome: This seemed to be too much Japanese tourists. The account of 80 euro drink payment was included by the two women, but they posted the departure on Facebook, which reacted with slight reactions.
"Solche cases are harmful to the view of Rome. We ask the police to ask to ask whether it is a fraud about this," a speaker of Federation requested the association of travel leaders in Rome according to the Roman Day Journal Il Messaggero (Freeday Exhibition).
Soon the reaction of the owners of the restaurant. Japanians had not only ordered Spaghetti but also fresh fish, justified the local owner. However, this is not to take out of the account. A drinking payment from up to 20 percent of the account was normal, the guest said.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is cut? President Donald Trump could be faced with the turbulent enthusiasming last days with an official detention procedure, which democracy wants to investigate in the Representative House as soon as possible - the speech is from weeks until a decision would be taken.
At the beginning of the skandals, the telephone calls with the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj. The proposal of the Whistleblower, which has finally taken the discussion on national security and the democracy of the United States with its complaints, is monstrous: the President has misused its power to instrumentize the government of another country to influence the election 2020. He has used the dependance of Ukraine in this way and wants to force them to be actived against a political enemy.
The Kern of this project is also to complete the digest of the conversation with Selensky, although it does not return to the complete word. The phonemat of 25 July is only an episode of a much greater history, in which the center is mainly next to Trump his own lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story takes from the view of the public in May 2019 its beginning when the New York Times of Reiseplanes reports in Ukraine. He wants to meet in Kiev with the elected President Selenskys, and the lawyer knows that his purposes are very heavy. "We don't take us into a choice that we're not going to make in a finding which we have the right," says the newspaper. I can say that it's unlikely, but "daran is nothing illegal."Juliani wants to be followed in Ukraine for the investigations that there's no basis for a "while this information is very helpful for my people and may be helpful for my government."
The lawyer and former New York citizensman seems to have been infected with the right conspiration fans that have been fixed on Trump's co-kandidat in the election of 2016: Hillary Clinton has conspirated with actors in Ukraine, then critics said to build a place for Russian Emirates in the United States. However, this provision was never serious.
This is about the exact findings of the Trump in July on the phone with Selensky, which says: The former Vice-President and the current candidates for the Presidency of the Democratics, Joe Biden, have been the Ukrainian Officer of Obama on the release of the former Ukrainian General Officer Wyctor Schokin. However, to stop the investigation of the Gas company in the Council of Supervisory of its son of Hunter-Biden, the senior has financed Ukrainian financing for the corruption of his family.
In fact, the end was something different. When Joe Biden requested that the Ukrainian general lawyer should go, the investigations against the gas company were already closed, the shokins had never had been directly affected. Scokin was also proposed the most corrupted shocks that the US government was not the only Western partner who was on his displacement. In overall, the Obama government also supported the investigation against the company.
Disorders at Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disasters at Instagram and Facebook. In particular, Germany, England and Spain are affected. The users report that Facebook has not always been loaded since 15.30 p.m. Instagram also shows that the error message was not able to load contents. What app seems to be affected by the distortion, even if it is not at the same time.
Instagram and co. opening of disorders
It is not the first massive crash in this year. Provided in March and July the services were deleted for several hours. As in the previous cases, users also turn back to Twitter in order to make their bad air.
Polish scientists in Antarctica saved
Three Polandian scientists were saved from the chilean air weapons from the ice of Antarctic. They were with a shooting boat on the road and several miles away from their base as their motor was shipped. They had lucky in unfortunately - less than one hour needed the chilean saving shooter for the discussion.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4 Chile Air Force:
"At 9:30 we received the message for a short time before we started, and a good 20 minutes later we were over the shooting boat."
In Poland since 1977, Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station, 19 scientists worked there. The frozen researchers were safely returned to their research station.
Note: Download Smartphone NIE cableless
Practical, but harmful
Indutive technology through Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
Since the last time there were several new smartphones on the market, supporting cableless downloads and sell themselves very well - all before the new iPhone-11 models, we would like to call a study of early July in memory. The free load of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not appropriate.
Higher temperature to battery
Scientists are warned before the cableless load of Smartphones. This is, according to the expertise of the University of Warwick, extremely harmful for the devices. For this reason, there is a significant higher heat development. A phone normally by cable is loaded within three hours on 27 degrees. In cableless downloads, the researchers themselves have been loaded in perfect direction of the smartphone on the ladepad as well as measuring more than 30 degrees. Leave the phone somewhere beyond the sleeves, increases the temperatures even higher.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature is an important factor for the slowness of batteries. As each degree plays a role. When loading higher temperatures, the battery is not only to the capacity but it also has not seen as long as it was. The life period is slower. The researchers reason to load the smartphone constantly by cable. As a battery is constantly connected with modern smartphones, it would have to be more helpful. Apple has the costs for a battery even increased.
Practical
The technology is extremely pleasant:Indeed, the device is loaded on a suitable loadpad - they are already in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the bathroom will be loaded without a quiet cable salt and powerful steel flight. As it is used to Qi (inductional energy transfer) a global standard, where even apple is soon enough, there is little limitations. However, the machine should be used only by the researchers in derogation.
Everest-Stau photo: 13 8 thousand in six months
A nepalese mountain rising in the only six months of 13 of the 14 highest mountains of the world. Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the pitches of the Manaslu in Nepal and ordered a record, shared its expedition event.
The former soldier wants to reach all 14,000 months in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He once made international slaughter lines: from him is a photo of mountain-sized hills that are on the Mount Everest Slange.
The image of the Massenand Rand solved a debate on strengthening security measures on the 8848 meters higher mountains and the highest crowd of the earth. In May, 11 clusters died within the last few days.
A problem for Purja may be the relief of the 14th-eighth thousands: China's authorities now learn the Xixabangma beg in Tibet. As a result, it is called in other bad weathers. The first week Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wants to talk to China to him to make it up.
Four all elephants on Sri Lanka found
Among the dead animals are also a tragic elephant cup, a police speaker shared on Friday. "We believed that the elephants were revivaled."
The four castles were found in a protective area near the famous and many tourists, and the animals were probably known to the police speaker between 15 and 25 years. It was ordered for an autopsie to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed each year. The killers are often farmers in which the animals were predominantly observed. Similarly, about 50 people are killed by elefants. This is usually happening when the animals are moving nearly to the village of their live space.
According to estimates in Sri Lanka, only about 7.000 elephants live. The death penalty is theoretically.
Conserved British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British Oil Tanker "Stena Impero" allowed more than two months after his establishment by Iran the port city Bandar Abbas. This gave the seaquarter of Bandar Abbas known according to the news agent IRNA. The Iranian Revolution Gardens had established the tanker under the British flag on 19 July under the provision to have cut the rule of the sea law in the Persian Golf.
Thomas Cook Management in the Critics
The competent Economic Committee of the Subcommittee wants to investigate the role of the traveling Thomas Cook, which is to go as well as to the question why the British government did not want to contribute financially to the surviving enterprises. "We are interested in supervision in the company as well as in the control of external books", said the President Rachel Reeves in London. "Openly we have to do it with a very example of management managers."
According to experts, gene will be exceededed at dark brain risk
The role of the gene in the family increased dark cancer risk is obviously exceeded. In this conclusion, researchers of the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) Heidelberg in a current study. Other risk factors such as family food habits are likely to be more likely to be taken than ever. This has resulted in calculation of the individual carcinour risk, stressing the DKFZ knowledge.
Elon Musk allows to increase Tesla actions
This wrote Musk on a email to Tesla employees published on Thursday (Original time) by the Branchen Blog "Electric". The question is strong, so that Tesla could visit 110'000 orders, it continued to write in Musks round.
The challenge is to bring the cars rapidly to the clientship. Tesla should provide as far as possible as many resources.
Income: Teslas shares went with more than six percent from the trade. So strongly the course has not been added for nearly four months. In the second quarter Tesla had produced a good 95'000 cars and thus reached its best value.
Musk needs recursing to achieve its high objectives. 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400'000 cars. This requires six-year-old numbers. In particular, the most favorable Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here are less than the profit rates. Despite the boom's losses.
Will the British government start to Brexit-Setz? Johnson Return
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson considers whether he is looking for an circle of the last legislation decided by Parliament against an unregulated Brexit; on a question, he only said on Friday before journalists that his government will hold its right.
The law proposes that the Government should ask for a movement of the end of output should not be achieved by the EU until October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitalization law", which has delayed the negotiations with the EU.
The former British Prime Minister, John Mayor, had expressed the conviction on Thursday, Johnson could try to "political skane" to implement the law. Johnson could set up a procedure strike that changes the entry into the law at the time after the EU membership.
Johnson said he tries to adopt a treaty with the European Union. "We are likely to leave the EU on October 31, and the best way is the one with an agreement."
Iran flys obvious uranium adherence up
Iran's President Hassanō has increased the pressure on the saving of the historical Atom Agreement on the European Contracting Partners in the fight. "The leadership shows the European States inability or lack of availability when it goes on concrete action," said the Thursday, in a press conference at the New York United Nations Assembly on Thursday. In the case that they did not make their promises, he put "wise steps" away from the agreements of the possible negotiated agreement of 2015.
The conflict on the international agreement on the prevention of an Iranian atomic bomb, which was opposed to normalize Teheran's economic relations. The United States, in 2018, decided to impose Iran with the "maximal pressure" to a course of a aggressive nahost policy. The Government of President Donald Trump wants to deal with a new agreement with urgence-related stocks, and then reacted on hard sanctions against Teheran.
The International Atomenergy Authority (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now used or prepared the use of Uran at the beginning of September, and, at least, the IAEA has prepared the construction of more than 300 other centres.
Maybe the Europeans were not ready to take their part in the contract and, therefore, the Iranians left with the costs and the last pressing United States sanctions alone; but it will also give further discussions, which hopedly have a solution.
Estimate Iran's development in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after attacking a significant oil plant in Saudi Arabia in September, the municipality has changed: Germany, France and the United States estimated that Teheran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Huthi revolts supported in Jemen were known to the attack, which was evaluated by the United States as a false recognition. "We have nothing to do with this," acknowledged  Rowland in the midday afternoon.
"They who are in charge must prove that this is the evidence of this," said Gregor. However, it would have not agreed with him during the UN General debate. Instead, they would only claim that the rebels in Jemen could not execute a attack like this, in the past days with the Federal Kansler Angela Merkel, President Emmanuel Macron and the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
For possible meetings with President of the United States Trump, the wide sanctions of the United States administration should first be dealt with, he requested the government in Washington to convert to a policy of "dialog and conciliation".
Commits of other stars crossing the sun system
Astronomists currently observe a commit from the deep of the world. This has been once before. The commit allows resignation to other sun systems.
What was just a confusion, it is now confirmed: A intersystemal guest crossed by our sun system. The commit from the depth of the world has been baptized after his discovery on 2I/Borisov and has the interest of astronomers throughout the world.
The largest commit was discovered on August 30, by the amateur starman Gennadi Borissow at the Margo Observatory, with a self-building telescope of 65 centimeters of diameter. After observing the various observers, they confirmed not only that it was an unknown committee, but also showed that he was not out of our sun system.
2I/Borisov has been viewed after 1I/'Omuamua of 2017 only the second interstar object that has been viewed at a flow of our sun systems.
2I/Borisov offers the rare opportunity to obtain astronomies from nearly an extraordinary sun system before he disappeared. First observations show that the interstellary committee of which our systems are different, as reported by the astrophysical Institute of Canars. "The current speed of the committee is about 150,000 km per hour, which is significantly above the typical speeds of objects that are around the sun," reported about David Farnocchia of the US Radio Aviation Authority in a communication.
The commit is also responsible for the appointment and categoryization of sky bodies. To honor of his discovery, the inter-screen swifsters, which first had been conducted under the catalogue number C/2019 Q4, which indicates the name 2I/Borisov, which is the first part of the name that it is for the second inter-actoral object that has been discovered in our so-system.
The astronomes have happiness: On the contrary to 1I/'Omuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been viewed in the flight. Thus the researchers remain a few months for research. "The object will reach the largest light in the midst of December and then be seen with the medium-sized telescopes," explained Farnocchia. "To October 2020, it will only be observed with larger and professional telescopes".
several observers have already taken the visitors. Thus a team of Karen Meech from the Hawaii University, who had already led to the characterization of 1I/'Omuamua, shows a significant swift of the committee in a first study.
Scientists and researchers of the Astrophysical Institute of Canarys (IAC) have already won a first named spectrum of the interstelary Sweefster that offers a kind of finger impression of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is different of the committees of our sun systems, and it knows that the composition must be similar," reported the IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation is closely high that compositions in other solar systems could be formed by similar processes as in our complete León's college Javier Licandro.
The discovery of two inter-screen visitors within only two years shows that these objects can open a new way to investigate certain solar processes in other sun systems, but how often such styps are, however, is still difficult to deal with. One of the next intersystem visitors may be a planned satellite mission of the European Railway Agency Esa.
The Agency wants to store the three-party space "Comet Interceptor" (in fact, comit-depths) on a waiting position of 1,5 million km from the earth. It is like to spend the swimming point of Esa scientist director Sunther Hasinger or to spend on an unrelated, fresh coma from our own sun system, or to visit intersystemal visitors like 1I/'Oumamua.
First load on Pekings new Mega-Airport Daxing
Recently before the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic, it is so large: At the new Mega airport in the south of the chinese capital is a first passenger machine of the United Airlines, a special honor for Captains and Crew.
By 2022, about 45 million flights are to be completed annually, 2025 should be 72 million. Chinese President Xi Jinping announced the opening of 450 billion projects. The recent Chinese press project is also called "Seestern" because of its sixth building structure.
The complex has four start- and landway trains, which will be expanded later to seven and is equipped with the world’s largest automatic transport system. A new U-Bahn transports passengers in only 20 minutes in the town of Peking.
Soon during the building, the Chineses had been able to learn from Berlin from Peking several times. The opening of the building in 2006 - and significantly smaller - the main airport in Germany has been moved to the same time. Nevertheless, in Peking, the first passenger machine was launched for four years.
New surrounding aircraft is to fly 2030: In four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in only four hours - the British Railway Agency UK Space Agency is dreaming. It may be to do this for the over-time flights (Synnergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which developed the company's Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, quoted the US Sender CNN. "This is the technology that can be edited finally", said the Agence Graham Turnock. "We are talking about the 2030s for the invasion, and the work is already continuing."
In order to advance the project, the British Railway Agency wants to cooperate closely with the Australian aircraft. A flight from the main city of New York to the Australian Metropole is now at about 20 hours. As the only overall aircraft for passenger transport, the Concords of 1976 to the establishment of its operation in 2003, the New York City was discovered and used for three to three hours by half hours. In 2000, the United States’s shipping airport Charles de Gaulle came to an accident at the start of an accident on the Paris Airport. In all 109 invasions, the US-American Lock of Locked Placked, known with the US-Raal-RGB, has also entered into the programme.
"Sabre will make the world more smaller with its high speed-up-to-Punkt transport", writes Reaction Engines, among others on its home page. The sare drive could be used for efficient travellers with a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as soon as the steel. Additionally, such aircrafts can also be accessible outside the stores and allow the "first generation of re-useable rail drivers".
Accommodation in Washington: Trump wants to explore anonymous tips in Ukraine
In Ukraine's appeal for possible power-free use of the President of the US, Donald Trump wants to observe possible skilled places in the white house.
"I want to know who has given the Whistleblower the information", said Trump on Thursday before the United States Embassy workers at the United Nations in New York. The person concerned is almost a "a spon" and has changed in the past "a little different" than today.
The event was not public, but many US media distributed audio media on Friday on the conversation. Democratics responded to the statement of the President.
The Democratics in the United States Representative House had announced preparations for an office-related procedure against Trump, especially on the written complaints of an an anonymous secret worker, the serious accused of Trump and its government centre, which had been made publicly on Thursday Day.
In his work, the Whistleblower wants to receive information from several government employees, as the President of the United States "uses the power of its offices", to achieve that another country is infringed to its profits in the United States 2020.
In the centre of the predecessor, a strict telephone between Trump and the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj is encouraging his official colleagues to investigate his political rivals, Joe Biden, which was about former businesses of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine, and pleasant efforts to protect his speech before the Ukrainian justice.
The Whistleblower acknowledged the White House, in view of the Ukrainian Telephone, also the discussion: Leaders of government workers would try to keep the exact expression of the conversation under the box. How normally a electronic Word Language Protocol was prepared. This should be published after the discussion on the instruction of lawyers from the White House, but from a common data database, which was provided in a specially protected system, and only a large discussion protocol was published.
The identity of the instructor is not publicly known. The New York Times reported that it is an employee of the foreign secret Service of the CIA.
Trump reiterated the credibility of the source in question on Friday. In a series of Tweets to the theme, the President wrote, among others, that "ashing Whistleblower" has distributed information from the second hand that had been unacceptable, so it may have not been possible to give a tip or a spione.
As Trump was expressed in New York about those who had to play the Whistleblower information, but resolved, and the Chairman of the United States Representative House, Nancy Plosi, reacted to anxiety and accused of the Trumps statement, raised the integrity of the government once again.
In the Representative House for months, different research in various committees against Trump and its environment have been conducted. In view of the Ukrainian warfare, democratics are now being investigated with a new sense to put up a possible functional procedure against Trump in Gang.
"The Whistleblower gave us a driving plan for our investigation," said the head of the Secret Service Committee in the Representative House, Adam ship. Trump shocked ships, a false show of things before him and reiterates the return of the Chairman. Trump was shocked regularly and requested for the return of the committee for months ago.
More than 300 former US government employees from the security and external policy areas, mostly under democratic, but also under the Republicn presidents, have been held in a statement published on the voluntary day after the possible investigation of the democratics, and if the prosecution was protected, it would be called by Trump.
There is no precise time for the other processers; with the majority of the representative House, the Democratics could, however, emphasize a so-called execution procedure, but the decision on a real office was made in the Senate where Trumps' Republicans have the majority, and the perspectives on success of such procedures are therefore less.
VW Administrative Council: jobs are decreased
The VW Market plans, in which the production continues, could go to the latter of the production in Germany and Europe, and this concerns the bus-building Council, and the market will depend on its annual factory costs of ten billion euros to 2023 to two billion euros, which will already be allocated to 500 million euros in this year.
A key is the staff costs: 2016 between enterprises and the Employment Council negotiated "success package" is already seeing the decrease of 14.000 jobs in Germany only until 2020. In particular, a job place can only be reduced when a car manufacturer is almost evidenced that the related activities are not needed.
However, as our newspapers are now produced from operating crystals, jobs in the production, which are not in fact "speaking" on a different way, so on the official course.
In these cases, the Operation Council has no possibility to prevent the redistribution. In the meantime, it is unlike many staff to take the labour detention, the concerns for a total exemption of the vehicles would be greater. In order to ensure that vehicle production could be decreased after and from Germany and Europe, because they are more favorable in other parts of the world.
Marke VW wants to standardize the world's production and control new projects centrally. This also aims to reduce costs and to accelerate decisions, including the goal to increase productivity and to ensure competitiveness. Andreas Tostmann's production plan said on a management conference in Berlin: "Graduate in unsafe times from Brexit to the threatening trade war between the United States and China, we are well advised to make us a crisis."
To this way it has been successful: so, for example, this year first, since 2013, the production costs for vehicles are compared to the previous year. Tostmann said that the production period for the Golf 8, which will be presented on 24 October in Wolfburg, should be reduced to 1.1 hours. Exact numbers for the production period call VW not, according to the information of our newspapers it is located at the Golf 7 around.
20 hours.
Our region is the only VW-fabric of Wolfsburg which is produced in the vehicles. The works of brain swimming and salt guitters are produced. For Wolfsburg, the VW internal rules apply that there are 800,000 cars to be built in order to be satisfied with the work. 2018, however, the extradition in Wolfburg was only about 700,000 vehicles - provided by the slightest essential demand and the problems in the revision of the new consumption and gas test process WLTP.
As Tostmann's production rate has already been announced last year, however, a million cars in Wolfburg have to be rolled "perspektive" in the band, which is intended to make the swimming of the golf production in the stamwork - because Zwickau's work is depending on the location of the e-auto-production.
Furthermore, SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfburg. However, the sales numbers of Golf and Tiguan have recently been developed, and therefore the expectations of the Golf 8. It must now remain all of the efforts to build e-mobility first the Wolf and Butter autonomy of the Wolfburgers.

If the company does not return to the negotiation table, the company will inform "a 14 October on the workshop measures in the LH Congress," Daniel Flohr shared the Ufo Tarif proposal on Friday.

In addition, it is the question of whether the company has legally announced the tariff contracts to the airhansa.
In this regard, Ufo is now enhanced under a decision of the Francfurt law. Airhansa wanted to make sure that the tariff contracts were not announced; the Court reaffirmed the applications.

The Ufo had justified, because of the doubt, a sentence in its leadership, which was already undertaken on the strike of the cobine personnel at Eurowings at the end of July.

Eberesque and wild Rosscania threatened
In Germany, most of them were threatening Eberes (Sorbus), said one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency. "The majority are threatened because the populations are small, or through the transformation or weakness of their lives."
It seems very bad to the common Russians. It's being "feated" since 2017, two levels of the IUCN scale. The largest threat is located next to a pillar of the Balkan minimode. It has been widely extended from the whole continent and has little natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild rockcania (Aesculus hypocastanium) in Europe by less than 10,000 exemplary. In this assessment, it does not take account of the Bumes in cities, parks and all.

Rarely like snakes played a key role in the recycling of nutrients on the ground and are an important food source for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation of many overwhelmed and underestimated species is precarious to form the backgrad of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, Director of the European Union of IUCN. "We have to limit the effects of people on our ecosystems and make priority to the protection of these species."

The Chief of the United States Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pa, warned the federal government to trust the Chinese network operator Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too large," said the Father to the "Handelsblatt" with regard to the construction of the new 5G mobile network.
China has an "national security law", which is obligation to follow the instructions of the security bodies of each undertakings under Chinese law.
The applicable law also prohibites the enterprises to inform third parties about such demands, as the FCC Chief continues, and it is very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.

Germany must invest and now, as soon as possible,," said Le Maire on Thursday at the presentation of the French budget for the next year.
The economy in the euro area is weak, the Minister warned.
We should not wait until the economic situation is worse to take the necessary decisions."
These countries should have acted with more investments, inter alia Le Maire, with regard to Germany.
France did not have these playing spaces to add the minister and spend on the high debt of its country, which is in more than 98% of the Brutto Inland Product. The French State debt should be "stable" and "stable", said Le Maire.

Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson no question about Brexit tactics
The British Prime Johnson criticizes the "capitalation law" adopted by Parliament.
Parliament has returned to a law to the British Prime Minister to avoid a chao brexit, but the critics are afraid that Boris Johnson could still use a smooth, but this is what the Tory policyers say.
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson considers whether he wants to implement an unregulated brexit, despite the last legislation decided by Parliament, which is to prevent it exactly, and Johnson said only before journalists, his Government will hold its right to the right.
The law proposes that the government should ask for a movement of the end of exit should not be achieved by the EU until October. Johnson criticizes this as a "capitalization law", which has delayed the negotiations with the EU.
On Thursday, the former British Prime Minister, John Mayor, was able to try to "political scanners" to implement the law. The First Minister could set a procedure strike which turns into force of the law on the time after EU agreement. Johnson said to adopt a treaty with the European Union. "We are convinced to leave the EU on October 31, and the best way is the one with an agreement."
Johnson's chief advisor dominic Cummings stated that he accepted the political discussions on the Brexit as "Spacing in the park" and showed himself that the aimed EU access was still encouraging: "We will enjoy what we will win, we will be (e.g. red: come out of the EU) no concern," said the British newspaper "Telegraph" in accordance with a book view.
Cummings, who led the Brexit Campagne "Vote Leave" during the election campaign before the EU Referendum 2016, now functions as chief Strategy in the British government Hall Downing Street. He has to shoot behind the uncompromised policy that the Primer has led to a slightly free situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all standed before the camera of Linda McCartney, who became one of the great rock photographs. But it must not always be the great love. The photobook "The Polaroid Diaries" (Taschen) looks a deep in the entire private world of McCartney.
Paul McCartney, who was married to Lindas in 1998, was apparently proud and encouraging when he presented the "The Polaroid Diaries" band in the middle of September in Victoria and Albert Museum in London.
After the Launch Event, McCartney wrote at Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a fleeful view in life of an extraordinary family from time before instagram, a party for the ability of LindaMcCartney as an engaging artist and the emergency magie of the polyroid film."
With Linda McCartney, who had studied the art history at the university of Aizona until she found the photograph, the camera was always there. Thousands of polyroids have made it, some hundreds of these are now published in the "The Polaroid Diaries".
There are portraits, styles, landscapes, several hasters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interestors from the early 1970s to the late 1990s. "He wanted real moments", writes the artist Ekow Eshun in his term. And of course, there is still another one in the middle point: your husband Paul - as you may have never seen him.
When he danced with her daughter Mary on the shoes, calls in the bathroom with a sweet on the head or brings an unfair moon boat. Surely, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but there was a part of the shooting light on their farm in Southern Greatland or Scotland also leading a very normal life. So Mary McCartney said to BBC that she would have been sleeping as a baby in a bed that was buried with her father from old cartoffels. And it was not always in the McCartneys.
As little as a other media, the Poloraid camera starts the immediate moment. Linda McCartney's inceptions are certainly a kind of family daybook, but they are much more than clean shoes.
It's about the decided click: you must recognise if a great photo happens before you. And then you have to kick it exactly in the right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you can get two seconds later or two seconds ago, it may be a completely different photo." And Linda had the gift to start exactly the right moment. "He knows that she had it," said Paul in the Eshun-Essay.
That is true the light, the composition, the image extraction and the colors, which "The Polaroid Diaries" makes not only a deep picture book for Beatles fans, but also a great athletic advantage, where landscapes have already been affected as astray. The perfect addition to the new Beatles album "Abbey Road", which has appeared over 50 years ago.
"We're gonna buy further oil and gas from Iran."
In spite of the importation of oil and gas from neighbouring countries, the Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday, that Turkey could not abandon the import of oil and gas from Iran.
We will purchase our earthquake from there," said Erdogan in New York, where he had participated in the UN volunteer Assembly.
However, it was noted that Turkey had problems in the import of Iranian terrestrian import, since some undertakings had been "returned to the US drugs".
Nevertheless, Turkey will "prosequently continue in this issue and in many other matters our relationship with Iran," said the Turkish President, who has repeatedly criticized the United States networks against Iran in the past.
Since the international Atomic Agreement, the United States follows a policy of the "maximal pressure" against the Islamic Republic, which has been a nuclear programme in the secret and does not hold the agreement.
Their sanctions have caused Iran's oil export and a serious economic crisis in Iran, and in the past months the wages in the Golf region have significantly increased.
US government wants to limit the inclusion of refugees
The United States government wants to be drastly limited to the registration of refugees, and the United States Foreign Minister stated on Thursday that the annual overwhelming level of a new-development programme was to be deleted from 30,000 to 18.000 refugees, which corresponds to a total of 40%.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the United States would continue to see the support of refugees, but the most important task is to protect and serve the US citizens.
The US government wants to concentrate on the inclusion of two refugee groups: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqi who have helped the United States military in the country, and are in danger, as the Declaration of the Foreign Minister is declared; but from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador must be included by a maximum of 1500 refugees.
In the 1980 programme, refugees from UNO camps are selected and newly settled in the United States. The overwhelming level of 18.000 refugees for the budget 2020 would be the lower in the history of the programme. As the current overwhelming level of 30,000 is a depth value. When the president of US Donald Trump, Barack Obama, left the white house, was about 85,000.
Help organizations responded to the announced decline of the top limit. "This is a very tragic day for America," said the Chief of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. The United States would continue to damage their leading role in protecting the most vulnerable people of the world.
Trump tries to limit immigration to the United States - legally as illegal - strictly. The US government expects its own details for the coming year of asylum 350,000. These figures are separated from the new registration program.
Donald Trump - "Come a split near"
U.S. President Donald Trump has regarded the Whistleblower officer of the Spionage. Whoever always wants to make him powerful misconduct has changed the corresponding instruction, "It's close to the Whistleblower, said Trump's registration of a private event on Thursday in New York. This report corresponds to several US media.
Thromp said to workers of the United States Mission. When he was asked after the person informed the Whistleblower about rounded operations in the white house, he said: "This comes near." Then Trump added: "You know what we have done in old times when we were broken?" Right. The Spione and Verrat, we used to do something different than we do now."
The observers estimated the possible impact on death punishment. Democratics were deeply criticized by Trump's explanations and prompted the assault of witnesses. It also tried to defeat a congress survey to a possible official decision-making procedure, writes the Chairman of the Committees for Foreign Affairs, Secret Services and Supervisory in the Representative House.
The Whistleblower proposes the President's complaint to have a misuse of his office in a country in the United States 2020. It is, among others, about his circled telephone with his Ukrainian Office Wolodymyr Selenskyj in the summer: in the conversation, the Trump closed to him to investigation against his possible democratic deficiency, Joe Biden and his son. Trump is able to keep a shock.
It is not clear that those who are both the Whistleblower itself and their informants. As reports the New York Times, it should be an analysis at the Whistleblower.

Location immediately set: WeWork allow real estate markets to sit
WeWork was the largest officer in New York.
Within less than years, WeWork increases from the small startup to driving force on the most costly real estate markets in the world. But now the company is in the crisis. Weakers need to fear milliarity income.
The crisis of the officer WeWork threatens the balance on the largest real estate markets of the world. The company had been able to win for the next weeks and months before the reasons for Adam Newmann, to move the planned bridge and to sell girls and values, such as the private item for the leadership forces, and to win the financial space for the coming weeks and months. In addition, the British "Fincial Times" WeWork reported the end of new advertisements with immediate effects. This is among other in New York and London's largest midst of offices.

To lose the loss of the new company, the firms must now be switched up the emergence and the new swallowing of the floors.
According to the "Financial Times" WeWork has concluded a period of up to 15 years with the obligations of more than 40 billion dollars, not only for the company itself and its investors, but for the whole real estate markets.

Only WeWorks assured that the demand for offices in New York was higher than the new markets in that time. Without the Works Expansion, the Office Learning in the US-Metropole would be held in this period, as Alpert wrote in the "Business Insider" in London.
In the main city, the weight of the real estate market could also be seen without any further expansion of the aggressive startup. WeWork’s headmasters, in a year ago, from Spain-Fonds provider Deka for nearly 100 million euros sales office houses in the center of the Financial Metropolis.
Many employees have made their real estate for the requirements of WeWork with high investments.True WeWork, to make its business model soon profitable, should be able to register a part of the expected billion income. Access to the - without cutting - reserves of WeWork have not even the long-term merger contracts.

The Russian coastal wave again has been held against the northern Korean fishermen. In the past few days, there were over 262 Wilders who had been illegally fished in the waters, the Russian internal secret service FSB of the Interfax was shared on Friday.
First ten days ago, 161 fishermen from North Korea were arrested. Before the border shooters were shot and three of them were blessed. This time it hasn't led. The Communist North Korea leads to chronic food missing.
The North Korean fishermen were in Russian high waters. The Russian Coastwave runs on their own details on the protection of their multi-biological resources. In the renewed controls, the information was discovered in three fishing boats and two motorboats, called Suodka and Posjet at Wladiwostok. The Ria Nowosti Agency established over 8,000 residents in 2018.
The Russian fishing authority had also not issued fellow licenses to the northern Koreans, and thousands of fishermen from North Korea have already been arrested in 2019.
The head of Russian fishing companies' association in the Province of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently condemned high environmental damages by the Northern Korean fishermen. They also fished close synthetic networks that were prohibited in Russia, which would also have helped small lives from the sea. In addition, the networks would be simply discharged in the sea where they needed 200 years to be devastated.
The FSB later died after his infringements. On September 17, Russian border protectors set up a North Korean boat first and then a second after opening the fire.

New Climate Protests of Fridays for Future
One week after the greatest international climate protections today, thousands of people want to go on the road for more climate protection.
The movement of Fridays for Future renews actions and conjunctions in twenty-five countries. The beginning of the New Zealand and Australian switch was to make the protests from Europe to North America, where the climate activeist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a large assembly in the Canadian Montreal. It was also wanted to join the White House in Washington.
How large the world's access to this Friday after the recording of the evening, it is relatively unclean. Thunberg itself was good things. " Last Friday has been over four million people for the climate. This Friday we do it again," she wrote on Twitter. As long as it had given 6383 actions in 170 countries, she complemented it.
In particular, in Germany, the past Fridays for Future was very large. A good third of all world demonstrates - about 1,4 million - had been stimated by Fridays for Future in 575 German cities. This time, a list of movements planned at least 65 cities. In Metropolies such as Berlin, Hamburg, München and the Columbia, but also in smaller communities and cities as Jews in the northeast of the West or West, people want to go to the road.
In the age of 15 years, Thunberg was placed before the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 in order to encourage their country's policy to make a greater use of climate protection, and in a short time, the Fridays for Future movement has been made, particularly students and students, but also growing in a growing range of researchers and other adults.
They are in common calling for more honor for the policy to fight the earthquake and the threatening climate disaster, especially under the Paris climate Agreement, the global warming is under 1,5 degrees compared to the pre-industrial time.
Thunberg was attended just a month ago after a two-week transatlantic tricks in New York, where she had finally participated in climate protections and assemblies of the United Nations. In Monday she held an emotive talk to the United Nations State and Government heads of the Earth. In her home Stockholm, she was talking about the use of more climate protection of the alternative nobel price of the Law Live Hoofst.
Russia prohibits smoking on the balcony
The people in Russia do not have to smoke anymore on the balcony. This looks like a change in the burning protection. "This is also applicable to smoking", said a speaker of the Ministry of Emergency on Thursday in Moscow of the Agent Tass. The ban is to enter into force on 1 October.

New World Climate Protests of Fridays for Future
One week after the greatest international climate protections, but thousands of people want to go to roads for more climate protection.
The movement Fridays for Future renewed actions and competitions in twelve countries to end an international climate night.
In Germany, Protests are planned at least 65 cities, including in Metropolies such as Berlin, Hamburg, München and Columbia, but also in smaller communities and cities such as jungles in Northwest-Westphalen or Western countries in Sylt. Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a major accommodation in the Canadian Montreal.
Climate Protests ✔ Who are Thunbergs Intermmanners?
Justice senses and courage are, even in the 21th century, a world full of wars and smoking manufactures that make the climate warming. In order to be surprised that a 16-year-old girl takes the powers of this time before the nase. But what's going on in here? Is it helpful or pleasant marketing of an climate activist? Historical master service or manipulative tactic for himself?
In the first place, Greta Thunberg moves the mass and brings young people up to a better climate world. It is historically not seen the first time in Europe that a young man created a congregation of children and youths to win for himself. In 1212, a child named Nicoleus from the Columbia has felt a cold to make himself a world more just. Then it also has a horrible for young people to win, and it overcome the sea to swim in the land, like Greta Thunberg, has slowly made up to the United States.
But this is about a shadow page? Why is it necessary for a action named "We don't have time" to save the world? Moreover, Greta Thunberg has rich PR-managers on its side. Nevertheless, her mother has published a book that has been widespread sold, thanks to the daughter in the light. An old-selected followers of Greta Thunberg had a little disappointed about the last PR show, or. The travel with the ship was likely also a few follow-ups. This is not reasonable because the action came in the world's media very well-related way, and it was a lot of money in the action.
Here the Spirits are divided: is morally proper to the savings of the world financially? Is it still authentical if some people's creatures are working together with the world's management partners? At the same time, what position will finally be involved in a critical and reflected point of view is always more important in a democraticly practitioned society, because democracy lives from different opinions and discussions. Therefore it may also be likely to ask critical questions from certain trends.
Compet discover: Intersteller guest crossed by our sun system
A foreign commit crosss our sun system at the moment.
The confusions of the astronomes have confirmed themselves: a foreign comit is crossed in the moment of our sun system - he is only the second of his type.
Garching/Washington - Lange the researchers have just disappointed it, but now they have awareness: one commit of another star crosses our sun system in the moment. He was baptized after his discovery 2I/Borisov and is just employed by world astronomes.
2I/Borisov: comet was discovered by amateur starms on the Crime
The inflicted body was discovered by a amateur star named Gennadi Borissow on the crystal. He saw a self-building telescope in heaven and other observations confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually a unknown commit that was not known from our sun system. He is only the second of his type that was seen at the flight.
The great opportunity for astronomies is now to get closely into an alien sun system. It is obvious to the comits of our own systems, as reports the astrophysical Institute of Canarys. The commit is clearly intersystemal, and is currently moved on a so-called hyperbike train that leads it from our system.
Comet was already seen before the flight - and can be observed several months
But before it's so far, the astronoms can watch him immediately. Because, in contrast to his preacher, 2I/Borisov is already seen in his fleet, which means that he can be investigated from the earth for many months. "The object will be reached the largest light, and then to be seen in the middle of December 2020 with a medium-growing telescope," says Davide Farnocchia by the US Railway Author of Nasa. "But it will only be viewed by more professional telescopes until October 2020."
The new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumamaua".
First knowledge of comet 2I/Borisov makes hopes in science
According to the first recognition, the commit is estimated at 2 to 16 kilometers of diameter. At the same time, the sky body seems to be similar to our compounds - as the IAC researcher Julia de León expresses it, the spectrum of the Swiss star is similar to our. This observation is closely empty that commits in other solar systems can be formed by similar processes as in our Leon's College Javier Licandro.
However, the observation is out of individual knowledge, which has already been discovered two such objects within only two years, allowing a new way to investigate certain processes in other sun systems.
Asteroids re-employed again. Shortly recently, a rise-asteroid passed to the earth, and they were dangerously near.
"Aucunely Compressed": Rachel Johnson is a brother
For Boris Johnson it will be alone. First, his young brother leaves the castle, his sister, with clear words, sweets the army language of the first one as "shockless". It's not the brother she knows.
"Captuation", "Betruck", "Contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and continues to be shocked, at least at least at least. In the mid-day afternoon, the questionnaire was to the massive reputation of the opposition, and there are still other critics: twelve bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The known journalist and authorin said to the Sender Sky News, his brother uses words such as capitalization, as if the enemy of a EU engaged "speaked, diged, diged and feeded" should be divided, diged and feeded, and it was very convincing. You did not recognise her brother's version, said Rachel Johnsons, who had been at the elections for the EU's anti-Brixit Party "Change UK".
In particular, she said that her brother Jo Cox mentioned that a EU-wide subcommittee who had been killed by a Neonazi in 2016. Their Andenken could be the best honored by the brexit had said Boris Johnson in the underhouse. "It's very uncomfortable to refer to a deputy who was killed by someone, the 'Britain first' rief,” now criticized Johnson' sister. The killer was clearly coming out of the straight layer, which is "the kind of language."
Also, the Witwer of Cox criticized the Prime Minister. "It makes me sick if Jos Name is used so," he tweeted. The best way to honor them is, if you are suffering and decided for what you believe - unlikely what you think. But never should "demonize the other side". He also claimed that an atmosphere was avenue in the attacks.
A few weeks ago, Boris Johnson was a young brother Jo his Office as the Secretary of State and his mandate as a Tory deputy. "I was destroyed in the past months between the loyalty to family and national interest - it is an unsolvable shock," founded Johnson.
Johnson's language was also critical in the church. As the "Time" reported, all 118 Bishops and Heritage of the Church of England criticize the language that the "this country is not valuable". In a common statement they explained: "In the last days, the language is, both in the debates and outside of the Parliament, not acceptable. We should speak with respect to each other."

He goes to the Head of State directly and through rustic language. While the people were hungry, the President in Luxus, and let himself build a precise new palaces, it is. The army leadership, based on the Sisi government, introduces Aliruption and Agriculture, because he made it in his second employee as an employee for 15 years with exactly these rulers, it seems to know exactly exactly what he speaks - at least it is the impression of many Egyptians, as it is to show the numbers of clicks to be explored.
After the first week of Sisi Griff was arrested after the power of thousands of people against his rule, and almost 2000 citizens, among them, the prominent figures of civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, called Ali for this Friday to a "millionary" market.

If the supplier has too much performance
Within the Internet connection, it is always much lower than the supplier, there are different test opportunities.
A Internet contract does not need to be blindly trusted in the suppliers' speeds, and customers can see how much it is real to be achieved.
Finally, the previous transmission rates are a part of the contract and should therefore be achieved, explains the consumer central Bayers.
As far as the connection is always slower than the supplier, there are different possibilities of testing. So the methods of the Federal Network Management (BnetzA) are measured as the actual data transfer rates and compare the rate agreed in the Treaty.
"But the tests of the suppliers are carried out according to offering specific requirements and therefore are not unique and objectively calculated", provides the consumer central Bayers on its side.
If the connection is significantly slower than announced, the customers can place a appropriate period of 14 days in order to create the promised performance. This makes the customers in writing the best.
If there is nothing to do after demand, customers can declare and, in circumstances, also demand the damage rate. However, if the success is extinct, it is only helped to help the slaughter path.

Scott, a moderate Republican, has already been used against Trump's policy, such as the locking of environmental protection rules and the strengthening of immigration rules.

Doping: Provide more Russian manipulations
Materials from Moscow analysis are manipulated - this confirms David Howman, the only Director of the World Entertainment Agency (Wada) and the current Head of integrity of the Lightthletic World Association.
In view of the lightthletic WM, new details about the Doping Scandal in Russia are expected - and they destroyed the few of the credibility of Russian sports at the beginning of the year, and also only in a position. In January 2019 the Moscouer Doping Lab finally delivered the requested samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Intent Agency (Wada). Now he found that they were slaughtered.
In December 2014, a systematic fraud was enthusiasmed in Russian sport. The Wada was cut the Russian antidoping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time, Russian sports were not freely banned by the World Sports. The International Olympic Committees read individual examination at the summer games in Rio in 2016, around 270 athletes of the country under the neutral flags, at the winter games in February 2018, were 168 Russian sports and sports at the start. In the world's various sports, they had also been held in the Sommer, in Russian Guarantee, as a part of the Guardier.

In September, the Wada reopened the Russian bank, but requested the access to the lab and the advised samples. The data should be concluded about the extent of the discussion of Doping cases at the State Doping Doping. They should help punish post-training atthletes and atthletes.
The Chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (IAU) of the Lightthletic World Association (IAAF) now has confirmed that the Doping data from the Moscow analysis work has been manipulated. "We have received the data for nine months ago. We should check whether the Task Force has received the right data", said David Howman in the interview of the "Frankfurter General Journal" from Friday. "We have determined numerous discovery between the data that the Wada of a whistorist blog, and those they received in January the Russians."
The WM does not affect
This confirms the position of the IAAF: The Lightthletic Association is the only organization at the Russian Bann. At the WM in Doha, 30 Russian sportors started under the neutral flag, and they had to prove that they trained outside the Russian system and conducted tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada manipulations had already been placed in the space and requested Russia to respond to the predominants within three weeks. Russia now threatens the new spectres of Russia and, in the worst case, also the exclusion of the Olympic Games 2020 in Tokyo.
