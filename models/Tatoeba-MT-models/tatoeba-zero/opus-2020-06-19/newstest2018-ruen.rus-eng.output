The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, signed the Act of Administrative Responsibility for the violation of the deadline and order of the payment of goods (work, services) during the purchase of public and municipal needs.
This law aims at addressing the very challenge of non-compliance with its claimants in the implementation of State and municipal purchases.
Another two years ago, the situation in which entrepreneurs could not obtain payments for the already implemented public and municipal contracts, was complete.
Then the President of Russia appointed the Advocate-General to address the issue of special control.
Since businessmen themselves couldn ' s inevitable claimers who had not been supported by contract financing, they all tried to abandon the payment obligations and included in the treaties of illegal conditions.
The problem was generally in the country.
Since 2015, the prosecutor ' s prosecutor ' s payments for public orders had been submitted, with the results of their consideration of the diplomatic responsibility of 4,5 million officials to the administrative 533, 75 materials have been condemned by criminal cases.
Finally, the debt was debt to more than 66 billion rubbers of the employees.
These huge amounts were not covered by the non-payment of multimillional contracts.
In the basic debts, numerous, systematic delays were made to entrepreneurs where more modest amounts were paid.
That's a personal case.
A small company manager wins competition for social transport services in a number of millions of rubbers.
The man put all its trade funds, fully complied with the obligations, but the money set for a period did not receive.
The result of a long-term financial composition of payments, taxes and credits that would lead to banking if the entrepreneur had not been requested for prosecution.
In a number of regions, the problem has now been maximized.
However, at the first half of 2017, a joint amount of debt for public and municipal contracts identified by the Prosecutors of the Russian Federation was about 27.4 billion of rubbers.
In regions where debt indicators continue to achieve critical values, the prosecution works in the ruling anti-crisis management regime.
The General Prosecutor is on the journey meetings with the representatives of the local authority, which are subjectly selected by all the offenders of violations and measures to immediately eliminate them.
Such operational meetings have already been held in Yaroslave and Ecatherinburgh this year.
The principal improvement of the payment discipline of public claims can implement the Federal Law No. 189-FZ " on changes in the Russian Federation on Administrative Discrimination in the part of the administrative responsibilities of the complaints for the delay and order of purchase of goods (work, services) in order to ensure public and municipal needs " which was signed last week by the President of Russia.
The draft law was developed by Russia for the Gender Procurement Initiative.
The new law complements the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Criminal Discrimination, which prescribes 300,000 to 500,000 rules for violation of the official assets and orders for goods, jobs and services in State and municipal purchase.
And if the official has already been sentenced by administrative for similar offences, it is expected to disclass for one year to two years.
All prosecutors of the Russian Federation have already been assigned to ensure the application of these legislative novels to practice.
The Civil Rights Group announced a warning to move to the Mission
The National Association for the Progress of the Flower People has published warnings for people traveling to Missouri, because of the discriminatory policy of the State and racist attacks.
The Declaration of the Group calls on: "African travellers, guests and citizens of the Missouri State are particularly careful and enhanced in the state journeys regarding a number of doubts in racism, recently situated on the entire territory of the State and in the country. "
According to the National Association of Promoting the Progress of the Flower People, proclaiming the movement warning of the group has recently built the Law adopted by the Mission, which has made people more difficult to win discrimination, as well as that law enforcement bodies are often selected by their representatives of minorities.
“ You have a violation of human rights.
They stop on the streets because of the skin, kill and kill them,” reported the Cansas City Star, Rod Chapel, President of the National Association to promote the progress of the Missuer people.
"We will hear the complaints as much as ever."
This is the first warning of such a kind announced by the United States State.
The Panel focused on incidents such as the reduction of black-train students at the University of Missouri and the death of 20-year-old Thory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances that year ago after he ended the benzine during the state journey, and the police arrested him without proclaiming a crime.
The warning also indicates the recent report of the General Prosecutor of the Mission State, which is likely to be stopped on the road for black drivers above 75 per cent than for whites.
“ The purpose of warning that people are aware of situations and warning their parents and friends and colleagues about what could happen to the mission, ” said Chapel.
“Their parents must be prepared or otherwise, whether they take money for the loan or report to their relatives that they travel on the State territory.”
According to the last data of the FBI report on hatred crimes, 100 crimes were registered in the Mission for 2015, making the state of sixty-five offences in the State.
The movement warning is also a response to the new Missouri State law, which would be more difficult to rebuild the case against the legal person in relation to housing or working discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Freedom Unit (ACLU) announced warnings for travelers in Texas and Arizona after the new immigration control laws, as the local laws prescribed to arrest people for immigration laws that, in view of the ACLU, should increase the number of checks on racial signs.
The State department is generally launched by the movement warnings in respect of other countries, but recently public organizations have been in response to specific laws and trends within the United States.
Two men died as a result of the police patrol in Egypt
Unknown police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, reports Reuters with reference to the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
During the shooting of two men, including one policeman, had died three injuries.
All prisoners are put to the hospital.
According to the agents, the police stopped the car, after which two armed persons were opened by fire guards.
One of the maltractors is detained, the second was able to hide.
The Russians supports the law on the cancellation of free shipping for non-road aircraft
Head of Osturism, Olym Safonos, stated in the television interview of the CBK, that "possitively" is to adopt the free-free shipping law in the aircraft.
"It must be able to create conditions where a person who has no bag may buy a decorate ticket, even if he had a bag," he stressed (quote for ASS).
Mr. Safons said that, despite the fear of the citizens, it was not necessary to pay for the shipping of high clothes and mobile phones in the handle.
"It'd be right to calm all our citizens and tourists and say that it's to the top clothes, to the zones, to the mobile phone, to the episode or even any computer's relationship," said the head of Russianism.
The previous President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, has signed the law which provides the right to aircraft to exclude the free-free shipping rules in the aircraft.
It is the case that the aircraft may determine the number of locations and the weight of the bags included in an unexpected tariff.
Vladimir Putin ordered to eliminate the pollution of Baykal
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, at the Baykara Protection Meeting, reported that significant areas of the Lake have been extremely polluted in the past few years.
It was intended to determine the sources of financing, plans and executives to eliminate pollution.
Mr. Putin also urged to make full correction of the polluted territories.
The President ' s 'REA News ' s should also be identified with the objects that continue to work here, purified the army of most of them.
He also added that the Russian Prosecutor-General had to check out the identification of environmental harmful activities.
It says that there are problems related to natural trails and a number of distant environmental violations in the region of the lake.
"I would like to emphasize this: not all of the substances to check, and here is also necessary to know, but it is illegal and environmental harmful activities and take appropriate measures," he stressed.
Previously, the Ghan Procurator reported on the reduction of fish stocks in the Baykal Lake and suggested that increased the number of objects under environmental supervision.
Remember, on 15 June, Vladimir Putin in the direct line stated that legislation was necessary to change the rights of citizens living in the natural areas of the special protection regime.
He had reported about the problems of the management of the Oilhorn Island, which is in the Baycale Natural Territories.
The Head of Minproportion of Sergey Donknah immediately suggested that the problem was addressed by the determination of the Baykall waterway zone, but the Government of Buratia recalled that this change was inadequate because restrictions were linked to a number of regulatory acts.
Previously, in the Middle East, they suggested to address the problem by changed the Earth Code and the Environmental Protection Act.
The new temple appears in Jugree
In the village of Sweden, communities from the representatives of the indigenous small peoples of the North, Rahattia, together with the people of the Belarus area, participate in the construction of a Orthodox temple for the honour of the Nicola Chodoleitor.
His location is a swimming beach, the temple will be well seen away, so it will serve fishermen for a travel swimming swimming pool.
According to the representatives of the communities, the construction work has been completed this year, and the cowboy has now been established.
The EIB Flood had been transported.
The Kram was appointed to the holy Nicola Chidocre, because it is read by the Orthodox Church as a traveller, including fishermen.
In the world, the fishing swimming pool provides work to the employees.
Local inhabitants are waiting when the temple opens their doors, and children even write to school associations on it as a local remarkability.
Disneyland with death penalty.
Why are Singapore complying with the laws?
I'm talking to the local employee Changom, sit in a shopping air.
Changing the situation in Singapore, it smokes one smoke for another, and the oaks are attractively covered by the office of the iron box.
After the end of the conversation, businessmans are sent to the nearest urn, to it, hundred meters of feet, and take the shoes there.
Chang reports about the shooting in the public place, 500 local dollars.
You know, I've just developed a reflex: I can't get a fanc from the shock to the bridge.
And now all the video cameras.
And indeed, Singapore’s trutuals in the center of the city are clean as in the museum.
Chang says: three months ago, his 18-year-old son, his neighbourhood, had drawn up the wall of the old colonial building.
The Court acknowledged the man who was in the bandalism and condemned the slaughter.
What?
Imagine yourself.
He received 10 shocks of a tree shock in the jungles and held a week in prison.
We don't have any physical punishment.
As in Singapore, the higher levels of life and the unlikely absurd laws have been identified at the location of the AIF summary.
There's no one thinks to abolish the death penalty, explains the lawyer Victor Li Hong.
And the Government has long referred to the view of Europe and the United States in this regard.
If a person transports a large party of drugs, or sells them, he is the seat.
In 2002, Changi was detained by a 22-year-old citizen of Australia, who was with him 400 g of cocaine.
The Australian Prime Minister was protected by sanctions, international human rights defenders and even the Pope of Rome.
However, the man was still buried.
After that, the narcotics of our country strictly turn into the side.
The following is: Singapore states that laws are required to comply with the ECE, not only modest and sky-based people.
I don't care who you're a million, a Vice-Premier, a known artist or a Eurovis.
The option in this case is: if you find a cocaine powder, you'll be shooted.
When you go to Singapore and meet some warnings, you're just wondering how much it's forbidden in the city of State!
For example, the skin is sold only in pharmaceuticals and can be purchased by a doctor.
The kitchen will not be discarded, but it's supposed to be shocked in metro, shocked by $1,000 local.
For four days, I met two people with white tablets on the shoes, "I'm shooting."
For a shooting shooting, more than a strip, the shooter often calls for the shooter: a week to remove parks and shoots.
6.000 Rub. pays the " criminal " forgotten to cut water in the public toilet, and when trying to make a small need in the lift of the house, a special detector is blocked by the doors and sends a signal to the police.
The total ecosythical laws include the prohibition of bleeding on the street, the public performance of the songs and even the excessive heat of the room plant (!).
In avoiding the fire of smokers, it is not possible to shoot in metro, other than 50,000 Singapore taxes.
In general, it appears that, as you do, you have to violate something.
That's not really, - it's trying to make me convinced Mohammed Kabri-Kajaria, the owner of the local tourism.
Specially fantastic laws exist only on the bowl, and in the last twenty years, I have not seen that someone has been inflicted for their violations.
Why do they keep?
That the citizens don't have to relax.
In compliance with the basic rules, it is uncomplied.
So, if a young man is sold in the kitchen of cigarettes, it will be sentenced to all at the basement: the master of the shop pays a great amount, the offender will receive the shoes on the "day" shoes and the seller will also put and settle in prison.
This is very rare because of the so serious laws of crime in Singapore.
Is that right?
In the past seventy years, we had a chaos on the road - automobilists ignored the lights, moved as they wanted, sit down on the rule.
After a year’s breakout, it has been succeeded.
Now, the driver, drinking a viski portion, knows, if they stop, the police will not leave the shooting, spend the cost of the apartment, and they are sent for years.
Many foreigners in South-East Asia seem to be a variety of concentrations.
In 1993, the American writer William Gibson called Singapore Dysnelland with the death penalty - a guest from the U.S. was in fear of the general richness of the people, the "pur aircraft" and the "Occulent Nature".
The discovery of such things appears artificially and should not be in principle.
The first days in Singapore and you're certainly afraid to get a paper on the throat, you're shocking if you're in the metro with a marine.
But then you're coming to the small Indian area, and on the other hand, it's a model explosion: the car stops are shocked.
"What's this?" - You're surprised.
That's how, the singapores are shiny.
Everything's done.
Not for any such crime, but you have to know, if you are calculating, you're not going to defeat, because you have violated the law.
It's just enough for a man to make himself normal.
It is sure that the authority of Singapore is fully authorized.
But you know what?
In Viet Nam, I moved very carefully - motorcycles often cut off the hands of Smartphones and cameras.
In the centre of Paris, the bombs and demands are full.
They're not all trying to shoot up on our streets.
However, Singapore has become the most peaceful, clean and safe city on earth through the assembly of dragons and unfortunate (related to death) laws.
You're thinking about it.
Such human nature: Remember, and no one in Russia was guarded by the rule until he was shocked.
Although the main part of Singapore is not the trap, but the voluntary compliance with the laws.
And we should think that people in Russia would also be pleased in the clean streets, the lack of metro and welcomed by those who travel a lift with a public toilet.
There's a physical punishment. Thank you, don't.
In the rest of the Singapore laws the minimum stands for them.
No holy thing?
The White House of Trampa is now struck on the Liberty Statute.
The most reliable sign of the mode is when it begins to fight statistics.
Americans do not understand that worse than all of the other -- the theatrical contribution of Saddam Hushin's statue in the Firdos area in Bagdad in 2003.
Steven Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Government of Trampa, knew uncertainly what he did when he took a symbolic point on the Free status during the disastrous discussion with the journalist CNN Jim Acoty on the proposals of the President ' s substantial reduction of legal migration.
We're honest, Miller hasn't tried at the same statue.
The pool of passenger vessels and artists, pictured by the Freedom Statute, would be cut it if he tried to do that.
But he tried to the meaning of her, and especially to the meaning that she was accepted in 1903, 17 years after the monument finished, when the text was added to Emma Lazarus.
"I don't want to enter the story, but the State of Freedom is... the symbol of American freedom that will save the world.
It was added later and not part of the original status of freedom."
Miller correctly put the facts, but as he himself said, it's not really the story.
It is about the current sound of the voice of Lazarus, the only ones in which the State is invited not any immigrants but the poorest: "There are your lips, your poor, / your dreams who are smiling freely, / the unfortunate displacement of your powerful beaches."
There's never been any "unfortunate displaces" on our screens.
Miller didn't care for literature, and he realized that these people were not waiting for in America.
This is a part of the broader political and cultural war: this is really the opposition of the United States.
Lazarus, and her friends, fighting for putting her words on the statue after her death, were very well understood what they do completely politically.
The sculpture should be marked as a relationship between the French and American Republic with a classical image of the Free Women.
Lazarus changed its sense: in her creating a woman ' s figure is not Abstract, she has a voice.
And she received a complete name, the mother of the Exiled.
The association of stignification and images was a limite pheminist and a devastating attack against American nativeism.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statistics, the right to change it back.
In 2010, John Baptist, who was his parent, said that the Freedom of nobody was likely an early non-consistent non-consistent who was born in the dark world: " Freedom goes forward.
It has a set of freedoms from the United States to the rest of the world.
The faculty does not need to shine the way to the United States."
Limboa's prevention is really on the point.
The meaning of the statistics depends exclusively on the vision.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see her as they would have seen, unfortunate, but full hopes of people on the ships after a long and often heavy swimming floor.
This means literally to look at the world by the eyes of people who are looking for refugee and the best chance of life.
Its article answers the words of hope and hospitality that they dream to hear.
And of course, it's not a prospect that Miller and Tramp ever wanted to recognize.
Their faculty needs not to make it possible, but to wipe out hate, which is the only source of their power.
The World Champion 2017: Nil Blake apprecies the Skotlandian members of the collection of Britain.
Elid Doyle remembers the time when only two Skotlands were in the assembly.
Nil Blake, director of the Federation of Facility Atlantics, stated that 16 of the Skotlanian part of the World Championship of Championship had a "important contribution to the team game".
The recursive number of Skotland flights was selected on Friday 2017 of the London Championship.
Blake believes that Skotland is "also special" and that the Federation of a easy attraction should take into account.
"We know that and try to understand and support until they have the capacity," said Blake.
"I spoke to people at the Skotland Institute, and they think it is related to what they did.
Skotland Federation thinks they have to work with what they have done.
The British Federation of Easy Atletics, which they have done, needs to work.
And people on the street think that's the same.
I don't know why the situations were so able to be, but it's perfectly worse."
Some of the Skotlands claim to meal, including Lora Maure and Andre Batch, which will compare with Mr. Mo Faroch at a distance of 5000 meters, and Elid Doyle had chosen his captain.
"Elyd's mutilating.
Her captain was great," says Blake.
" Many lightways, independently of their shocks or not, and from where they live or trained, left out of this room, feeling proud and victory.
The pain and sincere feelings that Alid had put into her were wonderful."
The manufacturer of a silver meal champion of the Society, which will fly at its fifth Champione of the World at 400 meters away, says that 16 Skotlands in the British collection are "incredibly".
The previous refund for the world championship was equal to seven, 1983 and 2005.
The Laura Mur, who is specialized in a medium-term flight and killed five British and two European recursions last year.
She will run up to 1500 and 5000 meters.
Chris O'Her, who will participate in the shipment of 1500 meters, is another shock that should be attentioned: for the spot of his lucky season, in which the selection of the British collection and the annual conceptions were winned.
Doyle reminds her first championship of the world when Lee McConnel was the only skoolander in the team.
The Captain's team says that she's "incredibly proud" that so much of her co-conciliators were not only in the collection, but in some cases they're going to claim to the meal and to fight for the end.
"The head of the collection chooses other team members, so that was in any case a great honor, but I know your friends have made you and have chosen, that's a perfect person for me," she added.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the Skotlandians who entered the collection.
That shows how much we have done.
And they're all the light boards that will try to spend on the shooting.
What about my captain?
Yeah, I think she was good.
I just pointed out that we were very happy to take the Championite of the world.
So this is simply how it is important to receive support from the farmers and use what we are talking again at the Olympic Stadium.
I got another chance to go to his farm and to participate in the snake, and the atmosphere will be wonderful there."
Blocking critics in Facebook: not move to public position if you are not ready to listen to the critics from the electors
The founder of our country understood that it was a critical press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not prevent them to criticize it from all internal policy to its political principles.
His criticism, of course, was disappointed.
But he didn't touch his critics.
Because, in 1783, Washington said, "It's possible to take the freedom of speaking, and we, the deep and its, will lead to war."
I'm going to go to the Governor Maryland Larry Hogan, who would have been trying to be more like Washington.
The underlying Hogans blocked and stripped at least 450 people who expressed their view on his official page on Facebook.
And this week, the American Civil Freedom's Unit gave it to the court.
The underlying Governor called the search for nothing, and the comments in the Internet were written in the spirit "no and what".
"It's just Facebook," they say many.
But it's also important.
And it's especially important when it's about the Hogan guy.
It is a surprising popular Republicn Gouvernant in the democratic advantage of the State.
He is in the second place of approval among 50 gouverneurs of the country.
Hogan isn't an incredible reactioner.
He demonstrated a strong hand in the administration of the State and commitment to its principles.
He also uses the Facebook as a primary way to connect his electors and shows his shoes on his page after the chemistry of his head.
Thus, blocking people coming to the Governor's page, which is declared as an official public forum and carried out by the Administrators for money payers, is unnecessary and finally unnecessary.
In the Vasington Post interview, the secretariat Amile Chas protected the Governor's actions, claiming that the locking of comments is just their moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of throlls, spamers, and chatters that slaughter in the Internet.
Post talked to some of the real people who blocked Hogan.
And that's the real people that aren't thrown, the teachers, the businessmen, the pastors, who are referring to their elected leaders.
All of them say that their comments were respectful, contained and not cruel.
The pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to the fact that Hogan is Catholic.
The lawyer Lakshmi Sharma Raman, in the state of Maryland, had not expressed hatred but asked for a crime of hate.
"I wrote a strict comment that I have disappointed the lack of his reactions to hate crimes and to other news of the last time," she wrote in the section of comments to the Post article.
"I also don't like the idea that when many people leave comments on one and the same subject, some say that it is so called a strike, instead of admitting that they have a matter with a large group of unvoluntary citizens."
What the underlying Governor is called "concentred spam attack", others probably would be called "active life position".
In the eve of the Facebook, it is easy to communicate your image, just block critics or strike negative comments.
This is a lot of less pool work than before it was required to send people, gather and smell newspapers with critical transfers or arrest and smell the protesters.
But it's exactly what happens now, just in the number.
Hogen is not the first person who criticizes that he doesn't want to listen to Facebook and others.
The President of Traampu was proclaimed for Twitter users who were engaged in his Twitter account.
One of the first, turning decisions on this subject was adopted at Virginia this week.
According to the U.S. Environment Court of Alexandria James C. Casheris, the President of the observing Council of Laudon violated the First Amendment, inflicting the elector in his Facec Book.
And in Kentucky, the Republic-Republic Gubernamenter Mattu Bevin, a claim for the American Union for the Protection of Citizens' freedoms for his behavior in Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so difficult.
During the era of Washington, the available email costs were almost the same as the Internet today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers grew four, and the authors of anonymous letters were strongly violated by its authority.
And even then, Washington had an anonymous troll.
People under the pseudo-writers, "Valius", "Belizarius" and "Porcius" wrote letters in the newspapers expressing the decision of Washington.
According to the historical documents collected by the Online Documents of George Washington, his chain was engaged in complaints that criticize his position on the Treaty on friendship, trade and maritime.
But he didn't try to stop them.
The freedom of speaking, anchor and speaking is based on our State.
And the true leadership means agreed with that.
Ron Rafferty is hoped to be good at the Rensance Club.
The former champion of Europe, Ron Rafertti, is hoped to be in the nearest three days when the Renesens Club in Eastern Latvia takes twenty-fifth Skotlandic golf tour for old sports.

The British roads are learning to overcome harmful emissions
It has already been tested on the roads of the United Kingdom.
The country's transporting Agency, as reports the Autocar publication, has been reported on the positive results of the 100 meter tonne testing set on one of the shoes in the north of the country.
The tunnel height of 6 metres is built from a few new polymer materials that can absorpte harmful substances contained in cars.
However, the establishment of the entire network of these tonnels is only part of the extensive measures that the authorities of the United Kingdom will take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the tunnels network, the Englishs are planned to expand the network of loading stations for mobile motors, to implement a number of activities on road reducing, to expand the use of commercial traffic on electric ships and to modify the park of heavy cars.

Poorness and death in the Indonesian 'Slood Land'
It's ready to eat, Bardin Degey doesn't use a swimming pool.
She's even rarly useful.
In his village house in Enerotali, the capital of Pania, in the Middle Indonesian province of Papua, the household is usually simplely placed with a sweet cardfel here called “note” directly in the eye.
After half an hour, the clamped clubs get and eat with unselfish, unmeasurable hands.
Degey is sit on the ground field - not the furniture of it - and here she works at home, such as the strike of a sweet water from the close to the paint.
The slaughter serves in the room without snakes.
She was the age of four women of her husband, and therefore she was not forced to work in the field.
Many of them have been distributed.
Of course, work later may be dangerous: many men from this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are soldiers.
“No one decides to walk in the village after five nights,” she says.
This is a remarkable opportunity to see a daily life in the high-level Papua, the former Dutch colony, joined to Indonesia in 1969 after a doubtful referendum, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote on a privately higher hand before the occupied troops.
The existing movement from the Netherlands quickly urged its angry against the Government of Jakarta, which keeps a cruel control over the region, without allowing foreign journalists and rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially separated by Papua and the West Papua, and the independent state of Papua New Guinea is east of the island.
The Enerotali is the city that has been removed as well as the buried; the road is included in the mid-hour journey from Jayapur, the Administrative Centre of Province, Nabura, and then the five-hour trail on the loading car.
There's no public transport here.
The population of about 19,000 people are from the village houses covered by pumps, and the cuts from the heated have been improved in different markets.
There were little indonesians who haven't spoken about journalists, and almost no foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, my paused torment worshiped the god named Ug.
Other changes have also been changed.
“We were inadequate to take this clothes,” says Degey, showing his skin, shocked in the hands of the prison, dark sweet and bright shoes.
"We've brought only a card on the tv."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, 28 per cent of its population lives in poverty and the level of child mortality and gramm among the worst in Asia.
But this is also the Indonesian golden land.
The largest in the world and the most profitable gold machine, Gresberg, belonging to the Fenicks Company, McMoran, is about 60 miles away from Paniya, a higher province near New York, where 153.000 people live.
Only in 2015 the Freeport company has reached the gold and the media for about 3,1 billion dollars.
At the end of Papua, the forest stocks, which are estimated by 78 billion dollars.
Those riches, however, have a challenge for Papuas, safeguarding that the powerful armed forces of Indonesia remain here with its deep presence.
According to the New York Times report in 2005, Freeport company paid for local military and units of almost $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including $10,000.
The requirements of more autonomy from pavuas are threatening the existence of this golden heavy and unfortunately slaughtered.
According to the approval of the rights defenders, the military forces of Indonesia have been killed by over 5000,000 Papuas since 1969, and thousands of more have been disfellowshipped, subjected to torture and freedom.
On the basis of the adoption of the Asian Human Rights Commission, the major murders of the indigenous populations of Papua for seventy years may be considered as a genocide.
Only in the past year the Indonesian police arrested over 3900 peaceful protesters in the region.
“We lose everything” report published in 2016 by the Brisbanian Eparchy contains a witness of the beliefs made in the previous year, such as punishment without courts, torture, especially the parties, such as in other cases, violent and electrical points, and the cruel consignment of peace demonstrations.
“ It is difficult to compare the number of victims because the occurrences have a place every week, ” says Andréas Harsono, who conducted research in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
Haiki was displaced, as the resources of Papa’s residents from other Indonesian regions took place.
3.5 million people of the province are Christians, but the demographic indicators are changed through the arrival of Islamic economic migrants from the Gustavo-Indonesian islands – Yawa, Sumari and Slovakia.
The Yavanian shoes, "warnge", sell a smoke and a sweeter with a sweet soss.
Local people are trying to keep competitive.
“Migrants began to sell smoke and fruits of smoke than the Indigenous people of Papua” explains Abet Jou, twenty-year-old Panya's born in Jayapur, the Administrative Centre of Province, because of the work.
"It was because of the indigenous people of Papua, the mother of the women, lost their market of late."
The President of Indonesia Joko Vidodo, who was known as Jokoya, pleaded to take inequality and violations of rights in Papua during its Presidential campaign in 2014.
At his path to the President of Jakarta, the former carriage was supported by 27 of 29 districts of Papua, including Pania.
But Papua has almost nothing changed, and local people feel loyal.
“ Our hearts are disappeared, because we voted for Jocks in 2014, expecting that he would fulfill our hopes for resurrection of justice,” said Jou.
Indeed, only two months after the October inauguration, Joko Panya survived the tragedy.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children was on the street and a skin of birthday giants in the Enerotali, when two Indian soldiers were shocked from the darkness.
Inflicted children told them that they should be involved in the fair.
As the local pastor Javet Tebay reported, one of the soldiers had buried on their tones, and a few times he returned from four soldiers.
According to the victims and witnesses, the soldiers who were drunk were shocked for children and slaughtered their examples of expenses.
Then one of the soldiers shot the children's group.
One child, a 15th-year-old Julian Aimeemo, was so shocked that was shocked.
A few hours later, a government building was located near the electoral commission, and the next day the situation was shocked.
About thousands of Papuas men, women and children have gathered at a football field before the local police office and the military team centre to need justice.
They brought ritual snakes with themselves and swallowed the sweet, the dance of the Papuas tribe, the swimming rounds and pictured the birds.
Some protesters began to swing stones into the police office and the military base.
When the situation was covered, the soldiers in the internal radio connection were ordered to say: “If the torpe is opposed more than three times, shoot them”, he sounded as the official document that saw the TIME residents, but which was not published in local media.
The fifty-sixty-year-old Erientias Kaime, head of the Kjo Coto area in Enerotali, felt a risk of approach and called to calm down with a request to get home.
Nobody wanted to listen to him.
“ When I returned, I was soon shooting at the left floor, ” he told the TIME magazine.
I still don't know who shooted, but he says that the gun came from the sheriff's gathering soldiers.
"Big shooting, shooting was a lot," he adds.
In the local population of Alfius Job, his two - year - old brother, who became a witness to the shoot.
“ I went to him and checked his body to make sure it was him, ” said the TIME magazine Johanes, who, as many Indonesians, uses only one name.
"I saw him died... I kissed him."
General Yotje Mende, senior Police Inspector of Papua, said to the reporters that his officers were only “protected” on their basis because it was attacked.
“We have to protect when people are threatening to kill us” in 2015, stated the representative of the police Commissioner Poujo Sulistio.
“This is the question of life and death.”
According to the Human Rights Watch, five-year-old protesters were killed, and more were arrested.
The murder news came to Jakarta only on the next day.
After three weeks, Jokoy was a pleasant talk in Jaipur, expressing the confusion of the victims and pleading to address the question of historical abuse of the authority in Papua.
“ I want this situation to be immediately resolved to never again in the future,” he said.
In October 2016, Viranto, Minister of Security, said that it would establish an unfair organization to put an end to historical violations of human rights.
But we almost went out of the reserve.
“The majority of violations has happened for a long time.
Some of them had a place in ninety or at the beginning of nucleus.
The fact is that we, of course, want to take these violations, but there are procedures that we need to pass," he said.
Then Virranto rejected his words, speaking with the TIME magazine in Jakarta on 5 June, and said that it was not planning to create organizations to consider complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, "They will be decided through the court."
The Virgin, whose United Nations was accused of “the crimes against humanity” in the bloody vote of the East Timor in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua, including the incident in Paniya, had already been issued.
Seven victims from Paniya met such statements with mature infidelity.
“ In the past three years, I was asked four times, but no change was completely changed, ” says Johannes.
"I'm lying."
He says that the years later, he's still in fear.
"I'm afraid," he says.
“I am afraid that I have arrested the soldiers, and I fear that they will shoot me.”
His brother Jacob also expressed the view that the people of Paniya were afraid to discuss the event.
He said he was killed by military after he helped to fill four victims.
And he said, “When we entered the body, they came after me,”
The starba hasn't stopped.
On Monday, the Indonesian police shooted in villages in the neighbouring of Pania of the Deay.
During the assembly of the villages and a building manager, which refused to help a man who had no conscience in the hospital, one man died and 17 had been blessed, including children.
Man, twenty - year - old Ravian Doww, who shooted fish in a nearby shock, died on the road to the hospital.
Devastated villages protested in front of a building area belonging to the company.
According to the police, the villages shocked stones in officers who were in response to warning shoes.
However, local people claim that a mobile brigade (Indonesian Spencer) has become shooted and killed one man.
“ We were in such a panic, we were afraid of return, ” reported the TIME magazine of the 20th anniversary Badia, who lived at the hospital and saw how he had been able to get the prisoners.
“ I hid home two days. ”
The Acti Parliament needed the answer to officials in the event, and the mobile police brigade from the region.
Pania was always a ill place for the Indonesian Government.
The inadequacy of significant development results in the injury of the tribe mee, monks, donations and dames displaced on the whole territory of the pine green of the central high-earth regions of Papua.
Many have joined the “Free Papua Movement” (OPM), a resurrected army, who claims that the rights of pausins is protected by constraint attacks and infringement of people in Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the senior OPM leaders are from Paniya, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Koyoya.
As a respondent measures in the past few years, thousands of people were arrested and unfairly detained by military under the premium “Protection of National Independence”.
Some haven't come back.
Among the populations of Papua Panii is considered “persistent, forgotten place”.
Poverty increases in illness.
A small portion of the quality sold in Enerotaly is too precious for local inhabitants.
Brothers in the same way are unable.
People are here to grow all the foods: mainly, note, and some fruits and breastfruits.
Agricultural household is a women's work, each of whose four-five fields can be covered by a solar card.
Normally they remain a large part of the family's wealth, and the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten clubs are only 100,000 Indonesian rupes (75 cents).
The economic inequality between Indigenous Papuas and New Migrants has been increased since the new aircraft was entered into Nabuki Airport.
Many of the existing vacances are usually more educational and state migrants.
Papoua has rarely lacked money or ability to carry out its own competitive business.
“Young people don't want to stay in the village... because there is no job or money,” says John Gobay, Chairman of the Panii tribal council.
The isolation of Papua has been removed from the views of the rest of the world.
Furthermore, the limitations to work on international media remain awesome.
In the past year, French journalists Frank Escudi and Basil Lonshan have been deported from Papua for “unsufficient coherence with relevant organizations”, despite the root permission of videos.
According to Felima Kine, the Vice-Chairman Director of Asian Organization Human Rights Watch, the promises made during the pre-selection campaign of Jokoy restraints the media work in order to facilitate transparency and development.
“Another journalists who are now trying to report from the Middle Eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and Western Papua are faced with new dangers: refusal to the visa and to put into the black list,” he stated in the statement.
The lack of attention from the press means that the international pressure on the Indonesian Government was mainly limited by the direct neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshallways and Solomons of the Islands – requested the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate “disproportional and widely distributed violations” in Papua, including shooting in Paniya.
The same country has been supported by OPM in the past.
The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Indonesia, Arramanata Nasir, dismissed the statement of the group, reported journalists in Jakarta that “In Indonesia still operates a democratic system and there is a free press, so the hiding of the evidence of episodes of violation of human rights would be difficult”.
Local people want to take attention to the situation of more foreign governments.
When a official delegation from the Netherlands, who was the Dutch Ambassador on Human Rights, visited Jayapur, on 4 May, and the local people were inflicting the silence, prayer: “We want freedom”, as the source that was also present at the meeting, but wished to remain an anonymized.
In Indonesia, new presidential elections were held in 2019, but the pausées say that they are not re-declared for Jocks again.
“Jhokovi is a person with a good purpose, but it is around people who are involved in the gun in Paniya,” says Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants to know that the people of Panii, except that they live in the darkness of the threats by the old army, were polluted in poverty, and the education and health are in delay.
Gobay says that the people of Pania, as well as other Papuas, are considering their voice rewarded for Jokoy, a long time that he must pay.
“They don't need money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite threats and threats, the families of the fire victims in Paniya have carried out the last symbolic innocence: one of the victims of the earth had been entered directly against the police and military participation.
Knowing that justice may never be disappointed, they will at least not allow the guilty to forget their crimes.
“ They killed a member of our family, ” says Jacobs, not taking up the head.
"What else had we done?"
Fire in the second time covers the Dubai sky-screen Faculty
Fire was one of the world’s higher hills in Dubai, on Friday, with hundreds of people slowly abandoning seventy-yearth ethical constructions in 337 meters above.

There may be a return to the agenda on the security of materials used in higher buildings around the world.
During the investigation by the Fakela Administration, in 2015, it was explained that the shock was mostly affected by the slaughter – the external panels used for training and isolation.
In the United Kingdom, the police claimed that the isolation system and the plotting panels of the Grenfel Tauer building in London could accelerate the dissemination of the fire in June, resulting in the death of about 80 people.

It was known for the mass dragon in the Ural Military Center
In the Elean School Center, where a mass drama occurred, a work group of senior military officers arrived to investigate the circumstances of the incident.
Some details of this fear have already been known.
According to the table of Mash, which appeared on the B Kontakte page, the U.S. Military Party No. 31612 strictly slaughtered from the unexpected bed.
It was started from a line named Sayan demonstratively ignored the order of the officer to settle the torment.
At the side of the office, military servants were standing out of the sixth mouth.
Saana supported the first mouth.
By half an hour of 140 young men were slaughtered in the slaughter and slaughtered.
More than ten people suffered in the mass dragon.
The WHO has checked information on the powder.
A study showed that at least one of the fifth passengers in the United States had prohibited aircraft.
The survey showed that more than 20 per cent of aircraft aircrafts had been conducted in a shipping bag or accidentally through the point of view of the United States Transport Security Administration, including at least 6 per cent of the aircraft, in spite of the prohibited feet or other severe objects.
Another 1 per cent reported that later they found that they had a fire weapons, bombs or explosive substances.
The investigation carried out by the Stars Jet Charters company, Inc. and more than 1000 people, also showed that young passengers were more strict to violate the rules.
From the respondents who acknowledged that they were aware of trying to flee with something prohibited by ATT, 19.7 per cent were millionary compared to less than 15 per cent of the Generation X members.
A.T.A.A.A. is often a food and water.
More than 3 per cent had been acknowledged that they had been specially conducted through the investigation of extreme objects, and 2,2 per cent of the women ' s respondents and 3,7 per cent of the male respondents acknowledged that they were conducted in the prohibited drugs.
The company stated that passengers were studied throughout the country to know how many of them were conducted in case through the investigation of the airports and how well they did it.
We are expecting that most of them are aware or unreasonable, and that they are shocking the contraband by considering those who fly most.
As the company indicates, the ATB rules are very complicated and inconsistent.
People often don't know exactly what smooth they can transport in.
It is therefore unexpected that the large part of the ATB's chosen is forbidden ironicities.
Some time ago people thought that ATB could be considered forbidden to transport books.
Drugs are authorized on internal races but not on international.
Chapter EPA Prutit is rejected by the purpose of refusing the rules on emission reductions adopted by the Ombudsman
On the next day after the request of 15 State heads of the Environment Agency ' s head, its decision was to reject the implementation of the rules adopted by the Ombudsman to reduce the emissions of air polluting and education.
Priit explained its decision that his Agency is now more than previous administrations to be listened to the needs of the environmental controllers of individual states.
He did not mention the case against his previous position in the Federal appeal Court.
The controversy was turned around the period of 1 October, at which the states must ensure that the 2015 land-level standards were complied with the ground-level standards.
In June, Priit stated that they would respect for a year to give its state more time to study the plan and avoid "the inadequacy of local decisions or obstacles to economic growth".
Praitt, who was appointed by President Trampom to his current post, was a general prosecutor of the Oklakoma State, was long known as a follow-up opposer to the ecological standards.
After the movement to Washington Pruitt has locked or repeated standards contrary to chemical or gas-energy industry .
The unexpected change of the currency in the environment is a natural legal vision of the Penite Kurs to return to the previous standards.
In the last month, the Federal Appeal Court in Washington decided that the head of the EPA had exceededed its powers by trying to delay the implementation of the Administration of the rules required by the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce the loss of metal.
In the statement issued at the midnight, Pruit proposed to consider that the course of the zone standards was slightly changed, he simply complied with the EPA's duty to cooperate with the states in the integrated time-building process of new standards.
"For the previous administrations, the EPA was often not able to place in the current period, then waiting for the groups of activists and other persons and discussed the time for the settlement of the case," said Pruitt, who gave more than two decades to the EPA at its previous post.
"We do not believe in the regulation through judicial processes, and we relate to the deadlines set.
We are also seriously treating our stipulation and the authority he gives us."
However, the EPA statement states that the Privat may at any time re-use its "fullance for the delay and other data of the authority" to ensure that the standards "jcyjdfys in a clear course and all available information."
The Republicns in the Congress have a broader review of the rules relating to ozone.
The draft law adopted by the Party of Representatives in the last month is intended to defeat the 2015 Regulation as a minimum of eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this issue.
The General Prosecutor of New York, Eric Sneyderman, who had launched the coalition of states from the EPA for this week, said that the group planned to continue legal pressure.
" The rechange of the EPA course, after our courses, is an important winning for the fight against health and security of 6.7 million New Yorkians and more than 115 million Americans, which are directly influenced by their city's help," said Sneyderman.
At the outcome of New York, California, Connecticot, Delaver, Illinois, Iwa, Man, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Orion, Pennsylvania, Rod Island, Vermont and Washington, and the district of Colombia.
Earth-level ozone occurs when normal pollutant substances from machines, electricity stations, oil and chemicals and other sources are in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The emerging person may cause serious disorders with the feelings of these people by bringing to thousands of premature deaths a year.
Health Protectors and Environmental Protections welcomed the unexpected change of the Privat course.
"True thinking about how much pressure was needed to get this perfectly logical step from a man who is intended to protect the air that we breathe," said Lori Anne Bard from the Centre of Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to resist the ideological campaign of Trampa and protect those polluting air and their special interests."
The IAAF Congress extended the elimination of the All Russian Federation

More than 10 days ago, the players were playing between themselves in the Russian cube, but this time the game picture was perfectly different.
"Chiskey" wasn't in the opponent, but the second deficiency on the outcome has led to the low and the fascism.
After the recent struggle against the califan, many previously prophesied the light winning of the guests.
However, from the beginning of the meeting, the new museums began to consider and act against the defence, but from the position of the forces.
In the first time, the cowboy was higher and had the advantage of the milk.
Alexy Sirotin, who several times reflected the dangerous attacks and its actions made awareness to partners.
Unfortunately, the Chemist attack had no effort and ships to put Kalugi's defence into the snake and forget the first shooting.
After the break, the game was shocked at meeting courses.
The New York Times were more actively played in attacks.
Our team's careful calls were errors in the defence, which allowed the callahans to make a number of strict moments.
10 minutes before the Chemist's meeting was overcoming the territorial advantage and a few dangerous attacks.
But the experience of Calegan played his role -- they were more grammately and frozenly over the end, surviving their time to take the door.
After the dangerous Chimik attack, the shooting was transferred to the edge that the master field was transferred to the door without resistance.
The author of the Hola became Jury Dubovine.
The reported Chimke showed a bad game but suffered both of the phenomenon.
Before our team is waiting for another exit at 11 August at Moscow at the Torpedo Stadium named Eduard Stellitz, the new museums are fighting with the favorite FK Center, Ararat, which speaks to Roman Paulo, Marath Ismailov, Ygor Lebenko, Alex Rebco.

Of course, neither space nor missiles are in Mexico.
However, it was established by the Space Agency and the desire to develop the own space programme in 2010.
And the installation of the Yuria Gagarin is the respect of the first man in the space.
Rather than the memories of the Council period in some countries, the memories of Gagarin, on the other hand, are "placing the planet".
In 2012, the monument was established in the United States Hostel at the former headquarters of the NASA.
In London, a reminder of the Kingdom Observatory was established for the first 50-year-old fleet in space.
There is a memorandum of Gagarin in Germany in Erfuth, where our space was in 1963.
The memorandum in the Carlos Vaques (Chine) was escaped in 1992 by the public protests and was transferred from the city to the front of the local airport.
In the 70th age of Gagarin in Riga, a memorandum of the Juryus Gagarins.
So it sounds a name and name of the first late space, and it looks like if he was 70 years old.
Mors Ford murder: activists lost the Lynch Courts on the scene to call for justice
Ford Mercuree, in 1948, passed a slaughter in the village of Monroe, in Georgia, and swallowed to the small moon of Mors Ford.
When a car with four black passengers and a white driver came to the bridge, a group of white men with arms made her a way.
The main man in the mid - mid - years in the shooting shock was shocked with smoke and looked through the wind shoes.
Those who sit inside were driving from fear.
"We need that nigger, Roger!" said the man.
Get him out of the car!
A young black man was cut off from the front seat.
Happily, this horrible scene, which won on July 22, is only an incentive.
But when the Roger's shoes shocked the shoes, almost all the shoes were breathing and actually breathing.
Since 2005, activists return to the Mouse of Mors Ford to be played again at the night when the cocklecklacks slept two black-coup pairs, Roger and Dorothy Mallok and George and May Murley Dorsy in 1946.
No one was condemned for these murders.
"Certainly, no man was arrested for all these years - although we see them close to us, although we know who they are," says Tyron Brooks, who helped organize the order.
"It's a skin in our history, and it's a stone in our souls."
71-year-old Brooks, former member of Georgia, who is struggling for human rights.
The spectacle is a dramatic call for action and an annual reminder to the inhabitants of Monroe that the injustice has not been corrected.
"We want to investigate, we want to end up, we want to restore, we want reconciliation, but first we have to achieve justice," he says.
"We can't go to healing and reconciliation until we reach justice."
The Royal is a simple body of one of the victims of drought in Mors Ford on 27 July 1946.
According to the FBI materials received by Ann-Bi-Sy News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighbouring grams were suspected in the lifting.
But no one was sentenced.
Although the suspected decades remained free, the rights defenders said that the city has always known two related guiding motives: policy and sex.
In April 1946, the decision of the Supreme Court first authorized the black citizens to vote on the plomers that were to be held in the summer.
During the same elections, the FBI reported that the black user Roger Malcolm was shocked in the shock of Barnett Hester, the white landowner, because of the woman.
Brooks say that Hester was sleeping with her wife Malcolm Dorothy, and that the child she had to be born was not a husband.
According to the FBI report, on 25 July 1946, Loy Harrison, a large white landowner, paid $600 to release Malcolm from prison.
He went to prison together with Dorothy and their cousins May Murley and George Dorsy.
But when they went out of prison and went to the Mors Ford Mouse, the shooter was around the car.
"It is explained that he organized and commanded Harrison's murders," is concluded in one of the FBI reports.
"By obviously, there was a complaint between the law enforcement authorities of the State and the city which had not only participated in the murder but also destroyed and hidden the personality of witnesses."
Brooks call it short.
"This was a trial for election rights," he said.
"All of them have killed to send a black signal to the city: if you register and vote, you will be the same."
Over ten years, Cassandra Green directs an annual spectacle that plays the thickness of the Mors Ford bridge.
Her spectacle is overlooked, he is slaughtered, and it is about the deep racism that, as many would like to think, is no longer in America.
It's hard to look and it's harder to turn back, but Green believes that it's the main thing.
"We don't want to talk about Lincha's judges, because they show us our own nature," she says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't hear me or do not hear what I've survived."
The spectacle rescue began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors were white, the other blacks gathered in place and listened to the slipped review of the drinks.
Wayd Marbo was a register with Green.
He played a few years of the main member of the clan, but he says that the role was not easier.
"I think I'm missing, because it's not the man I'm," says Marbo.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story, because we don't want to come back at that time."
In the location of the actors, Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who played Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, repeat their roles.
Spectal begins with Malcolm, who has distracted Hester's sleeping with his wife Dorothy, crys and touchs him.
"I said, nig, get out of my house!".
Cry Rascon to answer.
It's shocked.
And at the same time, all of them (also all black actors) are disappointed by honey.
The ring's laughing all.
"What is it?" asks Ascona.
He's worried and funny.
Can I play?
"No," he said, "no."
"I just don't think the white ones were saying nigga."
Yes, it's ridiculous one of the black artists.
"You have to spend a strong 'r'."
Similarly, energy is changed in the room: the discomfort changes the feeling of companion.
Everyone must do it right, not only for drunk, but also for the memory of the four killers.
The scene starts first.
In this time Rascona says the word "n", it will be clear and strict.
No man's laughing.
The spectacle ends evil and fast.
Cricky, shoot, and then calm down.
The woman in a snake black clothes stands on the body of the actors and performs a tragic song of Billy Hollyde Strand Fruit.
His voice is interrupted through the word.
In hundreds of yards of it, half of the shooters slow and smell out of the eye.
Among the rabbits are almost equal to the number of black and white.
One couple came out of that, New York State, to look at the presentation, and many live very close.
They were almost eight hours old to Georgia, while Brooks drived them in the palms of Malcolm and Dorsy.
To this time the murder remained only a story, but now when they stand on the same place where people slept, they seem to be driving here in the air.
When the last note of the song, Green invites people to come closer and look at the body.
Childs die to their heads, shoot to a snack of blood, and the unmovable bodys and the shoeting one another.
"It's not really dead," is a little boy, like to remember himself.
A few minutes later, Green thanks the slaughterers, and then it ends.
The actors strike out the shoes and cut the legs out.
Bradshaw understands Marbo, a man in the kitchen, who played the main cockleks.
Nick Rascona understands two other actors and, soon, smile, falls into their smile: the emotional load of the spectacle was finally inflicted.
"I'm all right," a woman's shirt.
"We know that your heart is good.
You had reasons for this."
Afterward, the snakes sit to dinner with the actors.
On a table, a white couple from Atlanta has a living discussion with a black couple with which they just met.
Dennis Daplensky's work is looking for words to describe what she feels after the spectacle.
"It must be listening to these horrible, horrible words, and... people who look like you, and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"After that I think there's still a shock," she adds, "that's called the police shoot."
In the other edge of the room, Tyron Brooks had a general attention to the work of the human rights defender.
He said that it was started to plan the submission of the next year.
And he says: "The path is encouraged by us, because it is not only the fear of what we have survived, but we are teaching."
"For if you don't get out of this lesson, it may happen again.
Those who do not study their stories, who do not know their stories, are attributed to her replication."

After the unilateral winning of Harry over the former world champion in four pregnant categories of Eric Broner, on Saturday on the Showtime channel, both boxers are in the fifth best boxers outside depending on the pregnancy categories.

Successful to you."

“ I was previously in the weight of weight, ” she recalled.
“ I went up to the category for Broner [140 feet], but I’m not so big.
I'm little for 140.
I want to go back to the helmet.
And he's got to get up to the top of 135 feet, and then we're going to build a unit.
This wants a sweeper.
Let them make it."

New test results were published to evaluate the age of asylum assistants in Sweden
The recent tests of refugee visitors in Sweden, which have made a new medical assessment method, indicate that more than 80 per cent of the protested persons of the age of 18, but not yet believe the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Medical Agency (Rates Medicinal Network) began testing this year.
They were developed to assess the age in providing asylum more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) discovered that it had not been able to determine the age of some refugees who claimed that they were uncomprehensive.
At this time, Migrationsverket sent 6 880 cases to test, and the judiciary office has now published results of 2 481 tests for the period between March and July 31, 2017.
8 per cent (2002) tested as people 18 years or older, and in 25 cases, the judicial physicians estimated that the tested “incredibly 18 or older” was tested.
In the case of 432 cases, the person had said "also less than 18".
Tests are conducted only when human age causes doubt.
According to Johannes Geranceson, the results of the last month are corresponding to the results.
“We are not looking at a great difference with statistics over the last month, the numbers are completely relevant,” he said to the Portal The Local.
The higher part of the cases in which people were estimated as the age of 18 did not need to indicate that refugees have been lying about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and reported that 442 cases were “approximately the age of 18 years or more”.
However, in considering 581 published results, the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper found that in 243 cases the person openly stated that 18 were implemented in that year.
The method of medical assessment of the age in order to make dentists of wisdom and theography of college foundations and give them to the analysis of data and rentgenologists has also argued in some instances.
One of the sceptics is the endocrinologist of the Carolin Institute of Crow Marcus, part of which the work is the evaluation of the biological impact of people in order to determine whether they have passed through sex or later normally.
“I had reasons to think about this, and I don't think that we should use the methods of measurement now.
Biological age is so uncertainly defined.
If we can't determine him with confidence, we don't have to do what we can," he said the Metro newspaper.
However, Gerancen of the judicial medicine has been expressed to the accuracy of the tests: “In general, the risk of a child is wrong to take a child for an adult.
With the greatest risk we face when a person will soon be 18, in that case, he is about 10 per cent."
I'm thinking if I'm balling on the president.

As the financial rules of the football are affected by the movement of Nepal to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unlimited costs from the European football clubs are not prevented by the world's transfer of Nemar from the Spanish Barcelone in the French "Sen-Jermen".
Whatever the consequences may be further on the scene, for the "Sen-Jermen" Parri of the WEF, the Director of the European football Authority, whose authority prohibits the teams to participate in the prestigious tourist League Championship.
According to the financing "fair-pay" regulations introduced by WEFA in 2011, "PSD" should be shown to the end that the transfer of Nepal was financed without a large loss.
Barcellone paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) only for the release of Brazilians from the contract, and Nymar will receive punishment for tens of $1,000 per year.
There are some financial aspects of the movement of Nepal to France.
The “PSJ” may be precisely disappointed to take Nemar and add it to the galactic of other stars, if you consider the financing of the team from the rich energy of Catar's legal family.
The clubs have the right to expend large amounts to purchase players, but they should be balanced in terms of legal income sources in order to achieve rentabilities in their football business.
“FFP” entered Michel Platin after his election by President WEFA in 2007.
The former French footballist believed that the clubs used in great debts in their efforts to achieve, in general, jury, and risked disaster if banks or owners stopped financing.
In 2011, “FFP” stopped focusing on club debts and turned into follow-up to their losses.
As a result of this change in the business model, which Roman Abramovich was used in Chelsea in 2003, was to purchase a club with good capacity, and then to severely cost to improve the team and establish a worldwide bread, became a difficult plan.
During the current third year of the 2018 evaluation, clubs may lose 30 million euros.
Despite the sighting of Platinus from the Presidential post in 2015, his predecessor in WEFA Alexandre Chaferin is still decisively urged to remain exceeding costs.
The “FFP” is alive and we will move forward to the rule,” stated last week by the Associated Press Association André Traverso, who controlled the FFP in WEFA.
The PSC will and pay the purchase of the Nymar contract for a timely time, it may be able to allocate the amount for all the terms of its contract.
Nymar signed the five-year treaty, so that the transfer value can be shown in an annual accounting as the cost of 44.4 million euros during the next five years.
During the first wave of the FFP sanctions in 2014 to the “PHD” and to the belonging Abu Daby, Manchester City, were applied to serious sanctions.
The “PSD” was established in 60 million euros (82 million dollars), which later was reduced to 20 million euros, and was required to limit its composition in the Champion League during the 2014-1015 session 21 players instead of ordinary 25.
The EDF is a club that can try to overcome its financial inspections by developing their income from club owners.
The Catar Companion would be able to fund the GSP, but if the amount of financing would be higher than the standard market estimates, WEFA would not allow it to be considered legal income.
That happened in 2014 when WEFA decided that the amount of the financing of PSJ by the Catar Tourism Office was dismissed.
It was reported that the part of the Nymar's shipping in the SPS could be paid as a payment by the organizational Championship of the World Champion 2022 in Catar.
But “PSJ” and Catar-2022 refused that Nemar will be a world championship, and such a maneuver could easily find WEF inspectors.
The last sanctions imposed on the CPS mean that WEFA will be more careful to follow any attempt to comply with the rules.
As reported on the fourth persons with the situation, WEFA did not have a preliminary discussion with the Nymar transfer.
They communicated with the Association of Press on an anonymous conditions, since they were not authorized to discuss the situation 'PHJ'.
According to the last report, the EUR 542,4 million had been reached in 2015-1016,1 million.
The accounting for the last financial year is not yet published.
“PSJ” expects that the arrival of Naimar will be a favorable mail for the Panzer Trade, sell attributes and footballs with the team logotype.
The club predicts that the traffic will grow as a minimum of 30 per cent because of the new player.
The fact that one of the best footballists was uncertain, the Spanish flag tried to prevent Naimar's transfer, claiming that the 'PHJ' would violate the financial fair-pey'.
“ This apparent case of the “financing duty”, with the club and the State,” stated the Spanish newspaper “AS” President La Liga Havier Tebas, which means that the final ownership of the PSJ is Katar.
Arsenal trainer, Arsen Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sporting magnet, shares the doubt of La Liga about the financing of the State club.
“ This is all the results of the fair participation, and it has completely changed random football over the past 15 years,” said the Wenger Friday.
"When the club belongs to the country, maybe everything.
It is very difficult to comply with the financial fair, because the country may have a lot of ways and a lot of reasons for being presented by such a serious player.
The President will determine the order and location of the provision of sentences
Where and as new Russian citizens will be attributed to the IFF, the President will determine the second amendments to read in the relevant law developed by the Heads of Legislation and Guest.
Another week ago, the deputy planned to determine the order for sentences in the law.
From the provision of the treaty clamp will be released to 18 years, as well as inadmissible, the amended text in the draft "RF citizenship" (e.g. in the "Isself"), which will consider the Committee on 11 July before reading at its second meeting.
The idea of introducing sentences in the entry to RF, instead of the formal signing of the documents of President Vladimir Putin, supported 6 June during the meeting with the Vichela voluntary Hospital.
The deputy made this idea as an amendment to the second reading in the draft legislation, which provides for the cancellation of the citizenship of those who later have been condemned for a number of crimes of terrorism or extremist nature: for example, for public calls to terrorism or its public adjustment in media or online (e.g., p. 2205.2 of the FRC), as well as for aircraft, train or water transport, but only if the act is related to terrorism (art.
According to the draft legislation, it was the logic of it: by formulating documents to citizenship, a person is signed under the promise to comply with the Russian legislation - instead of extremism, he violates that promise.
The draft law was introduced in April by the leaders of the thinking fractions of Vladimir Vasiliv (Russia), Gennadei Zugan (CPF), Vladimir Jillini (LDD), Sergey Miron (Russian Jurisdictional) and the GD Wachelam Voluntein.
On May 19, the deputy adopted it in the first reading.
Last week, the Committee on Hospitality and Legislation adopted the text of draft legislation to second reading, but now it has been reprocessed again.
It now states that the order of provision of judges will establish the President of RF.
The previous parliamentarys had to describe the procedure directly in the Act of the FIR Citizenship, which indicated that the ceremony should be in the trading condition before the public herb and the Russian flag in the presence of the representative of the MDM.
However, the text of the draft legislation was not understood where such events should be held - a list of places where the RF herb may be placed, regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
They include courts, headquarters of the holders, municipal education, courts, prosecutors, heads of the federal authorities, etc.
It would be likely to be the CASs.
To make a trading clamp that wants to obtain CFR citizenship will be after the officials check their documents.
However, the Russian passport will receive only after a sentence, the text should be made.
A week ago in the project, the sentence had to be before the signing of the statement.
The updated text states that Russia will be sentenced since 18 years, not from 14 years.
The rule for which sentences will be released by inadequate or limitedly deficiencies, as well as those who cannot make it possible to read, read or ownerally sign the sentences.
Furthermore, the President of RF has the right to free from this procedure and "persons",
In the updated legislation, also, the special order for acceptance of the Russian citizens of Ukrainian, which are considered by Russian portraits.
They should be officially rejected from the Ukrainian citizenship, providing the relevant statement to the Ukrainian Authority.
The notified copy of the declaration will be sent to Russian officials.
It is not necessary for the "human" citizenship, as well as now, if it is prescribed by an international treaty or if it is impossible "in the power of those who are not defeated from the reason".
The corresponding amendment to the law proposed a group of deputy, among which the first Vice-Vice-Vice-GD Ivan Meller (CPF), the Natalia of Pole, Paul Crashiningers and Irat Farkhov (the only Russian) were.
I think many of you know that you get the help with Ukrainian in reality, just impossible.
Consequently, many people are waiting for the decision of their judges on the CF citizenship, explaining the chapter of the thinking committee on hosting and legislation by Paul Crashiningers (ER).
Furthermore, the text stated that the limitation of certain jobs for foreigners would not be distributed to those who were writtenly rejected from the "now" citizenship and made passports in Russia, but "not depending on the reasons of it" had remained to be considered citizens of another country.
Foreigners are now prohibited to employ municipal service posts, to work on objects and organizations related to Russia's security.
Any person with double citizenship or a type of residence in another country may not be a deputy of the Hospital or a member of the Federation Council.
The law was planned to enter into force since 1 September 2017, at that time, the necessary underlying acts should be prepared.
Nostalia is the "Chark of America's flight" and "Detective Training"
The current history of a newspaper recalls the glorious days of the 80s; the era of the grain in the 1990s (or mostly when the masters of David Wayne and Michael Schwalter made the committee of the sketch for MTV); and it was about 2001 before her stars, as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poller and Pole Rad had been transferred to more serious news.
As cultural facts, it is the increase and enhancement of our epoch with its permanent memories of Facebook.
But as Francis, she seems to be an analysis.
The "First Day of the camp" was a good surprise, not only because of the absorptive humor (including the original history of the speaking of the Forest Bank, heard by H. John Benjamin).
The result is the main shock: Middle age actors play sexually worried children who have only achieved the age of perfection, and they are not able to return to a part of the shock.
"Tween years later," where adults were already playing, they have less deep emotional roots, and their parity is more unsystemized and include rifs from the Starker films of the 90s-year-old Roke.
In one episode, Apple Powerbook, four rodlicks and some of the other things since 1991.
Many of the sudden steps are the same.
Welcome Coup (Shooter), now a writer, has not yet been obtained by Kathi (Margerit Moro).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't disappeared with girlhood.
And there is still a ridiculous and suburb conspiration in which Ronald Reagan (such as Shawlter), who is now underlined by George Bush-older (experienced couple in the implementation of Michael Yan Blake).
As always, the best part of the Francis is a disappearing from her.
Specially glad to see a young Rada who is able to see the song of Matthew Dillon from the Odiaches, whose old man, an old man, now looks old.
The success of this Francis could be an accidental angry in the spirit of the recursive Seven Up series until I think that it would be the logical conclusion of her: "The Great American flight: the twenty years later," where the entire company would slow to the film in the last scene.
The "detective" in Amazon is called to another type of newspapers: memories of the cold war from the Americans, the "Strong Brondy" or even the "Black" with its shapes of the East and West.
The committee created by Brian Gattoud and Alexandro Tanack with the register Rizm Thomas is a television: the Rumanian Police Drama of the 80s on two polices in Buharрест, who fight for the truth, the atheism and the Marxist-Lean.
The main roles of Gregor and Idealist Joseph perform Florin Piersik and Cornelly Urich and heard their English dialogs in Channing Tatuum and Joseph Gordon Lewit.
That's a ridiculous idea.
But just a idea.
There are several visual shocks (the police shocks have time to check out how the Americans could look at a football).
The chairman vote team, including Jenny Slett, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevini, is a very interesting playing in the "smell of the voice".
But "detector" is so holding for the deceased propagandist drama -- there's even a killer in the rock mask of Ronald Reagan, which often looks like it.
Six long episodes are broken, and it is not very common.
If it would be slowly done, "Detective" could be better to do with her stir in the spirit of a agepropa; for example, when Gregor and Joseph come to the American community, two sweet men are sitting in the Wednesday.
This image of the Communist says that the western culture is possible from which to be grained.
We do so even with our recent history and with them.

England's bank maintains rates at 0.25 per cent
It is expected that the Bank of England later announces that percentage rates are not changed after a weak economic growth and a declining inflation have been made to highlight the earnings of the possible improvement.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth remains unreasonable, and left percentage rates without changes in the increased pressure on family income.
The Commission's monetary and framework policy specialists (MPC) voted with the result of 6 against 2 per cent for the maintenance of 0.25 per cent, and in that month, less of the members of the Committee had increased rates because the weak economic growth had decreased the increase.
In its quarter report, bank inflation was limited to the increase of 1,7 per cent in 2017 and 1,6 per cent in 2018 and warned that the pressure on family income continued, while still expected that inflation is up to 3 per cent.
However, the bank warned that the increased rates in the next few years would be necessary to control the inflation brochure, and stated that business costs probably should be stronger than expected for financial markets.
The members of the Committee also proclaimed to reject the part of the public comprehension of economic development launched a year ago as a result of the bracelet.
Starting from February, the bank will close the urgency financing plan for which he provides low credits to banks, although he had reported that it would now be in the framework of the plan to provide more than 15 billion feet, up to 115 billion feet.
In the bank decision protocol, “in accordance with the main predictions of the MPC, the growth of the currency internal product (WFP) remains slow while the pressure on real income continues to affect consumption”.
On the basis of the tax, he repeated that to stop the inflation, the need for “unnecessary financial policy,” in“no more” size than the market expected.
At this time, the markets provide the first increase in the third fourth next year and another in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that all increases will be “progressive” and “limited”.
Bank proposals for increase in this and the next year below than the projects made in May, which were equal to 1,9 per cent and 1.7 per cent.
The Bank left its instinct prognosis in 2018 by 1.8 per cent.
After the news, the sterling falled in relation to the dollar and the euro.
Fund dropped by 0.5 per cent to 1.31 US dollars and 0.4 per cent to 1.11 euros.
The decision was not changed after the recent inutilities of growth were expected to increase, and the GDP increased by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter of 0.2 per cent in the past three months.
According to the representative of the bank, growth, which is all, remains at the level of 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, although the end of the year is little.
The last report of the inflation bank was fewer for the joy of households in which high inflation was affected and the totally fewer payment increases: according to the bank's statements, pressure will be increased before slowing.
Bank added that the financial policy “not can prevent” the wages in the next few years, but expected that payments would be “important” to the end of his three-year-old prognosis.
Economics also have increased results of the growing demand of British products resulting from a low fund rate that compensates part of lower consumer costs.
The decision was adopted a year after the rates were decreased in August last by 0.25 per cent after the shocking results of the Euro-Women ' s exit issue.
According to the evaluations of the bank, it may be necessary for four years to make full impact on prices and economy.
Before the bank has made his last tax decision, the sound of the expected increased rates slowed, as the inflation has increased and so experiencing household pressures: three specialists asked to increase rates up to 0.5 per cent in July.
In the last month, inflation has fallen up to 2.6 per cent from 2.9 per cent in July, although the bank reported that the fall was expected and reimbursed in the next months.
According to the bank, the higher indicator compared to the planned 2% is the result of a low amount of funds.
Andrew Montreak, director of the Coreko Epothetic Brochure Company, said: “If you take account of the recent decline of sweet rates, it will be more competitive, since creditors require business opportunities and account for a good year.
The line seems particularly favorable for those who are close to the end of their existing treaties, as the refinancing of credits, often with the possibility of lack of the Commission and with a low rate, becomes popular as ever."
The State Health Service writes the controversy of HIV 10000
Since September, patients will be accessed to the “revolutionary” preparation for HIV prevention after fighting in the High Court on the financing of preparation from the State Health Service.
The National Health Service announced that the pre-positional prevention of HIV (PRIP), the treatment taken before the sex, which was proved to reduce the risk of infringement in persons in the risk group, at average 86 per cent, will now be provided for health services during the initial three-year test period of approximately 100,000 people.
She agreed to finance the test after the Appeal Court supported the decision of the High Court in the past year, in which the National Health Service had the opportunity to pay the PRI, despite its statement that it had to finance local authorities.
The step announced in the Friday was called the President of the National Health Service of England Simon Stevens, and the National Monitoring Office of the Distribution of AIDS (NAT) was called it as a “return moment”.
Before the full run of the program throughout England to April 2018, the venerological diplomas in London, Briton, Manchester, Liverpool and Shefffield will start registering people, and more distributors will be joined in October.
Pre-Positional Protection (PRP) is the rate of HIV preparations that were taken before the sex to reduce HIV infection risk.
As shown in the study, PEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infringement among people in the risk group.
In receipt of the PRI before sex in the human body, the sufficient number of preparations specified to prevent HIV infection.
Such preparations can be taken daily or not after two hours before sex.
Patients with the right to prepare are homosexual and biologically, transgenders and people who have HIV-posite partners and have not been successfully treated.
Dispansors will take appropriate participants agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgenders and persons whose partners are unknown, whether their HIV status of antiretroviral therapy is detained.
Persons who live and applies to the doctor of general practice in England will also be able to make a request for potential participation in the nearest venerological diploma that takes part in the programme.
The programme will be 10 million feet, and the National Health Service of England this week after the International Tanner to purchase was signed in the preparatory treaty.
A study was built in order to assess all the Clean data possible for the collection of Clinical data on the purpose of the preparation auditor, its reliability and use in a large scale.
“ This important renewment should be added and strengthened by broader and successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another century of more than three decades of success against one of the largest threats to health, with which humanity has occurred.
Debora Gold, President of the NAT (National AIDS Distribution Control Management), said: “This is a turning point in combating HIV.
The PRP, if it is grammatly emphasized to people who need assistance and risks, will enable to change the situation of HIV epidemia in England.
Since September, people who are in the HIV risk group, through this study conducted in England for the National Health Service, will receive access to the new open-ended resources that could be used to control themselves, without discussing this with a partner that will lead to improvement in many lives.
We welcome this news.
Jan Green, President of the Terrence Higgins Fund, said: “The first time it is to be worried about the testing in the whole country and that no one of the HIV risk groups should be forgotten.
Now, when we are providing an experimental PRP, we go to protect more than 10000 HIV risks.”
Sheron Hodgeson, the Deputy Minister of Public Health, said: “We are very welcome to the beginning of the PEP test, which has been very delayed for months and delays from the Government.”
Data shows how revolutional this prepair could be as part of our approach to prevent HIV and stop transfer of this year's infection.
This test approaches us to a step to a comprehensive understanding of the PES' advantages.
It is now important that the test is as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people in the HIV risk group and to continue to step up to the end of the dissemination of HIV in society.

On 11 July, the Chairman of the Tataristan requested the President of Russia to extend the agreement and to maintain the name of the head of the region.

In Russia, there were complications in receiving international driver rights
AIDS units have experienced the deficit of international driver certificates.
In order to obtain such rights, a few weeks should be expected to have a real problem for departments wishing to go to the border on their car or take it there.
It should be noted that the situation with international driver certificates remains contrary.
IWU was introduced in order to understand more about the national certification, as the information is explained in five languages.
The requirements for international rights are recorded in the Vienna Convention on Road Movement in 1968, but in countries ratified by the Vienna Convention, Russian rights are also recognized.
However, all of them depends on the specific police or prosecution contracts: some of them require an OMI and some of the sufficient national rights.
In order to undermine, international rights drivers are still obtained, but it should be taken into account that the authority of non-ratifying countries (e.g., United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) should not be recognized by national rights or undertakings.
There is now a problem with the blocks of almost all the HIBD units, reports "Commerceng", conducting research in a number of regions.
Yes, in Moscow's units, there's only four months of HHID tanks.
It can be recorded at the hostage site, but there is already cutting up in the middle of August.
In the Krusoisk IU, it is not possible to get "for technical reasons", without details, the Samaritan area says honestly that there is no blocks, the same situation is also in other cities.
Many of the mosquitos have already been discussed with the problem, and the social reports are more often available:
Irina Burmistrova: "Remember why Moscow cannot obtain international rights?"
That is right, because all of the HIBD offices have been finished.
Elena Podkolzina:
The international law must be obtained urgently.
In Moscow, there is always a long way to get away, and there is no way out of the balls (no one is but it can't give it).
The portal of the hospital shows that in the Spb time is free to the floor.
Have anyone been worried about receiving another city?
Does it work?
As stated in MWF, the requirements for international driver certificates have changed, so the Hosaut Inspection Unit has implemented new blocks.
This may be related to the deficit, in fact, unexpectedly, which changes have been made before.
Blocky purchases the Centre for Trade Safety (SCN BD) and then puts them into the HIDD unit.
In the past years, all contracts were with AO Gonzak: almost 2000,000 MWB banks were prepared in 2014-2015, 150,000 blocks were purchased in 2016, in 2017 to 90 000, but the last contract was concluded with OOO on 18 July.
There's a version that the CIA just didn't sleep at the time, because of the deficit.
However, there are other versions of lack of burns: because of the crisis, many people have become self-reaching not to Europe, but in the more quiet Asian countries - China, Thailand, and so further.
What rights have been taken there, until the end is unexpectedly, therefore people and the people are overcome, and therefore a swimming demand on international " shorts".
Recently it was known that professional drivers should be checked to confirm their qualification.
The proposal was made by Mintrance.
The new image of the International Driver Certificate (IWU) operates since 31 May 2011.
The Ministry of Justice refused to believe in the construction of the Cross Mosque
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine Paul Peter said that it would not believe in Russia’s ability to build a bridge in the Red.
On Thursday, 4 August, he said to the portal of the Prosecutor.
There is no respecting international company, even balls or hake, because it is risking to lose its business in the EU, the United States, Japan, in countries joined against Russia's sanctions.
"There is, in my deep conviction, there is no prospect in this project", said Peter.
He added that Russia was not able to implement a large infrastructure project self-sufficiently.
Russia could not normally build a fewer objects.
I know that after the Olimpiade in Sochi, the whole stadium began to be destroyed.
"I think that the best tool in this situation is the sanctions against companies that were so inadequate to join this project," said the official.
On July 31, the buildings completed the shift of the Cross bridge.
The counterparty of the Cross bridge is completed on the board, which is shocked at 45 meters (45 m) from the foundation of the construction.
"Only motorists have prepared a plant on the swimming arc on the shock", reported in the project centre.
In April, the President of Russia, the President of Warcraim Putin, informed that the object was delayed by the graphics.
The Croming Bridge is connecting the Cross Middle East and the Red Road.
In Spain, an employee who had not been employed for 10 years
How should an angelic patient (or an absolute insufficient to the public service) be the Spanish chief of Carles Resio?
The permanent passenger was slowed for 10 years.
However, Mr. Recio was still dismissed.
But not his direct chief.
What isn't happening only in the Bureau world.
It seems like it's a long time to shoot all the shoes of the people.
However, the officials will always be surprised by those who live well.
At this time, "sensation" welcomed Spain.
There, the officer of the Archive Valencia Carles Recio, was struggled over the whole ten years, not to work.
In that regard, he regularly received forgiveness.
A total of EUR 500,000 per year.
And here's the wonderful times, Mr. Recio.
He was allowed to decide the Valencia's legislative congregation.
The investigation discovered that the bad passenger had come to the office at 7:00 a.m. every morning to take place in the electronic system.
And here he went home.
Once again, he appeared to work at 16:00 to see again in the system that he left.
And that's 10 years.
It was also known that all the free time of the passenger was dedicated to the design of mixtures at home.
Now, the deputy of the Valencia's legislative congregation are thinking how Mr. Recio was a direct leader who couldn't know how to work actively on his workplace.
Judges propose to protect the Presidents
The Presidential Council on Human Rights (HIV) on the Administration of Vulumir Putin has developed proposals for strengthening the judicial independence of the authority.
It proposes to limit the power of the chairmans and to introduce their choice.
For the courts of appeal and cassation of CSDs, special circles are intended to be introduced which will not be involved to the administrative and terrorist delegation in the FF.
His proposals under the Presidential mandate should also be submitted by the Supreme Court.
The CSD has concluded the development of proposals that will enhance the independence of Russian justice.
This work was held on the mandate of the Wormira Putin of 3 January 2017, which was given by the President after the meeting with the Council.
The meeting of the members of the Council of 8 December 2016 was discussed, including individual cases of the court, as well as the issue of public control in the field of citizens' arrest (see " .
The total work of the GDP has been 25 proposals concerning the independence of the courts and the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremelean rights defenders is the limitation of the powers of the chairmans to improve the independence of the other judges.
If the applicant has successfully passed the competitive and received support to the court community, the President of the Court of Justice must, in view of the CHR, submit it to appointment, without having the right to reject how it allows the law now.
It is also proposed that the Chairman ' s right to distribute the cases to the courts.
This may, allow experts, a specially written computer program.
The CHR also believes that the Chairman is not “determining the results of the qualification of the judges, launching its responsibilities to discipline, to decide on establishing additional material payments”.
The Chairman's Council considers that it is necessary to "sele the elections of judges by the judges itself" and to "to give them powers to a relatively irrespective period with compulsory slaughterment".
Now, all judge chairmans (for the Republic of the Republics to the districts) are appointed by the President for six years to submit the President of the Supreme Court of Justice.
In order to appeal the judges from the pressure of regional administrations, the COP proposes to newly organize appeal and cassure in the courts of the general judicial courts.
Their structure is now linked to the administrative and terrorist delegation of RF.
The CHR states that "the organization of individual courts of appeal and cassation should not be at the level of administrative courts in RF submissions, but in courts".
Experts are based on the practice of arbitration courts.
There are “countries” which are not Administrative Delegation in the RF, but guaranteed by this large independence from regional officials who are difficult to use the telephone law.
The World Courts of the CPs proposes to strengthen the people's meetings in order to consider some of the civil and administrative categories.
For example, the exemption of parents ' s rights, the restoration of work, the protection of honor and dignity, the extent of the driving rights, etc.
"It's only our proposals," explained the members of the CHR, the judge of the Constitutional Court in the departure of the Mozambique Tamara.
She also recalled that the mandate of the Chairman was not only Aids, but also to the Supreme Court (US) who had not yet discovered its proposals.
The time for the implementation of the mandate in the PRC (middle of the Génprocurator and the Human Rights Authority) is still available.
To add the Volmier Putin on the effectiveness of the RF independence of justice, the Chairman of Vichela Lebedev should take place until 1 September.
Living a high life: half of the designer and swimming accommodations have converted this small apartment in Erls Cort in space housing
Joan Lee, an ex-banker involving in movement, moved from a space home to a apartment in Erls Cort in 2014.
The Quarter is on the first stage of a sympathical home in the style of the Queen Anna, and in the benefit of the new design, he said that Joan has not collected its things and did not move again.
“ I lived with my former in Natsbridge in a larger range, ” says Joan.
“ I searched for something compared to my money.
I've shown this apartment in Eres Cort, and there were the same high shoes here.
I loved her and offered a price on the same day."
Since the first vision of the apartment, the area has transferred a full reconstruction of 1000 square feet.
This was originally a apartment with a complex bed – to get to bed, it was necessary to walk through the kitchen – and Joanna wanted to add spaces to store and half avail to survive the maximum use of the pool height.
“ I wanted high clouds, large windows, a lot of light.
That was my requirements," she says.
To this end, she started Erfan Azadi from the architectural design studio at Notting-Hille to use the fluid at 12,5 feet high and to create a household that would not only be successful but would be Joan for life.
It was not enough to build two places above one another, so the architectural task was to build a half where a full growth could be made.
Erphane had to think about creatively to handle a bluff.
"Labour with stabil constructions is very complicated," he explains.
“We had to make a place so that they could be on the other side, and they shouldn't have died.
It was not just to build a simple platform, but to shoot construction so that they were at the right height and to allow to use the places above and down."
This decision allowed Erfan to establish two full-scale rooms above each other in an outstanding space – and much more interesting.
A medium-sized medium light window from "Retrouvius" is opened up a view on a smooth guest down.
The golden furniture, silver accents and winning machines from Serja Muya takes a project style.
The use of the mirror plays a role in adding the tangibleness, space and light.
A short corner is covered with a mirror so that it's longer.
The grid protector panel seems to be a window in the other room.
In the entry of the spectacles, they serve to store all the Joan's ships.
To create a more growing space, the beauty of a guest may be rewarded when it is not used.
There's nothing new in the kitchen.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it is a swimming door up like in the garage.
“There was an engineering art” said Ertan about the armed shields of the shield door.
"He is sanctified by the opposite, so when you throw the door upward, it is quite easier."
Thanks to the wise use of space and storage location, Joan received more than 16 square meters, additional bed and improved planning.
"In the end, the gender area is that you will sell, that is, what your inmobility is evaluated," says Ertan.
“Indeed, trade agents will enter and calculate on the basis of gender area.”
Here they have been able to increase the area of gender using quality materials that provide the space of the vegetable area.
“Matrial is what we're trumpling, so they're helping to create a emotional relationship with the house,” says Erfan.
“No one is loved by electrical guides in the walls.
It is important, but is not the strikes of our hearts."
This has proved that, according to the good design and the increased apartment, a apartment may normally become something awkward.
Really, like Joan, you can decide to stay.

MI: VSU fighters agree with Donbassa's officials from the command
A regular phone link was established on the line of armed opposition in Donabass.
The fighters of the fighting parties are constantly communicated with each other on mobile phones, and they do not know the communication in the stages.
The U.S.U.S. and Donbush's employees have established social phone communications from their high command.
This reported on 4 August, "Strana.ua" with a reference to the military operation participants in Donbass.
According to the publication, the office teams have well known the names of their colleagues with the anti-powered front, and they are communicated daily on their phones.
Communication is absolutely unreasonable: the commanders are trying to achieve a few "tactic contracts".
The results of such discussions are a part of the transition to a certain part of the front.
Journalists were known when the welcome of a birthday of a officer was received from the front line, from its formal enemy.
The VSO fighters and DNA and LNDs sit in the division lines since spring 2014 when Ukraine began a war operation against Donbass.
IMD has delayed the locking of UNDP statements on RF Attacks
The Russian Foreign Political State has been displaced by the actions of individual Western diplomatic representatives that block the declaration of the United Nations in press condemned by the RF State in Syria.
This reports the Russian Middle East.
The State recalled that the Russian Police Territories in Damaskus, 2 August, had been a third-party shooting shooting by terrorist groups Haat Tahrir Ash-Sham (the former Jabhat An-Nuzra, prohibited in RF), and Philake Ar-Rahman.
Bearing in mind that the international community in the qualification of Nizzar as a terrorism organization, and UNSB resolution calls on opposing this structure, the MID RF noted that it would be said that the Terrorists of Nicera should meet a comprehensive and decisive condemnation, and in evaluations against diplomatic representatives there should be no duality.
However, as noted in the diplomacy, “in the third time in the month, the United States, Britain, France and Ukraine, the United Nations Security Council, in a different way, widespread towards the interpretation of the importance of information, blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to adopt a standard declaration of the Security Council for pressing a terrorist attack against the Russian diplomatic capital”.
The desire to demonstrate diplomatic solidarity with us remains aware of these delegations.
" The more important thing that the Security Council ' s incapacity to condemn the acts of terrorism is to promote them to new invasions and terrorists, give them feeling impunity," stated in the MIT, and added that "it would not want to make the barriers a conviction that someone in the Security Council would like to do with them. "
Vladimir Putin expressed the limitation of the number of unplanned business checks
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, during the Investment Meeting in the Forest, stated that the number of undertaking checks should be reduced to 30 per cent of the plans, and said that it was necessary to limit the deadline of ten inspections.

Vladimir Putin also said that it was necessary to prohibit researchers to remove servers and hard disks on businesses.
Furthermore, the President ' s views that business associations should have the right to protect the interests of their members in the court.
" This hopes to make a certain position to consider business activities, or to violate the law of undertaking", said the head of the State.
As reported by the Moratory Action on Planning Checks, the number of other types of undertaking inspections increased.
In May, a investigation was made by the President of Russia, Boris Tito, on the order of the Ombudsman, which was found that it had actually been replaced by the immediate planned checks (for the increased 21.9 per cent in 2015 to 30.8 per cent in 2016), the prosecutors (from 16.9 per cent to 21.8 per cent), the raids (of 7,9 per cent to 13.3 per cent) and the citizens' declarations checks (augmentation from 15 to 19.5 per cent) and administrative investigations (10.8 to 15.5 per cent).
More details about the checks of business with small business have come from the other side."
Brothers are fighting for the imperiality of more than $500 million
Two brothers are fighting for one of the largest in Victorian Empires in trade in an inmobility of over $500 million, 40 years after their Italian predecessors were based on dinastics.
The former director of the football club Carlton and the manufacturer of Colin de Lucis lives in the gate of Turk through three doors from his young brother Paul, who gave it to the Supreme Court for ownership and assets.
Paul wants to go out of the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court has been a terrible dispute on divorce conditions.
However, with her mother, Anna’s brothers have 87 more than half-millionary dollars than their family purchased a shop in Smit-Strate in Collingua in 1973.
There was a family based on the Westco Jeans company, which has grown into a network of 160 commercial points.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
Days were introduced in movement, and the list of families of De Lucis includes the official buildings today in Brussels and Sorrento, the apartments in the Zone Area and Maunt-Buller and the commercial centers in rewards.
According to the agreement with the dead father of Cole, Paul, whose family De Lucis describes the "governmental power and household" of the family, belongs to about two thirds of the company assets, and Paul is about one third.
According to the court, the property of the curnacle is 316 million, and the Pole is 176 million.
Department of property and money became for the Paul of the Confusion Steel.
"The Razdel proposed to give him, at my view, the best part of the ownership", he wrote in his first statements in 2015.
On Thursday, after a few unsuccessful attempts of reconciliation, the first hearing was held at the Supreme Court.
Brothers are now talking about whom will control the existing business, from which Paul's views have been excluded.
Colin claims that it is not true but accused of Paul in non-competentious management of some objects.
In the indications shown at the beginning of the process, it is hoped that the conflict is permitted.
"My Italian roots impose me to consider the family as the top priority," he wrote.
Judicial expenditure is grown as a sneak: hundreds of pages of indicators, electronic letters and reports such as Deloite, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer; both of the most famous lawyers, including the Royal lawyer Allan Mayersa and the best stricts.
Ms. De Lucis and her dead mate Louisi were immigrants from Italy, since the end of the 1950s they managed milk bars and gastrones, and bought a shop in Brussels at the beginning of the 1970s.
Under financial guarantees, they purchased a business in Collingvud, where the first family shop was opened by Jins.
Colin said he started Westco when he was "in the last schools, and Paul was a boy (approximately 10 years)."
Anna De Lucis said that they and Louise who died in 2012 were expected to transmit their possession to children without conflict.
"Luidy often told me that he didn't want the brothers to be judged," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer involved in the De Lucis group; when he says that Mark received 10 million people when he left the business and 26 million Luke.
According to Paul and Luke, Mark and Mark were “unpleasantly satisfied with the financial conditions of their office.”
Colin was not a public figura, although it was an ex-member of the AFL Club Directors Board and, as published in 2015, Eddie McGir, the best friend of the TV.
"Ferfax Media" was connected to Colin and Paul and their lawyers.
He just answered the text message that, because the case wasn't considered in the court, "I haven't really nothing to say."
"I'm so sorry that my brother Paul decided to make me search and strike in the court name of our family," he wrote.
Colen wrote in the midday 2016 that he tried to meet the brother's requirements.
"Our father wouldn't want to see Paul and I'm going to fight in the court," he said, "they still hopes to resolve the conflict."
On Thursday, this hope seems to be divorced.
"In our case, the case will be made soon by the court", wrote Cole.
The New Chapter of Trampa Ageo plans to limit the income of information to the President.
Others tried to do that and suffered.
Maybe John F. Kelly's really gonna get it.
In that case, he will be first.
Political reports that the new head of the White House Avenue plans to limit the flow of information to President Trampou, including the newspapers of the media, to keep the chief in a more calm state.
That's what the reporter Josh Douzzi reports.
"In the meeting of the new head of the White House John F. Kelly with the machine leadership at his first working day, he marked the main problem in the Belarus house at President Donald Trampy, which he hopes to solve: the bad channels of information to the President."
Kelly said to the staff that information should be through it, in a paper or in a briefing, because the President would be better to make decisions if he would get the right information.
Diagnes Kelly is completely faithful, but others have already suffered the failure by trying to die to Trampa and follow the income of information to him.
The relationships of President Trampa with TV have been placed a few decades ago - and now, when he is at Belle House, his appeal to watch television is still strong.
"When Trump was a candidate to the unfair light of the campaign, it was useful to demonstrate him that he had received a fair light in the publications that could be overcome," said in February, Sam Nanberg, former election stage advisor.
Tara Palmeri then wrote to the Politico that "as the words of six former members of the electoral stage to keep the Traampa's identity control in Twitter, it had to be followed that it would be a permanent flux of loving to him."
Okay.
But the idea that Trampa's appeal to write to Twitter was never under control, it's just funny.
Maybe these members of the election stage know something we don't know, for example, that if not, the Twitters would have been even more invasive.
We may never know about the Twitters that Tramp has not published.
If his staff were safeguarded by distresss, though several times, their efforts were not stressed.
But no one has always been able to keep the trumpet from the shield of oil in the fire.
Some of the problems are that the Belarus house, separated by confronting fractions, has always tried to extend its agenda, giving the Trumpus material to be reliable or not, which confirms their views.
"Political" - as once to this story - wrote in May on the tendency of the advisers to continue to accompany the President of doubts.
This is one example described by the reporter Shane Goldmacher:
" The current and former Trampa staff said that Trump could react very closely to press reports, especially with dangerous information losses, and is not concerned until he finds who stands behind them.
This happened at the end of February when someone sent the President on the post with GotNews.com, the website of Charles K. Johnson's web advisor, whose head of the Catee Walsh was accused that she was "to be in the Belarus house."
It is not important that Johnson is permanently engaged in Twitter for the aggressive behavior that he did not submit specific facts or that in the past he made false accusations and then rejected them.
Tramp read the article and asked the Walsh staff."
Goldmacher adds that then the head of the Rains Camp and the secretariat Robb Porter's device had tried to build a system to manage the tramp flow and document them.
How did that work?
Three months later, Kelly tried to do the same.
It may be a more effective manager than Ribus, but Trampa continues to be immunized, and his assistants continue to fight against one another for the influence.
These continuous factors make Kelly's task very difficult.

Italy is already a ton for NGO ships saving migrants.
Italy warned NGOs belonging to the Mediterranean Mediterranean that they would not continue to work if new rules that regulate their activities were not implemented.
"If NGOs are not subject to the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they can continue their activities", said the Ministers of Interview of the Tourism daily newspaper.
The warning of Minniti was on the next day following the Italian authorities confidenced a vessel belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rettet, as suspected that his equipment actually cooperates with traffickers and facilitates illegal immigration.
The civilian organization, which was working throughout the year, rejected comments on the existence of detailed accused against it by the Italian Prosecutor Ambredjo Cartocio.
"The salvation of human life is and remains the top priority, so we are very regretted that we cannot continue to work in the search and salvation zone," says the organization in the community.
"We can evaluate all the charges made now, only after we collect all the information and assess the situation."
Italian authorities follow the Jugend Rettet court from October.
His equipage suspected that the whole savings ships had taken on the board of migrants whose trafficking were directly sent to them and allowed contractors to go together with ships that they could re-use again.
As at least one of these meetings is expected, there was a total of 1,3 miles from the Libyan border, which is declared in the materials of accused which the content was published in Italian media.
The Equipage is suspected in violation of the prescriptions of Italian western authorities that control saving operations in this area, more than any other motivation.
The Code of Comporting provides primarily that the Court type of the United States will have the board of the Italian police officer, which will follow their activities.
As long as only three of the nine NGOs participating in search and saving operations agreed to subscribe the Code of Saving children, the Malta Mosque and the Pro-Activa Exposed Training from Spain.
The latter stated on Friday that the new rules are not necessary but acceptable, provided that they do not affect any "important changes or grounds" to its saving operations.
Among those who refused to sign, the Nobel Premier Organization for Disabled Drugs (MSF).
Thus, Minniti said that the slight reduction in the last weeks of migrants arrived in Italy as a result of rescue operations indicated that the efforts to support the liquid sea protection and cooperation with the local seamers have produced fruits.
"In the last days we started seeing light at the end of the tunnel," said Minister.
He reported on further negotiations with the Libyan Mares on economic development initiatives and Chad, Nigeria and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants abandoning these countries in hope to reach Europe.
"In Libya, we don't want to associate any of the conflict."
RF authorities have recently intensified their Level Policy, and with visits to Moscow, they participated in the anti-liby combating delegations.
Head of the Russian contact group on internal settlement with RF and Hosidee, Chairman of the Czech Republic of Lev Daygov, said the aim of Moscow in the region and to whom the rates are to be taken.
About the Libyan contact group, which you call, almost nothing knows.
Here, let's say, the Ukrainian contact group is all about it.
And here's the weight of secrets.
What are you doing, and what are your goals?
The Contact Group was established under the RDF initiative and the State thoughts.
Her activities were smoking by the Minister of Foreign Affairs Mikhail Goddan and Adam Delimano (Deputy Duma from Chechnie. - " ✔").
The last authorized to work on the liquid direction by the Vichela Voluntana.
The group was a detention in Libya, the Russian dancer, Mechanic Chabotarev (in September 2015, 11 persons were on board. - "Quit").
We thought about how to help the equipage.
Then, a group of military specialists, representatives of the Hospital, has also been established to support the Chief Channie Ramzan Kadaro.
How did you get it?
As I worked in Libya since 2008, I was invited to call on the group's work.
Our activities were not limited to the freedom of marine from the Cheboterarea Mechanic.
We have been able to establish contacts with representatives of all the main groups that are opposed to each other in the Libyan conflict, and from the third part of the Tripolis, where the UN Government is based on the head of the Fais of Sarajem. - ✔, and Tobrook (resident of the parliament, which opposes the Government and supports the Haftar Marshes of the Eastern Regions of Libya).
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Methyg (Vice-Premier Libya, " у"), we could quickly agree on the release of Russian marine.
Then it was decided to create a contact group more effectively.
Its task is analysis of the circumstances, identifying key factors and players, dialogue with all the parties of the conflict.
I would like to emphasize: In Libya, we do not want to associate with any of the conflict sides, we conduct dialogue with all.
How many are in the contact group and how many of them are constantly in Libya?
The contact group now includes five people.
Some of them have experiences in force structures, including the Ministry of Defence.
We also want to integrate a group of experts in the region, representatives of the Institute of the Middle East of the RAN.
There is no one in Libya until we have no need.
If there are Russian military advisers in Libya now, instructors.
And if so, who's on the side?
Russian military specialists in Libya are not available.
All conversations and publications on this are not real.
But in your contact group, the former soldiers have...
Yes, they need to be presented.
For example, when we visit the warm point.
Or close to a certain time for us, such as the Misurerate (which is based on the functioning offices playing the role of the Level leader of Muammar Kadafi in 2011 and significantly actived in the following years).
We came to Missouri in January this year.
We're scared, they said you're all the Islamics, the terrorists.
But it was important for us to evaluate the situation, to analyze the real military capacity that responds to the reason why the ears to the role of Islamics.
In the Misulate, we met all representatives of the IH destruction in Syria (in December 2016, this city was discovered in the Mediterranean Valley of Russia ' s prohibited "Islam State".
We wanted to look at them, to meet these people, to check the information that they have played a crucial role in the destruction of the IH in Libya, not Kalifa Haphtar, which was attributed to them.
What outcome did you come to?
Is the Islamic State in Libya won't Haphtar?
He wasn't doing this.
Haphtar has been operating on a other front in Bengasi.
And with the IH in Syria, the structures undergoing to the Government in Tripoli were fighting.
And on the other hand, we invited people to Russia to conduct this anti-terrorism operation.
And they came - visit extended from 19 to 23 April this year, the Little delegation adopted in the Federation Council, Douma, MIT and Russia.
You have understood that you are in all the Libyan regions and you probably represent local elites and field commanders.
How do you think that it could be possible to implement a war stop agreement, about the elections reached at the end of July at Halifa Haphtar and Fais Saraj at the end of July?
Or how has this been once again happened in the past, will agreements be ruled, war action will be restored, and the parties will try to take the authority unilaterally?
For us, a good signal was that Sarah and Haftar agreed to a regular meeting, not so long as it was impossible.
In the past recent, both leaders were extremely negatively reacted to each other.
What about Russia's position...
Many believe that Moscow is actively supported by Haphtar.
We faced this situation when we were in Misulate, and Haphtar was just on the Russian aircraft board.
It was a convergence.
But they did not believe in the Misulate.
We said, "You must be very brave people that have come to us today."
But our task is as to show that we are not only supporting Haphtar, we lead to dialogue with all key parties to the conflict in Libya.
You've been talking to Haphtar.
Does it facilitate understanding with Russian partners at human and emotional level that he has learned two times in the SSSS?
And, of course, do Haftar know Russian language?
He's Russian if he knows, it's very relative.
But what he has learned is, of course, helping dialogue with him.
And among others, not only with him.
When we communicate with the military in Tripoli and Misulate, we meet generals who have learned in Russia or still in the Council.
And here they're beautifully talking about Russian.
And they go to Russia, and somehow they're experienced by it.
Did you read the possible abolishment of a weaponsamburg in relation to Libya?
Are you interested in the providing of Russian weapons?
Of course, but, as I have said, we do not act in this conflict with some of the parties and would not want to weapon one another to harm others.
We would like everyone to be closely in equal positions.
With regard to the armed embargo, the liquidists are constantly calling for Russia to make it possible.
The Constitution process is now active in Libya.
We hope that the parties will take compromising decisions and reach an internal consensus.
Then the elections should be held at the Saraja and Haphtar meeting.
If elections are held and finally chosen to the legitimate authority (who there is no part of that status), there is a question of the removal of the armed embargo in the United Nations.
To put this issue now unreasonable and dangerous, it will only lead to the excavation of the conflict.
At the time of the media, Italy, who had faced the problem of African refugees, has felt that he had been broken in the courts of the EU.
Can Moskova help Italian partners in this situation using their link to liquors?
How, for example, is it realistic that the Haphtar offices will install the border control and put the end of the business of immigrant contractors in Europe?
A very time question.
We're active about that.
Italians need to support Russia, since Moscow has conducted dialogue with Haphtar and Sarajeh, and with the Misura and the Southern country.
And in this regard, the tribes play in the southern Libya, and they are willing to cooperate with Russia.
Is that what the Southern people want to preset the migration flows on further attacks?
Does that mean, the bus returned, where Nigerian migrants come from?
We're trying to do this.
But it's not simple.
Some clans and groups are interested in continued walking.
We hope that we can join the South in the negotiation process between Saraja, Haphtar and the southern tribes.
But for the beginning, we would like to see the only view on this question between Haphtar and Saraje.
The head of the Government in Tripoli Fais Saraji is considered a Islamic, a stakeholder for the country of shariat standards.
How radical is he holding?
Is that not an obstacle to Russia or West?
I will express my own view of it.
In my view, he opposed the radical Islam.
But the Islamics are in his coalition.
Yes, but it is the position that Libya must be a absolute normal country - a deadly Islamic, open peace.
He is also actively fighting terrorists.
Where does he have such a reputation?
It has been established by countries that are not interested in Russia's communication with the Tripolis.
Tripoli is a capital, and there is a legislative, executive and judiciary authority.
There is national oil corporation, national bank and other public structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in not being used there.
And we've got all the cards to them and we've been actively communicated with Tripoli and Tobrook.
The fruits of this work were already undertaken: Rosnife has concluded the Cooperation Agreement with the Libyan State oil company - NOC.
The Director of NUC Mustafa Sanal, whose head of Ronsity Ygor Sechin had a deal, was directly from the Tripolis.
And two weeks ago, the first download of the ice oil of the Rosnelft company.
What would Russia do with her?
I think it's gonna be transferred.
What other economic interests in Libya are Russia?
Reimbursement of contracts held in Muammar Caddafi.
This is, in particular, the previous contracts in the transport area (construction of iron roads), energy (electricity) and several other.
What about the livers?
Well, they've got oil.
Does that mean, as in the case of Iran, it's about the "scale of services" scheme?
I don't know what schedule will be, so I'm not working on these matters.
Indeed, Russia's economy in Libya is not main.
We are, in fact, in peace-making work.
For us the main thing is to stop bloodproliferation, help liquids to agree with themselves so that they have been able to set up the order and Libya has stopped being a favorable environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task to help the Libyan people and to issue terrorists from there.
Do you have data on the presence in Libya (actually or before) of Russia or other former SPDs?
One of our contact groups was the explanation of this.
I met the representative of the Libyan security committee, who said that there was no leave from Russia and other former SSSC countries there.
He said he had some 500,000 telephone talks from the representatives of Islamic and Radial Groups (in Libya) and the Russian speaking there is no sound.
What states are those fighters?
I wouldn't like to get into these details.
Then we'll make a question otherwise.
How many of the Islamic fighters in Libya's most lyrics?
Libyans are not most than 5 per cent of them.
The last ones are friends.
Can Moscow conduct internal negotiations on the example of Paris?
There are such plans.
We conducted active negotiations with the licenses, some delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow and said that they were willing to come to Moscow or Grosk.
When can such negotiations be taken?
Now it's hard to say.
There should be a number of visits, and I hope there is a clearness about the time and the location of negotiations.

Condemnation by Michel Carter for the message of Conrad Roy's suicide
The Deputy of the Massachusetts sent two and a half years in charge that it had encouraged the self-assault of Conrad Roy by text communications and telephone calls.
Michelle Carter, who is now 20 years, will be delayed for 15 months for a decision and five years of testing.
Carter was acknowledged in June by the unforeseen murder of Conrad Roy, which ended with him on 13 July 2014.
Father Roy said to hearing on Friday, "My family was killed by a pain.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to stay free before appeal.
She threatened the maximum period for 20 years, but her lawyers said that she was, and Roy suffered psychological disorders.
Carter, covered in the red brown and a sweet blue, listened to the condemnation standing, slept his hands and swallowed his eyes.
"He killed Conrad Roy with his actions," said the judge.
"He stopped his life to improve her.
She didn't recognize the responsibility," she said.
"He didn't demonstrate repentance."
But a lawyer Carter said that it was "tragic case that she was very sorry."
However, judge Lawrence Monys said that it was not a significant impact on her actions.
The accused read the statement of the mother Roy Lin Roy, in which he said, "I wouldn't pass any day when I would have lost my loved son's loss.
I want him to be proud of me and how I run - I'm trying to support his sister, despite all the pain that remains with us forever," says it.
The sister Roy Camdin Roy said that she was urged to overcome the thought that she could never be present at his marriage or to become his children's teeth.
"Let the man who was with me always since my birth is the pain that will remain with me until the end of my life," she said.
This case seems to be a legal precedent, since Massachusetts does not have a law which would be responsible for the Council for self-assaulting.
In 2014, when Roy found the dead symptoms of coal gas in the car, Carter was 17 years old.
This happened to the whole country when it was known that he was subjected to the self-assault of Carter's message.
"That can be smelling, smelling, smelling your feet, I don't know a lot of ways," she wrote in a few messages sent for two weeks before his death, when he slowed up with his family.
In a few minutes before the suicide she wrote, "You must do this, Conrad" and "You have to enter the shock, and you'll be free and happi."
The judge Monys said that Carter wanted to get attention by Roy's death, and forbidd her to contact with the press not to give her the desire.
The opinions of lawyers on this matter were separated.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Nox, who was sentenced in 2007 for murder in Italy, his British neighbourhood and sentenced two years later.
Nox, a 30-year-old year, published his special view in "Los-Angeles Times" which stated: "Ms. Carter is worth symptoms and assistance, not prisons".
The eagle Godchev said, "I left Langford as a bird of high flight."
One of the best Bactebolists of the Uniform VTB was 33-year-old Kit Langford left UNICS.
The United States Protector's entry proposed President of the United States of Godchev.
China took this decision on the family circumstances, said the Eugene Godchev.
He has a little child, a wife who didn't want to move to Kazan.
Kit wants to be closer to the house.
I decided to go to him.
Of course, I could say "no" and extend his contract, but he had another relationship.
He played in UNICSE three seasons and showed a high level of 100 per cent in each mask.
So I left him as a bird of high flight.
We thanked him.
We live in the family life and the carriage.
Kit Langford had played in the Tahan club three years, purchasing the Great One League 2.115/16.
In the period-2016/17, he received the reward of the own resulting player of the Eurolygie season.
He took 21.75 views in the middle of the shop.

‘Audi’ is to modify to 850 000 distance cars
On the day before the Audio Declaration, BMW stated that it would propose to update the program assurance of more than 3500,000 cars.
The President of BMW stated that the company was a more intellectual way than the precise limitation, including the European cities, including the Munchen, where BMW is, which considered the possibility of prohibiting or restricting the use of environmental cars.
The Dymler said on Thursday that there are three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their dioxide flow.
No company called his step to call.
European car producers actively moved the use of environmental cars in Europe and the United States to facilitate the compliance with the carbon gas emission rules.
But the oxygen of the ace that elects the dioxide engines is considered cancer and can be called asthma.
The level of the installation of equipment which is neutralized by aircraft gas is also increased, and the support of competitive prices is difficult.
While German car producers were at the attention, the Government of the Office of Angela Mercelle also accused that it touched the influenced car producers and ignored the signs of the problem.
The company is trying to not repeat the "Folxvagen" errors that cover the use of such "function devices" which could be used during the testing of the number of selected harmful gases in order to comply with the rules and, in terms of ordinary injury, disabled.
In the United States, a sentence was sentenced to a number of Folxvagen leaders, the rest of which are in effect on both Atlantics.
Last month, Germany arrested the former Chief of the Termodynamic Division in the Audio Motor Development Group.
The former manager, Zakeo Jovannie Pamio, is not protected from extradition and may be before the court in the United States.
Last year, “Audi” was under German criminal investigation with the Folxwagen's participation after the authorities accused of ‘Audi’ in the installation of the European Emission Rules and extended the investigation that was previously concentrated in the United States.
The inclusion of the Audios in the investigation may create serious problems of Folxvagen: the producer of elite cars is an unproportionally large part of the income of the Folxvagen.
Coffee visitors had been paid by false money in Asia
The police reported the officer of the Bank ' s discovery office on the transfer of money from the company ' s suspect purchase of 50,000 rubbers.

The Regional Office of the IMD calls for the people of the Asian region to be aware of financial operations; trade instruments workers are recommended to establish machines to check the reliability of the money received.
Astronauts found a "away" planet that could be shocked even iron.
The first study of the structural properties of WASP-121b, the astronomies were slightly surprised by the temperature that could be able to eliminate iron and other metals.
The specialists pointed out that water molecules were so decreased by the light of the stars that delete inflation.
The "Habbl" telescope has printed the water molecule on this gas gas, and this high temperature makes the water in the atmosphere of the planet lighting in inflation diameter.
The WASP-121b refers to the so-called "great pitterns" of gas guiganta, the size and mass compared to the largest planet of the Solar system, but is ten times close to the parent star.
Since that year, only 1,3 "term" day is long, and its gas tank is nearly 2 500 degrees.
Climate change threatens the lavanda in Provance.
It became a symbol of Provans and South France, but now it is threatening the climate change.
Lavanda was worse to grow because of the shocking weather and the transmission of insected diseases; this resulted in the continuous suffering of scientists and farmers who are trying to find decisions.
Eric Shes, an expert of the Agricultural Institute of CRIEPRAM Agricultural Research, says: "The Lavanda in Provance is really threatened, because in the past few years the growth has affected climate change: early and especially sugar has become too less.
This affects the duration of the lavanda life.
And there are still small cyclings that smell insected insecting micro-bacteria; they are very sweet weatherly."
There's a lot on the map.
Lavanda is not only attractive for dissidents, but the lavanda oil is very covered in parfummy and space.
Eric Shes says: "Instead of very long balls with large numbers of colours, we have small, weakened, weakened or missing.
So we have less parts that contain epileptic oil."
The decisions that are now considered include the improvement of water distribution and the slow speed, and the switch of the vegetables of the protected grass and water and the swimming exhibition that are more sustainable to the sugar.

The murder of a journalist stressed that Mexico has become more dangerous.
The weekly newspaper workers generally meet the media to discuss the recent violence crimes in the Sinala State related to organized crimes corrupted by officials or an unfinished war of drugs.
But today they met to talk about the security of their own tragedy.
They said they had to change their affairs.
Two older journalists discussed that they seemed to be more safe: the brothers of their children in the office in which they had already left granate or left their homes in 2009.
Security experts were written on the floor in the room, three words: enemies, neutral people, unions.
They requested journalists to call names for each column - evidence is not needed, suspicious and internal accommodations will be sufficient.
These are drug traffickers, policies, businessmen, journalists suspected that they are in the government or cards, the whole list of firms in which the haosing work is dangerous in Mexico.
Violence is not transferred, and among the bodys that are multiplied in the country, more journalists: on the data of the Protection Committee of Journalists, not less than 25 since President Enrico Peen Nieto took its position in December 2012; 589 persons after attacks and threats are under federal protection; and at least seven individuals have been killed in seven states in this year.
Among their last publications and inspiration, Havier Waldes Cardenas's Collector.
“A great mistake is living in Mexico and being journalist,” wrote Waldes in one of his many books on drug violence crimes.
His absence is very delicate, although his presence is totally a large photo of the Valdez, showing a medium-term, with the description of the "Reality" building; two reporters for 30 years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, have a football on which his legs, his faces in the eyes of the firm pants.
The seminar is less than two months after his death; the journalists discuss their overall trauma, their cosmetics, their unsomed and paranoia.
While in 2010 a special federal prosecutor was organized to investigate journalist affairs, only two cases were investigated by the Journalist Protection Committee.
As in most cases of thousands of murders related to drugs and organized crimes, journalists are rarly present before the court.
The Riodox journalists claim that they will write on violence in Singapore, although they are killed by a devastation, although it is now more dangerous.
Without information on murders, without the justice of security talks at meetings, Ibarra says.
"It's very stupid to lose time at this seminar," he says.
"When we don't know why, we're suspecting everyone."
On May 15th, Waldes went from the Riodos office in the capital of Cuban.
He was able to walk only a couple of quartals before his red Toyot King stopped two men; he was shooted out of the car and shooted in him 12 times probably because of the name of the newspaper, which means "Twelking River".
He went to his car and slaughtered her closer.
Waldes was 50 years old.
He remained a wife and two adult children.
The servants normally disappear to Kuliakan.
But Waldes' prayers are almost all.
Since Guzman was arrested and issued in the United States in January last year, Singala became one of the most bloody fighting fields in the country, since the conflicting fractions are fighting for the fulfilment of a vacuum.
We will not say that every day on the Sinala streets kill one or a few people, or that the shooting is fully shocked by two stages of drugs that are more than the house of many living people.
Let's forget that the state of shocking is just when one of the carriages takes control of the premature state with important ports and drug ways leading to the United States.
Despite this, the Valdes was well known about the dangers of his work, Ishmael Bochorks, the 60-year-old partner and the Director of Riodos, was dismissed by the sense of guilt because he did not want to protect a friend.
He thinks that the murder helped two mistakes.
First, it was published in February with Damaso Lopez, a leader of the confronting fractions of the card that fights with the sons of Guzman.
Publication could be disappointed by the sons; people who preferably were band members have purchased all the publications as they were given to the kitchen.
The second error was that he did not put Valdes for his own security to leave the country after a other newspaper written on the same story.
Waldes was legended in Mexico and outside the border, and his murder was estimated as a natural century in developing violence against journalists in Mexico.
He was so long away from the danger, his friends and colleagues thought he would always be.
He was an experienced reporter in Norwegia, and in 2003, with the five colleagues of Riodoos, sold his 50-dual-paid shares.
In Singapore, “It was impossible to work a journalist without having a drug topic”, said Bocorkise.
Since the newspaper, the reputation of courageous and honest publications, sales and advertising revenues grew.
The journalists liked that they were able to publish sweet reports without fear of census, but the readers pleaded that they could read that nobody more had not been able to write.
Eight years after the Ríodos founded, Maria Murs Cabo received a prestigious prize for the reporting work in Latin America.
In the same year, Waldes wins the International Press Freedom for the courage of drug investigation in Mexico, wherever it was.
He clearly acknowledged that he was scared.
"I want to live further," he said with the CPJ premium.
The drug trafficking in Singapore is "This is the shape of life", said in October last year at the TV interview.
"You have to take the tasks that are false on you like a journalist, or you just have a dumb."
I don't want to ask me, "What did you do when you were so dead around... why didn't you say what's going on?"
Riodose workers miss the Valdes, a shooter who was shooted as a loader in the port, the other, a generous, and the advice, a teacher who knew how to get in the lives.
They trusted in their order.
He should always take his shooting.
He had to go to El Guyabo, bar against the office, and always sit there for the same table.
Now they ask, did he lost love for one another?
His death also made them aware of the way he was better to do and remain in the lives.
"They don't like you to find out in their women, children, their legal business and underpower aircrafts for transport of drugs.
"These things were fake," said Boholics.
The results, even in the best times, were high levels of self-employment and self-reservation.
I need to believe instincts.
Stay away from what's wrong.
The problem is, it says, "Riodose" editor Andrés Villiareal, that "the fear can lie... and then happens what happened to Havier."
Old rules, said he and others, are not more operating in Sinala, such as in Tamauripas, Veracrus, Guerrero and other states, where there is a deterioration of profitable contractual ways, weak state institutions and corrupted officials.
Lanshaft's always changed.
In the room where Ryodos was gathered for security training, hundreds of phones were then banned, and a few days before it was known that the spy programs sold only to governments were used in Mexico for journalists and public activists.
Out of the two police officers are hidden in the dark of the tree of a 104 degrees (Celsian 40 degrees).
They gave the Government's mandate to protect the Riodoos Office, situated in the four-year building in the Kuliakhan Quarter quarter.
Some journalists asked whether the police were not included in the 50 per cent of the orders that the Governor had said that he could not trust them.
A few months ago, journalists have been sent to a mountain location, which is de facto under the band of drug traffickers.
In the closest number, Riodos was estimated to three main themes.
It's a murder in Sinala, a former champion on the boss of Hulio Sezar Chavez.
They also had the payment of government costs focused on the gouvernant city.
And there was a group of people in one of the most beautiful restaurants of Kulikaan, in the Quartet of the Prosecutor's office.
It was officially not declared who had been disfellowshipped or what happened, so it had to be careful when it was time to write that all in the city knew that it was the favorite restaurant of drugs and authorities at the same time.
One of their journalists learned from the open databases that the restaurant was registered on behalf of the policy belonging to the Governing Institution and Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated at all levels during almost the last century.
Recently, a number of gouvernants from PRI have been expelled with a large defence in corruption.
Wildreal requested journalists to write on previous incidents in the restaurant, including when El Chapo, the son, Guzman, was gone out of the area of militarys.
A few months ago, readers would search for the Valdes column with the most reliable information.
"We would have known what happened," says the 46-year-old Villareal, for his artistic body named El Flaco.
"All channels of our sources are disrupted every year."
The Wallace Office is now used as a packaging and anti-protegic murder of journalists, since staff became the one whom they had never thought to be: actors who speaked on the press name.
The journalist of Miriam Ramirez took several pledges and sent the following morning to demonstration in a local prosecutor dedicated to another journalist.
Salvador Adam's disappearance in the Michoacan state, west of the country, three days after the murder of Valdez.
The body was found, and the authorities said it was, on the basis of DNA tests.
In the whole country, journalists have been expressed so much, organizing protesters and writeing "SOS Press" on the treasures and walls of houses.
In that day, Director of Bocoraks was in Washington, trying to support internationally in the matter of Valdes.
The next day after the murder of Valdez Ramirez accused the authority that they were shocked by journalists and claimed to kill them because they say the truth.
After that, she requested not to give her more tasks for the publication of the Government, fearing that the angry harmes its objectiveness.
Valdez said many times that journalists in Mexico are "circle" organized by crime, its participants to the government and the impartial society.
He wrote in his last book that reporters do not only kill drug traffickers, but they do this on orders of policy and security in the conspiracy with organized crime.
The Committee on Protection of Press Artic 19 believes that half of the attacks against journalists last year were made on the order of police and government officials.
"In Mexico you're dead because they want to close you", says Ramirez.
Of course, the murder is threatening people.
All remembered that Maria Elizabeth Massai six years ago in the northern border state of Tamauripas, blogger.
On her body, there was a note written by the card of Zeta: "I'm here because of my articles."
The computer keyboard and the shields were close to her cut head.
Some publications prefer to be closed as the El Nord newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of her representative of Miroslav Brich in March.
Others remain as El Manjana from Novo Laredo after the murder of her leader in 2004.
In 2010, The Diario de Sudad Huas publicly called to drug cards using a draft article on the first page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists abandoned their own states or their country.
This is a painful decision.
In the escape, it is difficult to find work, and it continues to be threatened on the streets.
And sometimes they killed them as apparently with a photo of Ruben Espanzo, who was killed in 2015 with four women in the apartment in Mexico three months after flying from Veracrus.
Those who remain and continue to work are balanced daily between risked decisions.
Ibarra, who ever dreamed to be a poet, admits that he was afraid to write about drug trafficking.
"Mexico's got to smell, and that's why I became a journalist," he says.
On Thursday, when the last exhibition was ready to print, the Riodoos publishers sit on the treasure next to the office and drinked a drink when their phones were soon called.
A series of shocks between the fighting bands and the security forces near the smoke city of Massatlan left, as confirmed, 19 bodies.
The war continued to discourage, as was promised in a series of letters from the carrières found in the area.
Sit on the throat, they posted news on the Riodose web site via mobile phones.
The next day, the first page was to be shared.
The snakes have increased, and another shock in the neighborhood.
Boholics had considered whether they were ready to defend their police.
If they were scared, they haven't shown it.
Situation under the great portrait of their dead founder, whose median palm was sent to the surrounding of the whole Sinala, and the Riodos workers continued his case.
"What can you think about shutting," said Boholics, "if the day when Havier was killed, the practitioner asked me to send her to the street to make a report?"
Dinosaur was used to avoid the enemy
First, he seems to be statistics, although it is a fear.
Researchers told that the first remains of the incredibly incredible body with the shock found by the Canadian shooter remained so well that the experts were called "My Liza among the dinosaurers".
It was so well that they were even able to determine that the color of his cheese hair was redundant and said that he had, in some kind of "this past".
In the report published in the Modern Biology magazine, it was described as “the one of the best dinosaurs in the world's history and one of the best dynamists of the world”.
This is covered by a recent Nodosawru post that lives in the middle of the low period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly good condition has resulted in researchers who are called “effectively wonderful”.
This magician tireofor is the most well-conserved species in the whole history of income, according to the articles in National Geographic magazine.
He was found by Shon Fanko when he was working on the Millennium Company near the Fort McMurry northern Albert, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
He stressed something that seemed to be different from the environment, and decided to look more careful.
The discovery was sent to the Kingdom Paleonological Museum of Tirrel.
The following six years has been working for the discovery of the animal inside the earthquake in 2500 feet (100 kg).
Now, when all this hard work has been done, the final results can be demonstrated.
“It's only a lot of comfort, and it can be practically believed that he is sleeping,” said the leading author Caleb Brown, who is a scientist of the Palestinian Museum of the Kingdom, where the creation is demonstrated.
"He enters the history of science as one of the most beautiful and well-conserved dictators of the dinosaur – Mona Liz among the dinosaurs."
During his study of his skin, researchers found that it was a heavy skin, despite the distortion of the pancil and remembered the skin tank, in all the visibility, was a significant danger from the meat dinosaurs.
This powerful panzer dinosaur used a red and white camble to hide from the shooter and used a protective technician known as a protective squirrel, which also uses many animals today.
This would allow him to communicate with the environment and avoid meetings with enemy, said experts, predicting that there were more dinosaurs on him.
This exists in the age of 110 million years of age with regard to the family of Nodosaw in May, and is now on exposition to the Kingdom Palestinian Museum.
Scientists have already studied animals and gave him a name of Borealopelta Markmitchelli on the honour of the museum lab, Mark Mitchell, one of the members of the group, which has been held over 7000 hours for his crostóle squad.
The surprising conservation of the extraterrestree allowed Dr. Mitchell and the international scientists to document the painting and shape of cheese and pancil platin on its tv.
They have found a protective shield distributed by the protection method in the kingdom of animals, which means that the top of the existing was darkly below.
Although the protective clash has been well distributed, the opening was unexpected, because the size of the Borealopelta dinosaur is significantly higher than the present living animals with the protection of the ocult.
It could be suggested that the dinosaurs had so actively seized the fleshly dinosaurs that the evolution prefered confusion mass as a way of survival.
However, most modern animals with protective oceans, for example, ovins, blows, or blowns, are significantly smaller and are more accessible, that shows that the nodosawur has been severely fighting for survival.
“The severe threat from the massacres for a powerful, shocked panciller of the dinosaur shows how dangerous were the dinosaurs of the Melo period,” reported Brown.
Chemical analysis of organic connections in the cheese dinosaur also indicates that his hair should be redinated and corrupt.
Scientists continue to study animals, searching for information on his life, including the content of his survival trace, to find out what he eat during his last trap.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, he falls into the river and was taken into the sea where he was cut down and slow down the lion on the bottom of the ocean.
At that time, Albert was so warm as now on the south of Florida, and the rivers and the oceans, likely, were much more widely spread to the depth than now.
“ The nodossaurer is really observed that the fully maintained skin was fully, and at the same time it was fully maintained in three measurements, keeping a typical form of animal, ” said Brown.
“The animal now appears almost as it appeared at the time in the Lannn low period.
Don't need to be particularly inclined to imagine to restore it, it's only to be slow and you can actually believe that he's sleeping."
The low period is the time when guiant terrorists, the meat dinosaurs that standed on two feet, were burned on the earth.
Although the most amazing one of them, the Tirannozawr rex, lived over millions of years later than Borealopelta, some of the tireophora could be shocked.
They include actors, a 38 feet (11,5 m) weight in six tonnes.
Scientists whose last openings are published in the New World Biology magazine, believe that Borealopelta has been brought to the sea and has been mutatised in it.
The property was found by Shon Fanko when the Millennium shock was close to Fort McMurry, northern Albert, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
According to the museum staff, it is the most well-conserved tireofor worldwide, together with skin and pancil, and it was targeted from the sea to the poor skin.
In the meantime, they reached about 18 feet (5 m) long and weighted up to 3000 feet (1300 kg).
Their characteristic meeting was twenty-twenty-five shirts, speaking from the shoe.
Researchers believe that this magician tireofor has been hardly understood by the fact that it is now Canadian until the river was cut it into the open sea.
However, the subconduct detection of the dinosaur maintained his panciller with precise precision to the smallest details.
The random remains of this specific expansion were so well that the skin remains still covering bugry pancil plates around the head of the dinosaur.
As Michael Greece wrote in a article for the National Geographic magazine, it is a stage of maintenance as you win in the lottery.
As far as I look at him, he seems more sensitive.
The skin skin remains still covering bugry panicians that smell the heads of the animal.
His right front feet is cut around the side, five fingers on it are turned up.
I can compare the shoes on his shoes."
Mihail Sakashvili could return to Poland without documents
Mikhail Sakashili, formerly launched in Georgia, and then the Odess area in Ukraine, arrived in Poland.
He did so, not with documents that confirm his personality and citizenship.
Saakashvili reports the Polish Televizja Republic's publication, which has posted on its YouTube channel with his statement.
Saakashvili held the 1944 anniversary of the Varshaw Resurrection against the Hitlerian troops.
Since the politicians did not know Poland, even though he tried to start speaking in this language, he had to speak to English through the Poland translator.
During his speech, the policy has focused on Georgia's cooperation with Poland and spoke about Ukraine.
The Ukrainian Migration Service has lost its citizenship, the public policy has learned that it was in the United States.
How could he be able to make a transatlantic ship without documents until it was unknown.
Previously, the former Governor of the Mihail Saakashvili stated that his signing to the Anket was undertaken to obtain the citizenship of Ukraine.
Politics stressed that he didn't fill any ankets.
The duration of the events in the case of Vinzhier and Olhavka extended to January
The duration of the preliminary impact on the ownership of the Ronova Group of the Employees and the heads of the T Plus, Bobis Weinzicher, has extended to 2 January 2018.
On Thursday, 3 August, the Court of Basman considers the extendion of the charged house arrest.
The representative of the CK at the meeting reported that the last time it was to extend the period of the preliminary consequences.
The investigator stated: "The extreme complexity and long-term impact of the need to be taken and perform a large number of documents, as well as the implementation of investigations on the territory of a number of RF actors," said the investigator.
He added that the suspected had regularly given the Commission ' s guidelines.
They are estimated in at least a billion rubbers.
According to the results, Vinzhier, Oilhavski, and the former SO, Commplix Energy Systems, Mikhail Slobodin, who resigned to the Employment Corporation until 5 September, provided the High Officers of the Republic of the Commission for the establishment of maximum benefit rates for warm and electricity, and for the establishment of favorable conditions for business.

How did one aktivist learn the answer to the question “What is the street?”
On August 9, 2014, Britain Ferrell was shocked to the depth of the soul.
Only a day after the arriving to New York in a tourist journey, St. Luis sit to bed through Airbnb, phone-screen flight.
She touched someone from the middle of the school.
There was said: “The police just killed a 15-year-old child, and he still stands through the street.”
He pointed out that no more of her fellowships had discarded this information, closed the fax and opened the Twitter.
There were a lot of users in her legend with any @TheePharoah.
Repertoire from St. Luyus in real time in Twitter, Michael Brown, a preserved black-weight-year-old teenager murdered by the police officer in Ferguson, the Missouri State.
He published a photo of the unrealed Braun's body, distributed between the street, where it will be four hours.
“ It's a sweetness, ” Ferrell thought.
But death wasn't something new for her and her circle.
She took a phone, and later night he returned to Twitters that people were gathering in Canfield.
There were pictures of the signal and the crying people and men who claimed that he was the father of Brown, who cryed to say, “The police from Ferguson just killed my unarmed son!”
She looked at the direct transmission of the police officer in front of a group of protesters with a lacquering dog.
Another video of a policeman, she told her, shooted a smoke and shooted, "I'm gonna kill you all... animals."
“ This is an unexpected situation”, said Ferrell in his own memory.
“ This isn't a murder like we're attracted and typical.
At that time, I felt a sense of awareness.
I was angry and crying."
She took a ticket on a ray and flyed home on the next day.
When she landed on the 11th night, she took her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided both of them to Ferguson on the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years, was a new documentary film “What is the street?” that will go to the screen on August 11.
This is the statement of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and sustainability from the face of people living in the community and in the full streets that require answers.
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter, covered in a ball and a ball in a color, they recalled the conversation that took up to this morning a few times, “to experience of black and their conditions”.
She remembered: “Remember, how did I tell you how black people had to fight for what they believed?
We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed a 18-year-old boy, and that's wrong."
“ I couldn’t take her, ” said Ferrell later.
“What is happening today is a culmination of... that happened previously.
She must know about it, see it and learn about it.
It should not only be a good idea in activeism and organization, but also understand the various levels of experience of black and their situations and what we need to do to be free to be free.
Even if I can ensure her environment in which she does not share with the obvious racism, she is nothing different from any other black girl.
I feel that she would have been a bad service if she would be rewarded from that."
When they arrived in Ferguson, they first stopped at Saoth-Florisant Rood, on a board that was located through the road from the police officer, which was a kind of Palestinian camp while the activists were waiting for reports of the uncertainty of the officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and her daughter were joined to a local company that prepared the packaging.
They gathered the packages and helped the protesters.
Inconsciousness, Ferrell stripped a new type of activism.
“ My activism has been completely changed after August 9,” she noted that as a student of the University of Missouri-Center-Luis, she was President of the Sanitary Association of Students, National Minorities, and had been a food justice and unemployment among the black communities.
“ I didn’t have an organizational experience.
"This has come to himself."
After a few weeks of the evening, Ferrell met Sabaa Folaian, one of his guests.
Folarian said that she and her principal operator Lucas Alvarado-Farerer were “the only desire to document” events.
Ferrell asked: "Do you want to document or try to find a story to play?"
This skepticism has been a lot of people, often white, who came to the community in order to benefit from his pain and sustainability.
As explained in the recent Interview of Folaian, “We heard that the voice of people who were born and grown in Ferguson did not get into the center of attention, and they want to do this otherwise”.
Forian has already joined his co-chairman David Davis, a local artist known by his activeism on the matters convicted to death penalty.
His participation was a sympathetic to the Ferrell project and the six local people with whom the project “What is the street?” supported the connection during the years after the murder of Brian.
“In this documental film no one speaks for us or with us, that's what we say,” said David.
“This was the most important for me, as these people will be presented, because it is how I will submit myself.”
And although the project was aimed not to focus on the experience of Ferrell – to show that the movement is not “the leaders of the Safety, but how the community is together”, as Florian said, it was the most open part of the film.
As a result of the “What is the street?”, the personal aspects of the life of Ferrell, for example, how she loved and married her wife.
“ I feeled awesome, ” said Ferrell, smilingly telling me how I had first seen the ready product.
"But I understood that when you do such work and manage the blacks, some level of vulnerability must be. "
Moreover, the history of Ferrell again discusses and emphasizes the role of the black homosexual woman in the broader context of the movement of “The Life of Blacks has an importance”.
Two of the third movement founders are those who created #BlackLivesMatter in social networks after the murder of the black adolescent Trevo Martin in 2012 are counting to homosexuals.
“Areasoned homosexual women in the leadership positions support all this movement,” says Ferrell. - And all because we are struggling on several fronts.
The black homosexual women must take all this burden."
The Florian agreed with that appeal, noting that the movement was in fact supported by black women and many homosexual black women.
However, it insists that “is not a positive discrimination” and that Ferrell has not been elected to a central film because of its different features.
“It was the man who had experienced this energy,” she said.
“ On the other hand, it's not the coincidence that she was on the first plan, because when. ”
You can feel her energy through the screen."
Thus, in Ferguson, there is no film channel for a long time, but there have remained complicated racial relations between the community and the police.
Ferrell will be tested for the shift during the demonstration.
It describes the social and political atmosphere called the house, just "Bardak".
She still holds for the thing he learned when he went out on the Ferguson Street three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
We are nothing to lose, except our tents."
Two Salvador footballists dismissed for the course of the U.S. players

Decorations: Artist creates portraits using DNAC Chelsey Manning
In the centre of the Garerrey Fridman in New York, people are white, black and red, all of which is not similar to each other.
These 30 portraits have been created by the artist of Hizer Duy-harborg from the shoes and shoes sent to her Chulsey Manning.
Manning sent a recruit from Fort Levenworth prison where the former analysis of the information is 35-year-old for the famous transfer of confidential diplomatic telegraphs on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition of 2 August is called "Origination".
The result of the two-year record between Duy-Harbourg, which combines the art of technology, information and art, and Manning, the woman-transsual and a famous dissident, which Barrak Obama has condemned a sentence over three days before the end of its presidency.
He analyzed the DNA program from Manning and used it to create three-dimensional ports of persons that could be in such a gene, Duy-Harborg made a deep, even though it was not difficult to improve the manifth that was not only the Plastic Plastics of DNA - the different ways of interpretation and intellectual deterioration of these interpretations, but also the understanding of identity.
Manning, who was born with the name Bradley Edward, but with a adolescent age, has openly stated that she was considered a woman, 20 episodes was condemned in 2013, including six Spionage violations, computer angry and violence.
Her photos were not available in the prison, so only one of her photos was known: a black and white village where Manling in the platinum distance of the parking, apparently feeling smooth, sits on the roll of the car; with its photo and began to associate.
In 2015, Duy-Harbourg has completed its 2012 project "Visions of Non-Chairpersons".
The artist created the portraits of unknown persons with the judicial instruments of the type of oaks and a wedding resort, giving from this DNA museum and establishing images of how these people could look.
And then she received an e-mail from Magazine.
"They took interview at Chelsey Manning in prison and wanted some portrait to illustrate the article," explained Duy-Hagberg at the premature showing a new exhibition for the press.
At that time, Chelsea could not be visited and photod, so they were connected to her and asked whether she wanted to get a portrait created from the DNA.
Indeed, the artist and her sit in the museum became friends of spectrum and exchanged a few letters over two years.
They even wrote a book of the Mixed Images, pronounced by Schoili Canngo, which illustrated how Chase's punishment would be made in the future and can be visited by a personal exhibition.
The fact that Obama really decided to release Manning only a few days after the release of the book to the light was welcomed after seven difficult years in the military prison in Kansas.
There is something deep and strong and that the exhibition is now open when Donald Traamp announces the war of people who discover secret information in the Government and finds new ways to smile in Twitter.
When Duy-Harbourg asked about the convergence all over time, she said "is nothing happening."
In the statement of the artist, written on the wall of the gallery, the major sign of Manning down (and instead of the "i" in her home) calls for the end of the "automatic separation on the basis of gender, race, sexual orientation and culture".
At the opposite side, it is its mitocondrial DNA, a long runner of the C, G and A.
Included 200 letters (or nucleotics, as a learning artist is expressed, Duy-Harborg hoped to show how we all look wonderfully, in any case in our biological structure.
"I hope to explain people that our genius does not define what we are open genetic data for interpretation and how subjective it is," said Dai-Harborg; its 2007 video's "Light Reminders" was also published here.
"Date data can tell us a lot of different historys, and 30 of these stories here."
The last part of the exposition in one room is the roman mentioned above in comics.
Maning appears in King-Cong style on the building of the United States Correction Catherine with a speaker in his hand.
"If they kill your speech, they will win", it was written there.
"Don't shut up."
"This is a direct quote from the letter she wrote me," says a artist who welcomes us from Philadelphia.
"I've still got a skin skin when I'm talking about it."
Manning has not yet seen a personal exhibition - as it was visually pictured in comics - but when she comes, she will welcome the mask in the room centre, its own genus symbols collected, like the balls of the protesters.
It was also intended to do all of the exhibition (5"2, Manning growth) in which the career had been recorded genetic gangs.
"After I would smile them on the walls, but now I wanted them to look like a sweet people," says Due-Harborg about portraits.
"I wanted them to be like a massive move that was formed around Chelsea, as a movement standing up and for her freedom."
Professor of Northwest University and Oxford University are looking for the police for murder
According to the police, the national area is to professor the Northwest University and the official of the Oxford University, who discovered as suspected as a result of the fact that in Chicago's grown number, a smooth mortality was found.
According to the Protocols of the Court of Justice of Cook, the Monday orders were detented for the predicted murder without the right to release under the seat of the 40-year-old Vinham Latham and the fifty-year-old Andrew Warren ' s involvement to the death of Trenton G. James Cornell-Durranlo.
According to the documents, the 20-year-old colonel Duanlo died after it had been brought a multitude of harvests.
In the warning issued by the police office of Chicago, the body was found on 27 July.
The police called, they came to the Grant Plataz apartments, and found a victim with a number of TV wounds.

The Prime Minister has commented on the second part of the IADA road map to restore the status of the Code, which lists the conditions for renewing the work of RUSAD and has been recently published on the website of the organization.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could be difficult for Russia.
"It's been declared, it's gonna be done.

However, one of the requirements included in the list underscored that Russian Indian structures should be publicly recognized by the results of the UADU investigation of the Canadian jurisprudence Richard McLaren, which stated that the continuation in Russian sport was controlled by the State.
In response to this question, Mutko said, "We're conducting a investigation because our anti-powering system has allowed the badness.
All measures were adopted.
But no programme was, and we will not recognize what wasn't.
Vitalia Symrino, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Departure Commission, has repeated the words of Vitalia Syrnou.
On the same morning, in the Russian Rsport publication, Slimne acknowledged their previous problems in the Russian antidoping structures, but added: " We have often said that the report contains certain positions and provisions.
Indeed, no one will accept this report," added Symrone.
AWAA dismissed RUSAD from the continuous monitoring of the end-up in November 2015 after the end-candale.

Starmarks that help your company not to become a orthodox "World"
Aimee Errett wanted to assess the satisfaction levels among its e-commerce staff, but the surveys did not work.
The answers were often disappointed, unnecessary, or worse.
Even though she promised an anonymity, some staff did not trust this process.
“It wasn't never a subsequent and objective,” said Errett, who managed the company of 75 "Madison Reed" of the Hair Trade in San Francisco.
So she called to the third person to help.
There is now a new type of experience in the field of work with staff helping companies to find out how they feel.
Developing and licenceing the programme which is the measuring of staff responsibilities, they allow companies to make exams, call on specific teams and demographic groups, to propose an anonymity and gorge for complaints, and, in some cases, to allow information to minimize fuel and directly addressing.
"We have yet tools such as Strava and Fitbit for Health Monitoring, and where is Fitbit for your company?" says Jim Barnett, co-composer and President of the Glint from Redwood City, whose analytical programs are used by companies to measure the integrity of staff.
Errest told that it had been a greater understanding of the thinking and feeling of its staff for three years of use of Glint.
In addition to exams and ankets of the specified product teams, a warm card of the company is proposed and shows an overview form of more complaints and some low approval management managers, which allows it to figure out why.
The company acknowledges that they need to control the workplace, otherwise they will become a normal "Urbour", which was interrupted in the scandal when the former staff published a post in the blog, in which the aggressive circumstances in which those who expressed frustration were commanded.
For older people such as Glint, it is the desire to control the situation - the possibility of profitable business.
The Internetports estimates “Search on payment”, dedicated to financial technologies, the global management industry, regulation and corresponding to 2020, may be more than 118.7 billion dollars.
The Startap Convercent of Denver, the Colombia State, which helps companies to prevent and discover a bad behavior, noted the small growth of interest and activity in the Ubera's reputation in this year.
The Convercent is almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Mycrosoft and Tezla.
Recently, among the clients appeared a "worn".
Like “Glint”, “Convercent”, companies allow to send personal views, gather confidential responses in the real time mode and to train the warm cards of the problems zones.
He also provides a thrilling line for anonymous text communications that allows staff to report on a bad behavior.
And if you're shooting the shooter, the complaints are going to the directive.
“ The public view has overcome the authority of inspectors,” said Patrick Quinnlan, founder and President of the company Convercent.
If the company is cleared that it is wrong with staff or that it is ineettic, even if the inspector does not interfere, the company may be subject to the cost-effective consequences of the customers, the department of staff and the judiciary, reported in Quinlan.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant network where over 25,000 workers worked in 500 firms, used Convercent more than year to make sure that law and procedure staff workers are able to provide a simple way to go into the company’s main office.
Before, if the staff wanted to report about the problem, he or she had to search for the phone number or the main office, to give an official complaint and hope that it would be serious.
This was often a terrible and unfair experience, reported James Vitrano, head of the Ruby Tuesday, who said that it was not a normal way to follow the complaints of staff.
But now, when the company is used by the Convercent Service, the problems that have previously been hidden from the managers in other cities or states, such as discrimination, charset and unfair job payment, can be readily found and take them.
“I can draw close to a comprehensive, comprehensive understanding of the staff situation,” said Vitrano, leading to the 'Ruby Tuesday' network management group.
“We protect our shareholders from judiciary with staff.”
According to the Queenland, the company began seriously addressing the ethics, values and involvement of staff in 2002, after the Buhgalter Company Artur Andersen had suffered a cash due to ethnic violations resulting from Dale Enron.
But only when “social networks have received massive dissemination”, the company realized that they would not be able to keep their weakness from the virus distribution into the network.
“Instead of starting using ethics control technologies, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
And “Glint” and “Convercent” propose their software as a service with the company's regular payment for the use of their products.
This is the model of business and opportunities for the approval of venture investments supported both older.
In February, Convercent has been funded for $10 million from company such as “Sapphire Ventures” and “Tola Capital”, resulting in which the company’s general capital reached 47 million.
“Glint” received $10 million from ‘Bessemer Venture Partners’ in November, resulting from the general capital of $60 million.
These investments are not surprising if it is aware of the interrelated nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
A growing study shows that today staff are expected from their workplaces more than ever.
On the markets with a heavy competition, such as the Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects, it is only the minimum necessary.
The employees want to feel that they accept and appreciate, and that they dedicate their company to a positive mission.
"When people are happy to work in the company, feel that they hear and what they do, they are doing, they are more triing to make such a successful company", says Nina Macquin, Vice-President of the global money and the satisfaction of staff in the LinnkedIn company where they use the Convercent, and the Glint.
Investors receive income when businesses from their portfolio go well; businesses are good when the staff are dedicated and involved.
If the third party analytical instruments promise to increase loyalty and integration of staff, it is unseen that they have support.
As cultural specialists say in workplaces, it is important to provide data on the participation of staff.
But data are not useful until the suppliers do not take steps.
Indeed, if the company requests back-related staff, it may create the impression that changes are changed.
And if changes do not get enough, or not all, it may be distressed, and the staff lose interest.
“If you would ask for 4000 proposals, you should be ready to conduct 4000 meetings,” says Russell Rat, President of the Advisory Company Kotter International, who had to see how the company did a mistake by relying on the data collection.
“ Because if you don’t go to the end, you will think, ‘ Have you heard me the truth?
Isn't you all right?
And if you are equal, why should I not be the same?
According to Errett, the Madison Reed company that is now conducting monthly staff investigations can take steps on the same day when someone reports about the problem with Glint.
And after the reassembling of contacts from staff, unnecessary speed of decision-making and communication, it has been able to reorganize a number of teams within the company and to introduce communication training to address problems.
The Ruby Tuesday company receives new knowledge of its staff and hopes that, in a long-term perspective, these knowledge will help her to keep staff in the area known by high-equity career.
“If you don't try to create a culture of transparency, you're losing people” said Vitrano.
If you lose people, you're losing customers.
And if you lose customers, you'll lose the company.
In Barnabas, the new asfalt is on the Crusnoarmean perspective
In Barnabas, cardiac measures were taken to eliminate the cause of asfalt losses at the Crusnoarmea perspective.
The place where the shoes had been taken on a recently shocked part (displayed with the Youth Street), was decided to “closure”.
Remember, a small part of the roads near the tramway has occurred because the land is in the area of an unexploied network.

Depending on its results, necessary measures will be taken.
It is suggested that the rebuilding of uncommon communications and their betonization is needed.
This is reported on the official site of the outer capital.
The Broin's team should be done further because the National Sport Association has cancelled training two times a day
The time is near to the 11th evening; the thickness of footballists from the University of California in Los Angeles is delayed in order to deal with new training fields at one side of the camps.
Some of them cut off their footballs, finding the shoes shocked from the potato after the first pressing day of the sporting camp.
For many team players, these minutes are a break in the middle of the day.
The games registered at the summer occupation, after three-time training, they return to the communities to prepare final reviews, and the next morning they return to the Waterman football centre at 6:30.
Shortly before Monday turned to Monday, the team trainer of Bruinz Jim Mora said: “In the three next days, these men wait for the sea. ”
That the National Sport Association has denied two-folding trains on the day, which was planned to reduce the burden for players, in fact their working day – at least before the end of the reviews on Thursday.
As a result, the first three training team of the University of California was appointed at Los Angeles at 7:15 nights to be placed in and without that fleshly schedule of players.
The result of the lack of two trains a day has been more than a day with one training, and Bruins began a camp nearly a week compared to the last year and trained during the summer school in the first six seasons in the Westwide.
According to the schedule, they should take 18 trains to 20 August, incl. before starting official training for the first game in the sezon against the team of the Texas University of A and M in September.
Mara said that it supported the change of the rules by the National Sport Association, despite the fact that it had appeared another paragraph in the fleshly schedule of players.
“In three or four days, we will give them this great burden, that is a serious test,” said Mara.
“ And they just overcome him, they're working, they're wonderful men.
I think when we live up to Saturday and we'll have more time, it'll be really healthy."
When the camp is finished, the California University in Los Angeles will train closed; it is a lot of task, since its field is in a direct visibility with a relaxing park and from the neighbourhood of Laskin-Centre, a cheap hotel that has already been in the bomb of football shoes that have been protected by the doors.
Brein's games should be employed with these weekends, but Mora allows that when rooms will be free during the season, there may be a problem.
“We will be safe,” said Mara.
“ This is a serious problem, and I do not overcome the danger, predicting that someone can get out of the room, sit there and record a video training.
If you have a training video, it's very serious.
But we'll be safe there and we'll be safe at the park number 8.
We'll do everything we can do with what we have.
I'm not gonna be too worried about this.
We have a plan."
All victims of therapy in Petersburg are described from the hospital
All the victims suffered during the therapist at Sancto Petersburg metro in April are deleted from the hospital.
This was reported in the press office of Anna Miyan.
At the end of July, three people remained in the stations, transmitted the TV Centre.

Facebook increases the facts of waiting to fight factual news
Facebook will send a more deeply suspected text to an independent expert and show their arrests under the original posts, stated in the fourth of the largest social world network that is trying to fight such factual news.
In its website, the company stated that it began to use improved machine training algorithms to recognise possible artifications, send them to verification, and may be shown by the results of expectation.
Facebook was criticized as one of the main ways to disseminate such factual news, which many believed that the presidential elections in the United States were influenced by the presidential elections in 2016.
This issue is also actively discussed in Europe after French elections were made wrong before the Presidential elections in May, and in Germany, before the September elections, the support of the plan to strike social networks if they were not operatively removed withdrawals of hatred.
On Thursday, in a single German declaration, Facebook reported about the testing of the new fact-expected algorithm in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"Only to see what messages are opposed to independent checkers, people want to have a broader context to make reasonable condemnations that they are reading and shared," wrote in their Facebook blog Sarah Suu, the Leader of News Manager.
She adds that Facebook will continue to test the function of "linked articles" and work on other changes in the newsletter to address the problem of factual news.
Create a Roman-Comics: one lock in English history
In the past 40th century, Scotney was cut into a musical "Squeeze", and in the 1970s and 80s, Margaret Ttcher was inseparable.
But 700 years old from his weird place in the river of Buil, in Kent's graph, he observed the brush history around, and now inspired Jamie Rods, a copy hair and a circumcision to historical documents in Roman Comics.
"I think it's so beautiful - look at a man who died 300 years ago," he said with encouraging.
"You're feeling so personal when you keep this letter into your hand."
"The Chambre in England" covers the period from the mid-earth century to the Evardian era and tells about the families living in Scotty; each history illustrated one of the young British artists - Izek Lenkewit, Bryoney May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book of Rods based on the archives: in 2014 he wrote "Dead Man and Other History" - a Collector on the Documents of the British Library; the project was unexpectedly cut him into the depth of the soul.
"My man could cut a simple print on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent who worked on the knobs," said he.
"This is the impression of his finger."
And the letters will always shoot, because in that time, the fire was burned.
And after 300 years, in the future, you think you're there too.
Oh, I love the archives."
For a man who was covered by such an old shock, receive support from the National Fund and the English Artist Council and live in the shell of four months "Really, I have been a little sweet there" seems too good to be true.
The row's whole days studied a "new" victorian shelter, walked through the archives and considered a number of counts of names and old things, for example, the heads of the shoes or bottles that persist in the shoes.
He walked at the park and on the distance of the old castle, talked to forests, gardens, and sometimes with artists who worked over the illustrations of his book.
Then the night he said, "He sweared the whiskey and sit down to write."
Scotney's stories have not been understood because the National Fund had been fully accessed to it only in 2006 when the last heritage, Elizabeth Hassy.
When Rods came there for ten years, the officers just started to find the archive that he describes as "what the aristocratics cast out for centuries."
Thursdays, letters during the British Empire, maps showing what he had to say, "You think the land disputes are missing, says Rods, - but there are two families over this beach.
That's right, guys."
In some stories, the shell collection has been a point to broader scanning in English history: for example, in the Rabotnik, the hero is only one of the building shells to join the Krysian Revolution in 1381.
"Thes have information on the burn that happened in the castle in 1380, in the book called Kent and Saxes," says Rods.
"Creadian resurrection began in these places, and I thought that the bunt was a suitable start.
Maybe they were connected?"
Other surprises are strongly linked to the stories, for example, the "Peace of the Priest" in which the Darrell family hid himself for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or “Contrabandist” on the 19th century's contrabandist Arthur Darrel, who, as they believe, instimated his own horns, struck stones (this was discovered for a few years).
Darrela is a loved family of Rods from all those who lived in Scotty: "The men seemed to have been perfectly sweet, they used forever in debts and lost money for what they couldn't allow.
In different generations, Darrela had solved their problems with debts, marrying rich older women, - I represent them as a company of sympathy men that can be able to able to be paid for the heritage of great states."
After finishing the work in the Rods store, others are looking for a unique writer experience.
He lived two weeks in the Finnish smell, where he wrote a graphic novel about Elmániaki, a place where he was satanator at the beginning of the XX century, and then it grew again in the forest.
But Scotty remains a special place for him.
"I was worried to go," he said.
"I felt like that, shit, I have to get back to real life."
Fiftieth larger banks choose Russia.
The Conflict in the Russian Bank Association (ARB) is developed: following Sberbank, WTB, VTB-24, Alfa-Bank, Gazprombank, Russian Husk, Benbank and FCC, still seven credit organizations are going to leave this public organization.
Thus, at least 80 per cent of the market in the above of the ARB organizations will be.
However, this is not just the outcome of all banks claiming to break up with ARB, conduct negotiations with another public organization which combines credit institutions, the Association of the Regional Banks " Russia " , which is known by Anatolia, Chairman of the Financial Market Committee, acknowledged, as a result of the last session, and the most effective leader of the thinking committee and deputy for the initial preparation of the legislative projects.
The conflict was started within the ARB during the debate at the Federation Council, when the Interregional Bank Council considered new legislation projects, in particular providing a new classification of banks depending on the size of the capital.
The President of the ARB then stated that the draft legislation was adopted in favour of larger banks, which thus tried to limit the possibilities of small and medium-sized banks in the regions by encouraging their customers.
Among the other claims, he sounded and criticized in the address of the Centre, which, in the sense of Tossane, has not always responded to the requests of licences in some banks, so that, in fact, the representative of the CBI was reflected: many leaders of the overtraced banks, in particular the ARB, had entered into the guidelines of the ARB.
It seems that this exchange of interrelated views in a very sensible relationship with the main banking environment and became visible with the view that the 15 larger banks, claiming an inconvenience with the ARB policy, began to be prepared to enter the Russian Association, pointed out that “the effectiveness of the work of the ARB is at low level and the constructive dialogue within the bank community is not actually undergoing”.
The instructors will be better.
What's going on?
Let us immediately respond to the main question that occurs with a small deal or a conflict in the banking area or closer to it: there will not be any threatening for the banking system to increase the reliability of the banking system.
It means "Russia" Anatoly Axacks, known as its ability to all about the interests of banks and customers, professional high-level that is high-quality in the Centre: almost all CBI guidelines are present at annual associations activities, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator are through the expert evaluation of the "regions".
In the career-organization plan, it is apparently not possible that special triumphs have been predicted.
Indeed, the ARB is in an unfair financial and administrative situation after the remaining of such powerful and influential participants with their contributions and lobbyist opportunities.
However, in this older, in 1991, the organization of the banking community is a small capacity to continue to enhance bank legislation and the area of monetary and medium-sized treatment in general.
It is not possible to say that Russia's association with dictatorships are ready to take on any conditions of new members, judges on the reaction of its leadership, Anatolia Aksaca, which still on 21 July in the press of the parliamentary press, said that "earnestly on the next day, the representatives of the banks have asked me to consider the possibility to generate our Russian Association " .
Their proposals are to increase the vote of bankers in the Association Council and to give more attention to new banking technologies.
The negotiation process is now under review of the proposals for both parties is prepared for an external association agenda that will take place in Socie in the midst of September within the international banking forum.
There we are.
Anatolius Axaks also stressed that the possible new leadership of the updated Russian Association, Georgia Luttonski, was to leave the Vice-Chairman Center's Vice-Chairman, high-harraging his business and human quality in September.
On August 18, Anatoly Aksacks, who is now displaced in the Cloma, plans to stop the vacation and arrive in Moscow at the foreign meeting of the Russian Association Council, which is urged to consider the agenda of the " Russian intermediate entry".
Introduction of benzine engines in Russia's large cities will not be limited
The Vice-President, Nicola Assaul, stated that, instead of media communication, the incoming of a benzine engine in Russia's large cities would not be limited.
It's a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept, which must be slowly improved in environmental classs.
And there's a concept to move immediately to nucleus emissions.
I think we're not ready for this.
Question: From what year?
It's the same level at the frame lozzing level - let's just bann it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
The whole city is closed?
"20 years old - I don't know, maybe it's going to happen", brings the word of the Minister.
Previously, the Yesvey reported that at 17 August, the Vice-Premier Arcadia Dwardkouk was mandated to study the possible options of the manager of electric transport submitted by the PAO Camaz Sergeum Kugogian government.
Among the proposals, newspaper information, the use of DSS machines in large cities and cigarettes.

The demonstration of sex-roads is real, and that should be worried about us
We did not think that 2017 couldn't be worse, and a new report on technological success has been issued in the production of sex-fabrics.
Md.
Sex robots are now in the centre of attention.
The fund of responsible workers (FRR) has recently issued a report dedicated to sexual development in the nearest 5 to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharky, a professor of workshops and the artistic intellectual of Shephill University and FRR, we should be able to deal with their exhibition.
Users can select colours of works, box forms and leg type.
"Their chemistry are in this regard, but the companies are already sent them to consumers, and soon we will see them much more", said Sharky to present a new report.
Current sex clouds have evolved from their sweet assemblies in work with heat skin, heat, and almost human fabrics of artificial intelligence.
Users can also "set" their works on their sculptures by choosing all the colors of the eye and shapes of the work to the form and the footsteps.
But the fact that many works have "life" compared with which the Stepford Gene would be very progressive, is still more worried.
Current sex cucles have become workers of the silicon hair.
For example, the RealBotix Roboter company allows users to emphasize quality works that they find, for example, attractiveness.
There are still sex works of Roxxxy Gold, developed by "True Companion", which are made with the already programed individuality - for example, "World Farra" produces a fantastic impression, and "Dika Wendy" has a "mood" character.
"The Roxxy Gold has a charity that is beautiful to yours," says the True Companion website.
So she loves what you love, does not love what you don't love, and so on.
It changes the vision during the day, like the real man!
She may want to sleep or smell, or she can "be in order."
There are many concerns of sex workers - not in the last time because they replace real human relationships, but are worried more about the subscribed image of women, the association with the violence of the Cold (read the opposite) Farao.
The True Companion website Roxxy compares to the elector only for men.
"If a woman (sic!) may be elector, why cann't a man have Roxxy?" says the website.
But these sex robots are not just fetiches or just new sex games.
Their appearance and all the increasing complexity indicates something more dark and deep in our culture, as a disappearance of gender equality towards the desire of sex with the submission of an optional addition.
Of course, most men will not purchase sex robbery, and even though FRR notes their growing population, they remain on the peripheral of the consumer culture.
But what happens to us from the peripheral may be very learning about the meaning of the epoch in which we live.
And many people are not stupid and are not aggressive until the free market will give them a chance.
This is not a convergence - that these complicated sex-roots appeared just when women ' s rights were threatened in the world when the Belarus house is the President, who rejoices what had to come to women.
The most terribest in the television "Service Press" is not graphic images, cuts of body and eye eye, namely how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Galaad is an overwhelming, but now it doesn't seem to be so big.
The purpose of the sex workers is to achieve such physical likeness to real women (except pornographic proportions), which allows technologies.
Their creators want to be shocked by people to copy the movement of the human body.
But, in fact, their "harrakers" jobs are not like real women.
They can't leave with their partners or leave them.
They have no life or biography - nothing that could indicate independence or anything else that could destroy the illusion of full dependence.
Otherwise, they are beautiful slaves.
Or, as he says in 2017, the officers.
The born of Los Angeles Yunjin (Puh) Jeter, who has been speaking for the collection of Ukraine since 2013, does not help our national team at the Basquetball Championship of Europe, the final part of which starts 31 August.
In the portal, BeBasket reported the general manager of the Sine-years, André Lebedev.
We tried to agree with Jeter, but, unfortunately, he will not come in the family circumstances.
We're going to Evocaseket without a natural player, because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This will give opportunities to our youth players," he said.
Remember, in the direct participation of Jeter, the Ukrainian collected the sixth place in Euroacket 2013, and first came to the Bacteball Champion, which was not able to overcome the group stage, and the U.S. birth took a medium game of 15.4 o'clocks, tried to be boarded and led to 5 fees.
Jeter stopped speaking for the collection of Ukraine from the end of our national team, Michael Frathello, who left the post in 2015.
The Euborasket-2017 will take place at the same time in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian group tournament team will take place on the Promised Land.
In the support of the Murzin Group B, there will be five units: with Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Greece (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
In the course of the training for the tourism, our husband’s collection held two control units in which the Netherlands and the Belarus entered.
The great trampa ship?
It seems very wise to imagine the Mita Romney.
In the general era, the fact that the political disputes polluted by the American elector, some families were a micro-electronic disappearance.
Among the Thanksgiving Day and Birthday, the American newspapers regretted the colonies about how to address the horrible parents that voted for Trampa.
It seems that we're all pressing soon.
It is less about the ability to connect the family to Trampa.
I'm going to write this because my cousin, the left poeses of Chicago, who had been on the feet of the Republicans in his family, came to New York for this week.
She recalled me that the unity in the fight against the general enemy could have a strong effect.
At the Trumpe House, all whom she knows, including a Republican brother with whom she discussed the policy of decades, were immediately and strangely found on one side.
It is, of course, good at dinner, but I can't think that in a broader context it may be pretty dangerous.
The trumpet has leaked the strength into the left flank, but the deforming effect of his government can all turn to the right.
When we talk about Tramp and "Normalization", we mean the uncertain opportunity that one time we will stop struggling his leaves.
However, there are more doubtful scenarios in which the Trump "Normalizes" of the most legal Republicns, which are unexpectedly shown in the background of his standards.
I realized that I was very lacking today by the oldest desire of Mitt Romney, with a machine shooting dog and a 14 per cent tax (but at least we knew how it looks like his tax declaration) - compared to the Trump and the other seems very small.
When Tramp is gone, the next Republic candidate will be enough to be in his own will so that it might be a great step forward.
When my cousin went to the center, we went with the kids to the carsel in the Central Park, the largest carsel in the New York Park Department, and the best way in the city to lose $3 if you don't need coffee.
The shoes and smells, pictures of the sleeves on the central slaughter, are sweet clouds and animals that, shocking up, look at the shock, are extremely bad, and the snack of music, as it's strange, brings a shock.
There are so many known things in this city: species of sky clouds are slaughtered, the buildings have come too much to cause trips, and the reality of the city does not succeed in the dreams.
Twenty-five years ago, and I'm still worried about the day when I learned that the area of Swiss cottage is not actually a Swiss swimming pocket (Yee Olde Swiss Cottage), but a large circle crossing in North London.
And Carlosel in the Central Park is still an unfair, magnificent place in which two years of child, 12 years and two women in fourty may have a good time.
If I could put the evaluation cursues, I would put a fifth, but, happily, no one asked me about it.
And in the university this week, I was asked to take a terminal card, to evaluate my "experience" purchase from one to five stars.
In the coffee around my street, the same more option to make a 15 per cent evaluation is a order for holding.
As a result, it is not only the neutrality of interaction, but also the personal attitude to the situation that does not provide.
The poor soldier in the university was confusionly smiling until I was able to evaluate my experience in her credit card in five stars.
The Oscar Pistorious was transferred from the prison to the hospital because of the pain in the wound.
Pistorus leaves a prison because of the visit to the doctor on the second time.
Last year, he was transferred to the hospital to treatment of shocks that, as a result of the arrestation, he received a fall in the camera.
Pistorus was condemned for the murder after the appeal of the prosecution to the original sentence for an unpredicted murder.
He killed Stefan Camp early morning of the Valentine Day in 2013, shooted in it several times through the door of a toilet room in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorus said he took his friend for the nighttime night that was hidden in the toilet.
The Prosecutor stated that it was intended to make another protest, at this time against the six-year term of Pretoriaus, which, according to her words, was too milk.
The General Prosecutor stated that the appeal of the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal would be considered in that year.
Pretoria may increase 15 years of age if the prosecution has been successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
A suspected NTD journalist has been elected to sign a non-related sign
Town legal observers chose to be sentenced as a signing for a man who attacked the TV channel of NTV Niite to Divigate during the direct edition from the Horror Park on 2 August.
This reported TASS with an official representative of IUD Irina Wolk.

As later, hurligan has no relationship with the WHD.
According to Division’s own detainees, instead, they tried to stop the mocking.
Two Bolgarian citizens were detained in Greece for the illicit palace
As the Bi-T-Vi TV reported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bolgarian citizens were detained in Greece for the illegal palace.
On 1 August, a group of people in Citônia had been detained in a place where there were two Bolgarian citizens.
They were left on the same day, while the consequence is still.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported the "Bi-T-Vi" TV that the people of Bulgaria later left.
The Greek authorities have already controlled the free campagner and already designated serious strikes for all those who have been captured during the standing in an unsigned place.
The tests will be carried out throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may designate a trace.
MIT Russia accused the United States Vice-President during the "Fruit War"
Declarations made during the European Tour, Michael Penns, US Vice-President, were criticized by the Russian Middle East.
"True, it is regrettable that Washington is still more deeply covered by the predominant ideologicalized stamps during the "friendly war", says the Russian external state.
Thus, the MIT reacted to the words Pens on Russian threats and attempts to resolve a violent crossing of borders that they were referred to in the Sub-Green.
The Russian Middle East has indicated the destructiveness of the election, or the Western or Russia, and the inevitableness of the thesis on the ways of the inevitable entry of the whole South-East Europe into the NATO.
The Russian diplomates also recalled that the United States had violated international law, applying the force to defeat Kosovo from Serbia and thus set up another consideration of tension.
"All the American colleagues invited to stop Russia's smuggling and its external policy line, which is unlikely based on respect for partners and the preparation for joint constructive work, on the mutual basis of interests," states the Russian Middle East.
Feldsher suffered from the DTD with a "speak" in the Sub-Mobile
The DTT occurred in the Sub-Stopino, resulting in the cutting of foreigners with the Score Help Cart.
Today, about 08:10 sq has been cutting Misubishi's car with a cart of rapid assistance in the city of Stupino Moscow.
"The result of the switching of the machine has turned back", stated the TASC in the Moscow Press Service of the Press Service.
The TDT works with law enforcement officers and the circumstances of the situation are explained.
In the Odesian area, a woman was cast on a new birth son and returned to a packaging.
On August 3, the Separate police office reported the local resident that he was found in a unfavoured private home with a boyfriend.
"In the place of the event, law enforcements and doctors who were operating for children to the medical institution," reported the National Police Head of Odes.
Medicines determined that the child was born for a few hours before his discovery, which proved to be a population.
During the initial operational and investigative events, a local residence of 36 years of age has been established.
Women also have three young children.
As noted in the chapter, the family observers had not previously occurred and had not been particularly taken into account.
The police are currently established by the circumstances and reasons that women have taken into this event after the processing decision was taken.
The girl is under the guard of the doctors now.
As previously reported, a 21-year-old woman from Nicolaeve dismissed her infant child in the museum.
Gregory Leps: "I'm kicking in battle, but 55 is not 30."
One of the most persistent artists of the Russian Estrada Gregory Leps in the nearest Sunday, reverses his 55-year-old.
Before the shop, the slaughter told the shooter of the shooter.
I remember your "pompioner".
The Special Chair in the Luxury, Gloria Gaynor's shirt for a named, powerful slaughter over the Moscow River.
Well, you'd like to shoot your next fifth.
Have the purposes happened?
If we talked about the profession, it was a lucky period.
I worked a lot, three times I passed with the guests of the whole country, giving up to 120-130 percent per year.
I put two bad albums.
Of course, I'm not the one I'll say 20 years ago.
Biological times do not lie.
Get as I smell in my 30s, it's all weak.
However, I smile in the battle, I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, I think I'm a different level.
You and the new album, first in three years.
Yeah, it's working on him now.
Indeed, we've already recorded in my study and now we'll send it to Los Angeles.
It's called "What are you serious?" on a song that was written together with Timothy.
She's not completely ready, so we haven't planned her for anywhere.
We'll do this later when we'll call on her.
And the album is represented in November to the series of my youths in the Moscow Crocus Steve Holle.
Your new platinum puts your hand a beautiful American slaughter Chris Colman.
You think you wanted to join him in your stroke composite?
In my view, the Colman is one of the world's most excited slaughterers today.
He came to me to the studio, recorded his party.
I invited him to enter into my group, and Jeremy Colson (known browser participating in various projects. - " News") proposed.
But for a long-term work in Russia, they moved, very much, excessively.
It's about gonorrs from €35,000 to €45,000 per month.
And then I thought that in the post-commerce space, I'm looking for pleasant musicians.
And I found Max Maleshev's beautiful slaughter.
Indeed, it is better to be pleased.
Sometimes, I want some of them to take care of, not for what.
For example, the guitarists of the Fodour Dosom are highly covered at the international level.
It writes western musical magazines, and it is invited to various hysterical festivals.
Steve Way, listening to his game, said "the new generation of guitarians, with another executive technology."
Your album is in Los Angeles, the American musicians work with you, but you still can't come to the United States?
Do you try to remove this ban?
Now, honestly, I don't do anything.
There's a number of lawyers that do this.
As a musicer, I'm really sorry that I can't get to America.
I didn't tell you I know there.
It is more useful to share with the real professionals.
We're not hunting them, but we don't have such experience, schools.
Before our artists of popular music for 70 years, they have not completely taken the tasks that American musicians have always solved.
They tried to make the maximum quality sound.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now why and Britain refused me to go for ten years.
But every year I'm going to give a visa documentation to the British Society so that I'll be allowed to travel there and the main thing is to work there.
The last Europe is very favorable to me.
And you're planning a concert in Monaco, not commanded, but athic, right?
Yeah, there's a good Sports room in Monte Carlo, I've been talking there once.
Now they were invited again, and as I know, all the tickets on the gate are already sold.
You're going to go to "Raime Wakele" starting on July 20, July?
She invited me, and I certainly called.
Lyma is a wonderful beach and a beautiful woman that can give herself and a beautiful ball and even a shoe.
After the guests and the jewelry concerts, I know you'd like to turn back to the snake of the High Witness.
Two albums with his songs are in your discograph.
When's the third out?
Maybe in the next year.
But he'll be completely different.
I want to write a 80-90 piece of higher song in the same way as he did.
Just a voice and a guitare.
There's no other warning.
To accompany me will be our famous musicer Tim Veders.
I intend to participate in the album and Alexandre Jacoblevich Disenbaum.
I talked about this topic, we have a good relationship, but he's busy, so let's see how it's going to be.
You and the songs of Boris Gingerski's slowly entered your repertoire.
Maybe you write his album?
Boris Borisovic is a beautiful man and a beautiful musician.
I sneaked with him several times and asked me, can I sleep that song or something else?
He said, "Grigory, I'll write songs so they're done."
Please try, come on.
It's probably interesting to write this album.
Until I have no such task, but in the future, a two-year-old, if Boris Borisovic won't be reflected, I may have done that project.
If you don't concentrate fully on your production center.
I think, until you've done his capacity, you haven't signed contracts with all artists that you're interested?
There's a whole range of executives I would have dreamed to have under my ship, but they are self-destined.
Are you understood by Sergey Lazarev?
I invited him.
I can't agree with his repertoire, but he also has its development strategy.
And in my center there's Alexander Panyots I've been in Holos.
We concluded the treaty and worked with him.
In our pop music, such skins are rare.
It will be very regretted if he does not reach the heights of which he is destined.
I'm trying to draw him the repertoire, I'll take the slips.
I hope it's good.
I'm also trying to move on other artists of my center: buy them songs, smiling poets, sometimes their tracks cut into tele and radio anals.
If they don't reach large heights, I still bring our cooperation to the logical conclusion.
They'll get the album, a few clamps.
And further, if they want, they can go on my way, and I'm not going to wait for them to return money into them.
Although I'd be glad if some of them get commercial success and pay for me the percentage we agreed in the contract.
But if this doesn't happen, I'm not going to get oxygen to anybody.
Let everyone work, kill, prove how I've ever shown.
If you're supposed to make a guest tower in Ukraine tomorrow and you're gonna make sure you're coming to the country, you're going?
I'm still invited.
It is mainly about closed events.
And what about a big tour...
I am a man of my country, a Russian, who believed that I fly to Syria on the same plane that then disappeared.
If tomorrow, you'll tell me that you're gonna fly to some other point in the interest of the State, I'll fly.
And I think I'm thinking of the bloggers and other critics.
I am so sorry that this situation has come to us from Ukraine.
Because I believe that we are one people and must be together.
I regret that this would not be done, at least in the nearest time.
I gave you a year to Ukrainian 40 to 50.
We've seen like there anywhere.
It's very grateful.
And with several Ukrainian artists, Ana Lorak, the World of Lobod, Artem Loak...
In Ukraine, the mass of the gifted people and sincerely regrets that they cannot now be fully able to use their talents to a large Russian audition.
Musicals should combine and develop people.
I would be pleased to invite some classical Ukrainian executive in Russia, such as Slava Vacarchuk, and made a joint concert with it.
But I think it's not likely at this moment.
Andrey Ohrokok was moved with a spaciole
As it was known, the technical director of the Eastern Space Andrey Oikokoks began working in the State of Space and Production Center (CHNPC) named Cronchev.
He was previously employed by the Middle East space, but because of the diversity of the management of the Headquarters of Land and Space Infrastructure (CANKY) was transferred to the Employee in Moscow Fields where the production coordination was accepted.
The channel of Mr. Ohloki will not be: the post of the technical director, probably, is disrupted and the functionality is dismissed by the CANKI units.
The technical director of the Eastern and Vice-Chairman of the CANKI on Technological Development, Andrew Ohjokock, moved to work in the GCNPSC name of Cronchev, said that a number of spatial industry companies, as well as the Government Agencies.
"He works at the new post for a few weeks," said the partners in the hotel.
The operational comments of CANKI were not possible on Friday, and Mr. Ojokocks did not have a comment.
However, information has been officially confirmed in the CRC.
He decided to move to the Director of Production Coordination, as he said to the company. - Andrey Ojokock, which was put before him, has completely fulfilled a start minimum for the first start of Eastern space.
Mr. Ojokock went to work in the CANKY in 2013, with the duty of space forces, in particular in Bayconu, and in Plezeki, the first Coast Vice-President of the Commander.
In 2009, Andrew Ojokocks became a criminal act.
It was condemned by his responsibilities that regional commercials had received for derogation of the claim but did not comply with the obligations taken for the purchase of separate missile parts in the Archangean area and the Republic of the Commission.
In 2012, the court acknowledged it innocent.
The technological development responsibilities were distributed to various projects, but most of them were the strike of space in the Forest.
The Federal Space Agency of Oleg Ostapenko in the Interview said directly that the situation in Eastern " had been critical already in October 2013."
The case was a strategic error in the planning: the completion of the structure and the completion of the first time of the Union-2.1 reporter was planned at the same time at the end of 2015.
To end up until the end of the year, the strike decided for a half years ago and the deadlines were delayed from December to July 2015.
In order to accelerate the process, the CIA specialists began to spend a parallel mount of technological equipment on unbuilding objects.
The main part of this idea was Andrey Ohokocks.
In spite of the existing risks and all the results of the transfer (the Union was only 28 April 2016), the idea was justified, said the source of the "Quite" in space, "as we wouldn't have done any start from the East and would work a structure."
Vice-Premier, Dmitri Rhozin, who smoking the creation of the space, called Andrey Ohokok his "space Sustainable", but he almost always requested information about the stroke period.
He recalled Mr. Ohlocks and directly: For example, in the interview, he proposed to stop the Federal Office for Special Construction (Spestry) status of the only Eastern and direct executive to work with sub-Special operators: "Why do we all have to constitute the eggs in one corner of the Spicester?"
This idea has been supported by the Government.
Since 2017, the CENKY has taken its duty to complete Building and Technology Compilation planned in the fourth quarter.
According to the data of Mr. Ohjoki to the new workplace, there was a difference with the CANKI leadership on the way to complete the structure of space and complexs, as well as the methods of work with sub-organized organizations.
"That's going to be better for all," says one of the mine-members who participated in the Middle East.
The Government Agence Officer, on the other hand, calls out a strange decision: "He was one of the best specialists, finding him a equal replacement will not be easy."
According to the data " . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
There is a two-specific training program in music schools
In the future, students of children's music schools will be able to receive two specialities simultaneously.
According to the director of the Department of Science and Education of the Hollow Law, it is possible to overwhelm the recycling disciplines, and the issue of the payment of other jobs in second speciality to decide with special pledges, is transmitted to "Ria News".
"The Ministry of Culture has taken this issue to control, and we are together with the experts community to develop a mechanism that enabled two specialities, but will not at the same time contrary to the effective education legislation", said Goubanko.
In the past Friday, Wolfmier Putin, a student of the Child Center, Maria Andreev, reported that it had been required to pay the second specialist objects at the CMSC at the Moscow Conservation.
The girl told her that it was learned by the script and forthepiano class and had the profits of competitors in both directions.
The head of the State acknowledged its issue very active and promised help.
The 17-year-old Russian wall in Mexico is detained in 17-year-old Russian
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian Kirill N., who is on the wall of the high building, reports the port El Universal.
The university occurred in the capital of Mexico.
A young man with two unknown men passed through a three-milh-milh board in the territory of Nestle’s office buildings, and he himself took one of his bathrooms.
He did not use any special insurance, insurance and credibility.
The young man has been detained on the shooting.
The Ministry of Public Security officers left it on the ground on the helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Migration Institute.
It explains whether the youth is legally on the territory of the country.
A video with a young man who was higher, was popular at the Internet.
Users called a young "Home Pope".
The media writes that such experiments are the hobby for it.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate can help to facilitate GHC.
Red meat and chocolate are adopted to be considered as a shock for your drinking trace.
However, recent studies relate to the reverse: The dieth, rich with milk whites and milk products, can help the symptoms of those who suffer a fever disease.
This is an inexcellent disease that causes approximately 1,3 million people in the United States and 3000,000 in Britain, leads to skins and injuries of animals, chronic or bloody food, weight loss and extreme weight.
Normally, the symptoms are advised to avoid meat and milk products, but researchers from the University of Washington have established that the main triptophan mixture of white triptophan has contributed to the production of immune cells that increase the tolerance of the skin.
Dr. Marco Collonna explained that immune cells in the kitchen would be monitored for the harmful microbes that were feeded not in the body.
Cells that can be able to start the breathing process are equivalent to cells that increase tolerance, protecting the body, and indeed do not cause sensitive tissue.
If the equality is too strongly violated by the repatriation, it may lead to the slower diseases of the skin.
Experiences showed that the mouse with a certain bacteria in the kitchen appears to increase the tolerance of cells.
And this bacteria needs a triptophan, one of the white building elements, to start the appearance of these cells.
Professor Collonna said, "We have established a connection between one type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuter, which is part of the normal microbiology of the kitchen, and the development of the population of cells that increase to tolerance.
More triptophan was in the museum food, more of these immune cells had."
He suggested that the same will be working in people: the combination of L. Reuter and the rich triptophan dieth could contribute to more tolerant and less circumstances in the kitchen.
The past by Dr. Louis Servantez-Barragánwas, studying the diversity of immuno cells, found that one group of these cells had experienced muscles, and the other group belonged to the same line, but individually contained them.
She suggested that the difference could be called by a microbial muscle -- bacteria communities, virus and skins, which are usually living in a glass-case tragedy.
The cell of the mouse was seen, and six types of bacteria were found in the mouse with immune cells but without the mouse.
The muscles generated in a stell environment that did not have a good microbiom and that did not develop this type of immune cells have received L. Reuters and immune cells have appeared.
To understand how bacteria influences the immune system, researchers increased L. reuters in the iron environment and then moved small portion of iron, without bacteria, to the unexpected immune cells from the mouse.
Immuno cells have become more tolerant cells.
When the active component was separated from iron, it was a bleeding product of triptotan processing known as a 3-mole oxygen.
When researchers doubled the number of triptophons in the museum, the number of cells increased by about 50 per cent, but when the triptophan level has been decreased, the number of cells also slowed to two times.
Dr. Servantez-Barrahan explains that people have the same increased tolerance of cells as the mouse, and most of us have L. Reuters in their sweet and sweet tract.
Inconsistent, whether triptophane products in L. reuter development of cells have been found in the same way as the mouse, but people suffering from smoke diseases have been found in triptophan genes.
She says, "It is possible to develop these cells and must be strengthened, since these cells depend on the revolving processes on the internal surface of the skin.
The high level of triptotan at L. Reuters can potentially lead to the expansion of their population."
According to Joseph Mourinua, Manchester Yuntead was a 'ganie' in the face of Nigeria Matich
Manchester Yunetted rolled a 'ganie' in the face of Nemania Match, he believed that George Mourin, after the defenseman was in the massage against the Sampдорia on the midday night.
The game acquired for 40 million feet in the Chelsea began with the count of 2-1 in Dublin at the last presidential shop of the United States before the WEFA supercub mask against the Rheal Madrid, and was impressed in the role of the settler, while the Game of Pogby and Andréa Transior had been pleasing first when they were grateful.
However, as Mattichi did not participate in the presidential Chalsey tour in Asia, he was seriously uncomfortable for the game, and he was only 45 minutes out of that, as it said, Mourinia requires processing before the first-leading season.
“He needs time, but his experience, mind, gentleness in his thinking, he thinks as a football,” said Mourini.
"We will help him prepare soon than late."
Like Matty, his new friends and friends, Victor Lindelèf and Roman Luke, started playing at Aviv stadium when Mourini began to form their main component at the beginning of the next session.
The Independent newspaper reported on this week that Mourini would like to take three other players, but underlined that the club had already achieved fantastic results, taking three of the four games he would like to start first.
"I thank the club for the winning of three of four," he added.
"I like more if they get me four of four, but they have already been very hard for me."
Lithuania's former social-democratic leaders agreed to remain in the right coalition
An ex-president of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, Algiers Butkawits and Gemininas Kirkilas, as well as the former seed of the social-democratics Chaсловas Ursinas, called for one party to remain in the rule of coalition.
As reported by the Parlamentary Journal, the Union of Crescents and Greens, the Social-Democratic Party has initiated a debate on whether it should remain in the legal coalition.
And here, three elderly partners were called to one party with an open letter, which states: "It is understood the disappointment of the committees on the results of the election party, but the coalition with the "Christians" was not very easy to create for us, but also the conditions for further implementation in the goals of social justice, which are prescribed under our initiative in the Government's programme and to maintain the political domination of the Left Centre on Rights."
According to the former party leaders, in the discussion, "the opinion was based on the emotions without specific arguments".
The writers are afraid that the unplanned action of their party could bring Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
Anton Mamaev’s invasion was appointed by a trap
Mosgourth was sentenced to Anton Mamaev's collective disabilities from the four and half years of the detention of freedom to the slaughter of 200 000 rubs.
Previously, the sentence was released from the AIDS.
In that regard, Mosgour Court confirmed that the accused was a criminal, since he organized maliciousness and distortion of the motorcycle in the former specialist.
The Moscou decided to strike the punishment of Antonio Mamaev up to 200 thousand rub.
"Mamaev is a organizer of disgrace, which also forms a crime, and, accordingly, a person should be engaged in criminal responsibility," explained the Moskow Press secretary of the Uran Sokov.
In this case, the court had been taught on the health of Mamaeva, the real circumstances of the case that had not been undermined.
Furthermore, the Court applies to p. 64 A.R.R.RF, which would be appointed to the punishment below.
With regard to Mamaev Vasilia of Serostano, the court had not established circumstances that would have become the basis for changeing the severeness of the convictions and the change of the convictions.
Anton Mamaev himself said that it remained unwanted by the Moscow decision.
I am disappointed by the court's decision.
The only legal decision would be justified, and it would continue to fight for justice.
His lawyer Andrey Orlow did not exclude the complaint of the sentence in the case of Moskow Court and the Supreme Court.
"We will use all markets to be involved in the European Court of Human Rights," he stated "RiA News."
Remember, the 28-year-old Moscow, Anton Mamae, who suffers a permanent muscle atrofie, has become a criminal case on Thursday last year.
Individual claims that he purchased a driver in the acquaintance of 160 000 rubs to sell then.
However, the owners of the motorcycle, among which the former specialist, claimed that disability and his assistant of the Serostana had chosen their property, threatening to adopt violence.
On June 30, the Treasury Court of Moscow condemned Vasilia Serostana for three years of colony, and Antonio Mamaev, four and half years of punishment, with the removal of punishment in the colony of the general regime (s. 2 p. 162 CFR).
After disability was placed in the AIDS, the Joint Hall, the Prosecutor of the Human Rights Corporation of Tatiana Moskalka, was linked to the case.
As a result, on the midst of July, Anton Mamaev was released from the SIDA by the same decision of the Timurish Court.
The protection was, on the other hand, condemned the decision of the first instance in Moskow.

The Reception for the White House was charged to payers in thousands of dollars
According to the reports of the TIME magazine, the White House decided to heat the Southern Sea Sea in the United States Industry shipping event in the last month was $24,000 payers.
The White-Green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Mariine One and the ship, became a central element of the United States construction programs held in Belarus on 17 July.
President Donald Tramp, Vice-President Mike Penns and the senior officials of the White House have examined technological products from all fifty-first States.
The Vacuum in Connective was sent close to a fleet from Man State, a fire car from Visbourg and a Mississippi car driver.
According to the first escape of the seas helicopters (HMX-1), the Heavy Heaven Office responsible for the Heavy Management, the White House Army Office was equipped with the presence of a helicopter in a private order, or “FRAGO” only 36 hours before the helicopter was landed in the Southern Heaven on the case of the “negative” event.
“I just wanted you to make sure that you know, because it is an uncomfortablely wide extensive expansion in the press,” wrote the commander HMX-1 in an electronic letter to your chief, the first Vice-President of the Sea-Chair Corporation, referred to the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive to the Southern Meeting about 7 a.m. on 17 July to participate in the event designated at 3 p.m. and remains there before the gas will be released between 6 and 9 at the same night.
The letter adds that if the shipment is delayed from the White House, the second escape is required for the return of the police in accordance with the limitations of work time.
The first equipage condemned the helicopter during the event, and the security officers remained close to the aircraft until it was on the ground.
The records received by the TIME magazine remained unexpected whether the second escape was needed.
The Hatcha Act prohibites the use of public property for political purposes by federal servants.
According to the records, HMX-1 has clarified whether the event was not contrary.
“In particular, we asked whether it was a violation of the Hatcha law, and they answered us that no,” wrote the commander.
“ It seems to be there anywhere, ” answered the Vice-President.
The activities “Overed in America” were declared by the White House as an official event, and the Hatcha law was not distributed.
But even official events have political notes.
During the event, the President made efforts to promote the reform of health reform, which was formerly developed in the senate, and encouraging the attempts to regulate Government decisions.
Use of aircraft named “Marine One” and “Air Force One” for political purposes is not a new revelation.
The Chairpersons are required to use them for travels.
But to ask them only for photos.
Tramp was the subject of the discussion in February when the President's aircraft was on the back plan during his first predicted mission in Melbourne, Florida, and his accommodation in Twitter was incarcerated with complaints to use his President's previous plane.
“The white house in the resort from the “Feated in America”, which has been presented products from 50 American workers from American materials,” said Vice-Secretary Press of the White House Lindsey Walters.
The HMX-1 Equipages are often performed in training around the Washington Aglomeration and the Southern Sea in order to make the President of the United States in the White House precisely up to Duyma.
When Tramp was at the G-20 Summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 conducted 58 train stations in the White House.
According to one of the officials, there was an equipment in the case of the necessary training fields for a month.
In that day, the units also had 11 additional hours under the “unpresidency support tasks”.
According to the White House, none of the expenditure submitted to the taxpayers had been led to any of the other expenses.
The representative of the Sikorsky company reported that the company had not taken part in the demonstration organization in the South Sea.
HMX-1 does not take into account the budget for the Presidential positions and determine the precise amount of events difficult.
However, according to the time rates of the Ministry of Defence for 2017, the return rate of the Ministry of Defence for VH-3D is $24,380 per hour.
The office records confirmed that the aircraft time was 30 minutes per minute each side of its aircraft based on the Kuanticco marine flight base in Virginia.
The White House claims that the real value of the use of this tax is very much below.
“Reasoning the value for payers, based on an example of reimbursement rate, perfectly wrong,” says Walters.
“These examples include personal composition, services and many other unreasonable costs, including annual allocations.”
According to the investigation carried out by the RTD Corporation in 2015, reimbursement rates are not included in the value of personal composition, but are actually taking into account the value of the hot, services and expenditure specified in the treaty.
At that time, the former secretary of the White House, Shon Spaceer, was expressed in the protection of the hepatitis use for events.
“ The idea to demonstrate the things made in America this week” said Spaceer.
"I know that Sikorsky and the Connectics company are very proud of the fact that they contribute to national security, and that they exist, I think, hundreds of people, if there are thousands of people who work more than that.
And I think, as the majority of the Americans, that we're all proud of this is the heavy and another military technician, which has been instantly working so much Americans.
Surely it is appropriate for you to take care of this."
It was unreasonable if Trump interacted with a helicopter, obsessing the South Sea during the event, but he was exactly located on a driving place in the fire car.
In the White House, Traamp returned to the representatives of the Sikorsky company, searching for a print on his own company product fleet.
"I'm good to know Sikorsky," said the President. - I have three of them."
