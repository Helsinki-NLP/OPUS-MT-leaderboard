What indicates that Russia comes out of the crisis?
Economists have seen the signs of Russia's exit from the most permanent recession in the last twenty-first years.
As indicated by the requested Bloomberg analytics, the RFBR demonstrates a positive dynamic - in the second quarter of GDP decreased to 0.8 per cent in the annual expression.
This indicator is minimum since the beginning of 2015.
According to the last data, Russian economy was decreased by 0.6 per cent in the second quarter.
The stabilisation of the situation has also recently been declared by the Centre and the Middle Eastern Development.
Previous growth.
According to the CIA experts, the recession in Russian economy remained in the past.
The Russian Index Evaluation states that the recession remained behind and the advanced growth of the economy,” states the Russian Bank Bulletin "What the Trents say".
The module assessment of GDP for the current quarter of regulators has increased up to 0.4 per cent, the fourth quarter was 0.5 per cent.
As noted by the representative of the Minoon Development, during the second quarter of GDP RF was stopped in the second quarter, 0.2 per cent.
In the second quarter of the periodic cleaning of GDP was 0.2 per cent to the previous quarter.
However, during the quarter of decline, it was 0.2 per cent in April, and in May and June the change of GDP was 0-0.15," quotes the representative of MED RIA "Newity".
The delay of the Russian economy during the last fifth quarters shows that "his long."
Among other marketmarks that indicate national economy live, Bloomberg calls an increase in electricity demand and iron transportation.
If an amendment to that year is high, it is understanding that the dynamics in more than 1 per cent of electricity consumption may be prescribed in a further working day.
Let's add to this lower average year temperature in the first quarter.
The following argument is the growth of shipments, but it is difficult to get accurate data, and 0.5 per cent of the half-year amount can also be explained,” explains Kirill Jacobko from AROR BROCER.
Others, however, have more clear signs of the stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, reduced pressure.
The user price index was 7.2 per cent compared to 15.6 per cent in the same month.
Moreover, the last two weeks of Rosstat fixed the deflation.
The prices in Russia have been decreased in the first five years.
In view of the dynasm of the rubber currency, which has also shown the strong counteracts at the beginning of the year, the results of August since the beginning of the year increased to 12 per cent.
It is also one of the signs of recovery to which indicators should be taken from the real economy sector,” emphasized Jacob.
In addition, from April to April, industrial production is increased.
In June, the rate increased by 1.7 per cent.
The decline in external trafficking drops from -32.8 per cent in January 2016 to -20.7 per cent in May.
The positive dynamic also demonstrates the situation in the labour market, where unemployment levels were decreased to 5,4 per cent.
He was only in September 2015 (5.2%).
Despite the well-being situation on the labour market, the question of the real income of the population is to remain better.
In the annual expression, the indicator is decreased to 4.8 per cent.
This factor may cause economic recovery, since household costs have a small contribution to GDP.
Normally, their share in the economy is 50 per cent.
In addition to a low consumer activity, the Russian Bank's huge risk factors can also be called.
The regulator maintains the rate of 10.5 per cent, which is not the most real sector.
The inequalities of investment are also insufficiently high levels of industrial capacity.
However, it can be suggested that, at the end of the year, the economies of RF are delayed by -0.5 per cent against -3.7 per cent in 2015,” said the GC Forex Club Irina Rhova.
The naturalization process of sports launched recently in Russian football and excellently living in winters at Olimpía in Sochie until it is actively developed in summer sports.
If the Olympic Games in Rio for Russia are speaking for former foreigners, most of them are the births of the former Soviet Union Republic.
In Rio de Janeiro, we can observe a relative process - a sufficient number of Russians speak under the flags of other States.
In each case, the change of citizenship is different.
Some parents have brought them to another country in a child, not left their choice.
Someone did not pursue competition in the Russian collection.

The girl had no choice.
There she decided to go on the stages of her old sister -- to take a easy atletic.
Lisa has chosen six pieces with her sister.
Don't stay in Russia, if it couldn't be able to shoot from the throne, Elena Isnbaev.
Unfortunately, the Olympics in Rio Lisa will be our only terrace, eve and former, in the sixth sector.
Her best achievement is the 2010 champion bronze of the Championship Championship and the gold of the Continental Pertinence in 2016, which she once again in the absence of Elena Isnbaev.
A 29-year-old Elena Pirozki was born in New York in 1986.
Her parents are religious promotors of the evangelist direction.
Some because of their faith, they went to the United States when the girl was only three years old.
Besides Elena, still eight children were grown in the family.
All of them lived in a small town of Greenfield in Massachusetts.
Lena started fighting in school.
As a result, she moved to the city of Colorado-Sprengs, where the United States Institute has continued to operate under the direction of another former Russian Vladimir of the Wildlife.
At the Olympic 2012 in London, Elena played in its first appeal.

Soon she had represented her country at the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
There, indeed, Yannah was able to take only 17 places that were not sufficient to fall into the final conspiration in the personal prize.
After two years before that, she decided to win the blonde meal of the Olympic Games.
Another gymnastic, only this time sportive, is Irina Sazona.
If the way of immigration mentioned previous sports can be deemed standards, the choice of the Irish family is very unnecessary.

She didn't come to Rio as well as she wanted.
The best place is 40 in personal multilaws.

However, for a long time she spoke under the Russian flag, showing the bad results, was even the recursion of the country at 200 meters away from the battery.
She received Swiss citizenship in 2015 and began to speak under a red-white flag.

According to the Governor B. Condratiave, "we need to learn non-actions and parades, but systemally."
They should grow and as at least seven years to understand that they should be shocked and educated.
But until this work, like I think, works formally and, I suspect, more on the bowl.
If the clusters of the class take all the positive things that have been covered before, at a quality new level, I'll be happy.
If it's all smells and we don't know how, the new idea is turned into a deep polarism.

Awareness of the rights of owners and responsibilities of resources and management organizations is very high.
The Plass Moskwa checks the reason for housing and communication services, since there are little parts of the budgetary support and money for a number of population categories.
It's probably all together and explains the peaceful situation in Moscow.
Are all engaged in the will of regional authorities?
Maybe free to change the place of work?

Can Erdogan reject friendship with the EU and the United States?
The President of Turkey, Regep Tyip Erdogan, issued the U.S. switch, proposed a choice between Turkey and Fethullham Gulen, Islamic preacher accused to the organization of public movement.
He declared it by speaking before his partners in Ankara.
Erdogan called for the Americans to reject the support of the “terrorist organization of the phethurists”.
This is not the first statement from Turkey, in which the United States call for a change in their position.
Experts believe that Turkey's relations with the West continues to grow and could try to change the authority in the country.
"Amerika will choose between Turkey and the FETO ("Terrorist Organization of Phetularists").
Life organizing FETO or democratic Turkey.
She should do this choice," quotes the Anatolian Task Force of Training Erdogoan, who was called at midnight in Ankara.
The President of Turkey was typically, but he had already needed the U.S. to comply with the requirement of them first immediately after the murder.
Remember, in the night of 16 July, that Turkey's high-employed representatives had been tried to pursue the legitimate authority in the country, as well as to pursue the heads of the State.
However, after the treatment of the population, the complaint was sent, and his organizations and participants were arrested.
A total of 80,000 people were slaughtered in a number of more than military teachers and scientists.
As Regipe Erdogan, their employee had Fethulls Gulen, who lived in the United States State.
Additionally, the Erdogan partners allowed that the doors can be interrupted and the Americans directly.
The United States checked all the claims in his address, refused to send Gulena and recommended to change the ton.
The last statement by the representatives of Gossip to this account was called at the time of the visit of Erdogan in San Petersburg at the past Sunday.
However, this does not stop the President of Turkey - that is deeply insisting on her, and also gives the requirements to others of their western partners.
"Ankara stops to comply with its migration agreement with Europe if Brussels does not have the date of cancellation of visa limits for Turkey citizens," said the Minister of Turkey on the affairs of the EU, Omer Chelico, on 9 August.
He said that the change of Ankara in the anti-terrorism law, as the EU requires, will threaten European own security.
Note that 1 August, Vice-Chairperson Germany Zigmar Gabriel needed to stop the load of Europe from the promises of opening the border for migrants to facilitate the visa regime from the EU.
His words were answered to the corresponding statement of the head of the MID Turchia Mevolta Chaudscholu.
Another promulgation statement of Chauschlol made in the past, allowing Turkey to go out of NATO.
The Turkish MID head did not exclude that the country would consider the possibility of retirement from the alien if he had not met from him expected support.
The decision to enhance cooperation with Russia in the defence area is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries who cooperate with foreign States in the defence area - they take missiles", said Chauschhol to the Anadolu Agency.
He said that Turkey must now establish its own defence system based on its technologies and cooperate with other countries.
"Turkey has still tried to cooperate with NATO countries, but the results were not satisfied, and we were looking for others," said the Minister.
Experts believe that this is all about the serious differences of Turkey with the West and the transition of the country to the East.
Head of the International Political Expert Institute of Eugene Minchenko believes that Regipe Erdogan is now leading to its game and could not go to a western conflict.
He has a lot to be linked to the West and to the point of business, and from the point of view of the military (Turkey is a member of the NATO), so I think that Erdogan will try to balance with the western relationships.
Although, of course, the Americans would be better to see the full obedience of this post," Iaf.ru expert explained.
He said, not only that after the statements of the Turkish leader (or the unpaymented compensation of the EU, on the demand of an unvisibility space with Europe and the extradition of Guinea from the United States) will be given to him.
"The Regiment of Erdogan is confronted with the deterioration of relations and with America, and with the European Union, which they will give it just on humanitarian matters, on the dictatorical methods of country management and so further", believes Minchenko.
Head of the Centre for Political Information Alexy Muhin allows the President of Turkey to change its views in Russia as it would be possible.
Eight months ago, Erdogan made a extreme strict position towards Russia, and in all ways, he searched for goodness in the West.
At least a small time, the situation was changed to the contradiction.
Garanties that after some time the President of Turkey did not rechange its priorities.
I think Erdogan has entered a slight diplomacy.
He will try to get the maximum benefit for himself,” believes Mohammed.
He believes that the main task of the President of Turkey is to maintain the political authority in the country today, and that the need for Russia and the partnerships with the Gulf Putium to remain supported by the United States.
Turkey also needs EU and the United States that control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
The agreement with Turkey will therefore be achieved," is the expert.
Another point of view is the head of the Asian Centre and the Middle East Anna Glasov.
Now the relations between Turkey and the EU and the United States are sufficiently pressed, and it is in the first way related to the internal policy carried out by Erdogan.
I think that this crisis will be decreased, and in the background of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to reload policies as well as in the Middle East and in Russia.
Nevertheless, the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, states that they are willing to change their position on the whole issue of Syria, to resolve the relationship with Israel, is an active political partnership with Iran,” explained AiF.ru Glozavu, which allows the next step of Argentine to normalize relations with Egypt.
In her words, the policy now carried out by Erdogan is the return to the course of an external policy concept which followed Turkey before the Arab Revolutions.
"In that case, " no problem with neighbors" Turkey began to develop its relationship with the Middle East and the Asian region very actively.
The very lucky visits of the President of Turkey in Russia and Africa have been ongoing.
The vector of the external policy will therefore develop and contribute to the strengthening of Turkey ' s positions in both regional and international airlines," is an expert.
The Global Committee believes that Turkey will be incredibly difficult to return to the previous relations with the EU, and now the question is whether the EU will begin to respond evilly to Turkey, which could be opening borders for migrants and establish the same serious problems for Europe.
Advertising the youngest doctors: calls to new collective protesters
The representatives of the young doctors requested the profession to authorize new collective protests in their discussion on the new working treaty.
The Committee on Teenagers (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is intended to request its full Board to support more collective protests since the beginning of September.
JDC said that the Ministers could not respond to the working treaty.
The young doctors and medical students in July voted for the cancellation of the working treaty agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58 per cent of his members who participated in the secret vote.
In a letter to the members published in Twitter on Friday night, President JDC Ellen McKourt said that the Government had continued to silence on the matter which she said to have led to the rejection of the working treaty.
She said: "Bearing in mind the situation, the leader of JDC proclaimed for rejecting the proposed new working treaty fully and called for official negotiations on all your matters."
In response to the silence of the Government of JDC, he has requested a formal request to the BMA Council for an external meeting in order to adopt the unprecedented collective protest expansion programme, starting from September early.
The argument was that young doctors had participated in six income this year, including the first general exciting in the history of the State Health Service.
The leader of the young doctors of BMA, Dr. Joan Malavan, left after voted on the cancellation of agreed conditions of the working treaty, recommended by the BMA.
He said to BMA members that the treatment was good that should take during the meetings in the prevention of the vote of 54.000 young doctors and medical students.
After the vote by the Minister of Health, Jeremy Hunt said that this working treaty would be used for medical workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: "Aliance wicked"?
It was a jacket that finished the crisis.
The Russian leaders and Turkey met on Tuesday to smile and announce the official end of the eighth-year-old war and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomed his Turkish colleagues in the shipping hall of St. Petersburg, I have a sustainable impression that Ankara wants to be more reconciliated.
It was the leader, yeah.
But Mr. Putin's smile appeared to be smiling, and if he soon removed warmly even according to his own detention standards.
Regiment Tyip Erdogan, in contrast to this, has often spoken about his "good friend" five times, according to one report.
I lost my account.
He also promised that the relationship with Russia would return not only to their crew level, but even above.
On the next day, a newspaper described the acts of Mr. Erdogoan as if nothing wrong would ever happen.
I think his enthusiasm would be back.
But the swimming shock from Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader did not forget anything.
In fact, the first reason for the crisis was that he mentioned in the entry comments: Turkey had slaughtered the Russian destroyer on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction at this time was instinct.
Mr. Putin was disappointed by a angry tired by accusing Ankara to attack Moscow.
The tribulation was even more stronger than the predicted friend.
Resurrection of real trust will be difficult, probably not possible.
The Russian public view has also changed since November.
During the months, controlled media States have conducted an overwhelming, accurate invasion against Ankara.
It was immediately shown that the turk must be considered guilty in all.
The most serious accused of the representatives of the Supreme Leader was that the family of Mr. Ergotan had been engaged in the illicit trade of oil from the Syrian region controlled by the Islamic State.
He denied it decisively.
But in San Petersburg, it was an official signal that was time to move forward.
At the end, the meeting was only because Mr. Putin received an apologize he requested President Advocate.
Russia could pretend the victory of its nature.
For Ankara, the declaration of transfusion is clear.
First, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get, after he was almost rejected from his post in the last month when he tried to turn.
The terror attacks against Turkey were clearly shocked.
There is also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions shocked strongly — especially the ban on shooter flights, which generally brings millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number was almost 90 per cent.
As regards Russia, Terrorists and Curter companies here, of course, feel comfortable when the flights are finally renewed.
They put the end of the season on the Mediterranean sea.
And even this week, the public television predicted more sweet fruit and fruit than the Turkish import of agricultural products would be allowed again.
"Turists there, fellow guests back here," stated in the Wednesday newspaper.
But the visit also had a further political value for Moscow.
Ankara's evil in the West because it is considered a weak answer to the trial of turning.
Add to this the long-term injury of Mr. Putin, which is trying to use the western and to gradually destroy Turkey's connection with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, wins bonus balls with Ankara for calls for supporting the elected authorities after the attempt of public movement.
You mean, this is the date for Moscow, who has its own deeply endured fear of the change of the regime.
Thus, the summit in this swimming park on the sea coast let Russia and Turkey imagine that one analysis describes me as "the wicked": two countries who feel themselves rejected and dismissed by the West united forces.
However, despite public reconciliation, these two remains significant.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently been a peace-maker, but where Russia and Turkey support the oppositions.
It may be said that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, while two Presidents gave the press conference, they did not even touch this topic.
The President of Turkey was wisely avoided the answer to the question of their differences while Mr. Putin wished to focus on them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find the general language of Syria.
But after months of open enemy, and taking into account the full possibility of the disaster when the NATO member of Turkey has slaughtered the Russian reactor, it is clearly better that two leaders have been talking at least again.
The Kingdom Bank of Skotland will disappear for customers beyond Skotlandia
Brad RBS should be noted to the role of the bank office, as the executive director of the bank.
The Kingdom Bank will disappear for customers outside the Skotlands.
Ross McEvan told BBC that the BBC Skotland was linked to global bank ammunitions.
Bank left them since he almost moved eight years ago and needed to save him.
In that period, the Brenda Strategy used RBS to protect other consumer credit burdens.
He was supported by millions of funds of Pansor International Sport, from the Cub of six nations to the Champion of Wilblondo Andy Murrey.
But now it was decided that it would be appropriate to allow more national burdens to enter the first plan.
The Kingdom Bank will be used with the Skotlands clients, but it will not be started.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the main office and the funds, will be changed to NatWest.
Brendan Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller, smaller bank services for private persons who have more influence — Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. MacEvan was interviewed during the tour of customers and staff in Invernessshire.
He said BBC Skotland: "Brand RBS will finally become our investment burden and our staff, because we are now more to be the bank of burden."
As the bank itself became a global burden, RBS became a global burden.
I now say that we don't have global efforts, we have local efforts.
Each of these burdens will represent something different in its population groups, and our staff will work with customers under these burdens.
RBS had already stated that it would not be to continue its spent support of the six-national Cube, and he would build a profile of different burdens in the launching of sports.
"It's a suitable time for us to move the burden bank, as (we asked us) as we focus on the improvement of the customer bank?" said the Executive Director.
It would be very cynician three years ago if we would say we're going to be a wonderful bank for customers and close all these burns.
But with the work we've done, focusing on the needs of customers, not on our own, I think you're seeing a lot of changes.
We can return these burns, so I think it's a suitable time.
Frankie Dectors reached to 3000 winners in Newmark to Pristige
Doctors disrupted shampanics, after the double in New Market, it is slaughtered to 3000 wins
Jacques Frankie Dectory has achieved his 3000-year British victory in Newmark at Tuesday.
He came to this extraordinary note using his second victor on his home road, to the Pristy, trained by John Gosdan.
The 45-year-old Italian is a six-year-old shock, which has reached this extraordinary mark in the shoes.
He should be following Sir Gordon Richards, Dougom Smith, Lester Piggot, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-class champion of the heavy doctor, who previously wins to Ghayyar, said, "This is something special."
I'm very excited because my family's here too.
I'm so glad that this happened in New York, so I've been here 30 years ago.
This is not a great light event, it is not Royal Ascot, it's a normal evening of 20,000 people.
I'm free from business, and I'm very unconscious.
The doctors accept approximations when they bring the Proposal after the victory
Two shocks reached such a note in shocks with obstacles: the champion of Richard Johnson and the upper twenty-five champion of Sir Antony McKy, who had more than 4300 wins for the record carriage.
Lester Piggot, Nine Darby winner, 4493 winners in the carriage
Franky is one of the best jokes in modern times and is unsurprisable that he reached the mark that so few had reached.
He's a style and strong, but his tactical shock is different from others in the wedding room.
He was a magnificent representative for scatchs, his enthusiasm and carrism in the sports year.
I told Franky a few weeks ago to Eps, he would have brought 6000 winners if it wouldn't be just a shock of weekends and big shocks!
And if serious, Franky has brought winners in Britain a large part of the 30 years, which is good to see.
He's a powerful person that's good for the British scacks, but moreover he's an incredible shock.
Frankie Dectory replied this extraordinary note of the company's voluntary cousin with the horse
From the finishing finish to the strikes, Franky Dectory is a symbol of British shoes for two decades.
They were flews and falls.
Many winners of large scannings, including his famous " Great Seed" in Ascot in 1996, also survived aviation catastrophus and had been disabled because of the end.
Three years ago, he first faced difficulties when he returned after the six-month dismissation, but showed the great will to leave skeptic calls and return to the form.
And maybe he wasn't done anymore — the doctors previously said that I would like to continue to participate in the raising, at least until 50 years of age.
Putin is a head of the Sergey Ivan
The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, unexpectedly released his head of the Sergey Ivana Administration.
Ivan was part of the confidence neighborhood of Putin for many years.
This 63-year-old was now appointed to the representative of the Environment and Transport matter.
The Declaration from Kremell claims that Putin " had ordered to release Ivan from his duties of the head of the Russian president " but did not call the reason.
The Vice-President of Ivano, Anton Weino, since 2012.
Mr. Weino, 44, former diplomat.
He finished the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (IMO) in Estonia Talline in 1972 and served in the Tokio Embassy.
Afterwards he was the head of the President's protocol and Government instrument, reports on the Web site of Kremell (Russian).
In the appointment, he said, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important task of the Administration is to support your activities as heads of States in order to develop law and control on how your instructions are implemented.
Putin reported a Russian TV canal on Friday that Ivan asked him to release it from this post and recommend Vino to replace it.
Does the Smile Become?
That's the step that gave Moscow back.
Sergey Ivan has been one of the closest partners of Vulmir Putin and served as well as the Council Security Service, the CB.
He was one of the most powerful people in the country as head of the administration.
At the meeting with President Putinus, which was shown by the public television, both men said that the Head of the Administration had gone on their own desire.
However, despite the smiling of the camera, it was little people who believed here — especially now, directly before the parliamentary elections.
So that's the unexpected consequences of any struggle for authority?
Not until anyone knows it.
However, the official statement is that a person with whom ever acted as a potential President had immediately wanted to manage the Russian environmental policy was met with a great sketchism.
In the comments of the Portin on the website of Kremella, Ivan said: "This is the truth, at the beginning of 2012, I requested you to trust me in this very complicated position, even if it could be a problem post for four years.
Well, I was the Chief of the President's 4 years and eight months.
Ivan entered the post in December 2011.
Before he worked as Vice-Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and the former member of the State Security Council of the CBB, as well as Mr. Putin.
At the end of the 1990s, when Putin was the head of the Federal Security Service (FBI), who had arrived to change the CGB, Ivan was appointed by its Vice-Chairman.
When Putin arrived to the authority, he called Ivan, including five people whom he mostly trusted.
Sometimes Ivan was considered to be the President of Russia after the second deadline of Putin, as the third time for Putin would oppose the Constitution.
However, the task was taken by another close partner of Putin, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became the Prime Minister before returning to the presidency only three and half years later.
The star Search as a Criminal, Thomas Gibson is released after the dragon with the producer.
Gibson was a member of the show breakfast in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce series, have announced its release in a joint declaration.
Gibson, who played the Special Agent Aaron Hotchera, regrets to the Friday before he was declared that he was dismissed.
There was a creative difference in food and divorce in views.
I'm sorry that it happened," he said in his statement.
Detail how Gibson's personal will be extracted from the show that is expected to follow the FBI agents' teams later, according to the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios statements.
The 54-year-old actor, who had played the main role in the Darma and Greece network, was in the show of the first season in 2005.
"I love "I send as a criminal" and I contributed to my heart and soul in him for the last twelve years," said Gibson in his statement published on Friday.
I hoped to be present before the end, but that's not possible now.
I would just like to thank the scenarios, producers, actors, our great team, and the most important, the best worshipers of which show could just dream.
It is noted that the show returns to its 12th session on 28 September.
Note: Fishes were landed in the Banph garden
A man from Banfa was helped to identify the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bayn believes that 75 fish could be skins left by water mortality.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the sea, put the shooting of this shock in Perskop in hope that someone could swim light on the appearance of twelve fish.
Quinsferry Crossing: The Bridge is now connected to Fif
The project for 1.35 billion feet must now be completed until 2017
Engineers connected the northern swimming pool and the Winsferry Crossing Viraid, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fif.
It's the first of the four shoes between the shoes of the pounds, which are now on the end of all three pillars of the bridge.
The Fif Bridge Section now is 600 meters long and weighs 300,000 tonnes.
There were 10,000 tons and 20,000 tons of beetone and 46 ten tens of the bridge.
The project for 1,35 billion feet must now be closed to 2017.
The Minister of Economy of China Brown has visited the area today and was including the first ones who walked from the ground to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of Quinsferry Crossing.
We've all witnessed in engineering art in this project, where more than 30,000 tonnes of beetons were used only to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the shift between the visa and the bridge, it is a virtual operation using extremely accurate permissions to collect.
A total complex of about 79 per cent of the whole bridge at the place now, for the last section, the beton shoes are reflected in Russia today, which means that it is totally ready to switch up on the shock.
Michael Martin, director of the Forth Crossing Bridge Builders project, said, "The widespread shift for each bridge project is always a significant season.
This exciting project represents the most modern building art.
After installing the last section of the road tower and connecting it with the extensive Northern Pilote, we remained closed to the northern, or treated to the beach.
This was made by the shift of the northern approach to 700 miles south.
It was wide, and at the same time a very excellent operation.
The largest, since the glass of 222 meters long, weights about 6000 tonnes and should be slowed up to a 3 per cent of the cycle.
It was popular because the permissions on which the team worked were small — just a few miles [2 km] in every direction.
Happily, it's been very good.
Safety in Sale Molephre: Twelve men were willing to stay in the lives
Twelve men were 'going to stay alive' after they were cast out from a fishing vessel in England.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station was at 13:20 on the British summer in Friday, after the team had seen the occurrence in Salive Moelfra.
Three men from all forces tried to reach a safe place while their ship continued to walk.
"We saw their ships crossed close to them and predicted worse," said the rule of Moelfre Vince Jones' savings.
"Freely, until we went down into the water, the strong wind took him into the side of them," he added.
Two men were saved by a local fishing vessel, and a third man of 60 years of age was found unable and injured in the bomb without a rescue.
All of them were taken up on the board of the beach rescue and put to the rescue station.
Johns said, "The three men elected in the water was glad that they lived and were completely harmful.
The ship engine had an accidental switch, but he was somewhat shocked from a man who managed the ship when it was shocked.
Somebody cares of these guys today.
Pokemon Go, a good pursuit for health and happiness
To see how the world changes.
The fact that adolescents and children are no longer out on the street to play, pretending that their free time look at the screen, was a complaint of many in the past decades.
Pokemon Go dismiss people from wonderfulness and engages in some physical activity.
The time at the screen was markedly limited by television, then video graphics and recently smartphones.
It is so glad to see that technologies and activities on the street are not inter-exceptive.
I, of course, mean the full involvement of Pokemon Go, an annexe based on the initially established video games in the 1990s (in the result of the generated series of multifilms, game cards and other responses).
As well as many other pop cultures, this has lost the relevance of a few years before the new game was available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
The start in other countries was then detained in connection with the mass reloading of the servers.
In the following days, Pokemon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In two words, Smartphone games are going to search for Pokemons that follow GPS and, being discovered, they may be 'food' (focused on your phone) or 'Poymans'.
A generation played in the game, being younger, joined the full involvement, shutting out from the looks for.
In the United States, the game has increased significantly the number of steps passed by a normal person every day.
Cardiograms, annex for Apple Watch, which follows 35,000 users, recently reported that in two days since the start of the game, the number of persons that were monitored every day from 45 per cent to 53 per cent.
The company doesn't know who plays in Pokemon Go, it's just seeing the primary data of the level.
Many health-care campaigns that convinced people “in 30 minutes”, “shoot from wonder” and “speaking every day” have not found a call, because most health-care messages are disappointed and expressed to people who seem unfortunate.
Nevertheless, the importance of physical training cannot be underestimated.
Those who are regularly trained reduce the opportunities of development in cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps adjusting weight, high artificial pressure, diabetes and long list of advantages, too long to bring here.
But Pokemon Go's worthy is that she throws people on the street to do what they love.
Thus, there are three basiss for health: movement, swimming air, sunlight and joy.
Some people even bring new friends to their guests.
Of course, there are smells that are looking for what to be grateful.
Yeah, somebody can shoot on the door.
Well, what?
There's been a break.
Despite the applications for smartphones, such as the Fitbit could and before follow our physical activity, they did not give us a career for employment as the game was given.
The news is coming, and the use will be decreased with time.
However, because of the success, Pokemon has become more games that will combine applications and virtual reality with physical activity in a real world by helping many people to be more active, well-being and healthy.

Simone Bailz wins the gold of absolute primary in the women ' s genius
Forget the pressure.
Forget the shoes.
Simone Bails is unlawful for all this.
Dynamic on the opposite shock.
It's a lie.
He's on the floor.
It's a great world.
And now, finally, the Olympic Champion.
The 19-year-old American hymnist at the title of the Champion on the absolute primary date, enabled to pass between himself and the rest of the world to a convincing demonstration under the adjusted Olympic attention.
Her general bar 62.198 was sufficiently removed from the silver melinists and the Final Petterk Team, Ali Raisman and the Russian Brons Brons Mediterranean Ali Mustafin.
Bylez from the United States speaks on a hymnistical blue during the finish of the Future of Women ' s Future of Athletics in the 2016 Latvia Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Bylese became the fourth part of the American woman who wins the champion of absolute primary and the fifth, strengthening its reputation as the best of his generation and, perhaps, if any.
She was shocked when she showed her final ball and her long journey to that moment.
The achievement of this achievement is the same as the exclusively rare light boards, such as Michael Felps, which took up their types of sports to new heights:
Bylese has been in the past three years, housed in its sport, wining 15 measles of the world champion, including 10 golden programs, with such an exciting work love and accuracy that Mary Lu Retton was the largest genius that I ever saw.
One last test was expected in Brazil, not so much between Bayles and the rest of the area, as much between it and the load of higher expectations.
Any less than returning to the house of your family in Spring, Texas, with the holiness of gold meal, would be considered as an unjust expectation.
Simone Bailz from the United States, left and left, and Eli Raisman, after winning gold and silver, respectively in the finish of an individual woman ' s original premium on artistics in the Late Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, August.
Bylese paid the first gold on Monday, which became a fine akcourd for the private celebration of the National Collection Coordinator of Marta Caroli.
While Birds insisted that she had never observed in the future during his long path to the top, it was not exactly true.
part of her voluntary program, including its company passement, was established to a Latin American music, which would go directly as a house on the street outside the Olympic Arren Rio.
It's not a match.
The girl who has married her grandmother and grandmother, starting to walk with a child and opening the mother of Amy Burman’s train during the visit to the hall where Burman was training, became forced.
It has not played any of the absolute initialisations since summer 2013, a shipping pool, which should continue as far as the Bayles wanted.
Despite the small advantages received by Mustafin by two tours, it was a world.
The giant and voluntary training, where Bailz protects the name of the Champion of the world, is located in the garden.
She returned from 15.433 to January and ended from 15.933 to field.
Raisman was very slightly shocked with her until they were waiting for a final account — a clean formality — and the lips appeared around a blue red and blue wheels for the Bayles' eyes, when the sight that she had ever recorded in the album for extraction was carried out.
Raisman's statement was a small place for the four years ago when she shared the third place but lost the Mustafian burn on the Tay-Black.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, which the Americans called "Babbling" was a great advance.
She sent pools after its voluntary training, a return that sometimes seemed to be in question.
With regard to the Bayles, the 19-year-old twin has now been completely new:
Police: 3 victims of a series of murders were shot during the hearing of music in the car
Two women and the 12-year-old girls who died during the death attack during the first series of murderers of Phynicos in the last decade sit in the car, talked and heard music when they were shot, according to the police reports published on Friday.
Angela Roshel Layner, Stefani R. Elis and the daughter of Elise, Malia, were shot on 12 June when their car was equipped on the past.
The crimer has made about eight shots from the gun, standing with the passenger car, after shutting on another vehicle, is reported in the report.
The police claims that the three murder is not the result of the rape, since the offender has not taken $2,900 of an adult victim.
The representative of the police of Finicos, Sersan Jonathan Howard, said that the shooting was struck by investigators to check whether he had been linked to four previous attacks.
The total of seven people were killed and two other were assaulted by nine attacks in two most importantly Latin American regions within four months.
“ This happens in the living area before the house,” said Howard KPHO, the CBS branch, in the beginning of this month.
The suspected vehicles were used by a number of vehicles including the slow Nissan end of the 1990s, the black BMW and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The followers refused to reveal evidence that the attacks were linked to one of the same murderers.
Elise, 33, was hosted with wounds and later ended.
Lyner, 31 years old, and her daughter, Elis, Malia, died in the place.
The Witnesses told the police that there was nothing uncomfortable that they sit in a parking car listening to music.
The authorities also issued the police report on the shooting which was intended to be empty for half an hour before the third murder and that, as they believe, was the case of a serious murderer.
The followers found a shock and shooted a shooter from the sit and a shooting shooting.
Mother of a six-year-old child with microcephaly: "It's better."
As most of the children of six years, Edmund Pixivat loves drinks, games and, of course, his mother.
But different from the majority of his overseers, Edmud's microcephaly is the result of a genetic violation that his mother Elizabeth Pixvito had not known during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn’t do it.
I can't do that.
I didn't sign it.
What isn't true, surely you're signing this," she said.
She and her husband Vincent said that Edmund might never know them and that he couldn't even survive.
Some doctors even invited him to place it in a specialized treatment institution.
“ My first answer was, “I didn't think people do this yet”," explained Pixvito.
Edmund's walking through the driving.
Edward wasn't sit and drunk until he did three, and he's still not talking about it.
But he's slowly walking some stages.
He goes with bilateral help and shoots on the bicycle.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and sisters.
Elizabeth shows the jacket that Edmund's planned for "Good, get me.
"We're teaching him to the jesting language," said Pixivato CBS News.
But not just a common language of wheel — she says that Edmund has developed his own jars.
Microcephaly may result in a number of different circumstances: genetics, such as Edmud, infections during pregnancy of virus such as core and Zica.
Symptoms and prognosis may be significantly different.
It's too early to talk about how it will be said about those who are infiltrated by the Virus.
Psychologically remembers the emotional losses because of the undetermined future.
I've always said what's going on?
What's going on?
And she doesn't know yet.
I really didn't ask for prognosis all over my life, because I'm not waiting for someone really to tell me.
But Pixvito has a pleasant advice for the mother of children with born defects because of Zek.
It's gonna be better.
You know that everything will be better for you.
You'll love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, swimming swimming causes of saving work in Louisiana, Mississippi State
The strong rain and wide swimming swimming in Louisiano had the Governor to declare the emergency situation in Friday, while even more aircrafts are expected to fall in the state until the Saturday.
Many rivers on the south-east of Louisiana and South Mississippi have been out of the beaches and threatened to a wide range of aircraft after the extreme number of boats, reported the National Meteorological Service.

In South Alabam, the Defense in waiting for the invasion had worked until Friday, as the rain continued to go into the Mobile area.
The committee was close to Baton Rojo and the Amyt, close to Dean Springs, both in Louisiana, to set a prediction for the recursion of the flow level in the past weeks.
The symptoms Alek Crautman said that both rivers could shoot many houses in reserve areas near Baton-Roja.
He also said that the induction cut down in the arriving of the Assencean was a threat, as these rivers slowly slowly flee into the Morpas Lake.
Rica Tikfo, the southern border of the Mississippi State in Liberia (Lucian State), reached the higher levels that had been registered at 9 p.m. on Friday morning.
Saviors have still cut people from the ships of Amyt and Wilkinson in the south-west of the Mississippi State.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his passing were among the saved early in Friday at Gloster.
Hansford, 62 years old, says that the waters of Biver Crick, which are usually in more than 400 feet from his home, were fast up for night.
He said another passing that lives close to him warned him.
"We wake up, and the water continued to come," said Hansford.
She reached my pool level.
His wife said Hansford was the biggest shooting she saw for 48 years he lived here.
Hansford said he and all his members were disabilities, and he was the only one who can cry.
Hansford said that the savings officers had saved all three by means of the army carriage and brought them to the fire station in Gloster where they were hiding on Friday.

The strong rain and swimming streets have led to work to save people from the house in Tandipahoa and to abolish employment in five school districts, declared the authority.
WWL, CBS officer, reports that the Consequent Tanjipaho had reported about 200 houses.
The people were evacuated in two churches, but they are both shooted now.
The Chairman of the Chairman of Robbie Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven home animals in high water.
The hosts were opened in Amyt and Hammond City to accept those evacuated.

In the city of Hammond, some two decades of streets were closed from high levels of water, and the fisheries were available to the people in hope that they would keep water away from houses and undertakings.
“ The last large invasion we had was in March,” said the city manager Leycy Random.
This is on the way to become a similar event.
In the Mississippi district of Harrison, the Chief of the Emergency Service Rupert Lays reported that the rainy was continuing to go to the Mexican Valley.
In his words, several houses were registered as stolen on Thursday, but no one was registered on Friday.

Maggie Brown, 6, "Deceased Boats" remains in the lives after the bomb in Filadelphia
The police reports that Philadelphia was shot at a six-year-old boy, registering the second shoot in the city on that week.
Grandfather and her grandmother identified him for the CBS Philadelphia as Magje Brown.
Her grandmother and her grandmother said that Brown received a number of firearms, including his legs, feet, hands and animals, but he was aware of him when they moved to the hospital.
"He was so much enough, his little body was deleted by guns," said his grandmother Delors Melandes station.
I can't believe it.
The child is in the hospital in a critical state and has survived several operations.
The family told the station that he was expecting to change.
He had to go to the first class to the local primary school.
Braun was one of the four people who were shot in the Quartet of Germantown.
They also shooted in three men: two 29 and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in a critical state; other two victims were registered in a stability state, according to CBS of the Philadelphia.
The station reports that the child was shocked on the front of the car near the 29-year-old age.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police is investigating whether some of the injured men could be shooted.
The followers reported the CBS of the Philadelphia that it seems to be a shock between several armed people.
The hills from half-automatic weapons inscribed by different poly-automatic employees have made action.
It seems to have been a permanent battle.
There were shoes on the street, both sides of the throat.
As a result, there were several armed fighters, and they were actively involved in the shooting,” reported the police station of Philadelphia Anne Dynoldy.
Many houses and cars in this area have also been entered.
There were no arrests, and the police, according to the report, is launched by video monitoring cameras.
Another 6-year-old child, a girl, was inflicted in the hands of the Sunday, playing before her house in the West Oak Lane area.
She's resurrected, and the police's still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simon, Gabe and Larry?
That's what I call the woman's Olimpy Collection for the Gymnastics of this year and for a number of reasons.
First, I was at each Latvia Olympice since 1984, and the United States never were so householding.
And second: There are three key roles in this collection: Simon Bails, Gaby Dukkoy and Larry Ernandes, who have already inspired so many white girls.
The collection of this collection, complemented by Ali Ryan, is a Jewish, and Madison Coshan, who is Catholic, makes all pride.
This collection seems finally like America.
This also strengthened the black and Latin American women’s presence on the top of this sport.
For the past four years, a woman's giant number one was an African.
In the past year, Simon and Gibby were No.1 and No2.
It's powerful.
At the past, the Olympic Gabi Duclad was unexpected by the Olympic Champion, and the United States welcomed.
The world could now be an unbelievable witness of the three-craft Champion of the World Simone Bails, Dukkoy and Larry Ernandes, which are unexpected but yet virtuous genital training.
Simon became a fourth American ship that wins gold in a women’s individual absolute initiality.
And a colleague for the collection of Alice Riesman paid silver.
We become a Witness of this kind of sport, but it doesn't look like that in the hymnistical sections throughout the country.
Simone, Gabe and Lori have all chosen the same way as Eli and Madison to form the Olimpiade Collection.
They're the "final fifth" because the next Olimpiade Collection for Gymnastics will have only four gymnastics in the team, and that's the last year of Marta Caroli's training.
But indeed, the geninastic is a road sport, and the gymnastics are trained first in private gymnastic clubs supported by parents who pay the value of education, awareness, traveling, forms, contributions to the rebuilding, guest payment (for trainers and their families) and the list continues.
Most of these gymnastic clubs are located in rich reward areas that may support this business.
These clubs are where the jinnators receive everything from their training, and that is a precious and long-term responsibility for the jinnist family.
Amy Burman, trainer Simone Bails, and Maggie Hanni, trainer Lory Ernandes, both trained their sports channels since they accepted the hymnastics.
We need to create more acceptable and available training to the communities of the unexpected number of young girls inspired by Simon, Gabe and Lori.
I found my gymnastic fund 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already offered free and disappointment of hymnastic employment in Harlem for more than 15,000 city youths (in the main, black and Latin Americans) and have established national and international champions.
In September, we will expand in Detroit (my family city) to provide a high quality genius of young people who will be able to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
The geniusism develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as sustainability to enduring work, disciplination and sustainability for mind.
This is a positive impact on good health, success in school and work throughout the life.
That is the inspiration of this collection to send thousands of girls to have a gymnastic, and that's beautiful.
Sporting is so important, especially for girls.
That's a great time now.
Thank you, Simon, Ellie, Lori, Gabe and Madison for this serious demonstration of the Genetic Force in the winning of the command of the Olimpiade gold and for the motivation of so many different girls to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
The young doctors received a declaration of further availability following the refusal of the proposal of Jeremy Hunt
The Ministers hoped to conclude the changes agreed to a changed treaty with the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of 37,000 young doctors who had participated in the vote was rejected.
In July, Hunt publicized plans to introduce the treaty, said that the NHS was on the "near land" and any delay of the delay would damage staff and patients.
The first young doctors are transferred to a new treaty, which includes changes in work at night and weekends to improve service at an emergency time.
Dr. Elen McCott, Chairman of the Committee of Youth Dr. BMA, said last night in the statement: "The young doctors still have severe concerns on the proposed treaty, in particular that he asks for the crisis of workforce and that he cannot apply to all doctors fairly."
Only eight weeks before the first physician group was transferred to a new contract, needed progress and time.
The attempt to authorize the negotiations has been gathered, and sometimes the Government has been fully calm.
This is despite the promise of Jeremy Hunt last month that his door is always open.
" The Jords of Hunt must act now, encouraging the introduction and react to the threats of the young doctors.
If he doesn't do this, the young doctors are inevitable that they are ready to organize afterwards.
The last article at the end of April led to a delay of about 13,000 planned operations and 100,000 nurses received, while nurses and advisers were subjected to the replacement of doctors in the pickling line.
The Ministers hoped to conclude the changes, agreed with a changed treaty with the leaders of the British Medical Association.
The WMA wants to make a better payment for 54,000 young doctors who will be under the treaty.
Daniel Mortimer, Director General NHS Employers, called the youngest doctors not to continue to smile.
Mortimer said: "The guests have not reached little or nothing, but are pressured to work at the front of the teams and services, and cause concerns, physical pain and disorders to the patients, the seats and their families."
In the past two months we spoke to the Committee of Teenagers, together with the Department of Health and others, positively responded to their fears relating to the role of hospitals and corporate information policy.
The workers hoped that the continuing support for other important topics, such as staff distribution, flexibility, additional education for those returning to the carriage, the value of training, mutual recognition of the training plan, academic departure and gender differences in medical payment, were aware of how serious employees, the Health of England and the Department of Health were to meet the conditions achieved by the WMA in November, February and May.
Preparation for 2 pounds per day may reduce the threat of heart attack
Thousands of patients with heart attack will be used by 2 pounds per day after the authorities recommended to give it more and more than a long time.
The anti-protectional precaution of ticgrelor reduces the risk of repeated attacks for persons with heart diseases.
The preparation has already been designated for 12 months after a heart attack, a lower risk of insult or a new attack.
The NEC National Health Service recommended that people give it for four years to continue to eliminate the risk of heart-respective problems.
However, now the NEC National Health Service recommended that people give it for four years to continue to eliminate the risk of heart-respective problems.
A heart attack occurs with about 1400,000 people in England annually, and four of them have another attack or insult.
The heart attacks and insults have resulted in the recovery of grass materials in the shoes of artry and the formation of the skin.
If the smell is cut into part, it may be a cause of the transfusion that blocks the access to the heart and causes heart attack.
And if the thromboe moves, he can move through the blood flow and lock blood into the brain, calling insults.
People who have already come to one attack are more risked to get another.
Chicagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold by Brilica, reduces the risk that makes the transit less credible.
The NICE instruction project, published today, recommends that people give 90 mg of ticgrer for 12 months and then 60 mg with aspirin two times a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, the Director of the NICE Medical Review Centre, said: “Over the existence of effective methods for secondal prevention of some four people that have already been a heart attack, there is another heart attack or insult, often with destructive consequences.”
Repeat fears may have a significant negative impact on the quality of human life.
There is evidence that a ticgrellar in combination with the aspirin effect in a reduction in the risk of following heart attacks and insults to people who have already brought a heart attack.
We are pleased to have the opportunity to increase the treatment options available to many thousands of people who are ready to use it.
As information on the effectiveness and safety of ticgrellar — especially the risk of blood — has been limited for three years, the instruction project does not recommend treatment over that period.
The CCC ownership culture allows to promote the flexibility of the vote accounts in the Islamic regions
Mrs. Taher-Hamelets Lutfuur Rahman was discarded from posts in the past year because of corruption, with a full account of the Government
Political adjustment culture has been closed to the eye that the total flexibility of the votes in the mulman communities had been covered on information about the destructive report of the Government, which has been published today.
The former member of the Office of Ministers, Sir Eric Piklas, is inflicted with the criticism of the police, the election observers and the administration of the cities for ignoring the evidence of violations of the elections because of "extreme feeling about racial property and religion".
The former secretariat of local communities, now the anti-corruptive king, reported that the fear of electoral elections was so strong that the police had to be allowed to put borders beyond the borders of the election places to protect the feared electioners.
He proposes that the electioners take a personal provision to prove who they are when they vote.
At this time, the electors should only specify their name and address.
The report is even proposed to put the smells on the fingers of people when they set up their offices in order to exclude that someone can vote two times.
The best protection should be provided to observers, said Sir Eric.
It calls for a major access to documents of the local council and decisions adopted by informal committees or working groups.
“It is not only to protect the electoral fair, but also to protect the local government from the more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes with her,” he said.
The report was ordered to Duning Strategy, as a result of the vote in Tauer Hamlets in East London.
In the past year, a special court that considers election issues decided that Mr. Luftur Rahman had to be dismissed from posts on a long list of corruption and illicit activities.
The Court found that Rahman had “ciniciously expressed” the religious feelings of his Islamic community and urged them to silence their critics, accusing them of racism and Islamicity.
Rahman, as he said, "he said his campaign, based on the responsibility of the Muslim believers to vote for him."
To 300 votes were questioned or resulted in the personality when a person voted, representing someone else.
Sir Eric said that there were witnesses of torment throughout the country.
He expressed special concerns regarding mourning with the e-mail vote, in which senior members of the Islamic community, as they reported, pressures on people to vote for their selected candidate.
Mr. Eric, on the photo, made several recommendations on the cleaning of the vote system, including the requirement to make personality certificate to prove who you are.
The report states: " The pressure of some vulnerable communities of ethnic minorities, in particular women and youths, is presented in order to vote for elderly, especially in the communities of Pakistan and Bangladesh.
"The fear that... public institutions have closed their eyes to such a behavior because of the excessive sensibility of the political adjustment on ethnical property and religion."
Sir Eric gave 50 recommendations for the cleaning of the system, including the elimination of political activists from the work of posting officers for vote to stop the “collection of votes”.
The report also calls on the temporary checks at the registration in order to prevent the use of the election list for immigration and privileges.
The option is considered to require the voters to claim a person's approval before the vote.
Use deceased smells on the fingers of people when they leave their burns to prevent someone to vote two times.
Systemic checks of nationality to ensure that they have the right to vote.
Introduction of a three-year-old vote on applications.
Delete political participants and activists from work with full votes and convergences with e-mail vote.
To give the police authority to establish borders around the election places.
Amend the law to facilitate the proclamation of the accused persons in fear in accordance with the Act of 1983.
Delete illegal photos on the elections.
Exemption for the English only to be used in elections (excluding Wells).
Enhance education to ensure that the staff makes voters go to the building one.
Sir Eric is illly attacked by the city police, claiming that it was "repectually" that no criminal accused was sentenced after the case of Taher Hamlets.
"The Sudow that considers the elections has dismissed Luthfur Rahman and his agent for the long list of corruptions and illicit action," he reported.
He was acknowledged in the absence of a reasonable suspicion — a criminal standard of evidence — on a number of basis.
He also criticizes the unreasonable " verifications for the chambers " offices of the Cities Administrations Registration.
Sir Eric stated: "The first decision of the court in Tauer-Hamelets was a sign of trial.
Our nation has the honourable inheritance as the mother of the parliamentary elections, and however, the proliferation of electoral fraud and the decline of certain bodies are threatening this good reputation.
Cate and other two of the Olympics of Olimpiade in Rio
The Olympics of 2016 in Rio were in the Rio this week with the smile of the French bicycle Paullin France-Prevo, which, as it occurred, seemed to be like a herogy of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic Games is not the only sporting channel that struggle for gold this summer, which could be honored by their own famous double, at least, according to the social communications.
So, at the honor of J.G. Rio and all the famous people present on our screens, the FEMAIL had a list of olimpiers with more than the surface of the Hollywood Stars.
Guest and bottle: Member of the United States Travel team Brady Ellison, the left, compared with Leonardo DiCapero since he was a child
In addition to the bicycle of Kate, many online people were able to tell how a certain shop could be the closest of Leonardo DiCaporo's superstar.
The member of the U.S. M. Brady Ellison was the cause of a uragan in Twitter, after his images appeared as a fearful as a Wall Street star.
And in fact, the cheese learned about the lack of sociality and acknowledged that he heard that he was like Leo since he was a child.
"I'm not personally seeing a large part, maybe otherwise race on the face," said Brady Huffington Post.
"He's an appreciative guy, so I think it's a compromise."
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 will, uncertainly, be further indicated in this year: the remarkable comparison between the British Greek Deserford and the popular Nila Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnastic Alia Mustafin, with its great expressive eyes, is the exact copy of the Cuban and American Pearl Gloria Estefan.
And in the South African Cameron Van der Burga’s basin, Hora Matt Morrison was compared to the star for many years.
In turn to an unexpected one, this user believes Nathan is a "sporting version" of the "Nachala" actor.
Another long-term comparison was between the tennisist Rafaelom Nadar and the actor Josh Harnett, who could be able to admire the same heavy burns and smells.
The silver melinist of Russian Eury Ethimous can not only be shocked with sweet hair and light hair as the actor Annalin McCord, as Nathan Adrian from the US team, as the fans say, "the sporting version of Joseph Gorgon Lewitt".
Dark Women: The star of Hoop Solo, the left, and the actor Jennifer Carpenter from Deckster, right, have the same shape of face and eye
Not only: one of the Twitter users was very pleased that others also had seen the path
Created theory: According to this user, there may be a reason to be seen on the basis of the externality of this couple
One Twitter user recently returned to a website to generate his reward that "the island's Internet thinks that Hoppe Solo and Jennifer Carter are actually identical".
In fact, the star of the U.S. football and the actors of Dexter have incredibly similar forms of face and eye.
Other popular comparisons were included in Carry Walsh Jennings and her sweet, close to the identical smile of Lora Liny, and the winned gold meal of Gabe Duglaw, which can swear a beautiful wide smell that seems to be the sweet of the "The Success Success" Gabriel Yunion.
The commenter of the CBC Olympica is sorry for the Chinese pool "death as a pornography."
Analysis of Bayron McDonald's fourth place at the end of 14-year-old Ay Yanhahn on the Women ' s free style 4h200m in the middle of the CBC to the direct transmission of the Olimpía
The Canadian public company CBC was condemned to apologize after one of its comments said that the 14-year-old Chinese plug was as a war and "death as a sweet" during the sweet.
The commenter Bairon McDonald thought that his microphone was disabled when he began to express his own view at the end of the financial woman's stage of 4 to 200 meters of free style.
It could be heard as McDonald, who joined the CBC's comments to "delete her color," said, "The 14-year-old Chinese kid has cut meat, baby."
A lot of sweet, old as a shock, died as a sweet.
Thank you for it.
The Chinese powder, Ay Yanchan, 14 years old, slowed the second stage of staff at 1:57.79 to 1.61 seconds less than the Canadian Taylor Rack, allowed Canadians to remove the displacement from China.
The Canadian authors quickly reacted to the network after the tone and the use of expressions were shocked
Emmitt McFarleyn tweeted: "Does the CBC Dictator just just said that 14-year-old pills died as a sweet?"
This idiot didn't understand that they were still in the eternal."
About Ai Younghan from China in the finish of a woman's east of 4h200 m, he said, "Thet is a small 14-year-old Chinese kid, was a meat, baby."
The criticism of Twitter immediately violated Bayron McDonald, which many called him to let it.
Twitter users did not stop when they heard how uncomfortable Bairon McDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradise wrote: #ByronMacDonald.
You're representing CBC and Canada and make us like a racist cubes. #disgusted.
Shortly after that, Scott Russell, who gave the CBC transfer, declared directly for the comments of McDonald, said: "We are asking for forgiveness that the comments on the swimming explanation were in the eterne."
It was an unexpected word. We're sorry that it happened.
The UNHCR concluded that more than 90 persons were excused to respond to this statement
The commenter Scott Russell had to apologize for the face of McDonald
CBC then copied and sent an excuse to more than 90 other Twitter users who wanted to comment on McDonald's comments
The televisory was also urged to apologize and publish the statement.
We are sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to leave the eterne.
Last night, we were operating to apologize for our slaughterers in a direct ether and our signators in the société.
By clarity, the comments of Bayron refered to the explanation, not to it as to the personality.
And yet it was an inadequate and unexpected choice of words, and Bairon is very regretted about what he said.
On Thursday, McDonald was accused of a direct eternity and tried to clarify his comments, saying that he did not think that his words were terroristized as an attack on personality.
"I would like to use the moment to apologize for the comments I made last night after a woman's stage," he said at the translation of the Olympic Games in CBC.
'I talked about the shelter, not on her personal.'
'I think it's not to be undermined by no respect, and I'm very sorry'.
The purchaser of Primark was depressed by a woman who had uncertainly illustrated the low whites through the shop
The purchaser didn't know where to take care of some woman to illustrate the strikes on the stage with the shops through Primark.
Whatever worse, she illustrated how she looked in them, put them up and put it back to the field.
She continued to search and finally died four couples of lower whites in the Bowerie Place Trade Center in Fallston.
The Primark Trade Center of Boubery Place in Falkstone, where women had illustrated tricotative strikes before they returned to the field
The mother of the two children, Jenny Davidson, who was at the time in the shop, said that after the example of the underlying white, the woman "covered and left out of the shop and didn't buy anything".
She said, "They couldn't believe in what they saw."
She took a pair of strikes with the shoes, removed his own shoes and shoes and their assignments.
"It wasn't trying to find some hot place to do that -- she was just standing there, unfortunately."
"It's all up when she took the strike again, and they seemed to haven't liked her because she put them back to the field."
She did the same with three other couples before finally decided that there was nothing that she would liked, again and out.
"It doesn't seem to be careful who looked for her, or that she thought about a man who would finally buy these bodies she illustrated."
The 33-year-old Jenny Davidson said, "It's the contrary to think that someone's going to take home a body that somebody else has already shooted, and they weren't buried."
The event occurred on Thursday.
Davidson adds: "I'm going to conclude that the staff, in the entire visibility, tried to remove these objects from the sale, after she went out, and so better."
"I wouldn't want to come home with a new couple of women's murders and find out that the other woman's jobs and cut them out, and they weren't tired."
The representative Primar reported: "Primark knows what happened in our business in Falloston on Tuesday 9 August."
All items on which it is said were extracted from the sales.
How to protect himself from a gun by using a magic claw
The surrounding world is dangerous, but it's a video from Dailymail.com, perhaps helping you make it a little more secure for you.
We talked to Ron Mizrachi, a master of the Crue Magic Federation in New York, to find out how to do with armed players in close distance.
If you're in front or behind you, this video will show you how to shoot his weapons.
If you go back, according to the Mizrachi, the first thing you need to do is to turn back so that you have seen the attacker and "free the fire line".
Then you will smell a weapon between your throat and your shoe, before you shoot them into the face of a free lok.
Then it should be rolled into the pocket, and until the assaulter is slaughtered, you shoot the gun out of his hand, shoot it into the face of the skin and go back, keep the weapon put on it.
For the army that is right before, the way to do that is like it - take your body from the fire line, quickly take the gun and cut it out so that the wicked could not shoot.
At the same time, move the weight to the gun and shoot the shooting shooter, then turn out the gun out of his bag, before you get back and shoot it.
Do you think it's complicated?
Look at the video to see what the Mizrachi does.
But remember that the safeest way out of any rabbit -- if you're not a magic-magy -- is to give your own.
For the traveller, Yan Riet is in his language on the most delicate places of Europe
The British traveller took its immune system and a root reflex of serious testing, cutting some of the most sweet and refreshing places in Europe.
The reliable and author of the Yan Reyt travel book, 51 of Saphholk, conducted a euro banknote language, the Chirca Pickadili, the button of the university on the train and the Russian public phone to prove the power of its immunity system.
Before we covered each object, he used ulminometers to show us and what he uses.
However, the experiment, which should be a film called "The Training of the Lisbourg of the Internal Shield", gave some wonderful results.
The mouse is to remove the swimming button that uses thousands of other trains may be extremely angry, but actually there are worse bacteria in kitchen cancer.
During the whole journey in Europe, Ryan spoke to the doctors and physicians about increased bacteria and his own health.
Happily, nothing of the sweet has brought him more than a bad shooting.
Reit was known by the testing of his kitchen, traveling to peace and eating strange and surprising things.
From the public wings to the button of the university, this task was uncertainly tested by its immune system.
In the movie that he was cut, he said, "I was perfectly uncertain about my health and I have swept many different things in the mouth of the earth, eating sharks and clean water."
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only one to which he refused is a russian public toilet.
His test mask showed the significance of the luminemeter that exceeds 4.000 units.
For comparison, only the measuring hands must be within 60.
But there was a Russian public toilet that he refused to shoot, after his munômeter's significance was more than 4000 units, while the extinction of hands showed less than 60.
The Valio and the Finnish Manufacturer of Milk Products have deleted a film on a traveler named The Limitation of the Lissunian Internal Shile, which demonstrates the number of bacteria in different places, such as the toilet
In the movie he said, "It's close to one of the worst things I've kicked in the toilet."
There's nothing more damn than that!
I'm not going to smell anything, because it's awesome.
The "Reproduction of Lizine Internal Shile" was cut together with the Finnish Milk Manufacturer Valio.
The company provided Raith Valio Gefilus, which contains oxygen bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, to facilitate the growth of human bacteria and to develop the immune system.
The Old Vice-President Valio on Buy, Sounds and New Categories said, " We really wanted to propose a new consumer.
What would be interesting to see, and at the same time it could explain the benefit of the biobiotics.
We had a brain shop that finished the idea "Don't call Yanu."
They say that the interest in the guest is a global manifestation
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to place them in large context: good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, importance of the pocket health and how it related to the immune system.
The increased interest in the health of the kitchen is a global revelation, and through this documental film, we have been able to provide consumers more information about this in an interesting form.
I also think that the film shows that we have a good feeling of humor!
Tom Hakal, who was a film register, adds: "I would say that I would have lost respect for Yan, if he had covered some things that I asked, for example, a russian kitchen shown in the film."
Of course, some things were easier and some were very cruel.
I'm glad some of these pieces have been able to sleep on the floor.
During the 2015 survey of Valio, 84 per cent of the respondents had linked oxygen bacteria exclusively with a good condition of oxygen and skin, and 58 per cent said that they used at least sometimes, products containing supplemented oxygen bacteria.
The family of the Huligans destroyed Saltash, a municipal house of Cornusol, which was discovered
The vulcanian family left its municipal house with a loss of $50,000, after they were displaced for the fear of their neighbors.
Tana Skeldon and her partner, Shana Trebilkok, have dismissed from their object of inmobility in Saltash, Cornusol, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forced to be displaced from an unmovable object, shocked housing and building cooperation officials have found this object of inmobility in the condition required to repair.
The walls were left with shoes, the seeds were hidden, the floor was shocked on the floor and the walls were spaned.
The family is now overlooked and, likely, lives in a private apartment
Donna McEva, a population in Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid not to save him.
She said, 'It was a absolute cosmetic for people here, and I don't think people should live like that.
There are many things that must be aware, because this object of inmobility may probably be known as a very good aspect of Cornell.
The family benefits from a stupid glory, and their name is used by a stupid glory.
A couple of three sons who lived in an unmovable object from time, and the police reports that the rule of the family has included dragons in the street with bathsbol baths, the pollution of neighbouring areas, the use of drugs, the trafficking of drugs, the excessive crys, the conflict and the rule.
Sceldon, whose name was at the aircraft treaty, received the order for the anti-social behavior in June.
In several house rooms, which could be covered, there was an old manner
Until the case in the house in which drugs were sold in the past,
Neighbors say they saw a dragon on the street and called the police regularly.
Cornwall Housing was forced to get out of her home and her partner on that week, after they were granted a extended period of 11 weeks for voluntary departure.
The expulsion was welcomed by the neighbors who said their lives were transformed into the universe.
One told, "He didn't worry anyone."
We lived next to them 20 years, and that was always bad.
Number of times when we saw the police here, it's incredible.
"The morning we couldn't sleep."
We washed up because we were so calm here - we didn't have to do this!
Now when they're finally gone, it's gonna be beautiful.
Adam Fitzpatrik, Head of the Cornwall Housing Neighbouring Group, said that the family had not been able to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house of 20 years, with the police, and regularly called the police
Musor and old games were displaced below the growing part of the municipal house
He added: ' This is the opposition that the arbitrator could not take any responsibility for her and her family, as the expulsion is always the last method of action that Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very complicated case, since the behavior was limited, and their actions should have been terrible for her observing neighbors.
I appreciate all my team, police and members of the community of Devona and Cornusola, who have spent a crowd to give us information.
I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbors and send a signal that the associational behavior will not be allowed.
Physpatrick reported that all three sons lived in a different time, but he said that they were all over 20.
Gray matrace remained on a floor in one of the houses after the exile
Divorce workers now have to cut the roof of the house around.
In 2014, police searched at home and found more than 70 grams, as well as the pertinent weight and $1700.
Sheldon was disappointed after he was condemned by the ownership of the class B for delivery.
She declared that the money was slaughtered for her son, Le Sceldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After their homelessness, there are evidence that Tanya and her partner are now living in Plymouth.
The walls of many house rooms were spaned over the entire surface.
The police says that they will try to spend an ardenators that are not subject to the location rules
Angela Crow, from the police of Devona and Cornusola, stated that the issue had sent clear warning to other ardenators that continued to violate the rules.
'This is a message for those who feel that they may be able to take themselves without a accused accused, and for those who do so,' she said.
Criminal and anti-social behavior will never permit the police of Devon and Cornell, which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal came to fear when a low-level military aircraft was not shocked in the beach
In the city of Abea, Portugal, the tourists who love to smile on the sun, feared their lives
Aircraft C-3C Orion Aeroports Portugal was incredibly low
Aircraft reported that he had performed a train flight, but stressed the absence of the security risk
This is the moment when the fearful tourists start to be packed, while the low slow shocked over the overlap.
There is a military aircraft on dramatic cars, which is not at the distance of swimming pools from a beach in Avoro, northern Portugal.
The relaxing shocked at the feet when they were understood by the smile of the flight motors, but they were not able to see what moves to their side through the board.
The Inspector occurred last night near the city of Abigail in Costa New.
Daniel Fernandsh, one of the restrainers who published a video of shocking flow in social networks, said, "He passed lowly two times, and there was a moment that showed that he was shocking."
Noah Arroja added, "I've been working with a serphant and swear, it was the feeling that the aircraft was going to shoot me."
Tourists on the Awake beach were terriblely scared when the aircraft was shown from the tsunami and flyed at an emergency low height
Portugal's military and aircraft today stated that the pilot of P-3C Orion had performed a train flight in order to discover fishing courts in the beach and was required to be low, since it was the only way to check them.
Pilot said that the aircraft was a little lower than normally in the sense of the inadequate visibility raised by fire from the nearby horrible forests, but the military aircraft insisted that no one was undermined to be dangerous.
In those years, forest fires have damaged the material part of Portugal, and four people lived on the Madeira Island.
Portugal's military-aviation forces today made a statement that the pilot had to fly so low in the circumstances — a slight thumb and help from forest fires that deteriorated the visibility
A train flight was carried out and the pilot was forced to find fishing ships within the task
The Hassp system has been required for a more years, but most of the coffees and restaurants of Petersburg have not yet been entered.
The tests are increasingly active and the business threatens to 1 million rubbers.
The Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points system (HACCP, Russian HASP option) has been analysis of risks and critical control points, which are binding to the use of food manufacturers and transporters, as well as in Russia ' s company as a member of the Taliban Union.
In February 2015, the Russian Budget Surveillance checked the standards in Petersburg.
But until the responsibilities are sent down the trap only for individual violations of the regulation (see " Documents Preferences " ...).
The incompliance of the regulations in general will be undertaken by 600 thousand rules for the first violation and 1 million rubbers for the second.
ASSP was considered to the United States in the 1960s as a system that takes into account the risks in working with food and preventing them.
Then it's the shock of food security for astronomers.
Now the system is used for all food companies, not only in the United States, but also in Canada and Europe.
Since February 2015, HASP operates on the Territories of the TAC.
4 years of the development and introduction of the business system (HASSP's involvement was presented in the TSS tasked in 2011).
However, both entrepreneurs and employees recognize that most companies have not even heard of this standard.
We, unfortunately, had been sure that the standards relate only to food production, not to reformers, have explained the chapter of the Elena Ceretarian Joint Council.
Now they're all trying to get up.
The expected deadline of the renewing of the carters in Turkey, the end of August, starting September.
However, they will not call for a smooth question, as their targetaudit - family with children - is already ready to school, notes experts.
The Alliance of the Tourist Agency last night sent a letter to the Government, with a request to allow the cards now.
" For many Russian tourists, the collection of quality and access to marine distance is unreasonable, since the Crusondar Radios and the Greatest Republic of Location objects are already covered to the end of September," notes the authors, and emphasize that the opening of carter transports in August is not significantly affected by Russian marine products.
As noted in the Northwest Regional Office of the Russian Tourism Union (RST), if the Russian and Turkey aircraft is soon treated, the renewing of cards to Turkey may be expected for a month.
Some understanding when the cards are renewed until no, this depends mainly on the aircraft authorities.
Technically, aircrafts can fly in September even in August if the tumors operate with the aircraft competing on the necessary routes,” said Paul Romanians, Vice-President of Communications and international projects of the North-West Regional Office.
In his words, the possible renewing of the carders is a good news, but it is not too affected by a market force because the main purchasers of the card towers - the family with children - have already returned from a distance and are ready to go to school or to leave in other countries.
In the barchet season, there are tourists in the main way of travellers and pairs.
Charter programs can take account of those who have the opportunity to relax", says Paul the Romans.
"Turkey has the opportunity to join many tourists, if it now gives very budgetary proposals - 50 to 60 000, because there are people who are targeted to attend very low tours", says Valeria Central, Director-General of the Optio-Travel.
In other cases, it is not exactly necessary to calculate the driving mass of the travels are already planned.
Paul also believes that, since there is a regular demand in Turkey, the carders will also be displaced, but the glass would not be expected.
"For Turkey the launching of cards now is the replication of the next season", says Paul the Romanians.
"Clarifying cards in Turkey is a positive news for the next season", according to Valeria Ruby.

On Thursday, 12 August 2016, the Russian Central Bank resigned the licence for banking operations in the organisation of the International Communist Bank, registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, the ACB HASSTREBANK has conducted a high-level credit policy related to the allocation of money in low-quality assets.

A London school, joined to IGIL, died in Syria
Cadiza Sultan, one of the three British schools who left London last year to join the IGI, as reported, died in Syria.
The lawyer Tasnim Acunday said that her family had learned about her death in Rake, Syria, just a few weeks ago.
It was supposed to have died from a Russian aircraft in Raqqa, a grouping in the country, as reported by ITV News on Friday.
Sudan was 17 years old, and as her family said, she died as a time when he planned to leave a divorced country of war and return to England.
"It may only be hoped that the only advantage of this is the overwhelming and advertising of others, that is the risks of traveling to the military zone of action to kill people ever the same choice," said Acundi.
In February 2015, Sultan and two other school schools from East London were a village in Turkey, and then on the bus to the Syrian border.
The family of Surtan said that she married the IHL fighter in Syria and became a widow for a few months.
Rid claims that Clinton remains loyal to Harland as a candidate to the Supreme Court in the case of election
The leader of the Democratics in Senate Harry Rid says he is convinced that the democratic candidate to President Hillary Clinton would be appointed to the judge Maryk Harland in the Supreme Court if it is elected as President.
The Senate Republicns blocked the approval of Harland, and as President Barrak Obama appointed it in March.
The Director of the Group of the majority in Senate Mitch McConnel states that the next President will choose the person who can replace the last court of the Supreme Court of Antonio Skyle.
Rid declared at the meeting on Thursday that he predicted that Clinton would choose Harland with a certain basis of confidence.
The representative Rid later said he didn't speak to Clinton directly about whether she would move Harry, and just built proposals.
He praised Harland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to "have a ship" with a new choice.
Harland is the principal court of the Appeal Court of the United States on the district of Colombia.
Rid stated that the Republicans, who blocked the name of Harland, were "fellowships" and "personnels" of the Republic of the Republic of Donald Trump.
He said that Tramp wasn't coming to the office.

But instead, they are intended to find the next generation of fuel models for their calendar for 2017 with the museums engaged.
The President of Treats Steve Shaw told us this year that his magazine with a large number of dealing models is different from the old playboy, because "Playboy is for men".
I'm doing it for women.

Women want to be part of the project because it is a beautiful art.

The New Book Book's Network was extracted for the sale of Stace Cramer's book 50 days before my suicide, reports the Moscow News Agency.

In Moscow, the memory of Ernsta's unknown.
In Moscow, there will be a memory for Ernsta's unknown sculptor, reports TASC.
The activities will be held in the Central Literature House, August 15.
Unfortunately, everyone will not be able to communicate with the unknown in the United States.
It was therefore decided to establish this evening for those who want to remember it on the land of the country,” stated in the press service of the Russian Jewish convention.
It was noted that this was important for the sculptor Anna Graham and his friends throughout the world.

The final consumer was guilty: Who actually purchases the plasts?
The only men in the middle of the mid-year love guilty.
And until you disappeared the section of comments by cruel distortions under the Middle East Mediterranean, the approval is out of the actual data.
According to YouGov, so much discussed rebuilding of plastics is not a bleeding among the generation of twenty-year-olds who want to come to a new material object, but notes of medium-year-old years.
Those who have recently purchased a large amount of wine albums are likely at a age of 45 to 54, according to the data.
Moreover, those belonging to the age group of 18-24 are less perceived.
This is also not just an act of collection of favorites - it has a emotional importance: the increased purchasers have condemned several more likelys to keep their feelings (56 per cent against 53 per cent) and enjoy the unity (69 per cent against 66 per cent).
But is the results of youGov faithful?
If this blog was a television newspaper, the camera would follow me until I would go to the center of the living street of Soho, in a modest snake and slightly shocking before the stop, composing the hands and say something smiling, "Yes, let's see."
Okay, let's see.
While the hearts of Soko slowly have been disappointed — hotels, cafes, paperchase shops have now been designed to build buildings when independent salers — a few musical shops with fantastical specialists have remained.
I probably asked the camera to stop the next scene, in which I find close to different people in some of these shops and try to evaluate their age and emotional attitudes by monitoring.
Grazgo Stuart, 55 years old for I went from Sister Ray, two young women, three men in the mid-year-old years, to Reckless Records (data accounts: eight men in the mid-year-old years, one woman probably 20 years old), in London at half a meeting, and passed on shops to take a few hours.
He's a collectioner, can I ask?
"I think so," he said.
I have about 3000 or 4000 plates.
These plates that are pictured above (he sent me by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), they go into lines on the walls of his guest.
His reason for purchasing such a large number of albums and symptoms, he can now buy plates that he couldn't allow himself when he was only out, and purchase objects he had sold when he was young.
"My more of the things I'm buying is the end of the 60s, the beginning of the 70s, the things that came when I was 11 or 12 things that I probably was too young to buy," he said.
He agrees that those who purchase the plastics are most likely, the introvers who love their own company, adding: "I'm not smoking, I don't drink too much.
It's my lack.
Wees, 25 years working at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers whom he meets are corresponding to the YouGov profile.
However, he noted the new concern of people who had been under the influence of the media, people who heard back and felt the responsibility to purchase their old platforms.
Judging on the discussions I had, people were discarded from their collection, usually in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who ever sold their fault to purchase dishes, are now sell their ski compacts to purchase their platforms," he says.
This may explain the blue among the persons of recovery in a certain age.
What about the emotional importance of placing?
A few seconds in the shop, such as Phonica, are sufficient to understand that the loan sales offer a comfortable society with similar views.
According to Wess, some more guests, in particular, have disrupted the unfair payment system.
Some guilty favorites may feel distressed from the digital world and prefer to be removed in the constant convergencies for the placing, objects that have the memories of immature youth.
"I think it may sometimes be filled with whiteness or material things as their kind of calm," says Weather.
Because I'm the collectioner, I have it, and I think there's also a lot of people.
That's a simple way to take your head.
"We're as their social workers!" said a colleague from the platinum strike.
The ICM survey showed that nearly 50 per cent of those who purchased a virtue album in April have not yet heard it.
The survey also found that 41 per cent of the player they have never used, while 7 per cent of those who purchase guilty, no placing player.
At this stage of the news report, I would probably have seen a seriously delicate, cutting up the board with the assemblies of Boshanova.
"Trofe" aspect of recovery is what Johnny noted 42 years of age that works in Sounds of the Universe (counts: three men a mid-year-old years).
"Another one came recently and said, "I don't have a plastic player, but I want to buy a radiohead plate so we could put it to ourselves," he said.
It's not a large percentage, but it's certainly happening.
It's the most typical, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a player."
These are young people who aren't older, a little less than twenty, who are just aware of it.
Fopp, who now opened almost all the stage of the vine, is much more diversity when I'm coming.
There are couples for 70, tourists photod, adolescents and women in the middle of the age.
Although the atmosphere is less innocent than the stories mentioned above, the last Sint and Sexy Pop Wild Beast, and not a jazzle introduction, is sweet to see the difference in its customers.
No one seems particularly unique, but the painful psychological trauma is difficult to establish 30 seconds close to someone.
Eleanor, 27 years old, went over Fopp for a few minutes, considering the various platforms available in the sales.
She looks like goods, not money.
It does not pay a lot, as she says, so it is not a very suitable option.
That's pretty good.
Listen to a music on a computer or another device - but the beauty has come to it -- and it's loading into the dreams with a smile that is completed by love.
I don't know how to explain it is really unbelievable.
My last stopping is the shop that, as he said, has helped the appearance of a new generation of lovers, because the people's models.
As I create the illusion that I'm considering gymnastics, I'm looking at a group of young girls, every minute assembling around the Polaroid camera, before my father and his daughter start to discuss the purchase of Crosley player.
The left is the wall of the plastics of Adele, Jephth Bacli, Amy Weinhaus and Flittoud Mack: the modern style and classics required platforms for any medium collection.
Nobody looks — maybe because they are just a shooting, some places are so high on the wall, that wouldn’t be able to touch them.
It's a real artistic guilty.
However, considering that any attention to these objects may mean more money for the industry and send several other customers to the Soho deep at any time, not almost what to be complained.
It is not surprising that the lion of people who have more likely than most of them have more time and money than most of them is a lake that loses the majority of the money of the raw materials, such as the guilt.
But until my conclusions show that the results of YouGov are accurate, at least in Soho platforms, they do not exclude the existing number of collective women and wives who are in reality, in placing and online forums.
These people probably work in school or offices.
But they are obviously not taking place on the morning on the shopping in Berwick Strit and avoiding the views of an unpleasant 30-year-old false leader, which depends on the shoes of men who are not suspected for medium-years.

The French Court rejects the proposal to purchase shops in the Jungly refugee camp
The French Court rejected the proposal of the authorities of Cale to take ten individual shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees live.
In the court hearings this week, the authorities of Kyle expressed that the State should be able to make a total complexity of 72 single shops where people sold goods within the camp from smoke to energy drinks, propose to switch or sell a tea for 50 cents (40r) or a few euros in an independent restaurant.
The Prefecturer Cale said that these places should be put into place because they are a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they have a fire and sanitary risk.
The Guarantee Groups told the court that the purchase and restaurants are vitally necessary, claiming that the free observations proposed by the Governing Association and other groups would not provide sufficient amount of food for growing numbers in the camp.
They expressed that single shops and restaurants often provide blood and free food for those who need it.
The Court of Leil decided that it was not a legal basis to evacuate people who managed 72 single shops but claimed that the problem of Kyle's prefecture was completely understood.
Judge Jean François Mollah said that bacalyes, cafe and restaurants had played a great role than simply the use of people who " live in a very thrilling conditions".
He said that spaces have provided the peaceful meetings of refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that were threatened by the report was a children ' s book of Junglee at a camp which does not work for benefits and offer 200 dinners a day, in English and French, and for rescue consultations for hundreds of vulnerable adolescents without association in the camp.
More than 170.000 people were signed by the complaint to protect the coffee of children.
The letter sent to Guardian stated that his closed " would be a disaster for these children, some of whom not older than eight years".
Two well-being institutions, the assistance to the Beemenians and L'Auberge des Migrants in Friday, estimated that the number of Jungle camps growed and increased 90,000 people — the most higher than the whole history — after the slight increase in new arrives during the year.

Britain is stopped in Regby-7, after the Master-class Fiji allows them to take gold
The impressive series of Great Britain in Regby-7 was slowly stopped at the final prevention of Fiji team in the finishing night when they were totally disrupted 43-7 in the Deodor Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave the master-class for the ownership of meat, squirty, swimming games, swimming lines and cruel force to win gold — their first olimpholic meal of any color.
The opinion was not too poor in the form of silver, the third in Britain, and they could be proud of their efforts in the first Olympic tournament in Regby-7, which won by the way New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
Boks bleeding, 7-5 in half of the same day, could be returned to the end.
But no matter what, Fiji has winned as far as it couldn't be a team of 15 persons.
This may be some comfort for Britain — but it is probably not — that at least one British man will wake up tomorrow on the hand of a gold meal: the main trainer Fiji - Ben Ryan, an ex-English chief of Wymbledon.
It was a few trips to Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at Adelaide Sevens.
They've lost the whole one here.
These shocks will cause pain, but the progress is positive.
Fiji began greatly, for the deceased, the attempt of the United Kingdom to overcome the meat.
It was like to touch the driving bus column to Captain Tom Mitchell and company, and the Championships of the World Series went up from 5 to 0 when Osea Colenisau sloped in the edge.
There were four minutes at Jerry Tuvai's time, adding another tachun on the right floor, which was implemented.
12-0 and Greece had to go to the bottle.
The great attempt of Mitchell's overwhelming was to hold Leon Nakarabra from to forget the third, but that's just Fiji's delay.
At the seventh minute, Jas Veremelalua did Tachdaun in the right edge, and the United Kingdom played 17-0.
Nakarabaya added another after renewing, and in the hour there were still more minutes... in the first half.
In the meantime, Ravo was cut through some other long-term attempts to overcome the Great Britain and the storm to get a look at it.
Implementation has led to 29-0 in suspension.
It seemed that Fiji would have been born for the game in the Regiby-7, while Greece still owns a rhythm.
What's going on in a significant way.
The Great Britain made mass replacements on half of the game, and they shocked a physician... at all four minutes, that the standards of the first half were good until Joshua Tuiswa passed after a number of fraude fysic interactions.
Dan Norton accepted the attempt for Britain, making a tank in the left angle to make a count of 36-7, but a long swimming game on the road of the islands of South Sea, whose skin fans were slaughtered by fleets and danced on the courts.
It was not possible to rejoice Fiji’s full joy.
Mother Willem slaughtered a fysian shop that had not needed to switch, another attempt in the last seconds.
The results were called, the physicians were dealing, and the United Kingdom went to gas, completely convinced.
On the same day, Fiji wins Japan from 20 to 5 in its half-five, and the United Kingdom was a little bunch of South Africa in a tensive half-first attempt, the difference of the British implementation.
Kyle Brown puts Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton helped a fine work with a slight leg and shooted the balls in the second half.
The last attempt to overcome from Marcus Watson, the 15th part of the team of England, Entony, was safeguarded by the victory, and finally a silver meal.
Helen Glover and Hiser Stanning are inspired to win in the struggle of cancer training
It's not gonna be more worried gold on these games, and that's something about it.
From the first move to the last, 220 degrees of the history, Helen Glover and Hizer Stanning found that their golden moment at the Lagoa Station was more important.
Although they were the two of the weights, there were three voices in this ship, but the trainer Robin Williams was always until they tried to the second submission of the Olympic gold in women, the first woman in the British sport analysis that arrived before that height.
Their superiority was absolute, the 39th unbelievable statement, again unprecedented.
What we're seeing is that two bluring sports that are covered on the surface of the lebedies are not fully reflecting the nature of the triumph.
For every gold of the Greek Batalon, prepared hands that contribute to the slowly swallowing winnings that are important, and no hands that were more important than the trainer, which 30 months ago when he had placed a cancer diagnose, did not know whether he lived before seeing that day.
As he said, it was a dangerous case.
I've got a smooth puzzler cancer, one of the things they can operate, and they've done it.
If they're not doing this, he's going all over there.
This could be a very bad situation.
She's a little changed your species in the future.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
Triumph was glad that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, maintaining a minimum graphic, if it could be a correct expression in such circumstances as those.
I needed payment, so I had to run fast.
It was smiling.
I was in the hospital and driving at the office — 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet per hour, although they were talking enough steps.
That's how it starts.
The beach itself is a journey, but it makes it a little more.
The next mom after the winning of their first thoughts were Williams, who held the nervous morning, speaking more than normally in trying to overcome their own challenges.
Stanning, Capitaine of Artillerian Service in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotive disappearing this week, maybe it's a little tired, but that's so important."
It only confirms how much this means for me, how much Helen and I worked, and Robin also.
These were fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we would be no one, so great thanks to him, he's the best trainer in the world.
I couldn't even ask for a better partner to train or a better trainer.
Helen Glover and Hizer Stanning haven't lost any honey for five years.
This couple has a pressing rhythm that their competitors never could match.
Even at the last 500 meters, when the New Zealand and Denmark teams began approaching, Stanning and Glover had too much in stock.
We were strong in the phase.
Helen said, "Let in the process, stay in the process."
Now it's very important to do it.
We had a good time, and at the same time we weren't trying to do something funny.
We weren't waiting for feverers today, we just expected that we could be well able to go out and win this gorge that we did.
A couple needs a year to decide on their future.
The Globe must be married in the next month, in her own television scanner by Steve Bakhol.
Now she just wants to enjoy a moment.
I didn't want to say that it's my last throne.
That would mean too much pressure.
We needed some six months in London to understand that I became the Olympic Champion.
It was so new, and I was so painted.
I need some four minutes here.
"I'm so much better," she said.

WTO arbitrators have established that Russian imports on papers, heatings and palm oil were contrary to the rules of organization.
The shipping rates exceed the obligations taken by Russia when the WTO is entitled.
" This is the first case when WTO decided against RF", states the official website of the organization.
However, the arbitrators stressed the fact that European Union had not submitted sufficient evidence that Russia had “the action of systemic” or “the whole nature”.

In Poland they won't buy fuel in the Gazproma.
The Poland State oil company PGNIG does not exclude that a few years later a gas supply of RF may be inacceptable for it because of the transfer of fuel from Norway and other countries.
The Vice-President of the Polish Finance Company was reported to God's Major.
His words are transmitted to TASS.
"That may happen that we're not going to purchase gas (the "gazproma"), we're now distributing our delivery.
In the border of the nearest four years, the main supply for us will become the Eastern, from the Termijnen and Norwegia," said Mayor.
The Gazprom is currently householding in Poland gas supply.
On Thursday, 12 August, the PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier in the first half of 2016 had put it about 5,3 billion cubits of gas to 30 per cent above the 2015 level.
The proportion of Russian gas gas in purchasing PGNIG increased to 49.8 per cent compared to 40 per cent previously.
We recalled that the Polish antimonopol State had not agreed to establish a joint Gazproma company and its European gas construction partners on the North River-2.

The Hazproma added that the fact that the Polish PGNIG declaration in the Stockholm Arbitration Court still did not mean that negotiations were stopped.
Before the Polish company was called in a court in order to reduce the cost of the Russian gas price.
Remember, the Poland Government on Gas and Energy Infrastructure, Peter Namiki, reported that the Poland authorities decided not to extend the contract with Gazpromma for gas supply.
The Poland contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expired in 2022.
In March, the Poland Government on the gas and energy infrastructure stated that his country could be rejected from the supply of blue fuel from the eastern.
In his words, Barshava plans to build a new term of consumption of the Baltic Pipe natural gas that will connect the country to the Norwegian shelf.

UN is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The United Nations Special Commission is investigating the possibility of the use of toxic gas in the remaining forces of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All the parties of the conflict reject the use of chloro, but the United Nations specialist for Stefan de Mister considers the fact that is unreasonable.
Such statements were called on a third round of interseries negotiations that should start at the end of August in Geneva.
UN specialists began investigating the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information on therapy with the use of toxic gas, presumably clore, appeared in 2 August.
The opposition stated that in the area where a Russian military-transport helicopter was slaughtered, the aircraft dismissed bombs with a similar substance, but in Moscow these accuseds were called a slaughter.
Later, the Russian Defence Ministry accused the opposition group "Nar Ad Dyn of Az-Zinki".
Shortly it was known that tóxic gas started was two bombs.
This confirmed BBC one of the victims.
"A few minutes later I felt the gas smell, starting to smile, was hard to breathe," quotes the quote of the witness.
At the result of the attack, at least seven people died, 23 hospitalized.
If the use of similar gas is confirmed by experts, the action will be evaluated as a military offence.
The UN Special Meetinger on Syria Staffan de Mister said to the journalists: "Declarations that this really happened is much."
The invalidity of the use of chloro for military purposes is set out in the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
Despite all parts of the Syrian conflict reject the use of toxic gases, human rights defenders fixed 35 cases of the use of the Syrian army against the "mething opposition".
The situation in Alpoo is complicated by the shooting of its areas every day and the terrorists prevent the outcome of the city.
According to Reuters, the United Nations is waiting for the establishment of the Humanitarian Pause in military action.
The effective regime of daily three-third involvement in the organization is considered "unsufficient to help almost 2 million peaceful citizens in the bowl".
The Council of Humanitarian Affairs Council, Yan Egelann, stated that for providing assistance and evacuation to the city of sickness and evacuation, every week, there was a 48-hour stop for fire.
"We have to send shoes from the colonic carriage to the place where the roads are almost destroyed, and what remained replaced," reported Mr. Egelan. - but the Russian delegation confirmed the willingness of seating with us for the negotiations table. "
Geneva has continued consultations between representatives of the United States and Russia on the establishment of the "government pause".
As Russia opened the "goodging windows" in Alpoo.
In the continuing fight against Alep, second to Syrian city, on 11 August, Russia announced the introduction of the three-time stop of combating, which will be working daily from the fourth day.

As a result of the series of explosions in Thailand, four people died.
A number of explosions were progressed on the south of Thailand on Tuesday morning.
In the result of the attack, four people died, 19 injured.
The explosive scenario came to the city of Hua-hin.
Among the victims, there were 10 foreigners, four citizens of the State, no Russians.
The responsibilities for the incident have not been taken by any of the terrorist groups, but the country has continued to say that the Islamics were not involved in it.
A number of persons have been detained under the suspect in the organisation of explosions.
On the pre-reported data of the local police, the scale and the speciality of explosions indicated that they had been addressed against the armed countries.
The attacks have occurred on popular tourist smokes, including the Paton Beach in the Phuket area and the town of Hua-hin, Strange and Surat-Tania.
After the arrival of the military duty to the country, the economic growth in 2014 increased from 7,2 per cent (2012) to 2,8 per cent (2015) but the tourism remained a few areas that demonstrate development.
The country has already visited 14 million people in 2016, with more than 1,5 million in 2015.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of attack have already been detained, reported the police officer Crissan Patanacharoen.
As soon as he was talking about the purpose, he added, but "the countries are convinced that they are not associated with the international extremist groups".
Soon soon, Mr. Patanacharon said.
But we know exactly that these incidents are not directly linked to some kind of terrorism, actually these are local divergences, and we are trying to establish the personality of those who are behind them.
Explosions occurred at the day of the Queen of Thailand Sicret.
The Thai Hunta considers the protection of the monarchy one of its main priorities, so that the incident may probably be directed against it.
According to the statement of the General Police Siticia Schrizopatriot, the bombs were shocked in a distance with a distance at half hour.
They were hidden within the trees on the living streets filled with dinners in tourist restaurants.
It is already known that one of the four dead girls became a Chinese girl who traded a sweet food.
The personality of the other victims, however, is known, that they are the inhabitants of four foreign States.
According to the Royal Police of Thailand, four citizens of Germany, three submissioned Netherlands, two Italian citizens and Austrian citizens.
The Russian no explosive victim reported the Russian press office.
Local experts are also linked to explosions from the last 7 August, in which 61.4 per cent of the people have supported a new Constitution project.
It was prepared by the Commission on the development of the Constitution designated by the Military Hunt.
The speaker had to determine whether they support the system where the top of the parliamentary was fully designated as military and has a significant role in choosing the Prime Minister of the country.
The new system was adopted and will first be tried for the 2017 parliamentary elections.
Remember, on 22 May 2014, a military shift in Thailand was under the leadership of the country's commanding army of the Chan-Ocha country.
In his words, the army underlined the unprecedented political crisis and the absence of progress in negotiations between the Government and the opposition.
The Military Peace and Orders have established the National Peace Council, introduced the comandant time and census, developed the Protest and the top of the Parliament.
How Bangkok was in an emergency situation
The Government of Thailand, in the head of Yinglack Chinavat, announced in January 2014 that an emergency situation was introduced in Bangkok and the capital of provinces.
The special regime has been extended 60 days.
Like in Bangkok two explosions.
In January 2014, in the Bangkok Center of Pobeda, where one of the main Protest Actions was one of them, there were two explosions resulting from 28 people, five of them were critical.
Explosions have resulted in unknown motorcycles.
The authorities have strengthened the security measures in the capital and engaged military forces to protect demonstrators.
In Sohma Logue, there was an development of conditions.
As it was known, the Government was proposed to agree on the draft terms for the counterparty of the Suha Log with the maintenance of two key limits.
It is proposed to not allow a company where 25 per cent and more foreigners and the claims in which the capital will not be at least 25 per cent of the host.
Participants are not expected that the Government will write the conditions, noting that many games are not risked by a complex and road project.
They can announce in August, and take it in October.
The mines were introduced to the Government in the project of allocation and conditions for the largest unfavoured gold-cooperation in Shua-Log (Irak area, stocks and resources), reported two sources of " . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The project was introduced in midnight, specifically one of them.
In the Minoprofeders, they confirmed that the project was introduced to the Government.
The representative of the fuming non-smoking vice-premier Alexander Kloonin said that the functional project has not yet been done in the device.
" The audience may already be declared in August, immediately after the Government's discharge, and taking into account the deadline for the collection of applications for potential participants (not less than 45 days) may be held in October," says the Ministers.
According to the project, there were two key requirements for the potential participants, which were written to the Ministers and FIWs in July (e.g. in " t").
The first is the capital of candidates, however, 25 per cent of the guest participation.
Second is the refusal of access to businesses under the control of foreign investors, from the understanding of FG-57 on foreign investment in strategic society.
According to the two of the FGs draft, as already written by "e.g." on 2 August, the company whose beneficiary (25 per cent and above) is not tax ratio or have double citizenship.
The Government is able to introduce these limitations, as the Suha Log regards the emergency of the federal value (more than 50 tons of gold).
In the Minoprofeders, the project was confirmed that the "consistent restrictions for foreign enterprises" but refused to comment on details to the Government ' s allocation.
In December 2015, the Chairman of the Sergei Lewchenko's officer, Mr. Sergeem Eroceanko, said "the former investment contract with the "Rustech".
Those who imposed the restrictions for foreigners are not cleared.
"But this is in the spirit of time, but not to control in Russia's largest gold place on the bottom of the Western sanctions," discusses the co-conciliator who is familiar with the shopping preparation.
The Head of Minor Prostitute of Sergey Dono, of 1 August, stated that foreigners would be able to go to consortium, if the claimants were bound to them as the financial structure, the technological partners.
Congress believe that it is not likely to be adjusted by the Government.
The main candidate on Suhaw Log is considered the consortium of the largest gold adventure of RFPA Paulus, the under-controlled son of Sullyman Kerimvo Said, and Russia.
As written in July, partners have created the "Zollot" CP, where 51 per cent of the percentage in the "Poloss", in the RT-GR structure, 49 per cent.
The Russian ' s refusal of comments, and the Paul stated "eye" that "freely interested in this activity" and had all the necessary competences and resources for its development.
"But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be adopted after the declaration of the conditions", was added to the Police.
ALRA may participate in the shopping, but a decision by the RF Government, the sources were called ".
The possibility for the development of the Suhgo Loga was declared Russian Gold and Canadian Kinross, which develops as Polymetal and North Gold, is not interested in active.
Head of the Golden Manufacturer RF Sergey Kashab in December 2015 estimated "investments" in Shua Log in $2.5-4 billion.
The majority of potential candidates is not only the number of investments but also the complexity of the project: they need a serious training of reserves and technologies with complex equipment, explaining partners in the sector.
At the pension market, the ICIC Finance Pension Administrator launched the process of association of four sub-controlled NFPs.
As a result, "Gazfond Pension Coppers" will be created by a number of NFF collected by about 373 billion rubbers.
On the launch of a combination of four pension funds, "KIT Finance", "Promford" and "Gazfond Pension Collections" last night, reported the owner of the 100% funds of the ICAT Finance Administrator of Pension.
"The reorganization is implemented in accordance with the CB, in compliance with the requirements of the conditions of the treaties concerned,” states the company's message.
The combination is conducted on the Gazfond Pension Collections.
As noted by the DG of the NFF Oлег Bylishsky, the combination of funds allows a number of tasks: the enhancement of geographic presence, the concentration of development resources, the reduction of costs, the trend of the best practices of each fund and the optimalization of corporate management.
In his words, the oriental term of consolidation is the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the combination of NFs, the Pension Coppers will become the larger player on the POP market.
According to the data on 31 March, the amount of pensions in unit funds exceeded 373 billion rubbers.
As reported on the funds website, the beneficiary of their owners, " IKT Finance of the Pensional Administrator ", are currently Anatole Gavrienco (65 per cent of the sub-control OOs belongs) and Gazfond (35 per cent).
However, the association of the group has been very late competitors.
Yes, the under-controlled O1-NFN-Bood-Down-Food-to-Stall-Food is still in the beginning of the present year.
This Joint NGO is currently joined by the Uralssib Funds and the Russian Standard.
"Introduction in a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary to solve structural tasks", notes the NF 'Body' Nicola Sydors.
The active work on consolidation of funds with April is also in the Safmar Pension Group - NPF Europe, Description and Science - should be included in Safmar until the end of this year.
In 2017, the GNF is joined by the Dead.
"Inclusion of funds will effectively enhance risk control, operational processes and expenditure", noted in the Safmar Pension Group.
A number of reasons may be made to the experts to the ICF finance Administrator of Pension.
Before the last time, NGOs could not purchase more than 40 per cent of the infrastructure expenditure, which had been actively placed by the group.
After amendments to the CB in March of that year, on a number of employees relevant to the regulator ' s requirements, such limitations are no longer available.
The director of the Financial Institutes' Racing Group of ACRA Jury Nogin, if necessary, can buy one large player.
A number of NFF leaders from fuel-15 assets have been called the separation of the scope of influence and, as a result, qualifications in a single fund that should be agreed to the owners of the group.
Last night Anatolius Gavrienko was not allowed to comment.
On the request of "Hasfond" to the NCP, it was not answered.
Although the consolidation of the funds is a job and unfortunate event, this decision will be justified at a long distance.
As he notes, the director of the Consulting Company Sergey Okoleson, the Pension Collections Gazphones, has a decrease in the stabilising the basis of other group funds.
This will be a more successful experience in the ICF's Finance and Promotor Fund in the construction of lower NOPs, as well as the use of more modern PP.
The requirements of the CBC to processes and careers of NPF will continue to grow, therefore double the infrastructure on four funds in the single investment policy, as the director of the expert RA expert, Paul Mitrophans.
" The effects of duplicating functions will unilaterally close the possible unit costs", notes Mr. Mitrofan.
The costs for the combination of four funds of Sergey Okolesne are estimated by 30-50 million rubbers.
" The costs of four such funds are about 400 million rubbers per year, when a medium-term budget is realized to reduce two", said Mr. Osolesn, as a result of the consolidation of the medium-term budget.
In the Russian procate, Pete and his Dragon was the best discinic film.
The beautiful species of New Zealand, the fascinating dragon, the soul-friendly history and the songs in the canter style are sufficient to believe again in the oldest magic.
The feared little was a dragon that became a human child and a swimming girl and loyal friend.
Pete calls her friend Elliot, who is honoured by the box book, plays with him in a ball and sits in a film.
Six years later, his growing and preserving connection is not yet different from the other industrial forest sovereigner of Maula.
In this way, Pita finds a blonde hero Grace (Brays Dallas Hovard), while the Brigade of Gavin (Carl Urban), her husband, agressively fled the forest.
Now she must not only believe in the existence of the Dragon but also help him save him.
Pete is a rapid course to "be a man" in the universe of the Indian Americans who have a cowboys, a moral code in the heart and smile more clearer than any advertising.
No person looks out and does not work too terrible that the slaughter actually begins to hate or fear him.
Even Gavin, who has been locked on a non-typical village of his forests, was far away to an unjust misrespect.
The shocked dragon was also unterrorized, with a good bouldog, the aircraft shoot and the ability to become invisible.
Dragon is awesome, smiling, even smiling, and, happily, he does not always want to swim, so it is usefully different from all known cinematographic dragons.
The visual image of Elliot and his manner are maintained in such a high sense of emotional involvement that at the pressing moments, not only smaller, but also adults begin to smile in three hands.
Awesome good and young Oux Figur in the role of Pete, which is interrupted between the family and the real friend.
And Robert Reedford is a canonic grandfather who would like to have literally every child.
How did the director David Loury have been able to remove a fantastically forgotten disciple movie Dracon Pita in 1977, which was meant from the noise to the end of the hot and mentioned only by a mix of animation and game movie, and to make it the most soulful movie of that year?
Not like a miracle helped.
In his picture of Laurie from the original, in fact, only two things were taken: the throne of Pita and the dragon.
The music numbers have remained on the board and the largest part of the strange shoes.
In this good statement, we read the faces of the Bambian, the Indonesians, and many other kind of children's paintings.
The Disney study continues to expand the gallery of high quality rings in the 21st century.
Of course, "Pit and Dragon" is not so deceived as "The Jongley Book" and there's no artistic abuse that Kate Blanchet had been in the role of a mache in the new Golden.
However, this film has successfully helped to believe in wonder and good in the best disciple traditions.
On the other hand, the keys from the magnificent store of Disney will be obtained by the recorder Laurie for the art adaptation of Peter Pane's history.
The "Fee and his Dragon" dance by David Loury and the scenar of Toby Helbrooks entered into a new ambitious project on the unbelieving boy at James Barry's single speech.
The journalist of RBK Alexandra Sokoloa proclaimed a new accused
The journalists of RBK Alexander Sokolov, accused of the organization of the extremist structure, said that the prosecutor had not been incompenseed in the matter of their subsidiary.
We learned from the investigators last night that the prosecutor had presented such a presentation.
We have been planned to participate in the judiciary on the limitation of knowledge with criminal matters, but the meeting was not finally held, and the investigators reported us about the prosecutor's presentation.”
She told the prosecutor that the investigators had indicated that the qualification of cases and assembled materials was inadequate.
The investigators now have to be removed in the proof base and proclaimed the new accused to Alexandre Sokolo.
Another article of the Criminal Code (OHCH) is the same, but with other evidence and new evidence, specificates Mrs Dynz.
As he said, Alexander Sokolov was arrested on 29 July 2015.
In June the current year reported that the results were excluded from the accused of the RBK journalist on the "Political Review of Instability" and the "related enforcement of the authorities".
Aleksandr Zilbert, a counterparty in the Olympic village, has investigated the Russian collection house, eated in a local table and even tested WADA.
It seems that life isn't going to die in seconds.
Even night.
The latest older times have been completed, after which the sports have been needed to return to the Olympic village.
Furthermore, there are seats and displacements from the village, since some attractors have completed their explanations and leave Brazil, and some of them are just coming here.
Well, at 7:30 morning, the heads of all the Olympic delegations are cut into one of the temporary tests.
In these congregations, we are generally discussing some operational matters, - tells the director of the sporting delegation of Russian Jord Casik, the Olympic team. - Despite the fact that our houses in which we believed that our sculptors have taken it to exploitation one of the first and have demonstrated all the checkers, even some cases have been found in it.
So with a hard water problem, I'm sorry, with vultasis.
We've been fighting for cleanness for a long time.
First, nobody had to get away.
Then the clinics began to come, but they're just swearing some substance on the ground, yes.
They've got, see if some innovations are innovative.
Mol, you can't touch them humanly.
We know these fields are the clamps!
In general, changes of the clining company have been made and now all of that have been done.
The Olympic village is the South Buto, a bed area that is covered by one side of the mountains, and the other swimming wheel, the places of the residual water.
Well, for the hope, there's still a two-milh-metre ice board on which the machines are walking.
All in the village can be placed to 17.000 persons in 3604 apartments located in 31 houses.
One of the 18 stages has a large Russian flag -- this house is completely dedicated to the need for our collection.
In view of a small incentive, you can immediately determine what problems are for the most pleasant team.
Two statements are declared on the long registration: "Priminist, don't leave the paper in the toilet!" and "Prime in the icon gift."
It's the same shoes in the browsers.
Their funeral race is contrasting with the brochure: "Remember of Infectional Diseases for Retroverse to Rio de Janeiro", "Search for help in the plot, the fall of the foreign body in a respiratory way, the loss of conscience is the stages of heart-leading reaction", "Healing in flights, warm shocks, shocks and blood tests".
The text is in a generally pleasant.
For example, “indication is contained by a heavy and post-related outcome.
Nevertheless, it is not all a favorable outcome.
There is certainly a physician in the location of the Russian collected, who is ready to provide the home-based assistance, including the deficit and sporting mass.
Instead of the physician, our delegation's headquarters.
The doors are inspiring crystal, "Only we will win!".
Well, of course, the texts:
All arguments are absolute burden!
They believe only those who fear.
Let us be less than winning, and Russia won't go away, and it's not broken!
The spirit has been declared to be more declared: “Awesome brothers and sisters!
According to the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and all the Russians, the spiritual bearing on the sports of the Olimpiade College of Russia performs the protoyer Andrey Wormrovich Alexandr.
Put your prayers and other requirements on phone...
Indeed, there is the Meditation Center and Religious Training for the representatives of all the conferences in the village.
Well, the Russians are in the privileged situation, they have their own hour.
With regard to the burning of the lift from the nineth stage to the fourth stage, I decided to go down the lit, recommended to use during the fire.
And in the darkness, the body was shocked on it.
As a whole, they were sleeping workers of the new clining company.
I believe, at any time, they decided to set up a calm time directly on cold steps.
At the fourth stage, I was waiting for a meeting with Vitalia Fedorovich Dudoko, the trainer of our baths, bringing them to the Olimpiade gold 16 years ago to Sidney.
He and the student, the Champion of Europe of the Yan Paul, agreed to show his rooms.
- We live on two, of course, sleeping is almost incredible, but it's not critical.
One of the four, but it's very spacious.
Scop, of course, sweet, from the shoes, confidence isn't calling, but something can be put.
"No, you're shooting, the tea have finished!" - he develops the tennisist of the Svetlan Kuisco, who has met me in the main table.
It is called, although, because it represents a space of 2,7 thousand km and is ready to take 50,000 visitors simultaneously.
There are 600,000 portions in the swimming powder completely free.
The options of the menu are: "Luke from Brazil", "Cuchney of the Peace", "Asia observations" and "Peace, Macaron Arts".
The last option I've seen is the great popularity of our volunteers.
That's what I'm saying, I haven't found any of the gigant restaurant units.
What are you kids?
It's good that I've got the Chinese shooter with me.
And the cheese.
But if you understand, we've got some worse food on the cortex.
There's something you can choose, despite an unexpected unity.
I personally chose a pair of pieces and fractures in tomate soß.
Each band is a table with its name in three English, French and Portuguese languages, as well as an indication of the food value of the product and the existence of allergens in it.
Well, it's all right. It's a good thing.
I don't even know why this is always in McDonald's local.
The networks that are disabled can be said the "Templens" sports from the restaurant are expected to be our best friends, the representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
It is a victorial winner whose football is obtained.
Come on, you can say!
To obtain a gift, it is necessary to respond correctly to eight questions from ten.
- I attacked a girl of WADA.
But it wasn't attacked.
I mean, I'm in the patriotic explosion, naturally.
The second question has already been addressed: "If I received a notice of the overlook, should I immediately go to the end-control point?"
I stopped with the B option, "No, I've got one hour."
I've lost, so I say, behaviour.
I forgot that the weakness of WDA would not be expected.
In general, you must be immediately.
Well, at the seventh stage, my situation was very critical.
I was thinking that if I'd be hard to observe the balanced dial because of my flesh graphic, so I can use bioboats to get "adding food substances to improve my productivity."
No, they're not allowed!
Exactly, the answer is made so that Category is not prohibited, but in a number of proposals are rejected.
That WADA plays unrighteously!
What's going on, Russia?
Get away from Ethics, Isnbaev and all our firm team.
So, I focused on the last force, and I wined a accidental football.
Find what you say, ours!
In a victory, I entered the Fitzing Center.
The trainer's count.
It's over 250.
It was surprising that no Russian sportor was found in this threat.
But maybe it's right?
Let the player be trained!
And here's one of our guy's sit down there.
In the way to the ocult.
Don't worry, not a shot.
In the polycline, as well as in all the villages where the pool is, the device is to extract preserveers.
To him on the morning, the enthusiasming call is: "Come with the end."
Furthermore, it is only to move a iron that remembers the door shell, and the preserving made from the Natural Latex of Amazon is prepared to get out of the device.
I took myself alone in memory.
It's not going to make the sports - they've brought them 450 thousand.
As a time for celebration and celebration in the Olympic village, there is a total dilution centre.
In any case, it should be a marked table, recalled that the International Olympic Committee costs a variety of ways for sports $3.25 per day.
The centre is introduced by videographs, bill and tennis tables, on a football and a cookie and some strange devices like video repository.
- I'm interesting in the Ukrainian collection that actively uses dicovine games.
Of course, it could be just that he wouldn't want to talk to someone in the form of the Russian collection, yes and all.
Here, there is a strange path of circumstances in the eyes of the people in the western blue.
The most playing gambling is shown.
In order to spend the whole village, we need not less than three hours.
But if you go, and not traveling on electronics, you're opened and the house of the Canadian shop with the income and chamber with the rebuilding bathroom, and the bicycle office, the work, and the chemistry, and the parking, and the color shop, and the box with the products of the daily consumption, and the e-mail with unique markets (that you can't still survive from Chinese firms), and the bank, and the buses, and photos, and photos.
And later night you, asking, will come to the air of the olive tree, shooted by different lenses, in the memory of the abandoned world of friends and parents of the atlets.
And you'll be under the packaging of the machine, which is uncomfortablely slow to die insects, to think about everlasting.
I mean, the Olimpiade movement.
Someone in this village isn't stopped for a minute.
As long as the rest of the Russian world was breathing, the Australians were not ordered to have been sent to the American Dream Team, which had been in the network.
A little man knows, the news that Inna Deligue wins gold in the XXXI Olympic Games, I got the first one.
Maybe I'm even the only mocky who saw this happening - not considering those who looked like that evening in Carioca.
This can be understood only the real baller.
This is the deep night of Moscow.
The neighbors down down, as always to the night, are smiling and starting unfortunately, but very much to smile each other.
And it's threatening to move the house.
On the kitchen, the curran is no time to go to the market and buy how he asked a new sandwich.
There was nothing understood in the television schedule, so it was just the control of the Match channel, the "Pearth" and in any case of Russia, although it was almost unreasonable.
The Russian is the family of repeats, all the sports there's something in the record.
There are serials translating directly in the ethers.
Hope, of course, at Matt's whole night, a young man cryed in newspapers first about the great half-fill of Delivela, Shanaev, then the gorgeous battle for gold.
It would be logical to show.
But instead of this, the United States, Australia.
I can't say anything wrong about this.
Australians were equally winning, first half of them.
They were placed on the place of the guards from their own large Americans.
As a result, they have been lost, but, as they are now expressed, the Basketball Olympic Tourner will never be previous.
It's all right, but it's close to the battle with De France and on the screen without changes.
In a easy panel, I'm starting to post the channels.
This feeling, the second time the shock is shocked.
Okay, let's go back, to the cable.
There's no thematic "Matchy" phenomenon.
Oh, my feelings, the battle starts.
Some sporting websites do not affect me.
The court Cerfing provides an unexpected but unexpected result.
The Pervoy website provides a direct technical transmission of all restraints that are on this time.
I click on a phenomenon, I'll get gold units.
The degree is excellently contracted, goes forward to the eye - and it is obviously starting a long time.
Italians are almost totally shocked.
We're on one point before the end will hear more than two seconds.
De Franciska is shocked down to Deriguzov, and it turns away, the time ends, the Italian shoes.
You won!
After a few seconds, the Olympic messenger reports about the fourth gold meal.
It's out, I'm the first one who saw it with my eyes.
Insensitive, faithful, afflicted.
The Musulman ' s spiritual management (DM) Tataristan is rejected by the use of Russian language in the sword.
Last night, the DOM forced his ancestors to take fifth preaching only to Tatarese to put young tatters “to study their own language”.
The administration claims that it does not harm the Muslim's right to other nationalities.
Some Kazakhstan ' s dreams say that Tatarian language is not understood by 60 per cent, among whom foreign students, migrants, and its own tatars.
The people are afraid that their preaching in the Tatarian "is not going to the whole hearing."
Last night, the DCM Tataristan decided to conduct fifth preaching in the swords of the Republic only in the Tatarian language.
As the muffin of Tataristan Camille Samuellin stated, this should be a stimulation for young tatars "to study their own language".
"To those who say it's hard, we want to organize the tatarian lessons absolutely free", said Mr. Samuellin.
He added that "decision has already entered into force" and today, in all the swords, preaching "debt to be already in the Tatarian language".
He recalled that D.M. Tataristan issued a "Sura" magazine with standard preaching in the Tatarian language.
The name that's not enough to say in Tatark, "that may be prepared for it."
The DM Tataristan combines more than thousands of income in all the municipalities of the Republic.
According to Muffatia, the five - year - old preaching areas are exclusively carried out in Tatar language.
At the same time, in Kazakhstan a number of swords were previously used as Russian.
In particular, as he stated, this was practiced in Burnav's sword, Zacabana and Eniler.
However, he stressed Mr. Mohammedshin, the leadership was the task that all students possess both public languages, independently of nationality.
"Don't matter what distress the Muslim-Netator couldn't be," emphasized Mr. Mohammedshin, explaining that the preaching itself "is not a binding part of the nams."
This will continue to read the swords and lessons in Russian language.
At the same time, Rafik Mohammedshin said that there was no serious threat to extinction of Tatarian language from the sword.
In addition to Russian and Tatarian other languages, such as Zambic or Tajik, it is not used in the preaching of the Republic.
The decision of DOM was actively supported in the Tatar World Congress Committee.
The executive head of the WCT Rinat Zakiros said "The men are the important part of our national life."
It would be painful if the Tatarian language was gone.
He noted that the preaching was only the "speaking of the smuggles" in Tatarese, but in the executive VCT, "that is right".
The names of the Russian preaching are ready to make the decision of DM, but they believe that it is difficult to understand the priests.
The swords and the rushes.
Many do not understand language.
They will, of course, be disappointed.
"It's supposed to be overlooked," says the Burnav's sword Farhat Mawletdin.
In his words, preach in Russian language even many tatakers because "Russian and schools, and in children, the radio is an indicative."
However, he believes that the swords will continue to learn and learn in Russian languages that are conducted in other days.
We trust in God.
And Allah will show out of this situation."
But about 60 percent of us don't know Tatarian language.
It's too sweethearts, twins, and azerbaijans.
Many go to us foreign students: Africans, Arabs.
"We've been four years as we've passed Russian," said they.
He believes that Tatarian preaching will "we will go to a closer circle and not go to the whole hearing."
But we're going to submit to the full decision.
Just the results of the preaching work will be different.
But it's time to show.
"My, for example, will be easier because the Tatarian is my family," said Gabulla Galililyn.

Anomy Snapchat Effect criticizes as a Asian career
Snapchat claims that the filter is inspired, but some suspects say he is racially free.
The Snapchat tool allows approximately 150 million users a day to change the reality and play personality with ways that are limited to the absorption.
You can convert yourself into ananas, dogs, or persons to the image of Roy Liechtenstein.
Lines are the pieces of instruments that make more than 30 million rejusted villages a day.
Any errors are rapidly known.
The Snaapchat Lines were sent to be a criticism in the past when they were accused of the application of the dark skin of the person or promoting the elected persons as the ideal of the beauty.
So when some users proposed the rings that made them out of space, dentists and tissues, some critics found this racist cardure in Asians -- the Jeltolians.
They asked whether these repeated contractions were towards a more serious issue of the company related to diversity.
In the midst, communications and results of the reports in The Verge and Motherboard were distributed, and on the next day after Snapchat claimed that it had been deleted.
The company proposed: Linse was considered an anam, not as an Asian career.
But experts who know racism not listened, Linz recalled the distressing stereotypes in action.
Others fully rejected the comparison with ana.
In the electronic letter of Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student who was actively shared on the photos, said that the lince was "awesome and at least smooth."
She added that " was hard to face with the comparison of the side of the Asian carriage and the effects of the filter.
This shows that the filter is not just ironic, but the highest level of ironics.
Snapchat is not the only company through these cultural bridges.
The American culture seems to have an integral fight for diversity and inclusiveness, starting from corporate meetings to Hollywood and girls, which we all have.
And the great hearing of young people in Snaapchat, which are racially multidimensional than their old generation, may mean that they are more able to expect understanding.
When one of Snapchat's rings created a painful picture for users, he said in the 25th-year-old Catty Jo, "the path of events is much harder to remain unremarked as previously."
On Thursday, Ju, the product manager and engineer working at the Medium decided to remove its accounting in Snaapchat and called others to do the same.
In the Medium and in the telephone interview, she said that racial oppositions were a cause of inadequate diversity in Sneepte.
Jhu was predominantly discovered by a white company that was only a man and ended her article by the hashtego: #DeleteSnaapchat.
John, who is the American origin of China, wrote: "If they have no sufficient number of unwhite people in the State who could take such decisions, or work white people, they do not work as a position where they can be safe and openly expressed."
Other investigators share their view, expressing the impunity of the fact that Snapchat did not respond to the majority of its questions.
The company does not publish information on the presentation of national minorities in its State by emphasising its status of the private company.
The fourth Snapchat refused to discuss the racial origin of his staff, but, as a reliable person said, the company recently initiated a publisher in order to concentrate the unsuccessfully represented areas of the population and the active attempts to integrate internal resources.
To his side, John said she will keep his accounting record in Snaapchat closed, adding: "I'm interesting if they really need more users like us to have to say that it will not go."
The Military Directorate has been informed of ITIL, reports the Committee of the Congress
The officials of the United States Armed Forces Center have changed the information reports to submit a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the basis of the event on the place, reported the Committee of the Conference in the report issued on Thursday.
The interim report of the operational group established by the Chairman of the Palestinian Committee on Affairs of the VC, the Research Committee and the Subcommittee on Military Contributions has found "widespread disadvantaged " among the analysis of the Headquarter Commanding Service, which claims that the leaders have sent their evaluation of American action to win against the Islamic State.
The Central Commandment, known as Century, is the main military administration in the city of Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
" The information documents identified by the Centre's High Command, generally, gave a more optimistic image of the United States anti-terrorism action as confirmed by real data from the place of events, and were stabilly more optimistic than the analysis provided by other special servants, " said in the reporting news.
“What happened in Century is not acceptable: when the higher leadership represents an invalid analysis, our military sufferings,” said the member of the Party of Ken Calvert, the Republic of California.
The leadership problems in the Centre have reached the most higher organization.
Decimal reports have been identified with details of the inadequate reports in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of American actions aimed at training armed Iraq ' s armed forces provided by the Central Command.
Although it does not contain the final evidence that the Ombudsman Administration members have commanded to fail the reports, he stated that analysis felt that the Centre's leadership needs to represent them more optimistic towards the threat by the Islamic State, also known as IHIL or ISIL.
"But during the first half of 2015, many presss, statements and witnesses of the Center Command in the Congress were significantly optimistic than real events,” reported.
For example, the official of the Centre publicly stated that a large military attack aimed at returning Moselle could already be started in April or May 2015.
Mosul, second to the largest city of Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
“ In the months of the investigation, it is certain that it is known,” stated the representative of Mike Pompeo, the Republic of Canasas.
From mid-2020 to mid-2015, the United States Headquarters Headquarters has shared commands to reduce the threat of IHL in Iraq.
The Republicns have established a operational group when they learned that analysis had expressed concerns that the Islamic State disclosed were phalised.
In promoting the investigation, by the report published on Thursday, the more developed data will be followed.
The main inspector of the Ministry of Defence is the main inspector of the Centre of Research that has not been completed at this time.
The representatives of the Democratic Party in the Palestinian Representative of the United States Congress have published their own data, agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republic of Operational Group.
"In the year 2014 and 2015, Center has established a excessive evaluation procedure on IHL and the Iraqi troops, " said in the statement of the members of the Party of Adam B. Shif, the main representative of the Democratic Party in the Committee.
This procedure, under the words of Shif, "depended on the outcome of the disclosure documents", has harmed the moral status of analysis and "insufficiently reflects expenditure".
However, Shif and the Democratics claim that the White House had not found evidence that the Century House had tried to impose analytics to shoot their arrests under a "designed or political interpretation".
The preliminary results of the Congress investigation were presented on Monday The Daily Beast.
The New York Times last August reported that there was an investigation of the main inspector Pentagon, open after the complaints of the Centko Analytics.
Leader-Commissariat Patrick Evans, representative of Pentagon, said that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the report of the Assembly until the investigation of the main inspector continues.
But he said that “experts sometimes disappear in the views of the complex data process, and the Services and the Ministry of Defence welcome the healthy dialogue on these important issues relating to national security”.
The results of the investigation are a question of whether the purposes of the American Bombers in Iraq and Syria are achieved (which is now more than the representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
However, the last year's statements have been aware of whether President Obama could believe that the Headquarter provides true evaluation of military operations in Iraq, Afghan, Libya and other critical points.
The criticisms made by the Islamic State are repeating the disputes that were placed over ten years when the investigation analysis of Center Gregory Hucker wrote a research article in which he stated that the Administration of George Water Bush, because of many protesters, had been supported by a small number of armed forces in Iraq and did not think that it would be after the invasion of 2003.
Hucker also played a key role in the protest identified by the Islamic State.
Last year, according to the officers, the Hucker team concluded that, despite the public claims on return, aviation aircrafts on oil belonging to the Islamic State did not cause a significant deterioration of the financial status of the terrorism group because it had built temporary oil insurance to sell in the black market.
However, opening was not distributed beyond the Central Command, as reported in the Times September.
The first commander of Centko, General Lloyd J. Ostin III, was criticized last year after witnesses in Senate, which many deputy viewed the extreme optimistic evaluation of war.
General Ostin went to the departure in April and was signed in the Hen Joseph L. in the Headquarter of the Headquarter.

We did not have such productivity in London now.
We have completely changed our views.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the first half of the shooting game at a short distance.
India came to the game without a single victory in the tourism, but the team showed himself to the surprise of the strip and maintained the amount of 1-0 until the end of the third period when Baam took the initiative in his hands.
She made a long passenger with a layer down the left side of the field, then spotted into the middle and sent a smooth to the door, so the Americans gave the advantage of 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez added a final hole in the midst of the fourth period.
The winning was the first to the U.S. tournament of Jacky Briggs, who spended on one floor in each of the first three winners.
She's in the shooting.
Like Bam.
"We are in a good situation right now," Parnham said, but how good it depends on the outcome of Saturday Game.
Without the Olympic Game, "Dzen" baskets
Whereever you had, it's Olimpiade.
The events in Rio-de-Janiro are not safe, and it is a better combination of conspiration and efforts.
It's like the olympic fire, and there's the horrible fake that is transferred from the rent to the powder, to the jinnest, to the triatlonist.
You can't enable TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the cafe and don't listen to Simone Bails, Kate Ledeki or the angry between Michael Felips and Chad de Chloe.
There's another Logan Duley.
Duley, the first participating in the Olympic Games, a sweet sweeter, could be among the remarks shown in the slopetimes that the sponsor and the reliable public roles, if he is a plumb, ginost or even a fectalist.
But a 28-year-old Duley from the city of Lake Force in California is fighting for gold in the olympic swimming pools.
The Olympic fire does not see all the events similarly.
Besides the center, partly in the shadow, there are the species of sports that are not commonly recognized: a fire from a plumatic gun, a shooting, a badminton and a thokowondo.
Brass will always be with us as long as his kingdom is.
But if I'm allowed to be able to protect your personal impairment, let me take your attention to the modest smuggling of the bathroom.
Although bathrooms are an olimpy species since 2000, when they were playing in Sidney, they received so little recognition that many of my requested people had not been aware that they were really related to sports in the past 16 years.
This may be regional inadequacy.
The United States wished and sent sports to the slaughter, they never winned shoes in the bathrooms, and their sports did not go to the finish until 2012.
Chinese and Russians are generally shared with male rewards, and Chinese and Canadian women are women.
Dun Dun from China and Rouzi McClanan from Canada will protect their London gold meal this year.
But bathrooms have an autsyder sharm, in particular because they are rather associated with a circle college than with the Olympic games.
I have to recognize here that I'm not an expert, but just a landed enthusiastes.
They really have a comic capacity — the carcase of unfinished springs — but also the extraction of hymnastics and water tanks, two types of sports, which are mainly combined in themselves.
The word "batut" comes from the Spanish word "el trampoline", which means "trumpling for water rings".
The candidates are shocking on the guiant bathroom, flying in the air nearly 30 feet, and have to fill a series of acrobatic tricks (turns, slows and salt) to the final landscape on the feet.
They are evaluated according to the official Olympic Games programme.
Thirty-two sports from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will be in Rio.
The most distributed Olimpiade Kurs is first.
The applicants should go forward, faster, above and above, and above by gold, sometimes to the finish, and sometimes back and first, there by field.
They are not only trying to finish or older stone, but also to be TV cameras, a different switch: a world or olympic recursion.
This is a deep temptation for good, worthy, even fanatic — and it is enough to make a swimming even the slaughter.
But I think it's a few of the games in my mind.
It's a shooting shooting on his bathroom.
Batuist shipping up.
Move forward is not target.
He or she pointed out that it seems weak as a astronom, fly up, then down, and then without any effort to get up again.
And of course there is no competitive or difficulty in them, but there is no ridicule in all the programs to finish, there is no long-term pieces, just a strange, extraordinary disappearance of time and degradation.
It's the closest to the telephone of the olympic species.
Women's qualifications, and then the finish will go on Friday, transmission at Eastern European time; husbands in Saturday, also at the time.
NBC will translate the finance within the daily programme, starting from 14:00 to both day.
The olympic sumass is expected to be a peaceful, beautiful moment that can easily be viewed in the whole sheep.
And if a growing consciousness can only be achieved by men's sports and objection, as stated in the Wall Street Journal, recently suggested men from the United States, Duly is only waiting for their new excited fans.
Generation protests in Ethiopia, the former United States Union
Year protesters in Ethiopia
Demons that require political change in Ethiopia faced a angry opposition from the Government.
The witnesses say that decades of protesters were deadly blessed during the police clamps.
Is Ethiopia really on the grain of shock?
In the past decade, she was one of the most stabil African countries, the solid Union of West with the rapid development economy.
However, in the past months, the anti-governmental protesters have shocked the country, distributing its territory more.
Only the last week, thousands of people have been on the street, requireing radical political changes.
The Government ' s response to human rights was cruel.
The witnesses claimed that police officers had shot tens of unarmed demonstrators.
Video records from Protests, which are intended to be deleted at the end of the last year or at the beginning of this year, show that the security officers kill young people with balls when they put their hands to the wall.
The Supreme Officer of the United Nations on Human Rights now calls for a careful investigation.
"It was always difficult to keep this country away and will continue to be more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, head of the African Rog project in the international research group.
Ethiopia is the second country of Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by Western.
American military and intelligence services are closely cooperating with ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and almost no country in Africa has received such support from the West.
Ethiopian economy is developing with impressive speed.
Her infrastructure has significantly improved — even a new reward travel in Addis Abbe.
And its streets are normally quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia was a picture of democracy - human rights organizations regularly mention government repressions - the opposition on the territory of the State had been presumed by dissidents actually stopped.
Many of them were sold, sentenced in prison, murdered or escaped in the remote desert.
But that can change.
"If people are constantly dismissed, and they do not leave other options except to protest, the resurrection is up", said Seum Teshmae, an university student in the central Ethiopia.
All youths protest.
The generation is protesting.
The complaints are many, starting from the earth-use, finishing the authority of the Government of Coalition.
After a widely critical election in the past year, the Government and its unions have completely strengthened the opposition and now controlled 100 per cent of the Parliament.
At the same time, the tension around the border with Eritrea grows; the fight against this undefined, confronted border has led to hundreds of lives in June.
Analytics are afraid that separater groups that have been destroyed in the past few years, such as the Oro Liberation Fund or the National Liberation Fund, may try to use the concerns and transfer of arms.
Many factors explain why he has a painful feeling, a few years smiling in the depth of the soul, are now smiling.
First, it would seem to be completely unfair: smartphones.
Only in the past few years a large number of ethiopians have been able to share in social networks, since low smartphones have become common and internet services have been better.
Even when the Government closes access to Facebook and Twitter, as it is often happening, especially during protests, many people still find the opportunity to share through server proxy which hide where they are.
Many young ethiopians said that they were organized for protests.
Second, there are more solidarity between Ormo and Amhara, two major ethnic groups.
Ormoo and Amhara are not natural unions.
Over the centuries, Amhara, from the best Christian high-quality regions of Ethiopia, has prospered in policy and business, Ormo, many of which are Islamics and live in lower areas.
But that's also changed.
"We will act at a single start," said Murata Gemeich, leader of Ormo.
The major protesters went in Amhara and Ormo.
Many of the Amhara and Ormoo feel that Ethiopia is injustly dominating members of the Ethiopia ethnic group that represents about 6 per cent of the population and controls military and discretional services, trade and policy.
The third reason for concern is the loss of Meles Zenaoui.
Meles, former leader of the Ethiopia Prime Minister of 17 years of age, engaged in the death of an unknown disease in 2012.
He was considered to be tactical, a person who could predict the danger.
Analytics argued that he had particularly identified the first signs of injury and used researchers to obtain data and reduce against persons.
"The current regime has no fair meaning," said Abdi, analysis of conflict situations.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalney, appeared in there and took place with Melisa.
Unlike Melesa, which was the birth of the Tunisia region in the northern Ethiopia, Yalemariam, Southern.
Analytics say he does not use confidence in the security services controlled by Yougae.
Many are afraid that it will lead to further bloodprostitution.
The last time, Ethiopia had survived such concerns in 2005, after thousands of people protested against what analysis seemed to have been elected by the Government and then made results.
Many protesters were killed during the following repressions, although less than the last months were compared, and this period was relatively fast.
Development experts expressed appreciation to the leaders of Ethiopia for a daily development of infrastructure, such as a new trail trail and significant success in combating poverty.
But it is obvious that it did not stop the growth of internal illness by the Government of Ethiopia.
And it takes a dangerous ethical form.
Last month, the protesters in Honduras, the city of Amhar, attacked the companies belonging to the Tunisia and the anti-Tyghurian hatred becomes a comprehensive number of social networks.
Analytics claim that the Protestants are the United States and other Western Unions in an unfair situation.
The American Government used Ethiopia as a base for unpilot fleet over neighbouring Somalia, although recently declared that the base was closed.
From one part, it is clear that western wishes to support democracy, but he did not want to lose his unstabile force in the region.
"And it will be hard to go over this pressed Canada," said Abdi.
Donald Tramp explains his statement that IHIL was based on Obama, "sarpam"
Donald J. Tramp tried to forget the last conflict covering his predicted headquarter on Thursday, claiming that he was smiling several times this week that President Obama and Hillar Clinton were "building" of a terrorist group of Islamic State.
The explanation made new questions relating to the opinion of the candidate on the President of the Republic of the Republic of America.
It also set his Vice-Chairpersons who tried to protect him during the angry period because they had to explain the statements he probably did not mean.
He expressed this proposal on the midday night, Trump urged his approval on Thursday, repeating the interview that he really wanted to say that President and Clinton founded IHIL.
But in the afternoon at Twitter, the morning, on Friday, Tramp wrote that he was just swimming.
This post was a direct contrary to the approval made all day before Traamp claimed in several interviews that he was absolutely serious in his accused.
When the Radio-Organist Hue Huit tried to help Trump to relieve the statement, he recalled that Obama wants to destroy IGIL, the candidate at the position of the President of the Republic of the Party had not been used.
The last scandal was discovered when Trump tried to reorientate its economy on the background of the rail reduction.
Tramp and Clinton were discussed with competitive issues about the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to this theme.
And again, he warned that Clinton's plans would lead to a increase in taxes and said that she was sweet.
The trampo has used the shrine as a correction.
At the end of July, after he urged the whole criticism, almost expressed the idea that the Russian e-mail of Clinton should be inflicted, he later explained his comments, saying, "I'm swear."
This approach allows the Trumpus to go beyond the limit of the permitted in the political speech and his brothers to return if necessary.
"I think that's his way to test the communications that have a response among his worshipers, to look at how they work and then to explain them in one or another side, depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert on the language analysis of both candidates.
But I also think he's careful in his statements and knows that they're sufficiently dispatched to treat them differently.
Instead of shutting expressions for a wide electorate, Tramp has taken more legal tone in the past days while its racing continues to fall.
The New NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Thursday, showed that Trump enters Clinton with a large overflow in Northern Caroline, Virginia and Colorado and goes with it in Florida.
Although Tramp is generally trying to forgive the prominent matters, he often accuses its critics in wrong interpretation of his words and unreasonableness of his humor feelings.
But as Trump became an object of higher attention in the last months of the President-Chairman's campaign, his shoes had put his faithful unions into an unlawful situation: they should be publicly supported by what kind of statements it would have been.
Rudolf W. Juliani, former Mr. New York, who is one of the most famous Vice-Presidents of Trampa, has made severe efforts to protect the candidate to the interview given by the CNN on Friday.
"I think he said is a acceptable political comment," said Julian when he asked for the approval of Trampa that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
That is true that IGIL was almost an unknown small organization, and he called it an unrepresented threat, absolutely injustly, and that is why it happened, because he had issued the army from Iraq.
The majority of the Mediterranean Republicans believed that the Obama Administration, in which Clinton was employed by the State Secretary, allowed IHL to disappear, since he was not grateful to control the situation in the Middle East.
Before the minute in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to attack the media in Twitter for the dismissing of each of his words and forecast.
He was shocked about the "weakening" television experts that try to think about him, and said, "He's weak!"
Some democratics expressed the justice of Trampa as the most reaffirmed that it would not be paid to the Presidents.
Sometimes the extraordinary coffee returns to Greenpoint
The Verb coffee was a shock, which was only a perfect place in Williamsberg, where it wasn't Wi-Fi, but gave a good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, it was removed from her place with the vitrine at the Bedford Avenue.
The Soup Sheri Magazine, which took the Verb Year 2014, is sell a mile in the cases form.
Local people pleaded it as the last loss of the updated city.
"New York is always changed, I know, but I can't believe that CBGB's dead, the hotel Chalsey is destroyed, and the Varb is now a shopping."
But some New York is constantly changed, he's up-to-date.
The born coffee "Werb" was opened in November last year in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original place.
The new "Werbe" has Wi-Fi and takes credit cards, but some of them remained the same staff and the same simple atmosphere.
Cafe is still good.
The new "Werba" chapter is Simon Rodriguez, an old official of the old coffee, who is the owner and the general manager at the new place.
He started working in the Verbe in 2001 and was there until the end.
When one of the customers suggested that he was on the new place, he said that it would be joyful.
Rodriguez, 36 years old, left a lot in the previous view.
"Werb" works with the same Bagler Divisioner and has purchased the same model of coffee.
It has even been established by the old Verba.
But Rodriguez said he would also want to experiment.
He proposed new observance.
The sandwich is presented in the menu, with becon, eggs, and sweet, and is available in the use of powders or smells.
There's a guard from a bleeding quality.
The coffee doesn't get a drink anymore, but now they're preparing sweet sucks.
9 months later, Rodríguez said that he had focused on the unmarried flow of old permanent clients.
"A few former customers have also issued prices from Williamsberg," he shared.
One of the recent resurrections Rebecca Olivier was one of these customers.
Oliviera, 34 years old, lived in Williamsberg and often visited "Werb".
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she was still in there.
After the Verba closed, she said she stopped drinking coffee at some time.
"I understood the coffee and the atmosphere put me in the Warbe," she said.
Now she's drinking a coffee again, although at that day she ordered a coffee purchased, another news.
Tom Cental, another old customer, was dedicated to visit Verb since 2003.
He was in front of the work and ordered the same.
"In 15 minutes of the eighth, every day, as at hours, I came, and for me prepared my bag with a mass and all the starts," he said.
Rodriguez said that he wanted to experiencing and introduce new observances in the menu.
Cental still makes a common order today, but he has ever changed something with bicon, eggs, or bagels with all starts.
Rodriguez said he wasn't on the dinner that the shop had ever owned a old place.
Moreover, the Soup Sheri owners suggested to make a special milk for "Werba", using coffee coffee prepared in a cold way as ingering.
"I think we may agree on their proposal," said Rodriguez.
The permanent inhabitants of Greenpoint of Poland also loved this coffee.
One of these new clients moved the menu into the Poland language, and Rodriguez said that he plans to find a place for him in the winter so that his new neighbors would feel desirable.
The new place has other benefits.
The local socket point is planned to differ on the bottles and to sell the coffee prepared in a cold way.
There is the possibility that the coffee will join its neighbor building.
For many customers, the new Verb includes their favorite observances in the menu.
Joseph Whitt was a permanent client and told him he was killed by a pain when they closed.
When the coffee opened to a new place, Whitt said that I entered and commanded a coffee, he feeled like it returned home.
"When long I wanted to feel this aromatic," he admitted.
Depressive food of depression in "Pluto Trapey"
In March 1933, as soon as the Chairman's post, Franklin Delano Roosevelt would eat at the Olympic Office.
As a gurman, President Ruizell loved the Fifth Avenue, for example, the Fifth Avenue and the Mediterranean Capital Soup.
His menu at that day was more modest: sweet eggs in tomate soße, sweet powder and sweet powder.
"This was an act of culinary solidarity with people suffering," said Jane Gigelman.
Her husband Andrew Cow added: "It was also a message to the Americans about how to ask."
The couples living in Brooklin-Hites are food history specialists.
The last book of the Coua, "Lagu Po China", was dedicated to the Chinese kitchen in America, and Gigelman told the history of life in the coal apartment in the low East Side by eating in his book The 97 House on the French garden.
The new joint work of the "Please Trapey" which will be published on Tuesday is the history of American food in the Great Depression.
When they showed their own culinary solidarity, they met a dinner reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small shopping area in the Flatian Quartal, which works since 1929 in the Birdshaw Bay.
Giggelman, 54, assigned a slipper and a butterbow with oil shoes, and Cou, 57, took an indic, a cartone and a fruit smell.
When the reporter ordered a meat route, the couple read the appropriate shipping point for the discussion on food at the Depression era.
"The roulets used a larger question," said Gingerman.
There was a swimming steel, a swimming rule, a bomb routine.
They were made from the main ingringant and milk products that allowed the ingredient to increase.
Imagine that you eat so much as you need for dinner.
Cou's been threatened.
"It's sure he was in a stone fat," he said.
In the years before the American Table Depressed, especially in the rural area, the Swedish table was represented.
Women's groups were prepared for farmers, and the swimming swimming snake was set on the breakfast, dinner and dinner.
The Americans have sent food to the hungers of Europeans during the First World War, and the “Please Trapey” describes how the country has seen soon that the country was stopped to be a nation.
"It was time when food became a central, unfair topic for the Americans," said Cou, explaining why he and his wife decided to write this.
The new budget ratio was so simple: remarkable observances, such as routines and safes, became the main food products; the insurance is " a wonderful way to clarify food", noted Gingerman, because the shoes could hide non-appetitive inherents under a sweet soak.
The fresh fruit was replaced by more decorative sugars.
The meat has become the economicly distributed forest during many years of the former American food.
People were worried about strange shocks, because energy and food values were more important than the skin and even the culinary sense.
In the study of the book includes receptives, Gigelman prepared the epoch of the epoch: a sweet swallowing grain.
"This addition to the dinner table was not successful," said Cou.
Zegelman added, "This was very strange."
The skin oil is perfectly not going to the smell.
This was characterized for many household receptives.
As ever since then, household specialists, including Louis Stanley, head of the Federal Office of households from 1923 to 1943, have managed food addictions in the country.
Public receptives and articles in newspapers and magazines recommended women to become “budgetary constitutors” to accept calls and to convert the torment of losses spaghet with marble in a fascination.
The "pleasant trapese" is the shock of loved experiences historical facts.
Specifically, the reports of the Government's reactions to the hunger citizens, such as the position of President Gerbert Gubert, in the spirit of "the powers of the pigs".
It was publicly transferred by a simple farmery state of the Iwa State, which was timed by her child, and was a million of people who had become.
"He liked the continental kitchen, for example, a fish with a sweet soup," said Cou.
He eats almost in a shocked table, shocking.
He was fantastically disfellowshipped from reality.
The President Rutzell could make the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not recommended to give him an example of his own desire.
As says in the book, Eleanor Roosevelt launched a economy that was not perfectly interested in the shooting, and that resulted in that the White House had "not only used the most unique food in Washington but sometimes and at times the most reversely prepared".
Many of the culinary receptions of the Depression era were forgotten when the country was resurrected again.
Their heritage is our continuing focus on calories and food, says Zegelman, and how science has been used in the preparation of food.
The couples say that during the writing of the book, they have better understanded the nutrition of Zegelman’s mother — that she couldn’t eat, for example.
"It was seriously scared of a malnutrition with food," said Cou.
Zegelman recalled: "He has fully seen people."
It was one unfortunate case with profiles.
When the bathrooms in Eisenberg's past, they and Cou got the department that prepared the house: a department from a sweetheart that President Ruizell eat for dinner.
"This is called a sweet smell," said Gigelman, adding that it was distributed to give modest breast receptors.
It was not only bleeding, but also a little swimming, swimming, water, and swimming.
All of them were loaded a lie, raw, and sweet substance.
It was amazing.
Two times, they requested an additive.
He said to her wife, as a reliable budget provider, "There would not be hindered by no ruling greek shoes here."

The company of Gilead Sciences Inc has the right to repay the costs of law entitled to the case of the patent of hepatitis C with the manufacturer of Merck & Co Inc, decided to the Federal Environment Court.
In June, Gilead company was released from $200 million of damages for the violation of two market company patents with regard to the drugs of Gilead companies, sales leaders, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the American Court found a number of violations from the market company, including false convictions and other non-ethic actions.

Clinton paid $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of the federal tax rates
Hillary Clinton has published its tax statements for 2015, which showed that the candidates to the President of the Democratic Party and her husband had $10.75 million income and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent in this year.
In 2015, Klinton received $1 million in the Clinton Fund, mainly the former President Bill Clinton received about $5,3 million in the form of expenditure soldiers, and the former government secretariat declared the income of $3 million from Simon & Schuster for its book of residence in the State Department.
The Potential Vice-President, United States Senator Tym Keen of Virginia, together with his wife, Anna Holton, has made tax statements for 10 years.
In 2015, they paid the effective federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
"Hillery Clinton and Tim Keen continue to establish financial transparency standards", said the advisor of the predicted stage of Clinton Jennifer Palmier.
In full contradiction, Donald Trump is hidden by detailed judgments and violates its last promises to promote its tax declarations.
This is the common case for candidates to the President of the United States to publish their tax statements, although they do not require the law.
The New York businessman Trump and his lawyers called a verification of the State Tax Service as a reason for his refusal to promote their tax statements.
"Our path," wrote in Twitter the predicted stage of Clinton Yan Sams, as a matter of the declaration of the candidate from the democratic party.
In Friday, the Special Adviser Michael Coan said CNN would not allow Trampo to leave them before the verification was completed.
The Trempa Critics, including the candidate to the President of the Republic of the Republic of 2012, Mr. Romney and other Republicn meetings, said that he refused to demand questions on his status, his welfare contributions, his business operations and other links, including Russia.
Clinton was disappointed for this issue, and on Thursday, a online video was issued, where the main place was deleted to the Republicans who avoided Trampa to generate tax accountability.
On Thursday, she addressed this issue during the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what everyone did without the exception of the candidates to the President for decades: to publish its tax statements," she said to be gathered.
The Political Journal reported that Traamp had not paid any or almost no tax in the 1990s, and New York Times' business adviser had quoted many tax lawyers and buggers that may still remain in the case.
The federal tax rates have become a object of conflict on the presidential elections.
Clinton supported the rules referred to by a billion investor Warren Baffitta, which would ensure that those receiving more than 1 million dollars a year would pay tax rate at least 30 per cent.
The Chairman Barak Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clynton last week in Omaha, in the Nebraska State, Baffitt, whose Conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based there, proposed to meet and exchange tax declarations.
Baffittet said he's also under the IRS control, and that Tramp was scared not tax collection agency, but electors.
The Clinton Previous headquarters has generated tax declarations until 2007.
Clintons who are now living in Chappaku, New York, have paid the average federal tax rate of about 32 per cent from 2007 to 2014 and the effective co-acquire tax rate of about 40.5 per cent.
Clinton's 2015 declaration showed that only $100 were paid from their revenue.
Their main investment was an inadequate index fund, and the Clinton stated that the capital was $109,000.

Conservation of Chile and Fairwalls increases the protection of dance slopes
The trafficking in the environment in Tanzania uses an untraditional way to prevent the sleeves of the pools of the people’s pools — they cast the preserves filled with a sweet chiles.
The method was effective, and the organization of Honeyguide Foundation, which was headed over this idea for a few years, together with the American Natural Protection Committee, has taken its promotion, training volunteers in northern Tanzania to use the non-weapon-fighted steps to protect their homes and visits without prejudice to animals.
Many of them used cops to protect themselves.
Thursday, the World Day of the Sloans, dedicated to the protection of animals.
"When we have developed instruments ..., we look at changes in the relationship within these communities, as they are much more sure that they will not be able to put shoes on their fields without causeing harm, " said the executive director Honeyguide Damien Bell.
The first two steps are in the slowing of the fake before the slopes of the slope and the signals with the corn.
If it couldn't be declined, they're cutting the name of the "that."
The cheese of the post is shocked with the boy in the preserve, and the end of it is closed, only the filling remains outside.
When the swimming snake is shocked with a snake, a small snake swimming in the air.
One dunning is usually enough to turn the slopes to the other side.
The main measure is a launching device that shoots the Roman shoes in the air by making soft, light explosion.
In Turkey, 32 Turkish diplomates have not yet returned to that year, which left the country after the trial of torment in July.
These data brought chapter of the MID Turchia Mevlut Chauschhol, in contact with local journalists.
At the first stage, we sent 208 officers to continue to work in the centre.
32 persons without objective reasons and explications have not returned," said the head of the Turkish external state.
Let us recall that in July the attempt of public shift has occurred.
The Governments of the country have officially stated that the detention of more than six thousand people had been detained, among which military responsibilities of higher and medium-sized bands.
As a result of the trials of the slaughter, Turchia has died 290 people.
The Jewish register closely discovered the Berlin hotel for the removal of the Israeli phone code on the Arab "Probe" channel, reported the RT News channel
The French director of the Jewish origin launched a scandal in the media, discovering that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin is not in the list of the phone codes of Israel, and the servants are referring to "prosections" from the Arab clients.
Crow Lanzman, author of a documentary film on Holocaust Shoa, expressed its gratitude by Kempinski Bristol in Berlin, wrote an open letter in German FAZ media.
During his recent stay in the Lanzman hotel, Israel tried to find the phone codes provided by the hotel.
However, the country was not mentioned among States where it could be called directly from the room.
How could it happen that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of New Germany, Israel was excluded and eliminated?
Lanceman wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol provides the opportunity to take Israel through its own phone service center.
In searching for explanation, the register addressed the question to the housing administration.
The answer he received there, according to Lanzman, "shocked him."
Clark's hotel said that this measure was "decided by the Kempinski network leadership."
The argument, standing on this step, called a larger wrath of the regainer.
“The majority of our Arab guests, and they needed Israel's code to be removed,” said Lanzman, the hotel servant.
Israel's embassy in Germany Jacob Hadas-Handelsman called a case of “terrorized struggle”, reports the Southdeutsche Journal.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
That's actually a terrible shock.
What happened in Germany, and that is, in this network of hotels, there is a larger shock.
I don't need to explain here.
We hope that the hotel will make the right conclusions," said the official.
The situation called a small resonance in the Internet; people called it scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski hotel was simply "going on the matter" in the prescribed Arab clients' requirements.
"It would be shocked," said in the other floor where it was indicated that the hotel situated on the glorious Kurfurstendamm Street is close to the synagogue.
The El Spiegel newspaper reported that the hotel itself was quickly in place of any accused accused.
“There was no direct order to include Israel in a rapid list,” quotes the representative of the Kempinski newspaper of Suddeutsche Journal.
She adds that code is now added.
The police uses smooth gas and rain guns against protesting Brazilian students
Students gathered the police in the Brazilian city of San Paulo, on Thursday, when they were gathered to protest against government reforms of public education.
The police used smooth gas and rain guns against protesters.
The degree began when police officers tried to shoot students, resulting in the use of rain bombs and waste gases.
A number of hundreds of students participated in the demonstration to express their concern on plans.
In accordance with the proposals by the Governor of the State of San Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, almost 100 public schools will be closed, and 3000,000 students will be redistributed to seen money.
Some protest participants could have been seen in writing on the walls of graphics against the temporary responsibilities of President Michael Theater.
The last protest took place only a few days after the protesters were on the street to support the distracted President, Dymo Ruseph, when Senator of the country proclaimed for its inscription.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71 per cent, reports the RT Business port
The decrease of trade sanctions between Moscow and Teheran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the previous year, as the Russian Ambassador in Iran in Jagaryan.
As international sanctions against Iran have been deleted, Russian companys have seen an interest in conducting business in the country, he said the ambassador.
Russian companies are re-linked with Iran, and new companies are ready to get market access.
Of course, the further enlargement of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,” said Jagaryan.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, the trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 and was $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports in Iran increased 91.5 per cent and up to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased 16 per cent, up to $158 million.
The increase in trade has been achieved through machinery, land transport and weapons,” said the police.
Jagaryan also predicts that Russia is visiting the recursive number of Iranian tourists in this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic representative in Iran issued about 350,000 Visa, mainly tourists and citizens of Iran.
Furthermore, Iran first entered the number of tourists visiting Russia to the stream of 20 countries.
We can say with confidence that the last year's recursement of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be killed,” he said.
At the same time, relatively a few Russians visit Iran, which is hoped to change.
"I personally recommend to visit the city of Isfahan, Shiris and Iron, in which the memories of ancient Persia civilization are in good condition," he said.
The State continues to shut up the hikes in the defence-industrial complex.
The "Sistematic incompletion" of the Congress General Almas Antheus, the "deliveration in the work" and the "reliable loss of confidence".
In the nearest three years, the NGO manager was appointed by Gennadei Benders.
Only on Thursday evening information was appeared and not called a wide media resonance.
How to explain such silence in the conditions of the enlargement of armed army?
Indeed, the RF leadership does not want to distribute any hearing or negative proposals in the public environment.
This reaffirms the fact that there are numerous problems in the Defence Industry Complex, and the State does not want to attach its increased attention to society.
The elimination of the disadvantages is, of course, the important events in the area.
NGO Almas is the main company of a concert that specializes the production of semi-radio-radio-based structures (COD).
Actually, Almas has work on the establishment of the CRC Poliment Reedot and Morphei, which are planned to establish new roots, frozens, smiles and cruzers.
The founder of the Military Russian Dmitrie Cornev believes that the release of the slow-scale of the projects was expelled.
This version is the most logical.
For example, the development of Morfeia began in 2007, and the entry into the strip was prescribed in 2013.
The " Roadcast policy " should be the main system of OMS on the new IMF ships.
For the information I receive, the tests have not been made for a few years.
The truth I can judge is that there's no unique Almaza fault in this, said Cornev.
The expert is afraid that the delay of the exploitation input may also occur with the "S-500".
Experience-building work has not yet been completed, but in 2016, the first complexs must be in the army.
The Minobourne believes that “the work is planned and all will be completed in the deadlines”, although the State has recognized the existing problems with the development of P-500 in 2014.
It is difficult to evaluate the professional quality of Nestradov, guided by Almazuma since 2011.
Cornee stated that project ruptures may be both the cause of freeship.
It believed that in the past few years it was extremely difficult to get information on internal processes in the COP and undertakings plans.
The section has received long-term orders for tens of thousands of rubbers, and large money, as they know, love the tranch.
In general, the director of defence companies includes posts on their own desire, on the treaty of the parties or are translated to another work.
In that case, the elimination occurred publicly, or not received a resonance.
This emphasizes the fact that Almaza's leader could have been a strict structural and resisted to the above-based "reactors".
As a result, the State is not intended to be peaceful with such a manner.
The shareholders will defeat those who prefer to oppose the Minoboron installations and do not carry out the tasks laid down.
At the same time, RF leadership is trying to punish the slaughtered administrators (the maquination of the Star).
A higher attention to the sector is the President.
Vladimir Putin calls on the Military Industry Commission and regularly held meetings dedicated to the transition.
Kriml protects several COP management managers, trying to have a loyal composition of directors that will be carried out above.
This is a far unfair policy, but it has not been the absence of corruption and the absence of normal competitiveness in the COP other instruments in the State.
The situation in the defence, of course, is not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical situation encourages Kremell as soon as possible in order of armed forces.
In parallel with the "purpose" management of the CFR, RF has taken successful steps to enhance the Russian army professionalism.
The army has received a new quality as a minister of Defence of Sergey Shaugu.
It is the impression that the President has taken on the weapon the famous speaker "Peace is ready to war".
During the cold war, the USSR military force and the nuclear party reached in the 1970s have brought to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which has strengthened the Moscow influence area on the continent.
With all the lack of bipolar system, she worked effectively.
The absence of war on the European Continent and about the stability situation in the Middle East.
Tradition of “winners” in the cold war was finally enhanced by international terrorism.
After a series of terrorists in Europe and the United States in the civilization world, I hope there was no peaceful cloud.
Despite the general disaster, the West refuses to speak with Russia at the same level.
In such conditions, the only associators of our country remain the flag and army.
The strengthening of military power allows Moscow to remain more effective for the national interests and to go into the new parts of the world policy.
The Skotlandian Calum Skinner spends on the finish line, resulting in the shipping gold of the British
Scotland, Calum Skinner, was a triumph in a man's bicycle team at Rio last night, resulting in which the command triumph was protected from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old borner of Glasgo was the most powerful of his cousin, Sir Chris Hoy, who had made his own, and the young man was honoured in his history, spending on the final line to escape the victory of the Favorite team from New Zealand.
Britain declared the right to an unexpected victory four years ago, wining Hhoy declared the right to five of its six Olympic gold meals.
And they repeated the trick, since they were modestly finished in the sixth Mart World Championship in London, despite the end of the carriage since then.
The question between Peking and London was replaced by a member of James Staff.
They did the same time when Hindes appeared.
He also created a whiteness that Kean Emmadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Scinner was a man who was holding the British trains, seeing the capacity in Skotland, which is now being implemented.
Hindez, Kenny, a champion with Hoy four years ago, and Scinner set the Olimpiade refund for qualification, but the standards were overlooked in the first round of New Zealand.
And the British Trio wins the duel for gold.
Hindes was exactly behind his circle, but Kenny shocked the team forward, and Skyner supported.
The change of the strategy was a larger part of the reform where Hindez went to a greater transfer to Kenny and, in particular, to Skinner keep the time.
He looked at his place as an invitated BBC expert and captured the view of Skyner, Kenny and Hindes when they entered into the beach.
23-year-old Scinner from Glasgo said, "This is a simple comparison."
I'm here to make everything possible and make my own name.
We set the Olimpiade Record in the Final and win the Champions of the world.
That was incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After the triumph in London in 2012, Kenney and Hoy acknowledged Hindes to be a train after an unexpected age.
He later refused to comment, and there was no way to appeal from the Great Britain competitors.
There was no question at this time in the greatest victory.
And he said, "I felt like in London, with all the flames of Britain on the court."
We've all met the team in the last three months.
We played in so many shoes with the world's name that the oil was just awesome.
This is one event, one gold medal for the country who wins seven of 10 named hole in Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of progress made in the past five months, the wheel will wait for five successful days.
With the demonstrated Kenny, it is not possible to imagine how he repeats the Goy ship, wining three oil meals in one game.
This would be possible to see how Kenny, which was just 12 years older than Hoy, also born 23 March (the sacred date in the British sport, which is also the day of the birth of Steve Redgreev, Mofarha and Roger Bannister), has reached its account to six gold meal and one silver.
That would be like Hoya.
The next time Kenny is in a spring that begins today and is slowly over three days.
28-year-old birth from Bolton said, "I just like that now.
The commands are always the best.
You're coming to win your friends.
A little one to win one if honestly.
He said, "If he wins two other gold meal, he must get the market."
It was the only day of medal playing, but it was the following good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Cranes, Steven Berk and Owen Dull are qualified for the fastest four-kilometer command chair.
They finished at 3:51,943.
The world refund established for the winning of gold in London in 2012 is 3.5.659.
The first round and final (10:42) events are held today, on the second day of the event where Wilgins will be exactly in the centre of attention.
He had a debate with the Commissioners last night referred to a qualified train when the officials needed to measure his weight.
In the relevant event, which is renewed and completed tomorrow, Laura Trettot, Joanna Roysel Shand, Elior Barker and Kate Archibald, showed at 4:13.260.
The Great Britain command was trusted in the powerful bicycle team to acquire the Olympic Games in the average period and pay a number of meals.
After the real exceptional demonstrations of full overcome in Beijing and London, the expectations were slowed in a gradual training for Rio.
The second plan was the dramas, not the last time, from the head of Shane Satton's technical office in April, because of the accused of sexism and detection, and the exits of large figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, on the basis of the first weekend, however, it seems to be the legendary of the glory of Britain to reach the top at the right time, perhaps again.
Increased português Metallurgic Industry threatened by the distortion of electrical contracts
The português Aluminium Industry in Victoria, as well as the workplaces of hundreds of workers, are threatened by the fact that the electrical company that uses the company, according to one of the owners of the company, will be prepared to switch the delivery contract: it is planned that all delivery contracts will be switched.
This step is the result of the decision adopted by the Government of Victoria this year not to extend subsidies granted to support the functioning of the plant.
The fixed subsidy for 20 years expires in November.
To 2.000 workplaces may be threatened by the Alcoa company in Portugal.
The total of 2,000 jobs, directly and indirectly, may be in the risk zone as a result of any closure.
Additional outcome may also be, as the metalurgical plant requires about 10 per cent of all the electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed a metalurgical company in Point Henry, which resulted in the closure of the electricity station in Engles last year.
Portugal Metallurgic Company Alcoa loses money and risks closing.
These actions have resulted in the consideration of the future industry that has continued for a few years, in particular because of the strong positions of the Australian dollar, and later, because of the prices for the production of the company.
The AGL company, who enjoys a large electricity plant with the Loy Yang A electricity station in Latvia Valli, reported that the other three owners would also take steps to deal with the treaty.
The control share of the company belongs to a joint short-term company of Alcoa and Alumina and the Chinese CITIC and the Japanese company Marubini Corp belong to smaller parts.
"The AGL committee expects that the Portuge object continues to work, namely, that the physical electricity demand from the metalurgical industry would not stop", said it.
According to the AGL company, the contracts mentioned are such as the 'hedged contracts' which should be entered into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month distortion period, so they are actually completed in 2017.
"In line, the AGL company still expects that these contracts will bring their income in the financial year 2017", said the electronic company.
Whatever the potential impact of the AGL company has been income from 2018 to the financial year has been limited to a strong feed market for optical electricity prices.
The AGL company said that the amount of contracts had already been reduced in its account of $187 million in terms of “continued distortion”.
According to the company of Alcoa, the decision to trade contracts "is not influenced by Alcoa's ability to manage a metallurgical company or to provide electricity to the metalurgical industry."
The American company stated that, in 2010, Loy Yang's company had a 20-year contract that had to enter into force in November this year, but she still had to explain why it had disappeared the contract.
Analytics were concerned about the possible closure of the Portland Metallurgic Industry in Victoria, as well as of the Tomago industry along with Newcastle, because of the unpleasant economic situation in the area.
As a result of analysis previously in this week, AGL, Steven Mickelsen, AGL, said that Portugal uses about 600 megawatts annually and Thomas is about 900 megawatts.
If both of these companies go from the market, there will be a significant reduction in the market demand [electronics].
For us it will be bad for the producer," he said.
Not only a reality-shale star to Kardashian, Kendal at the box of the September Vogue
Kendal Jenner, 20 years of age, model and fourth daughter, Kardashian-Denner, mother-manager, Christ, appeared at the fellowship of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendal, who was the face of the Estee Lauder burden, has reported that the news was in the outcome of the Instagram on Friday.
"I was in the room together with my favorite people, I looked at this box and smelled," wrote Kendal.
The news about the board was awesome (or just in the spirit of the Cardashian Family?), prepared by the reality-video, in which the entire family of Kardachian-Janner (deboshir Rob and Katelin, also joined with him the most loved grandmother of the Show-Beznes, the producer of the Cardashian Family), forgotten the appearance of the sisters on the board, and at the end of the classical tour: they planned the evening.
This is the standard surrounding line of almost all the episodes of children's television shows dedicated birthdays (Skiprus expressed the phrase: "Do you think we forgot you?", with the honestity of a multiplex crown out of the 8th morning's program, but Chris needed that this glory could be achieved as well as other girls.
Because with this episode dedicated to the September Vogue, we, indeed, entered in the new era of the Cardashian show.
Let the old sister Kendal Kim goes on the board of Vogue before (he came to her with her husband Cannie Westom in April 2014), but the seventeenth magazine box was its own achievement.
Headquarters are the most sales of Vogue for year.
It seems likely to the giftal publication than the model magazine, it is a large number of publishers (as reported by the Fashionista port, 615 pages of the last year of the 832-strategic publication).
A news about a star on his board is expected that the pictures of the magazine have been opened up in the last two years.
The number of previous women cast on the floor includes Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist and Kate Moss.
In the past few years, of course, there were more "renouncements that work models" than "models that are famous".
The Laureat of Oscar's prize and the face of Dior Jennifer Lawrens was presented at the board in 2013, a year after that honor was taken from Lady Gage.
But even in the poor case, if Jenner, whose magazine describes the model of his generation, is in the first category, it is in a bad company.
These representations are not the parent of famous people, the reality-show stars or modern children who know how to make a good video in Snaapchat (who Gerner falls into all these categories).
These are truly talentous women who are in the industry of distraction.
For the Bayonse last year, this year was one of the most lucky carrières in relation to the Lemonade album.
Of course, it's not all happy for the success of Jenner.
Gerner's situation in the world of mode, as her last star of television reality show, had always been shocked.
In June one of the first models of Victoria's Secret Stefany Seamor discovered by Jenner and her colleague, Jilly Hadd, called them "the moments".
These settings have again been broken after Jener's news on Vogue's board.
But it doesn't mean to raise injury.
Kendal Jenner's headquarters of the Vogue.
It is a supermodell in all the meanings of that word.
She's defiant for Mark Jacobs.
She's gonna sell you a tonic krom from Estee Lauder.
She, yes and all her sisters, sell your photos to you in its applications available for pay signature.
She sells his own photos of the daughters of Sindy Crowford magazine LOVE.
And in a free time, maybe still seeing her sister Cortney and her children, she participates in the television reality.
Public legal centres refuse to provide 1600,000 persons per year
Each year, more than 1600,000 defended representatives reject the service of the public legal centres, since this sector is prepared for the effectiveness that will provide further financing for and as long as it has been done.
In Quinsland, three of five people, in the main part, old, immigrants, unprotected works, victims of violence, people who have no possibility to combat unfair ownership, and further, have already been rejected by trying to obtain free legal assistance and representatives.
The public legal services that are already under opportunities are prepared for further reductions.
Since June next year, these legal centres should lose more than 30 per cent of federal funding.
The Director of the Social Rights Centres of Queensland James Farrell said that, according to the recent records of the National Laws Association, thousands have been rejected annually.
Farrell said that if a federal government decision would not be denied, the situation would only be worse.
" The legal centres of Quinsland are continuously inadequate, and that means that thousands are rejected in their vital lively important services, " he said.
Persons from violence, persons with uncontrolled and distorsive debts, families who have divorced unlawful work - all of these people have a legal problem, and this shows that they can not receive assistance that they need.
The Federal Government will be funded by 30 per cent since June 2017, which means that thousands of protected people of Quinsland will be required to address complex legal issues without assistance.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Senator Quinsland George Brandis to immediately decline these reductions in the financing so that people can receive necessary assistance when they are addressed to legal problems.
In the past year, the Government fulfiled its commitment to fund free legal assistance to the average country indicator.
It has now been time to focus on the needs of public legal centres and communities, their customers, and the Government of the Palestinian Government to take into this important work.
At the predicted stage, Donald Trampa was sent to the court after the staff was deemed to be threatened by the gun
According to the New York report, at the predicted stage of Donald Trump, he was sent to the court: as he stated, he did not take anything after reporting that his operational director in Northern Caroline threatened the gun when they went to Jipe in February.
The university was described in the trial in the middle of the court in Charlotte Vincent Bodney, an ex-agency instructor in the State ' s pre-selective headquarter.
Bourdney said that he waited for a few months to make the problem in the internal state, but he realized that it wouldn't happen.
Director Earl Phillip, "It's got a weapon, put his right instruction ball on a smoke, and shipped a shooting to the Vincent's shooting," says Bourdney in the slaughter.
On the basis of the local and regional office of the predicted headquarters, Bourdney realized that at least four other persons were part of similar incidents with Phillips, they are deemed to be treated.
"The guns don't have to shoot to harm," said Bornnie in the torment.
Isak had only two days after the Chairman's Chairman from the Republic of the Republic of the Republic of the Republic, said to the listeners in Northern Caroline that "The people of the Second Amendment" — understanding as weapons and his favorites — could start acting if his companion Hilly Clinton is elected and elected to judges.
The Previous Stadium of Traampa said that the media had taken his words out of the context and that it was not expressed in support of violence.
Bodney ' s complaint requires compensation from a predicted stage for unclean control, and Philips is a threat to physical violence, the elimination of acts and the cause of moral damage.
The representative of Trampa Hoop Hix, with the answer to the request to comment.
The attempt to talk to Phillip was not successful.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, reported that Philip had recently gone from the predicted stage.

Britain should be sent into the necessary ring of the olimpholic spirit and expanding Hittro.
Hytro also brings recovery and prosperity not only in our coastal population points and in the whole of London but also in the whole country.
As I think, this was the great advantage of Hytro, as it was with London 2012, where we made all the efforts to make our people and regions benefit from the game.
The Olympic Games benefited greatly for Strategy and Eastern.
And we're doing this again, creating the possibilities for local people and the company close to Hittro.
Only for our local populations, we will build 100,000 new shops, 400,000 new jobs and put the end of young unemployment around the airport.
As was before London 2012, those who think that Hittro's challenge is too extensive.
They told me that Britain would never be ready to the Olimpiade games, and that we are in an unfortunate situation of world airline.
Sceptics were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong with Hittro.
There are always obstacles to survive, but Hetro responds to any question raised on it.
Like the Olympic Game, it's a infrastructure project for most, not only for a circle.
Advancement is the possibility to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion feet of economic growth, remaining a heritage and employment around the airport, as well as through the whole United Kingdom.
We have a nice team in Hytro, which introduced the 11 billion infrastructure investment schedule at time and within the budget, from T5, the best terminal chosen for the airport five years, up to T2, built in the middle of the two most operating flights in the world.
Now they are ready to ensure the third aircraft field, confirmed by 16 billion feet of private investment.
The Olympic Games in London in 2012 was a great success for Britain, and I am sure that Hittro will also be expanded.
It was time for us to send the Olympic spirit into the necessary ring and enhance Hittro, to ensure our trade future and to create a heritage of opportunities and employment that Britain could be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton is Chairman of the Hetro Council and former Trade Atlashee of the Championship
Adblock Plus, Facebook plays in a "meek" on the issue of public locking
For enterprises who pay money on the Internet regulations, the attempt to purchase the program for the locking of the advertising is a game in a "cook-cook", as one of the company who creates such a programing assurance.
On Thursday, literally after a couple of days after Facebook announced that the advertising blocks will be blocked at its website version, Adblock Plus published a record in the blog that users can update their program filters to block the public again in social network.
On Monday, the Facebook declared that the website's exact version changes the breakdown around its advertising to make the publishers more difficult to recognise what parts of the newspapers are.
But Adblock now states that he could get a new code.
In its publication, the representative of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "a kind of counter-related struggle between the public blockers community with an open source code and those who try to deal with it is continued since the discovery of the public blocking" and that Facebook may submit its own decision in the nearby time.
The fact that the largest social network has entered in the world is clearly aware of how large it has become the blocking of the advertising for the industry.
About 200 million people have been using public blocks, according to the last year study of Pagefair and Adobe, and almost four times more than those who used this program in 2013.
In view of 1.3 billion daily active users who are on the Facebook via mobile devices, the mobile advertising is now 84 per cent of the Facebook income from the advertising.
However, the company is intended for advertising publishers on the current version, as mobile publishers are inefficace in mobile Facebook applications for social network and Instagram, as the representative said.
However, the advertising in this version represents a sufficient article to make Facebook a valuable stage of investment.
The Facebook also announced that it would be updated by its "regulated preference" tool to provide more control on how the advertising has been subjected to them.
On Friday, Facebook stated that Adblock's new filters were worried, as they will also block some unjustable content on the website.
"This will not be a positive experience for people, and we're planning to solve this problem," said the representative of the Facebook in an official electronic letter.
Advertising blocks are a cruel tool, so we focused on the creation of instruments such as the Declaration preferences to deliver control into human hands.
Women moved to Switzerland's Autostrate to the episode of apparent self-assault
The victim was on the bus in the middle of the night.
The police calls upon witnesses after the woman moved a number of vehicles to the road early on Thursday morning to a clear suicide attempt.
The university occurred at A1 next to the sea in the Canton A immediately after midnight on Thursday.
The woman slowed on the road in the darkness of the disappointment and shooted several vehicles, reported to the police in a statement.
A number of vehicles, including a car, were slaughtered by the Switzerlandn woman in the age of 49.
She died at the place.
Some involved drivers have already been investigated, but some have not yet been established, reported the police that calls them and somebody else who was a witness of events to be rejected.
A criminal case was sentenced, a "logical" step in such a situation, declared a lawyer Jill Hoffstetter Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it should still be cleared whether some of the engaged drivers will proclaim accused.
Could it be possible to avoid a shock?
That's what the Prosecutor must determine," said Hoffstettter.
Two other similar cases in the past five years are allowed to suggest that drivers will not be recognized responsiblely.
Each case, both of whom a person goes in the dark road, has been condemned that automobilists can’t wait for an accidental meeting on the road in the middle of the night, reports the newspaper.
Last year, the officer was justified by the cause of the death of uncertainty, after he attacked and killed a man who was on the A1 at Piern at the night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim of drink and lost conscience on the road, heard the court.
The Court found that a police woman, who responded to the extreme calls, managed the vehicle by a means that was found, and that the existence of a man on the road was " perfectly exclusive and unpredicted situation", said the judge.
Someone who owns information about the event on the Moon is to call to the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Climate model NASA: Vienna was ever known
Venezuela may have ever been known according to the estimates of the new Climate Model of NATA.
The students from the Soviet Institute of Space Studies have developed a model for the study of Vienna's past study, using tools and algorithms similar to climateologists.
The model was designed to determine whether Vienna could, with its sweet surface and the atmosphere of carbon gas, ever existing conditions such as the earth.
The scientists predicted that the small speed of Venezia’s return was explained by its fleshly atmosphere.
However, the last model suggests that Venear may probably have a decreased atmosphere like the earth, and still slowly turn.
The model also examined the fuel of Vienna's early.
The planet, likely, was more surprising regions than the Earth, but there was once enough water and enough geographical change in order to create conditions for life and prevent rapid elimination.
Rane Vener also benefited the sun, which was 30 per cent of the skin.
“ According to the GISS model, the long-term return of Venice submits it to the daily side of the sun almost two months per month,” explained in the report of an scientist from GISS Anthony Del Henio.
This increases the surface of the planet and produces rain that creates a slight slee that acts as a zone which protects the surface of the planet from the substantial part of the sunwarming.
The results are the medium climate temperatures that, as a surprisely, at a few degrees more cold than in our day on Earth.
The model shows the history of Vienna, similar to the development that previously predicted planet researchers.
Despite the possibility of having been contained in Vienna, it has affected too large wounds and ultraviole extraction during a few billion years.
Her oceans have been defeated, and its water pair was survived with ultraviolet extraction.
When her hydrocarbon flying, it remained only a fleshly atmosphere from hydrocarbon gas with the mortal park effect, namely, Vener, which we know today.
Researchers have shared the results of their new climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters magazine.
Patrick Roy leaves Abalanche's train team
Patrick Roy left the train post and the vice-President of the Colorado Avalanche in the Friday, referring to the lack of influence during the decision-making process.
The Executive Vice-President / Chief Kolorado Commander Joe Sack confirmed the news and noted that the club will start looking for a new train immediately.
"But over the past three years, I have performed my duty to the main training and chairman of the Colarado Avalanche with energy, stress and determination," said Roy in a statement.
During the summer, I have long thought about how I could improve the team to bring her the necessary depth and take it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this goal, the vision of training and the vice-President of the Hooky activities must be perfectly consistent with the vision of the organization.
He should also have the right to vote when making decisions affecting the work of the team.
These conditions are not implemented at this time.
Sack, who took Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," said Sack.
We appreciate what he did for our organization, and we want him to be successful in the future.
Roy became the prize of Jack Adams Award as the best liga trainer during its first session with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014.
He brought a club to 112 views and wins in the Central Division, but Colombia was disrupted by Minnesso in the first round of the Offs and lost the tribe of Offs in the last two years.
The Avanche team announced assessment of 39-39-4 at the session 2015-2016, and at five points the Wild team was abandoned in the fight against the second loan journey to participate in the Western Conference.
Roy wins four Stanley Cube, two from Montreal Canadiens and Abalanche.
North Sea ocean neighbors renew negotiations and prepare for availability
Workshops on the payment of oilers in the North Sea were suspended, and all the parties of the debate start to the new negotiations, reported to the leading representatives of the parties.
The winners against the oil company Wood Group were cooperatively organized on platforms in the North Sea, which were conducted by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group and Unions and RMT may confirm that we agreed to renew the negotiations for the authorisation of existing disputes,” states the joint statement.
We will hold a few meetings over the next few weeks, starting from the beginning of the next week to consider a quiet view.
Professionals reported that their recent action, which was the first than 25 years of age, was towards the potential reduction of payments to 30 per cent.
In this year, Wood Group has reduced the rates paid by contract officers working in the North Sea for about 9 per cent because of negative market pressure.
The reduction of taxes from the company has been reduced in 2014 after 10 per cent of contract staff workers.
According to the company, additional reductions will give it the space necessary to overcome the market fall.
She has decreased thousands of people and announced the plans to stop oil activities in countries to 10 because it rationalizes its activities as a result of its mega-megation with the British BG Energy Company.
Energy companies are pressured by the decreasing prices of unconserved oil: the economic situation was worse because of the decision to get out of the European Union adopted in June by the United Kingdom.
The Skotland Parliament, Dave Anderson, met with professional leaders in this week to discuss one of the largest working conflicts in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea said that it was vitally necessary for the regional economy.
"In the North Sea, yes and throughout the country, we need a economy that would work for most, not only for some," he said in the statement.
Mining $1.4 billion for new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, with the average amount of $7 billion for the past five years.
Kepler measures the speed of the slope of the planet to the Plyed
The last mission of the Space Telescope Kepler helped astronoms to collect the most complete directory of the slope of the sleeves in the collection of Praids.
New data help the astronoms to understand why the stars are converted to different speeds, as well as the return periods are focused on the development of the planet.
"We hope that comparing our results to other star collections, we learn more about the relationship between the mass, its age and even the history of the sun system," reported in the press of Louis Ribal, a Scientist of the Inflation Centre and analysis at the California Technology Institute.
The collection of Plaid is in 445 light years from the Earth.
Many of the stars in the sculpture are now only reached by shocks, which have been born about 125 million years ago.
They're angry as fast as they will never be.
In their slow speeds, these growing stars select large numbers of star winds.
In turn, the magnetic fields of the stars, these winds are on the stars of a stroke.
As the stars are old, its shift speed begins to late.
Kepler measures the speed of turning each star, over the time between the appearance of the known five stars — such as sunfire.
The new directory of return speed suggests that more massive stars are slower than less massive stars.
Ribal compares the stars to the dancers: larger pirates make slower than smaller.
"In the "plaid" we see that those who turn slowly, normally more massive, while those who are slower are usually related to very slow stars," said Ribal.
Since the collection of Plyad is close, it serves a perfect space lab to compare the properties of the star with the speed of return.
"Plajada's summer collection provides a shipping point for theoretical models of turning the stern as well as older," said Ribal.
We still want to know how and why the stars slow the speed of their turning and slow to their "thinks" shoes like that.
Ribal and her colleagues have detailed their last analysis of Plyad ' s returning speed in three new articles that will soon be published in the Astronomy Journal.
A study related to the activities of the group detained in the Ukrainian divergence in Crema, writes "Commercant".
The ECB has set evidence of the responsibilities of detainees to prepare diversity in Krue.
As previously reported, the acknowledgement was given to the inhabitants of the Ukrainian city of Energydar Eugene Pana, who agreed to cooperate with the consequences.
He said that he was an object for diversity, and he considered the chimpanzee of the Titan in Armenia, the petroleum in Feodozoia, the Kerk Party Transformation, the Gas Guide, and one of the military aeroports.
The safeguards believe that it is not possible to keep the distributors far away.
This was, in particular, a basis for arresting suspected in the Kiev Paradise of Symphere.
The main trainer of Russia's football collection became Stanislav Cherchez
At the plenary meeting of the Russian football Union, a decision was taken to designate a headquarter of the Russian football train on the Stanislaw of Cherchesus.
The contract will be calculated for two years, before the completion of the CM-2018.
On 11 August, the RFS execution was appointed to the headquarter of the Russian assembled football by Stannigrad Cherchesois.
This is a well-known footballist, who was previously played in the Moscow Spartake on the position of the angry, as well as a trainer with a solid experience of the Russian teams such as Spartack, "Jimjuina-Sochi", "Terek", "Amcar", "Dinamo" and "Legie", which became a victory of the national primary and cube of the country.
It is reported that the contract with Cherchez will be signed in the nearest time and was raised for two years.
Thus, he was responsibilities to prepare a World Championship in 2018.
It is known that in his train head, Miroslav Romanzaco, Guntaras Stauche, Vladimir Palarus.
There are information that the total training stage is 2.5 billion euro per year.
According to the media, the RFS guided the Cherchem ' s goal to test Russia ' s collection to half-final and to acquire the meal.
As the trainer himself stated, he considers the creation of a competitive environment in the team and would give the footballists the opportunity to prove himself.
Also, in the words of Cherchez, he was glad that the choice was on him.
The first shop under the leadership of Cherchez, Russia, will take 31 August in Antarctica, will be a competitive meeting with the Turkey team.
Remember, previously, Leonid Slunchy, who was the principal train train in the CSCK club, took place in the Russian football club.
He declared his departure after the post of the Russian national team in Euro-2016 in France.
He was responsible for the bad result of the collection.
With the desire of Angola and South Africa, Namibia suffered very much during the long-term combating of the apartment.
However, after the decrease of the independence of South Africa in 1990, the country with populations in 2,4 million have achieved huge success, especially in the past few years.
The main reason for Namibia ' s success is that the Government highlights education.
While people in developing countries have been acknowledged as their own comprehensive primary and medium-sized education, in many poor countries in the average and even primary schools they require for education.
Furthermore, Governments are often advised to introduce training payments for expenses.
However, there is free education in Namibia in primary schools.
Furthermore, since 2015, the average education has become free.
The authorities of the country also work actively in other important areas.
Malaria ' s destruction efforts have reduced in the past 10 years of annual disease 97 per cent.
Infringing the international trend of inequality, Namibia is decreased.
In comparison with the 1993 coefficient of Jini, the standard income distribution inequalities, was 15 paragraphs.
Then, 23 years ago, this indicator was one of the highest in the world.
The poverty level has reduced from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (not less than $1.90 per day) has also reduced from almost 53 per cent to less than 23 per cent.
Namibia also has the highest ray of freedom of words in Africa, according to the "Reporters without border".
The country has significantly warned the United States and other rich States.
Furthermore, the country has a favourable racing, one of the highest Africans, in the Index of Corruption, which is the Transparency International.
Even now, when the prices fall on the base, Namibia is able to keep the high levels of growth.
At the same time, GDP debt ratio is about 25 per cent, which is less than 1/3 levels of debt in the United States and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
The unemployed level, at least traditional assessment methods, remains sufficiently high - almost 28 per cent.
As well as other countries in the region, the high level of HIV/AIDS is in Namibia, almost 17 per cent of the population.
According to the assessments of the World Bank, Namibia relates to the number of countries with the income above the average, but the authorities claim that their State is actually a developing country.
Indeed, there are some difficulties faced by the low-developed economies.
The State must develop a very large and devastating country with a small population.
In the territory of the wilderness, isolated tribes of countermembers, which should be integrated in modern society without loss of identity.
The integration of people who had been on the peripheral of the world economy for the fourth century has been an unfair challenge for any country.
For Namibia, it is more difficult: as any other country in the world is, it is with the consequences of climate change.
Nevertheless, Namibia did not think to leave the hands, but the country decided to face the problems.
Shortly after the deterioration of the independence, the establishment of a diversified economy and a collected society was taken.
It is notably that competitive political fractions have gathered together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides peaceful medical services not only for its own citizens but also for its neighbors.
About 15-20 per cent of the medical institutions in the northern Namibia citizens.
No one in Namibia speaks of the construction of a wall that would separate the country from the poor and corrupted neighbors.
The Namibiates understood that neighbors were not selected and therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate with deficit water resources, to participate in regional medical projects, to promote investment and exchange students.
Furthermore, the Government of Namibia had justified that rich natural resources could easily be disfellowshipped by helping poor people by many.
The authorities understand that Namibia's income from natural riches must be contributed to infrastructure and production power.
They also acknowledged that it would be indirectly not to try to obtain the maximum arrival from the sale of countries and to remedy investment laws and contracts in order to ensure that it is.
Transparency is very important for this process, so the Government ' s strong support for freedom of words is so important.
As the head of the Hague Gangeb State noted, the media often speaks about what he did not like.
But after fighting for the freedom of apartheid in South Africa, Namibia should protect the freedoms received, says the President.
Not all the key resources of Namibia are expensive.
Some, such as fishing, are related to renewed, and the Government has made all efforts to maintain and strengthen them.
Another million foreign tourists are visiting the country every year.
The Namibia shows that even those countries who begin with serious deficiencies — racism, colonial structure, inequality and low development — may stand on the way to general prosperity.
Its achievement benefits from international recognition and imitation.
Many have heard about the Star of Warna, the ancient gold objects created by man (4600 to 4200 years before our era).
I hope that this was the most powerful archaeological scene of the 1970s: in Bolgaria, when the barnean non-cropole, there was a fantastical number of gold artifacts, more than three thousand over the total weight of 6 kilograms.
Only one detention known as "power No 43" was extracted by 990 gold objects in general weight more than 1,5 km.
However, the official status of the ancient world's gold could soon be moved to an unexpected kind of busin found by the archaeologists in July of that year.
Once again in Bulgaria, it is known as Tel U.N.C.
Unlike Varna, the port city, Tel Younaccite was displaced from the sea, near the village of the Pazardjik area.
Busin is a golden pool that turns back to a row.
Yvo Boyajiev, the leader of the Discovery in Tel U.N.C., died 4600 years before our era, and said that she was the older of Warna gold at least 200 years.
The Barna's throat is given about the same period, 4600 - 4200 gg before our era.
Technology that allows the data of metals to be given in absolute accuracy is currently not available.
What is the confidence of the older gold?
Of course, Professor Boyajiv knows more than reported by Reuters: "I'm very sure that the gold of the United Nations's older gold of Varna's."
This is an outstanding scope: this is a crooked object, but it is enough to take a similar place in history.
In the interview, Reuters Boyajiv reported that scientists analyze the composition of metals, as well as repeating and more carefully studying the archaeological plastic where gold artificial was found.
This helps to date the browse with the maximum possible accuracy.
There are also many explanations.
Tel, U.N.C., is a famous place, even if you have never heard about it.
At present, Tel U.N.C. is considered the former "reward" of Europe.
Telephone was based on the posts of people migrated in Europe from Anatolia (Current Turkey) in the seven thousands of years before our era.
During the following centuries, burning processing of metals was developed, from the restoration of the first metalurgical skills to the establishment of the fullest industry.
In the main history of this archaeological community, it is a special name: Balkano-Carpate-Metalurgical province.
In the five thousand years before our era around the metal processing centres, the population of the urban type began.
Now they are called the ancient towns of Europe.
Of them, maybe the oldest one of them, because there were 4900 artificials found here before our era.
I would like to call Tell University prototype of the modern city, although it is very old, even compared to Mesopotamia.
“ This is the place of the old Shumere for thousands of years,” said Boyajie, with a general acceptable view that the urban culture was born in the south of Mesopotamia, the modern Iraq.
There was the first city in an accurate understanding of this word.
The scanners of Tel, University, have been carried out since 1976.
At that time, archaeologists have discovered nearly 12 hectares, which is about third of the population’s general area.
The rest of a strong wall was found that has never reached three meters higher.
The houses and the masters are few, but the architects clearly distinguish the streets, the public buildings, the counterparty, the business centre and the lives.
There are decades of bird fibers found here.
All birds are pictured in a calm state, so that they were not decorative objects, but an object of local culture.
The "Structure" was destroyed about 4100 years before our era, perhaps by Indonesian tribes coming from the northeastern.
There were no cities, horses and weapons.
The three-metre-third walls have not stopped them.
Archaeologists have found the apparent signs of a cruel fight: the remains of older, women and children were found within the houses with the injury of the war.
New events and new facts appear to be changed annually, changed with regard to the ancient history of humanity.
Bulgar Archaeologists are often talking not about individual cultures, but on the first "persistent" civilization of Europe in Balkans.
The powerful stimulation of this civilization has become the Varna River, which has recently been found in 1972.
It is logically that the Barna's gold blowing should have been predicting something like a crochet gold sweet created in Tel Youncite.
In Porsche, models 911 Targa were artificially covered
Officially stated that the preparation of 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is carried out manually by units working with series machines.
For example, the "Retro-Luke" is a particular color of Etna Blue, which was developed in 1960 for the Porsche 356B model, which has even been designed in this color.
Moreover, Targa received a company white graph on boards and special RS Spyder wheel disks, as well as some details on the white-speed metal.
In the retro-third interest, it is noted less than that, in large account, the gamma-size series, new cresses with expanded electrically-regulations diameters and separated black-notified shoes with the logotype of the unit.
Furthermore, when purchasing a special version, each purchaser will receive a checal gift for the car and a rich distributed album with photos of the production process.
The powerful installation of the Porsche Exclusive specialists has not become tough: the retroval of characteristics is fully compatible with the series.
It is a six-cylindrical motor with a careful amount of 3.0 m, developing 420 cm and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version 911 Targa 4S can be speeded up to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be executed by a limited quote, but no amount or value of each specific sport chair shall be reported.
Facebook and publishing advertising have launched a weapon
The recent inclusion of the Facebook technologies that prevented the hiding of the newspapers on the social pages has been proposed by the developers of decisions to block the advertising to respond.
In AdBlock Plus, the Facebook plans to do so soon as possible.
So AdBlock Plus projected its new technology that may have remained effectively long.
Société representatives noted that, trying to inflict a new "non-blocked" advertising, the decision by AdBlock Plus, together with commercial statements, also blocked many common mails from friends or pages.
In Facebook, the AdBlock Plus was regretted and promised to solve the problem soon.
As a source of the source among social developers of TechCrunch, the code that makes AdBlock Plus free on the Facebook decktop will be ready for the next hour.
So, socialists and blocks have divided their kind of " weapons go" by trying to play one another, the same side has become users who have lost interesting records from friends or an advertising where they were not acceded to see it.
The ethical aspects of the public blocking have recently caused a delicate conflict.
In Murmansk, the violencer is before the court of the Murmansk evening.
His case has already been investigated in the next Committee of the Russian Federation on the Morman area.
The accusation of 54-year-old man is very serious towards sexual violence.
The results were that, at the end of November 2015, Paul’s street area in Murmansk has acted sexually with regard to violence against 20-year-old girls.
The sanction of this article provides maximum punishment for the punishment of freedom for six years.
Dongfeng will bring to Russia Crossvan Fengguang 370 and Picap Rich New website On page www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370, a resident of the popularity in China of a car class that constitutes the dignity of mine and croscinars.
Another Russian prince is Picap Rich New.
Many western companys of the Moscow International Autoshop this year have decided to ignore, so the white exhibition halls of Crocus Expo will be filled with the Chinese companies.
In particular, a powerful front will be the Dongfeng Motor Corporation, which has great species of Russian market and intended to propose a number of interesting news to our automotives.
One of them will be the crassvan Dongfeng Fengguang 370, sold in China this spring at the price of 55 900 yen (of less than 550 000 rubs on the current rate).
The Russian value is not lighting, but the question of delivery in our country is until it is in the stage of the debate.
In China, on the other hand, Fengguang 370 was intended to reach the 11th place in the list of most sales minerals, although it was a large road education (175 mm) and a protective platform of the skin in the lower perimeter.
Crossvan is built on a pre-produced platform of the Fongguang 360, in the 370th round base of the same rail in 2725 mm, but the bones are higher than 4565 mm (4510 mm), the design of more slightly than the richer.
The Salon was shocked by tree planning, but the large vertical scenario screen showed on the Tesla's center console was only on the early exhibitions of Crossvana, and cars were made with music simplely.
Five of the seven floor sites are easily composed, with a low loading area of 1650 meters (1650 m) long, the maximum volume of the bathroom is 1500 m.
Fengguang 370 engine prescribes only one to 1,5 litre binary atmosphere power of 115 l.s. from a 5-year mechanical transfer box.
On the dynamic quality of the machine, the manufacturer is modestly grateful, so it promises the pleasant budget of the owner at the level 6,7 m/100 km.
Picap Rich New is a well-known Russians Nissan NP300 Navara for the previous generation, but with a lot of Chinese design styles.
Despite the morally swimming construction, this model is still used by a stable demand in the Chinese consumer as a reliable and unreasonable “slaughter gate”.
At the east price, Rich New probably interests Russians because the modern Japanese picapans have become immensely precious.
Rich New is loaded by two machines for choice: binsine 2,4 l (137 ls) or carbodiles 2,5 l (116 l).
The transmission box is only a mechanical, the machine is behind the row, but there's a modification and a strictly connected "forward".
The new Flagman Sedan A9 will be at the Stind Dongfeng and its Russian Prime Minister, who was the Chinese company, has yet been anonymized in June.
Mine-profits on Chinese market is increasing, one of the last news - Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
Today, the Russian Dongfeng line is of two models: S30 sedan and H30 Cross.
In that year, the Chinese company’s dileagues have performed 696 cars in our country.
Transport tax publications stop mailing on the www.zr.ru rule
The tax inspection has changed the list of notifications on equipment taxes.
All Russian automobilists were inclined to the unchanged years of schedule: they receive an e-mail for transport tax payment for the past year.
However, in this year, many of them are not expected.
The case is that tax inspection has changed the order of notification of the citizens.
Those registered in the Public Payment Office on the official web site of the nalog.ru, the publications will come electronically.
In the inspection, such Russians were automatically viewed by online users and cut them out of a standard, "boomer" list.
The newness consists of all vehicle owners and non-motiveness.
All remaining letters will continue to be received.
The possibility of return to the old scheme is, however, also of the owners of the website account.
For that reason, they must visit the tax office and write a statement in August.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and better.
The notification appears in the "fair office" immediately after the preparation, while the letter is going to go a few days and may be perished.
In addition, the Internet Users of Tax Inspection has been overlooked by 18 million people, which allows the State to seize seriously the shipment.
On the other hand, modest news on the website is clearly not enough to inform citizens of changed standards.
Some could be registered in a regular office to obtain a single service and forgot it for a long time.
These people are not expected to learn from e-mail and, even if not, will go into the category of non-employers with all extraordinary consequences.
Access to the Life Payment Office is carried out in three ways: through the accounting port gosuslugi.ru, using electronic signs or logisms and passwords specified in the register map.
The latter is available in any tax inspection office (independing on the location of accounting).
Remember that the transport tax must be paid up to 1 December in the present year.
The reporting began in July.
The Tuning Mercedes-Benz G-class, which aims to achieve a very high deal, is something in itself.
But the controversial concept did not cut the G-Power company masters that were taken for the modifying of the sport version Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power is known by its BMW cars, but no human masters are foreign.
Really, why wouldn't G 63-571-powery aircraft with aerodin tank and swimming up to 5,4 s?
The shocked "muscles" of a shocked "gelic", the master used by the advantages that opened a 5,5-litro-shore-shore-scale.
And here, the dinamics have improved 0.1 c, and the flight flower can be 5,3 cs.
However, the speed of average speed must be clearly better.
The speed flow affects: If the standard G 63 is not slower 210 km/h, the tuberculosis of a deactivated electronic " driver" can survive 250 km/h.
Out of the car are almost uncertain from its original driver, except other rail disks - the Urricane RR of 305/35 ZR 23.
The Mercedes-Maybach Unit anonymous 6 m long-term conceptual purchase represented in the Concourse of Eleanty in Pbbble Bich.
Mercedes-Benz company will competite with the "very-sub-Subrange" BMW i and will move its electric models under a separate trade market.
In the nearest years, at least four economic news is expected.
