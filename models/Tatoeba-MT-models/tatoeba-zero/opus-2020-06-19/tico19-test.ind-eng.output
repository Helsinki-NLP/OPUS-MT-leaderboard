How long are these events going on?
And all the tissues should be adapted to this way, especially in your age.
And with the snare.
and blood pressure and colesterol must also be checked
And are you being calm now?
And do you feel this skin nucleus now?
and are you also a problem to breathe?
And can you tell other events you're natural with this age?
And how high your snakes have you ever been?
And I'm also a stone.
And I'm a little pipe and stone
And I feel the weight weight of today
And this is the alergial summer rhinitis.
And there's a snack of snake.
And I think it's a little smell.
And I want you to explain the place of your cart.
And they also smell.
and with your diabetes reway
And you know, my smell feels like it's gonna be sweet.
And do you know, people always stone to my way?
and you're feeling a skin
And you say there's a pressure on your face
Whoever in the family has heart problems, heart disease, heart attack, colesterol high, high blood pressure
Is there any event or other problems that you look at with the otot nerves?
Does there anybody ill like you at home with the same experience?
Do you feel another experience?
Did you ever feel breathed?
Are you still feeling nervous?
Because this is the flu summer.
But we can’t be able to overcome the heart’s weakness of the heart
But the more important problem now is the weakness of this card.
And I feel hard to breathe
But I know many stones toward me
But we need to handle each nerve of a very seriously serious.
But can you now breathe well?
I really forgot the cause of this skin.
Does it feel like somebody smells your pain?
It's still sweet as a breath.
Did they suffer the same pain?
Do you have chronic problems like high blood pressure or somewhat?
Do you have medical problems or other chronic diseases like diabetes?
Do you feel slowly breathing with that skin?
Do you suffer high blood pressure?
Do you feel slightly breathing together with that shock?
Do you know what the phenomenon is about?
Do you see the picture?
It's a lot of fluids today.
But I run diabetes tests
But he has a little like me
How high your hair?
How is your blood pressure?
If your smell continues
if you're a hundred or more
If you think you need a better examination
I'm smelling yesterday.
I'm also a little sweet.
I'm smelling yesterday.
I'm feeling nervous in here, in the shoe.
I was also a problem to breathe
I'll send a picture to you.
I'm feeling nervous today
I'm just feeling a little worse of head and smell today.
I think it's flu.
I think it's a little flu.
Does it feel like somebody who is very serious to sit on your skin?
All the starts of the head's illness were shocked at the time nearly together.
I've been ill in the midst of my face.
pressures like wearing nerves
on my face
in the midst of my face.
in the middle of the data
I've got a nervous in my skin.
I'm very worried about this skin.
I want you to explain this skin.
like high blood pressure or diabetes
Like the right in the middle of the shadow.
You can drink tachipirina sweet.
Mary, how long have you experienced this event?
You're saying you're feeling crazy.
Sometimes, I feel nervous.
All right, if there's another experience with this event, except the nerves.
Or somebody sit on your snake?
Nearly similar to stones, stones, head pain, and otots
Right in the midst of my face.
Show on this picture where you feel sick.
'Cause you're hot.
So do you think that some of these events may be related to pregnancy?
So, your kids have the same thing?
Tell me about your nerves
Day grows in the night
My snake has continued for two days
Demon begins to grow last night
This is Dr. Porter in the centre of the emergency triase room.
Can you tell you more about your skin?
I feel nervous at the front of my body, here, on the shoe.
I feel a strong nervous in my skin.
When I felt that nervous on my skin
Nigeri like what you feel on your smell?
When's this skin starting?
where do you feel nervous on the skin?
where do you feel a skin?
You feel like a bit in your skin.
You know if I suffer diabetes and other diseases
You're saying you're feeling this skin.
Currently increased corenavirus disease (COVID-19) in the EU/Wilayah Economic Europe and England Raya, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative insecurity of the heartnavirus disease (COVID-19) shows the same train in the United States of Europe/Wilayah European Economy and England that states that, although it is different from the country, COVID-19 pandemics are developed quite rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, the country, the hospital, and the intensive care units, it should be necessary to increase its ability to provide COVID-19 patients who will need health care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, the pneumonia class was not known in Whan, the province of Hubei, Tsikong.
On January 9, 2020, the Centre for the Protection and Protection of Chekong reports this disease agency is a new cornavirus called now the syndrome of acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, diseases affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection called heartnavirus (COVID-19).
To this day, some 80 percent of COVID - 19 people have suffered cold diseases, infected with or without pneumonia, with a majority of these healthy people.
About 14 percent of the cases, COVID-19 develops a more heavy disease and need hospital care, while 6 per cent of other cases have a critical disease that requires intensive treatment.
Mortalities of patients in hospitals resulting from COVID-19 per cent.
In this study, we examined the internal COVID19 United Europe/Wilayah European Economy (EU/EEA) and England (UK) and compared it with internal trains in Hubei Province, Tskong.
We also compare the number of cases of COVID19 in the EU/EEA and the UK with the number of cases in Italy during 31 January–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK
After Thikong, COVID-19 suffered more than the geographical preaching of COVID-19 in other worlds now follow the pandemic dynamic in Tibet.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declares COVID-19 as pandemics.
In Eurosurveillance 2020, published on 5 March, Spiter et al. reported the first Europeans with the case of COVID-19 confirmed on the basis of the WHO case.
In the EU/EEA, the first three cases were confirmed by France on 24 January 2020 to those returning from Whan, the province of Hubei, Tskong.
In March 15, 2020, the case COVID-19 has been detected throughout the 30 EU/EEA and Ingris Raya (UK), from 31 December 2019 to 15 March 2020, including 39.768 cases and 1.727 deaths, with 17.750 cases and 1.441 deaths from Italy only.
Obtain cumulative numbers and cumulative counts of COVID-19
In the Centre for the Prevention and Control of European Diseases (ECDC), the number of cases of COVID-19 reported to each country worldwide has been updated every day at 8.00 p.m. This number is available only from official sources such as the State Health, national and regional health authority, and WHO.
This data is used to evaluate COVID-19 trains in the EU/EEA and the UK, and compare it with trains in Italy.
As the prevalence of the COVID-19 active case, we are counting the cumulative internal rates of 14 days, so as a result of the natural journey of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA and UK, in the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also paid the cumulative number of cases that each country has been reported until March 15, 2020 at 8.00 compared to the Italian case during the period 31 January-15 March 2020.
COVID19 in EU/EEA and UK
The CVID-19 case of the EU/EEA and the UK is usually following the train in the province of Hubei (Tionkong) (Game 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK in the whole, the COVID-19 cumulatives began to increase around 21 February, and increased around 28 February 2020.
This train is mainly employed by a rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK shows that the same COVID-19 currency cumulative trends are higher.
Image 2 shows the number of COVID-19 cumulative cases in the EU/EEA and the UK compared to the amount of cumulative in Italy during the period 31 January–15 March 2020.
The data stressed that, until 15 March, 15 other EU/EEA and UK reported the total number of cases compared to the total number of Italy cases three weeks ago or less.
We have indicated that the number of cases of COVID-19 reported to increase rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The treasury of COVID-19 cumulative cumulatives states that pandemics increased the speed of all countries.
This is unlike the differences in countries, social health responsibilities, and the possibility of the definition of cases between States and the different protocols to choose the patients to confirm COVID-19, including testing.
At the beginning of March 2020, physicians in the Italian region explained the situation around 10% of COVID-19 patients need intensive treatment and media sources report that hospitals and intensive medical units in this region have reached the maximum capacity.
Today, the data of COVID-19 case investigation in hospitals and/or intensive treatment units at EU/UA are only available for each 6% and 1% of cases (not displayed data).
However, data should be collected in a systematic way to clarify the current survey data focused on the number of cases reported and the number of deaths.
The study carried out in 2010-2011 shows great variations in intensive bedrooms and medical care in Europe, starting from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per cent of the population in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 places of intensive care and medical care for 100,000 people in 2010-2011).
The model scenario related to healthcare capabilities, with the prevalence estimation of the COVID-19 case for each EU/EEA and the UK associated with risks > 90% reduces the capacity of intensive health care, was provided in six ECDC risk assessments on COVID-19.
As far as the case is classified in certain regions in the EU/EEA and the UK, and the hospital and the intensive medical units are usually serving the population of specific regional service, information on cases and medications as well as at the Wilayah University for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
Experience from Italy and the current train in other countries shows that COVID-19 is very rapidly developed in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals, and intensive medical units should be prepared for the transmission scenario SARS-CoV-2 and increased the number of COVID-19 patients that need health care, especially intensive care, as happens in the area in Italy.
As is shown in the rapid risk assessment of the ECDC recently, rapid approach, projective, and compromise is very important to delay SARS-CoV-2, with the training of the approach to the mixture approach, because the rapid increase of cases, as prevented, may not give enough time to the creators of decisions and hospitals to understand, accept, and adapt the correct answer if it is not applied before.
The rapid risk assessment also stresses the health steps of the social health to reduce pandemics.
There are opportunities available when the country has the possibility of enhancing its control efforts in delaying the SARS-CoV-2 service and decreasing pressure on health care.
If failure, other EU/EEA health health systems will be likely to face patients who need intensive care within a few days or weeks before.
The disease of the 2019 heartnavir (COVID-19), caused by the syndrome of the heartnavir 2 (SARS - COV-2), has been killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in the Cyclopedia and other parts of the world, which caused disasters for humans.
Like his homolog virus, SARS-CoV, which causes a thousands of people to SARS in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmised from the wolf and causes similar gestures through a similar mechanism.
Nevertheless, COVID-19 has lower risks and mortality than SARS, but more than young people, and more than men than women.
As a response to a rapid increased number of publications about this new disease, this article tries to provide a precise and comprehensive work on rapidly developed research subjects.
We'll discuss the basic epidemiology, ethiology, virology, diagnosis, medication, prognosis, and prevention of disease.
Although there are still numerous questions that have not been asked, we hoped that this effort helps us understanding and preventing the threatening disease.
The Semi Museum Festival, on 25 January 2020, has become an event that has never occurred and was not forgotten for all Tionghoa people who were commanded to stay at home during the release and a few weeks later because of the new virus disease.
This virus is very homologized with the heartnavir (CV) which causes a deterioration syndrome of acute respiratory syndrome in 2003; therefore, the virus was called SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the disease caused by CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
Epidemide begins in Whan, Tskong, and rapidly preached to all countries and almost 50 other countries around the world.
By 2 March 2020, this virus has affected 80,000 COVID 19 cases, with more than 40,000 patients being collected and 3,000 patients died in the world.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is "destruction of number 1" and potential destruction is more stronger than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.nbi.nlm.nv.gov/pubmed/), at least two months since the first report on 7 January 2020, which sets a number of virus isolated from some patients, more than 200 have been published about COVID-19, including virology, epidemiology, ethics, diagnosis, and treatment.
This triumph is trying to include research progress in this rapid development of the new subject.
Maybe we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other diseases caused by CV, the syndrome of Eastern Foods (MERS, changing in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned about prevention and prognosis of disease, and some other questions that aren’t undermine, but urged.
Based on traditions, CoV is considered an unlegal pathogen for humans, especially by about 15 percent of the piles 4.
However, in this century, we have seen a very pathogenic CoV for humans two times, the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each causes an initial wave in Chekong in 2003 and Saudi Arab in 2012, and soon distributed to many other countries with horrible morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, COVID-19 is now the third vision of CV in the recorded human history.
As shown in Gbr. 1.1, the pneumonia class was first not known from Whan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Committee.
Seven days later, the CoV was launched.
On January 15, 2020, the first case of Whan was reported.
During that time, epidemics were rapidly spread to towns, provinces, and neighbors.
On January 20, the health infections were reported, which states that human transmissions may happen.
On January 23, a district carnaval was treated in the city of Whan, and the whole public was stopped.
On January 24, the first clinical study on this disease reports that, from 41 patients with cases confirmed, only 21 patients directly contacted with the Whaan sea food market, which considered the first place of infected animal sources.
On January 30, the WHO declares that this vision is an emergency of global health.
During the report, this disease has been distributed to the whole Tsikong and almost 50 other countries around the world (Gr. 2).
Because the situation is so rapidly developed, the end and the risks of the weakness are still to be set.
On 11 February 2020, a multiplay study at 8.866 patients, which includes 4.021 COVID-19 patients confirm, provides more updated epidemic pictures (https://mp.visxin.qq.com/s/lBi-HX_rHPX1Qa2bhA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people at all age, but especially at the age of 30-65.
About half (47.7%) of people older than 50 years old, just a few under 20 years old, and only 14 infections under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 more male infections (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 increases in class, especially inside and around Hubei.
COVID-19 spends rate 5 (2-9) day starts from awitan to diagnose.
Rate incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The time starts from the shift until the death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
Basic reproduction (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of infections increased exponently before 23 January 2020, in accordance with the mass transport time before the Semi Museum Festival in Cuba.
Mortality with cases confirmed by 1,44% (95% CI: 1,10-1,86%) and mortality corresponds to all patients of 3,06% (95% CI: 2,02-4,59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are the type of herald (pria), age (≥60 years) and weak pneumonia.
CoV is a large subfamily of a collected virus containing a single RNA sense.
CoV can be shared as four genes, the alpha, the beta, the gamma, and the delta, with the alpha and the beta-beta, known as human infections.
Tongoprotein or spy (S) combined with its cell receptor, enzyme of angiotensin 2 (ACE 2) and peptidel 4 (DPP4) each for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and the fusion is broken.
The virus genem RNA is released into the plasma site; after the replication of viruses, the genome RNA is part of accumulated glucoprotein and nuclear protein forms a vessel containing virus, which then experiences the fusion of plasma to release virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genome was reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new cov-type beta with genetic symptoms more than 99.98% of the 10 samples available; the sample was taken from the original location of the Huan sea market in the Whan.
Geneticly, SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through transmissive elektron microscopes, SARS-CoV-2 parts were found in the very type of human breathing epitelium.
Human ACE2 was found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, protein SSARS-CoV-2 connected with human ACE2 weaker than its connection with SARS-CoV protein, which corresponds to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes an infection that is not separated by SARS-CoV infections to patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new descriptive protein that is circulated with orf3b and protein separated with orf8 password.
Protein orf3b SARS-CoV-2 may have a role in the pathogenity of virus and IFN expression inhibition; but orf8 has no known functional or motivative domain.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., reports the cryo-EM ACE2 structure to human resolution 2.9 in complex with the transporter of amino asam B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which has an open and closed conformation, was obtained in the form of dimer and ACE2-B0AT1 complex can connect two S proteins, which are evidence for infection and coV infection.
B0AT1 can be performed with the approbation of drugs to test SARS-CoV-2 infections.
Original and interface
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known from the wool and each transmissed to humans through skin and skin.
By comparison to the SARS-CoV-2 philosogenics with other coVs, the wheel is considered as the original SARS-CoV-2, because this new virus is 96% identical with two types of SAV-SARS of the sleeves called bar-SL-CoVZ45 and SL-CoVZ21.
However, intermediaries that help the virus to defeat the species to infect human infection are still not known, and transmission routes must still be explained.
Ji, et al., considers the snake as a snack of virus to humans that include homolog re combination in S - protein.
According to a study, research in Guangzhou, Quekong, suggested that the tension, the mammalians of the long-spot that are often used in traditional Tionghoa drugs, are potentially based on 99% genetic homologs in CoV, and SARS-CoV-2.
However, 1% of the differences in the whole genome are still a large difference; therefore, the results of concrete evidence are still not available (Gbr. 3).
SaRS-CoV-2 physics are not known.
In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can hold for 48 hours in a smooth environment and up to 5 days on 20 °C and 40% to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar qualities.
It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 sensitive to the ultraviolet and heat ring at 56 °C for 30 minutes; eer, etanol 75%, the infection containing clorin, chloroforms, and other milk chloroforms, but not clorhexin, effectively detect virus.
In general, all human populations have no immunity against SARS-CoV-2, and that's the point of the new virus.
Today, there is no primary study reporting about immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
That's why we can only refer to other CV research, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Gr. 4).
In general, after invasion, the virus was known by the immune system through the polar receptor (PRR), including C-type lectin-like receptor, Toll-like receptor (TLR), NOD receptor (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
Through a different route, virus introduces the expression of inflammatory factors, dendric cell maturation, and the synthesis of interferon type I (IFN) which limits virus services and accelerates anti-virus fagosites by macrofag.
However, N protein on SARS-CoV can help virus to avoid immune responses.
Shortly later, the adjustive immune response is involved in the fight against this virus.
Limfosis T, which includes CD4+ and CD8+ cells, plays an important role in this defence.
CD4+ identical cell B to produce specific antibodies against virus, and CD8+ cell killed a virus infected cell directly.
T helper cells produce pro-inflactor sites to help protect cells.
Nevertheless, CoV can switch the T - cell function by inducing pharmaceutical T cells.
Moral immunities, including completes, such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies are also important in combating virus infections.
For example, antibodies isolated from patients who have already been guilty of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the reaction of the immune system produces a large number of locally free roots, which can cause severe damage to the pull and other organs, and, in the worst scenario, the fall of major organs and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infections, which are based on widespread classs, are more about lansia with abuse diseases and pregnant women.
Of course, a person who is packed by virus in large numbers or whose immune functions is imputed to have higher infection than others.
The evaluation of the SARS-CoV-2 rate rate is 1-14 days, most of the 3-7 days based on the study of 425 cases in Whan.
However, a study of 1.099 cases shows that the incubation period is 3 days and starts from 0 to 24 days.
The newer study, as explained above, shows that the incubation period is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) day based on demographic 8.866 cases.
In fact, health authority adjusts the effective carantine time based on the most accurate incubration periods to prevent infected persons, but without injury, transmitting virus to others.
As a general practice, people who are packed by virus or infected are usually required to be carnatine for 14 days.
Should the weather be long until 24 days?
In the meantime, COVID-19 is often the primary and early age of COVID-19, with or without any other events such as sweet stones, nausea, otot nerves, liver, head pain, rinorrea, dada, diarree, nausea and swallowing.
Some patients have been disappointed and/or hypersensitive one week after illness.
In serious cases, the development of patients’s diseases rapidly continues to become a syndrome of acute respiratory syndrome, sectic skin, metabolic acids, and coagulopathy.
Patients who have warm and/or respiratory and accurate breathing, although without pull disorder, should be affected to the virus for diagnosis.
Demographic study at the end of December 2019 shows that the rate of skin is 98% large for heat, 76% for skin stones, 55% for diarrees, and 3% for diarrees; 8% of patients need ventilation support.
Similar discovery was reported in two recent studies, a study of family classs and classs that are caused to be transmised from asymtomatic people.
In comparison with this, demographic study in 2012 shows that MERS-CoV patients also experienced a heavy (98%), sweet rock (47%), and was spnee (55%) as the main stage.
However, 80 per cent of patients need ventilation support, much more than COVID-19 patients and consistent with higher MERS letality than COVID-19.
Diare (26%) and smooth disease (21%) are also careful of MERS patients.
In SARS patients, heavy (99%-100%), skin stone (29%-75%), wasspnea (40%-42%), diare (20-25%) and skin disease (13-25%) was shown as the main stage and ventilation support required for around 14%-20% of patients.
By 14 February, COVID-19 mortality is 2% with the case confirmed by 66.576 throughout the world.
In comparison with that, SARS's mortality in November 2002 was 10 percent of 8.096 cases confirmed.
For MERS, based on the demographic study in June 2012, the mortality is 37% of 2.494 cases confirmed.
The previous study reports that R0 SARS-CoV-2 reached 6.47 with a trust interval (CI) 95% larger 5,71-7.23, while R0 SARS-CoV is only 2 to 4.
The SARS-CoV-2 comparison with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in the events, mortality and R0 given at Table 1.
These figures show that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher ability to distribute than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but did not note MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
So the challenge is to control SARS-CoV-2 pandemics greater than MERS-CoV pandemics and SARS-CoV.
Awitan is often visited in one family or from one group or vehicles like a burial boat.
Patients often have travellers or travellers in Whan or other shocked regions, or contact with infected persons or patients in the last two weeks before swifting.
However, it is reported that people can take virus without showing the age of more than two weeks and patients collected from the hospital can bring the virus again, and it provides care to increase the career time.
At the beginning, the patient has a number of peripheral white cells (such as lymphosis) normal or lower.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood rate < 4x109/L, including lymphosis < 1x109/L, and so many aminotransference assets and a increased virus found at 1.099 patients of COVID-19.
Enzymes of heart and otot and myoglobin increase in blood in some patients, and C-reactive protein and final blood leverage increased in most patients.
In patients with heavy cases, so much D-dimer increases, the product of fibrin in blood, and the level of lymphosis decreased progressively.
The photos of the touch were found in the majority of COVID-19 patients and are in place with bilateral swimming or glass-based options in the powder.
Patients often experience atypical pneumonia, acute skin ceder, and syndrome of acute skin (ARDS).
When ARDS arrives, taxi inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis is very improved by gas struggle.
Disfunction of pneumonites types I and type II decreases so much superficial and increased surface pressure so that the pulmonary ability to develop and increase the risk of pulmonary colaps.
Thus, the worst finding on the toracs photos often paralel with the worst level of disease.
In February 18, 2020, the first analysis of COVID-19 shows pneumonics of pneumonics, infiltration of hialin, interstitutional lymphosis, and symptoms cells have been placed in patients who died because of this disease, in accordance with virus infection and ARDS, and similarly with SARS and MERS patients’ s pathology.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 through transcriptic polymerase ratio (RT-PCR) used as the main criteria for COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, because it is a false negative level, which can accelerate epidemic, the clinical manifestation began to be used for diagnosis (which is not only dependent on RT-PCR) in Chicago on 13 February 2020.
Similarly, the situation occurred in SARS’s diagnosis.
Therefore, combination between illness, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiologis discovery is very important and a need to make effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group explains the SERLOCK technology protocol on the basis of CRISPR to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects the RNA SARS-CoV-2 synthetic fragments on 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 input micro-chip) uses the cell rats for less than one hour without needing a complicated instrument.
Unfortunately, this new technology can increase the sensitivity and ability when checked at clinical samples.
Because of few new experiences with CoV, the doctor especially offers support for patients with COVID-19, while trying to use or previously issued therapy for other CoV care, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table 2).
This therapy includes therapy that is now and potentially therapy with antivirus, immunospression, steroid, plasma of patients who have been healed, traditional Tionghoa drugs, and psychological support.
Even plasma from patients who have been healed to use in therapy.
Pharmaceutical companies develop antibodies and vaccines against this virus.
At the beginning, SARS-CoV-2 attacks the pull and may also attack other organs that express ACE2 at a lower level, such as gastrointestinal and gymnastic system.
However, disfunction and breastfeeding are the main threats for patients and the cause of death.
Therefore, the support of breathing is very important to reduce the eye and save life, including therapy of oxygen, high oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depends on the improvement of disease.
Patients with heavy breathing should be supported with oxygen of extracorporeum (ECMO), or a modified cardiopulmoner technician used for heart failure or breathing that threatens the soul.
Furthermore, e-lying guards, prevention and infection and sectic infection, and vital organ protection are also very important for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
A more well known immune system reacts affects the drought to SARS and MERS patients.
Site sites are the forms of systematic inflammators which are designated to designate the release of a number of websites, including TNFα, IL-1ś, IL-2, IL-6, IFNAL, IFNś, IFNī, and MCP-1.
The sitokins introduced immune cells to release a large number of free radio-free roots that becomes the main cause of ARDS and the failure of the major organ.
Immunouspression is very important in the struggle of the website, especially on a serious patient.
Corticosteroid and Tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL6 antibodial antibodium, have been used to handle the website.
Another immuno-use testing for the website is included in the modulation of immune responses established by T; IFN- Gamma, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; website signal 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroid, as an immunization, used many in SARS to reduce inflammatory diseases.
Nevertheless, steroids of high doses are not useful for a weightener ceder of SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, steroids can affect pressure effects, especially osteoncrosis, which are extremely affected by prognosis.
Nevertheless, short-dose receipt of corticosteroid is encouraged to be carefully given to a critical COVID-19 patient.
During this record, there is no effective antivirus therapy that has confirmed.
However, in intravenous cases of remdecivir, a analogy of nucleotide, has been intrigued on a patients in the United States of COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, first for diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg.
Later, remdecivir also shows inhibition against other unique RNA virus, including MERS and SARS virus.
Based on this, Gilead provides this slight for the Cubans to make a number of tests on the SARS-CoV-2 infections, and the results are very forgotten.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-alpha, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin has been recommended as potential therapy for patients with acute breathing.
Diare, nausea, insulin, heart disorder, and other side reactions may occur after combination with lopinavir/ritonavir.
This therapy interaction with other drugs used by the patient should be precisely monitored.
plasma from patients who have been healthy and antibodies
There is a long history of the recovery of patients who have been healed from the illness to treat other patients who suffer the same disease or prevent the healthy healthy ones.
Of course, patients who have been healthy have so many relatively high antibodies in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulin (Ig) with limfosis B to combat pathogens and other foreign materials, recognizing unique molecules in pathogènes, and immediately regulate them.
Based on this, plasma is collected from blood from a group of patients who have been healed from COVID-19 and were administered to 10 serious patients.
They improve in 24 hours, separated with lower inflammation and virus diseases and increases the oxygen in blood.
However, verification and clarification must be made to adjust this method to use large scale before the specific therapie is developed.
Moreover, more than the appetite effects, some plasma infections should be considered accurately.
For example, antibodies can have more immune responses and cause symptoms of release, which are potentially threatening the soul.
Concentration of antibodies in blood is usually low and plasma needed in large numbers to care for critical diseases.
Developing and producing specific antibodies with sufficiently fast to combat global epidemics.
Therefore, more important and practically isolate cell B from patients who have been healing and identifying genetic codes that produce effective antibodies or effective antibodies separation against the important protein for virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the level of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat several diseases in Tsikong for thousands of years.
However, most of the effects depend on combinations of different components in the form, which different forms depend on the diagnosis of diseases based on the TCM theory.
Most effective components are still not known or not as clear because they are difficult to switch or detect them or the optimal combination of them.
Now, since effective and specific therapy for COVID-19 is not available, TCM is one of the main alternative therapy for patients with sweet slowly or for those who are clean from heavy diseases.
For example, capsul Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen was directed for COVID-19 therapy.
The increase in COVID-19 patients is predominantly observed in several provinces of Chekong, which uses 87% of its patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hungaria (50%), while the province of Hubei, which has only 30% of COVID-19 patients, has a high level of health (13%).
However, this comparison is still very difficult because many other factors, such as numbers and risks of patients, have to be identified in a evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and friends performed a study compared to western drugs (WM) only with WM and TCM therapy.
They found that the time necessary to restore the body temperature, the loss of the speed, and the swimming swimming drivers in the WM+TCM group is much higher than just the WM group.
The more impressive, the degree of glucose levels (from weight) is far lower for the WM+TCM group compared to only WM groups (7.4%) and the lower mortality of the WM+TCM group compared to the only WM group (8.8% compared to 39%).
However, TCM’s efficiency and security are still waiting for a better controlled test on a greater scale and in more research centres.
Another interesting thing is to determine the working mechanism and to clarify the effective components of TCM or combination, if possible.
Most patients who are expected or confirmed by COVID-19 feeled very fearful about a very decreased and even defeated disease, and those incarnant also feel disappointed, patience and hungry.
More, infections such as heavy, hypoxia, and stones and effects of therapy, such as insomnia that caused corticosteroids can cause greater anxiety and mental pressure.
During the early phase of SARS, psychiatric morbidity, including depression, anxiety, panic attack, psychomotor disorders, psychopathism, delirium, and even sonoliality has been reported.
Discussion of contacts and waantina, as part of the social health response to COVID-19, can make people feel more challenging and feel guilty with the effects of abuse, karantina, and stigma on friends and sickness.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to patients of COVID-19, people who are expected, and who are in contact with them, and the common community that they need.
Psycology support should include multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communications with routine routine and correction on the SARS-CoV-2, and the therapy plan and use of professional devices and applications to avoid contacts close to each other.
Effective vaccine is very important to send transmissions from animals and human reserves to medications that are infected and often infected by antivirus therapy in the control of epidemics caused by virus.
The efforts have been made to develop protein S-based vaccine, which long and effectively makes transborder antibodies and/or immunities protected against SARS-CoV.
For SARS, living vaccine has been evaluated in the test animals.
Nevertheless, the effectiveness of this vaccine candidate on the lansia and the letal challenges and its protection against the infection of zoonotic virus must still be determined before the clinical study begins.
This may be because SARS was 17 years ago and no new case was reported since then.
Instead, the sporadis and the MERS class continued to happen in the Middle East and spread to another region because there is still a zoonotic source in the end.
The vaccination strategy has been developed for MERS using deactivated virus, DNA plasmide, virus vector, nanoparticles, similar virus particules, and protein subunits and parts of the test animals have been evaluated.
Vacuum development against SARS-CoV-2, which is safe and effective for non-life people, is a very urgent task and important task to control the epidemics that are ongoing.
However, this difficulty is not easy because a long time to develop vaccine (18 months) and a named CoV variation.
As a new disease, COVID-19 began to show its full clinical travel in thousands of patients.
In most cases, the patient can be sealed without any of them.
However, in comparison with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also related to high morbidity and mortality of patients with serious cases.
Therefore, prognosis models are very important for the health care office, especially in the area with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies that have been reported so far, the following factors can affect or be related to the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 3):
Using: Use is the most important factor for SARS prognosis, which also occurs for COVID-19.
COVID-19 was most important in the age of 30 to 65 with 47.7 percent of the patients over 50 years in the study of 8.866 cases, as explained above.
Patients who need intensive care of tendency have adverse and complicated compounds, and significantly older than older patients who do not need intensive care (mean 66 years older than 51 years) who are ageing as prognostic factors for the end of COVID-19 patients.
The type of infection: SARS-CoV-2 increases the infection of men than women (0.31/100,000 than 0.27/100,000), as explained above.
Compoundness and complexity: COVID-19 patients who need intensive treatment have more likely to experience acute heart disorders and arithmology.
The heart occurred as well as the principal cause of death on SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also be reported to associate with colangeoitis with ACE2-positive ACE, which can affect heart disfunctions to COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and diseases based on a very correlated and affected one another.
Abnormal laboratory: C-reactive protein (CRP) in blood reflects inflamation or network skin improvement and is deleted as a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy, and restoration of therapy.
Correlation between CRP and improvement and COVID-19 has also been deleted.
Furthermore, the increased dehydrogenase (LDH), aminotransferase (AST), alanin aminotransferase (ALT), and kinase creatin (CK) can also help predict the final results.
These enzims are expressed very high in various organs, especially in the heart and heart, and are released during the illness of the network.
That's why these enzymes are traditional prescriptions for disfunction of heart and heart.
Main clinical event: Photo toracs and temporary clinic development should be considered together with other things to predict the end and COVID complications.
Steroid use: As explained above, steroid is an immuno-principation that is useful as therapy for infection diseases to reduce inflammatory damage.
Since high doses used in SARS, many who survived from this disease finally suffered avasive osteoncrosis with disabled lifetimes and bad quality.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low dose and short-time duration of COVID-19 patients.
Mental pressure: As explained above, many patients suffered from extreme stress because they have to carry out long-term carnaval and extreme incertitude and see the death of family members near and with each other of the patient.
Psychology and long - term support should be given to help this patient remove from stress and return to normal life.
Based on the demographic study so far, COVID-19 seems to have different epidemiological images with SARS.
In addition to the correction in the lower respiratory systems, SARS-CoV-2 may effectively be effective in the overseas and cause swimming or without shifting in the early infectious phases, as well as other CV that causes pillars.
Thus, at the beginning or at the time of incubation, infected patients can produce virus in large numbers during daily activity, which caused great difficulties to control the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV transmissions are believed when the patient is serious and most of them did not happen at the beginning.
Thus, the COVID-19 change is now much worse and harder than the SARS.
Today, the great effort is being made in Quekong, which includes the Whan regions and the cities around and the carnaval continued almost all the population with hope to send SARS-CoV-2 transmissions.
Although this action is extremely corrupted by the economic and other sectors in the country, the new number of patients are reduced, which indicates epidemic reduction.
The most optimistic estimates declare that the wave will end in March and the falling phase for 3-4 months.
However, some other firms are not shocked.
Paul Hunter et al. estimates that COVID-19, which seems to be far more slow than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al. makes models to predict the end of the epidemic and declares that SARS-CoV-2 can infect two thirds of the global population.
Canadian research group reports that SARS-CoV-2 was identified in mid-conka and healing patients who have been healed and returned from the hospital for 2 weeks ago. This indicates that re-identified virus can be re-episode, similar to influenza.
However, the signs promised that happens in the Cyprus, if it appears to be reduced by the new number of cases, which shows that the current strategy might be successful.
Ebola was previously predicted to cause a million cases with half of death.
Nevertheless, the disease can finally be controlled by carantina and isolation.
Maybe, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 reduces its ability to infecte and finally lost or become a virus not too pathogène that can meet humans.
Comparison with COVID-19 with SARS and MERS under this (Gr. 5).
SARS-CoV-2 is very easy to be transmitted through stones or skins, and may also also be through direct contact with anti-virus contaminated materials.
This virus was also found on the fascination, so that it's likely to get new transmissions, the transmission of feses-supports.
Recent studies in 138 cases report that 41 percent may be caused by noocomal infection, including 17 patients with other previous diseases and 40 health care.
Thus, specific prevention should be made to protect humans, especially health care, social workers, family members, partners, and even those who are infected.
The first defence line that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is through the use of the face mask, the slight mask and the N95 respirator mask (N95 series 1860) helps to control the virus care.
Increased maskers are safely able to deal with those who are potentially infected by the air that are not following or put on the surface of the materials, where they are dissolved to others.
However, only N95 mask (1860-year series) which can be protected against inhalation of virus with a width of 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of virus can be completely enhanced; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in an estimate of 85 nm.
Because particules can even betracked five masks to be one, health care providers directly connected to patients must use N95 (1860-year series numbers) and not raw mask.
In addition to mass, health care providers need to place isolation switch to reduce the contact with the virus.
Virus can also infection someone through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor infected SARS-CoV-2 even though he puts N95 mask; virus may be entered into her body through the eye.
Therefore, health care providers should also have to put the shock of the faces on the shooting or on the other hand when they work with the patient.
For the public in the area that is cut or engaged, it is very recommended that each person clean the hands with a infected sample more often than normal, try to keep in the house of swimming karantina, and avoid contact with those who are infected.
A three - feet walk is convinced in order to keep the path from the patient.
This is an effective method to reduce the risk of infection and to prevent virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for human world, its high-level homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, it should be a great warning for the Tacoma that has a strong relief to the SARS wave of 2003.
Nevertheless, on January 19, 2020, the Headquarters of the Women’s Diseases emphasizes people by saying that this new virus has a low preaching quality and the ability to reproduce limited from humans to humans and the prevention and protection of this disease is not a problem.
This report is very grateful to the fear of the people, especially when the whole country is preparing the Semi Museum Festival, so that the critical time is to cover still small diseases in Whan.
The control of diseases in the Cyclopedia should take care of this and make a great remedie in the future.
For example, this body should be more careful when making public advertising because every word is observed by the people and can change their attitude and decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to information from the clinic than waiting for official reports from the doctors or officials; (3) more limited the use of the potential of epidemics at the initial stage, and not to try to deal with the public; and (4) more often extend targets and effective uses of public standards on epidemics and tests and increased social responses periodically.
COVID-19 was caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus that began to be shot at the end of December 2019.
During less than two months, the shipment has been distributed to the whole Tsikong and more than 50 countries in the world at the scene.
Because this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 barrier has a renewed impression.
However, there are clear differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are very important to include epidemics and treatment of patients.
COVID-19 is more than young people and more about men than women, and death levels are also higher than young ones.
SARS mortality is higher than COVID (19.91%).
COVID-19 patients transmise virus even when they are unexpected, while SARS patients generally transmise virus when they are sick. This makes more difficulty in maintaining the COVID-19 service than SARS.
This explains most of the reasons for SARS-CoV-2 to broaden and broader than the SARS-CoV.
Rutin RNA source to check SARS-CoV-2 can give negative results in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, a healthy patient can make a positive result of the virus examination.
This findings increased the risk of the virus.
With so fast progress in the COVID-19 research, some important problems still have to be solved, that is:
Where is SARS-CoV-2 coming?
Although genetic homologs were found over 96% between SARS-CoV-2 and two CoV-SARS like blowing, we are still not able to find that SARS-CoV-2 is from the wolf.
What kind of animals are among the species of mentating virus from origin, say sweetness, to humans?
Unless we know the answer numbers 1 and 2, we can't send transmissions with effectively and switch can return every time.
Although moleculal and biochemia moderation shows that SARS-CoV-2 is connected to ACE2, how is the virus exactly entering into the breast cells and affecting the next pathology change?
Does this virus also connect to cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we can't reach a fast and correct diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic go?
How is the virus developed genetically during the transmission between humans?
Will this pandemic become the world’s pandemics, end like SARS, or will it be periodically renewed like flu?
The answers to the above questions and many other statements are important, but may require time to find it.
Nevertheless, we do not have any other choice than stopping this epidemic soon that we may be able to return to normal life.
Sonototic virus in human heart
Thousands of years, mutations and adjustment have generated co-evolutions of heart viral (coV) and its skin, including humans.
Before 2003, two human coVs (HCV) were known today caused raw diseases, such as sealma.
The syndrome of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the syndrome of the Middle breathing syndrome (MERS) reverse the situation and explains how HCOV infection can be very devastated and threatened to the soul.
The SARS-CoV-2 culmination in the centre in the end of 2019 has made CoV back a sorotan and surprised us with higher transmissions, but with lower pathogensity than his brother, SARS-CoV.
HCOV infection is a zoonosis, so the understanding of the original zoonotic HCOV will benefit from us.
Most HCOV originates from the heavy, in this animal, virus is not pathogenic.
A number of HCOV reserves have also been known.
The identification of animals has directly involved in preventing human diseases.
Research of coV interactions on animals can also provide an important monitoring of CoV pathogenesis to humans.
In this work, we shared the public picture of the current knowledge about the seven HCOV, focusing on the history of its discovery and its synthetic origin and the transmission of its antarses.
What's important, we compare and reverse the HCV from the evolution circle and the re combination of genome.
Epidemia CV 2019 (COVID-19) is now being circulated in this context.
Furthermore, the conditions of successful heating and the impact of virus evolutions on diseases are also dishonored.
Coronaviridae virus (CoV) originates from the Coronaviridae family, consisting of a group of RNA viruss, a positive intrusion, and a unique number.
This virus has the biggest genome of 26 to 32 kg base between the RNA virus called "CoV", because its morphology is like a mask under the electronic microscope.
Based on its structure, CoV has an insigned genome that has similar paintings.
About two thirds of the genome consists of two largely open (ORF1a and ORF1b) which are thinned each other. The two are translated as polyprotein of pp1a and pp1ab replication.
Poliprotein has more crews to form 16 non-structural protein, called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome consists of the openly reader (ORF) for structural protein, including tonnels or sprays (S), rolling or developing (E), brushing (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of specific specimens of captive proteins for certain birth lines are also carried out by several CV - generation lines.
Based on the differences in protein, CoV classified as four genes (alfa-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV); between four genes, the genes of CoV have the most largest HCOV and are further shared into four descendants lines (A, B, C and D).
philosogenetic books show that the skin and animals are a major source of the gene alfa-CoV and beta-CoV, while the ungarns are the main cove gamma and delta-CoV.
Thousands of years, CoV continued to cross the species and some CoVs have become important pathogens in humans.
Before now, there are seven known human coVs (HCOV).
Among the seventh virus, HCOV-229E and HCOV-NL63 are alfa-coV.
Other five beta-CoV includes HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, a syndrome of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), the syndrome syndrome of Eastern Tengah (MERS-COV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, and HCOV-NL63 are generally caused skin skin, such as pills and/or diarrees.
Instead, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are extremely pathogenic, resulting in infections under weighter weight to relatively more patients and have higher opportunities to develop a syndrome of acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and manifestation in the outside of the pulmonary organ.
Strain HCOV-229E first, B814, was isolated from a simple patient nervous in the middle of the 1960s.
Since then, more knowledge is gathered through deep studies against HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43, which both causes a own guest.
Indeed, this concept has been widely accepted that HCV infection is generally not dangerous until the SARS is happening.
The SARS’s event in 2003 is one of the most destructive phenomenons in the current history, which infected more than 8.000 people with the number of deaths of about 10 percent.
10 years later, the syndrome of Middle East breaths (MERS) endeavoured the epidemics continued in the Arab Semenage with sporadic preaching to various other worlds.
HCOV new 2019 (2019-nCOV), which is called SARS-COV-2, is a shocked epidemic agent of 2019 (COVID-19), which has decreased life over 3,120 people and infected more than 91.000 to 3 March 2020.
The alarm is hidden and the world must prepare himself for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic that will come.
The seven HCOVs all have a synthetic origin of the skin, the skin, or the beast.
Many evidence support all the HCOV evolutions from the wolf, and in the wolf, CoV is in good and non-patogenic, but shows great genetic angry.
The COVID-19 epidemic has resulted in medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for Tacomo and the whole world.
The philosophy of HCOVs shows a number of work to understand the environmental, the skill, and the deployment factors have been moved to the species.
This study can also lead or make the search for reserve animals, interviews, and implementing SARS - COV-2, which have an important implication in the preaching of the preaching time.
In this trial, we have a general image of zoonotics, antarspesis transmissions, and HCoV pathogenesis.
We are particularly encouraging and discussing public topics that HCOV induced viruses are usually non-patogenic in their natural reserve, but became pathogènes after transmission of antarses to the new heat.
We also investigate HCOV evolution that transmission capacity is often associated with the decrease of pathogenicity.
The end of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
The animal coV has been known since the end of the 1930s.
Before the isolation of HCOV-229E strain B814 from the sealed patients, various CoVs have been isolated from various infected animals, including skins, skins, dogs, skins, and dogs.
In some last warnings, seven HCOV have been identified.
The short history of HCOV in chronological orders (Table 1) is an informal instruction.
Strain HCOV-229E was the first is isolated from the patient’s napkin bleeding in 1966, which was then adjusted to be found in the WI -38 pull line.
HCOV-229E patients infection show a selema bleeding, including heads, skins, leaks, and shooting illness, with smells and stones that appear to be 10 to 20 percent of the case.
The next in 1967, HCOV-OC43 was isolated from the culture of organs and serum flows in the brain that still circumcised.
HCOV-OC43 clinic infection image seems to be similar to the infection caused by HCoV-229E, which symptomaticly cannot be differentiated with other respiratory infections such as A influenza virus and rhinovirus.
HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 are distributed to all the world and the most transmissed skin during the winter in the climate area.
Infringement, the time of the two virus is less than one week and is followed by the illness period for about 2 weeks.
Based on a human volunteers’ study, healthy persons who have been infected with HCOV-229E have suffered quite slowly.
Only a few patients with a heavy body reverse system that shows the infection of the skin skin under weight.
SARS, who is also known as "pneumonion atipi," is a pandemic resulting from the first HCOV, which is well documented in the history of humans and its ethiological agency, is SARS-CoV, which is the third HCOV found.
The first case of SARS could be able to return to the end of 2002 in the province of Guangdong, Tskong.
SARS’s epidemics affect 8.096 cases are reported with 774 deaths, which are distributed in many countries and earthquakes.
Without the superbs, each case may cause some two secondary cases, with the incubation of 4 to 7 days and the top of the virus burden appears in the 10 day.
Patients who have been infectioned by SARS-CoV have initially experienced mialgia, head pain, heavy, league, and smell, which are followed by disfunction, stone, and breast-feeding as a further level shock.
Limfopenia, unnormal heart functional tests, and the increase in creatin kinase is a lack of laboratory in SARS.
The alveolar difusion, the proliferation of epitel cells, and the increase in macrofagy are also associated with SARS patients.
Next, about 20-30% of patients need intensive treatment and mechanical ventilations.
In addition to the lower breathing burden, some organs including gastrointestinal, heart, and gins can also be infected in deep cases, usually separated with the site bleeding, especially with the weakness of patients.
The first time the virus was isolated from the powder biopsis opened by the patients who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, great efforts have been made for HCOV research.
HCOV-NL63 was isolated from the child of 7 months from the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
This virus was initially slow to the child, the lansia, and the weak patient who suffers breathing diseases.
Descriptions of corruption, conjunctivitis, heat, and lazy bronquiolitis were met to diseases caused by HCOV-NL63.
Another independent study explains the same virus isolation from the age of 8 months of age that suffers pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although the virus is identified in the Netherlands, this virus is actually distributed throughout the world.
It was estimated that HCOV-NL63 represented around 4,7% of the public respiratory diseases and the top of its occurrence was at the beginning of the summer, the summer, and the winter.
HCOV-NL63 is associated with obstructive ringites, which also called crup.
In the same year, HCOV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71 - year - old man who had been careful for fire because of pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and communal bronquiolitis, HCOV-HKU1 was reported with regard to the exazerbation of the acute assert.
Like HCOV-NL63, HCOV-229E, and HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 was found throughout the world, caused raw nutrition diseases.
Four HCOV communities have all been opposed to humans and generally have small probability to change to a very pathogenic disease. However, this is a marvelous case because there is no known reason, such as in the subtype HCOV-NL63 more recently reported, caused a deterioration infection in the tsunami.
Of course, when you get the ability to move effectively and keep yourself in humans, virulency and the pathogeneity of HCOV also decreased.
MERS-CoV was the first time isolated in 2012 from the 60-year-old patients who suffered an acute pneumonia and failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the cases confirmed the laboratory from the Middle East, the impor case has been reported in various European and Tunisia countries.
Another incident in South Korea was confirmed in 2015 with 186 cases.
MERS clinical manipulation is similar to the SARS clinical manifestation, which is dissolved with a progressive progressive pneumonia.
Not like SARS, many MERS also experienced acute injuries, which only happens in MERS among diseases caused by HCOV.
More than 30 percent of patients show that gastrointestinal disorders, such as diarea and angry.
By 14 February 2020, more than 2500 cases confirmed the laboratory reported with high death, 34.4%, make MERS-CoV as one of the most feared viruses known by humans.
In the middle until the end of December 2019, the pneumonia class of pneumonia, which was retrospectively related to SARS-CoV-2 infections in Whan, the province of Hubei, Tskong.
World Health Organization (WHO) states that the infection of low-scale infections has been caused by SARS-CoV-2 as global health emergency and called COVID-19.
By 3 March 2020, 90.053 cases have been confirmed throughout the world, with the number of losses of 3,4 per cent.
It should be recorded, that death in Hubei, Tsikong, is 4,2 percent, while death outside Hubei is up to 1,2 percent.
SARS-CoV-2 causes heavy respiration infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-COV with heat, stone, and breast.
Diare is also visited with a number of patients.
Pneumion is one of the most weighty ages and can quickly develop the syndrome of the acute breathing syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar to the high-nucleody nucleody homology, 82 percent, both slowed into different philosogenic trees.
SARS-CoV-2 pathogonisity clearly lower, but more than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects have been reported and may have played a key role in the rapid SARS-CoV-2 service worldwide.
Compare and different SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCOVs shows an interesting difference and difference.
First, incubating and traveling of HCOV diseases is very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 follows the public train of six other HCOVs.
Second, COVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and four other HCOV communities (including HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1, and HCOV-NL63).
On one side, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows a more common picture appears in HCoV Communities infections, which includes unspecific or even unspecific.
On the other hand, a small majority of the COVID-19 cases may seem like SARS-CoV infections even with a little lower ration.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission also shows an interesting pattern characteristics, with chemicals with the community HCOV or SARS-CoV.
On one side, the SARS-CoV-2 transmission capacity is at least the same higher than the community HCV.
On the other hand, there is no ability to transmission SARS-CoV-2 after some paths to humans still need to be checked, as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases.
Last, like other HCOV, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from a fess sample.
"If the SARS-CoV-2 transmission is an important role, such as in the SARS-CoV transmission case, at least in some situations, that should still be explained by the next study."
What is also very important to be known is whether SARS-CoV-2 summers are like in the case of the community.
How, SARS-CoV-2 pictures, including transmise, pathogensity, and preaching on a few ways on humans, will have a very influence on the end of COVID-19.
Four HCOV communities that caused swimming snacks all have been engaged in humans.
It looks out of the other circle, it can say humans have been corrected with these four HCOVs.
In other words, well, HCOV and humans may be a spectrum of HCOV pandemics.
HCOV that causes a weaker disease in humans and humans who have suffered heavy HCOV diseases has been cut off.
In order to do this, HCOV should be adjusted in humans in a number that can enable an accurate variation of use towards weapons factors.
Thus, more long-term SARS-CoV-2 infected people, increased the probability of this virus to be full of humans.
If the virus is good, the transmission of human transmissions will be difficult to stop by karantine or other infections.
For many years, four communities are divided into human populations and slowed up to people with immuno-competence.
This virus does not need a animal reserve.
Instead, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, who are very pathogenic, aren't in a position with humans and their transmissions in humans, cannot be maintained.
Both of them need to maintain themselves and make a repair in the zoonotic reserve and search for the opportunity to distribute to an important human target, probably through one or a few intermediaries and applications.
SARS-CoV-2 has a similar image with SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four Communities.
SARS-CoV-2 is very easy to be transmitted like HCOV communities, at least now.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more pathogenic than HCOV communities and non-Sethogenic SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
There should be aware whether SARS-CoV-2 will be fullly controlled with humans and switching into humans without reserve animals or interviews.
Before discussing the origin of the HCV animal, we need to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, restaurants, intermediaries, and HCV applications.
The animal acts as a HCOV evolutionary if he has a close-scale and shared high homologs at a second level of nucleotide.
The first virus is normally aware of good and nonpatogenic.
Similarly, the reserve’s reserve has HCOV continued and in a long - time sleeve.
In these two cases, infections are naturally infected and are natural refrigerators for HCV or induced viruses.
Instead, if HCV newly enters the quarters precisely before or around the time of the virus enters to humans, the virus has not been corrected with a new phenomenon and often seen pathogenic.
These intermediaries may function as a source of human infection and play as an integration barrier by allowing virus to temporaryly correct, and transmit it to humans to implement the scale of human infection.
HCOV can experience infection if it is not possible to maintain its transmission in the intermediate barriers.
Instead, HCOV can also be able to be cut off with intermediates and even cause long - deficiencies.
In this regard, the wars became a natural reserve.
Epideological data declares retrospectively that the SARS case has contact with pesticides.
The next seremovalencing study indicates that the animal saler has the prevallence of anti-SARS-CoV anti-SARS-CoVs, higher than the public population.
The month (Larvata Paguma) and the animal dogs in the lives market was the first time identified to bring the SARS-CoV viruss that almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This is not directly supported by the fact that no more SARS cases were reported since all the markets were killed.
Indeed, it is reported that the monthly burdens of the natural or the non-apartment of the animals to the market mostly gives negative tests to SARS-CoV. This states that the month period may only act as an inter-application, but not a resorption of the SARS-CoV natural.
It should be noted that 80% of the animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies could not be observed that many small mammal species may also function as a refrigerator of SARS-CoV.
All of these pieces seem to be the end of the SARS-CoV.
Search for natural animals for SARS-CoV is the next explanation of a close-scale cov, called the Rhinolopus cove of Rhinolopus-SARS HK3 (SARSR-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in the slope of the shock of the twenty-third horse.
This was a positive test for anti-SARS-CoV anti-CoV and a few SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3-genics.
This coV and the other cows cows shared a number of numbers of nucleotides in 88-92% with SARS-CoV.
This study is a foundation for a new concept that the bleeding is a ring for new human pathogens appearing.
Some CoVs like SARS (SL-CoV) are also identified from the blowings, but only one, named WIV1, can be isolated as a life virus.
The enzim of angiotensin 2 (ACE2) change is known as SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1, which originates from the sample of heat, appears to use ACE2 blowing, bleeding, and humans as a receptor to enter into cells.
Interestingly, during convalencing patients, the WIV1 can be used.
By now, WIV1 represents the most closest stakeholders with the SARS-CoV in the wolf, with a total of 95% of nuclear homology.
Without its height of homology between these two viruss, generally believed that WIV1 is not a virus induced directly from SARS-CoV and the heavy is not a reserve reserve direct SARS-CoV.
Phytogenetic analysis puts MERS-CoV into the same group with coV-HKU4 and CV-HU5.
CoV-HKU4 cows and MERS-CoV use the same swimming receptor, called peptidee 4 (DPP4) as an incoming virus.
Soon the polymerase RNA depends on MERS-CoV by philgenetics closer to its depths in the cows identified by Europe and Africa.
Even now, there's no MERS's lives found in the wild wolf.
MERS-CoV and its closest friends, coV-HU25, are only shared in 87% of nuclear homologs.
That's why the shoes may not have a reserve of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, study in the Middle East shows that Arab birds have produced a seriesable result for specific antibodies, which indicated MERS-CoV, as well as the origin of the Middle East in some African countries.
MERS-COVs that are identical to the virus found in humans are isolated from the original use of Arab birds. This indicates more details that birds are the real restaurants for MERS-CoV.
It is also important that the total massive virus with a generally slight specimen of tests that are infected with MERS-CoV.
It should be recorded, that infection infections are not only through breathing routes, but also through fecal-oriented routes, which is also the main part of the virus of the skin.
Nevertheless, the question is still not answered because many MERS cases confirmed have no contact flows with an unrecognised animals, likely due to human transmissions or transmission routes, which includes unrecognised animal species that brings MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotic homology with the RaTG13 slightly isolated from Rhinolophus skin.
Like the SARS-CoV case and MERS-CoV, the difference between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to establish a relationship.
Another word, it may not be an outstanding SARS-CoV-2 reserve, except if the cows are almost identically found in the next day.
The SARS-CoV-2 animals may have been sold and died in the Grand Sea Market. Many cases starting with COVID-19 are associated with this market, which indicates that there may be transmissions of animals.
Some recent studies, based on the numbers of meteorologicals, show that a small group of swimming mammals, known as trends (Javanica), may also have brought up cove stores that were related to SARS-CoV-2.
The new CoV trend gene shares 85-92% of the nucleotide nucleody with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the coV is close to RaTG13, with a weight of 90 percent at a second level of nucleotide.
Both are grouped into two subgarists of SARS-CoV-2 virus in philosogenetic trees, one of the receptor-link domains (RBD) more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with a number of amino accommodations of 97.4%.
What is counted, RBD SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is more different, although the level of homology is at least higher than the whole genome.
The previous study on the ill-training also reports the detection of the virus of the powder sample, which is also related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study applies to different methods of reproduction and manual currency to produce a number of partial genomes that consists of around 86.3% opening virus genome.
We can't compare the probability of trending as one of the SARS-CoV-2 animals.
However, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 supports directly from trends because the difference between SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-2-coV family beta.
Furthermore, the round between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 was closer than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and the sight-CoV-Cov-2.
The SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary route is still to be set.
Although the highest Homologs in RBD were found between SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-CoV-CoV-2-related beta-CoV-2 trends, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest homologs in the entire genome level.
It is still special if it is said that its high level of chemical level between RBD beta-CoV family-SARS-CoV-2 trends and SARS-CoV-2 is employed by the mediated convergencies.
Hypothesis supports recombination between beta-CoV family-SARS-CoV-2 trends and RaTG13 in third-seven animal species.
As an evolutionary factor, recombination is a lot of happening between the cove beats.
The researchers cannot still decide on the origin of SARS-CoV-2.
Besides the very pathogenic HCOV, the zoonotics HCOV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-HKU1 have also been identified.
philosogenetic books indicate that HCOV-NL63 and HCOV-229E may originate from the helélawar coV, while HCOV-OC43 and HCOV-HU1 in the animals have been found in the test animals.
It was reported that the CV of the lelawar named ARCOV.2 (Apocalypse Ridge CoV), identified in the three colors of the North America, shows violence near HCOV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCOV-229E geneticly associated to other helmets, named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was identified in Ghana, with Camelidae, is also the interface.
In order to clearly, the present knowledge of the HCOV animals known as smaller in pictures 1 and Table 2.
philosogenetic analysis has shown evidence of the transmission of HCoV antarses in history.
In 1890, when HCOV-OC43 switchs species of heavy animals to infect human infection, there is a pandemic of breathing infection.
The history of HCOV-229E antarses is not too clear.
The Alfa-CoV of the cowboy of HCoV-229E has been found.
Among them, there are alpha-coV alpha.
Some evidence support the transmission of virus directly from the skin to humans.
First, humans, not alphabets, which may be contacted with the skin in ecological replicas together.
Instead, humans have a warm contact with a slight.
Secondly, HCOV-229E has a variety of and non-patogenics in the wolf, while the alpha-coV alpha causes infected animal breast diseases.
Lastly, the alpha-coV alpha was not found in the feral animal.
That's why it's likely to get HCOV-229E's family alpha alpha can't be met.
In fact, the skin is a direct source for human pathogenic virus, including rabbia, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it was not too surprising that the bleeding may immediately transmit HCOV-229E to humans.
Another possibility, while the alpha-coV was functioning as HCOV-229E gen long, the alpha and the Arab bird may function as an intermediary flow that transmitted virus to humans, almost like MERS-COV cases.
MERS-CoV is a very good example of transmission of antarses from the skin to the Arabs and the Arabs to humans.
The original MERS-CoV evolutionary from the cylinder was known at the initial identification of the virus and also strengthened by finding it later.
Clearly, it is a wide range of virus species that are rich to combat antarspesia genetic fragments and transmissions of antarspesia.
A long-term colony, a deep social interaction, and a strong flight ability, is all the conditions that support for the massacre to become an ideal virus provision.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has entered the Arab bird for decades.
This virus has been adjusted by a heat that has changed from the wings to a stable and natural reserve.
MERS-CoV causes very slow diseases and maintains relatively low changes in this animal.
His sharp transmissions to humans occurred, and humans remain to be the end for MERS-COV because their transmissions cannot continue.
Not like a single role in the MERS-CoV transmission, the part of the trend, if there is, in the different SARS-CoV-2 transmissions.
In particular, the cove-coV trends are extremely pathogenic in trends.
The standing may be the end of the SARS-CoV-CoV councils, like a shock in the SARS-CoV case.
In the opposite studies, some possibilities transmission of SARS-CoV-2 antarses from animal to humans must be calculated or accompanied.
First, the skin could be a reserve reserve for the SARS-CoV-2-related virus that is almost identical with SARS-CoV-2.
Many can share ecological rings with grains by purchasing or swimming stones.
Secondly, trending could just be one of the intermediate instruments for the SARS-CoV-2-related virus.
Humans get viruses through the injury and the consumption of the flesh.
Perhaps, many mammals, including animals of conservation, actors against SARS-CoV-2.
Antibodies surveys against wild animals and animals need to be done.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adjustment of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in the third species that are well connected to the skin or trends.
Search of the SARS-CoV-2 animals still continued.
Within the various kinds of animals, three main factors of the virus’s side are also important to shift CoV to the decline of species.
First, the relatively higher change in the RNA replication.
Comparing to the single RNA virus, the COV changes can be considered as "split" to "length" with a high rate rate switch ~10-4 per year per case, depending on the adaptation of CoV to the new heat.
CoV has an exoribonclease of correction, which affects very high, attenuation, or even invisibility.
Interesting things, the analogy nucleotide Remdesivir was known to react CoV replication through this exoribmunclease inhibition and polymerase RNA dependent on RNA.
Remdesivir is one of the most promised anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that will be tested in clinical trials.
Nevertheless, the CoV mutation path is around a hundred times higher than its marvelous changes.
Furthermore, changes often have been higher when CoV has not been able to swallow.
Rather than SARS-CoV that has higher variation, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation is actually lower, set up a higher adjustment level with humans.
It's likely that SARS-CoV-2 has been resolved with other weathers that are close to humans.
Besides SARS-CoV-2, this also happens to MERS-CoV, which has been engaged in the Arabs.
In theory, small probability that genetic hair will quickly make vaccine and antivirus agents against SARS-CoV-2 into an inefficacy.
Second, the great RNA genome in CoV gives extra flexibility in genome modifying, to change and re combination, so that increases the possibility of antarspesia co-evolution, which makes it possible to appear a new CoV when appropriate conditions.
It is supported by many single readers and the protein functions that are covered to the 3 - t - up range of genome.
Third, the template mounting coV was slightly shocked during the RNA replication through the unique "select-salin" mechanism.
In the flights functioning as a struggle, heavy training occurred during the CNA transcrision.
RNA opening and subgenomic, very homological, can experience recombination to form a new CoV.
Natural philosogenetic re combination books have been found on HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, as well as in animal coVs such as SL-COV and coV-HU9.
Virus interactions in its skin with transmission.
Moreover, three of the virus factors mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with the heat receptor is another main factor that affects the transmission of antarspesia.
Here, SARS-CoV re combination is considered a special example, which also shows evidence of positive cells during the transmission of antarspesia.
Based on a comparative analysis between the SARS-CoV-Human CoV isolate, SARS-CoV was expected to experience rapid adjustment in various ships, especially with mutations to SBD protein.
The RBD protein S CoV interacts with cell receptors and intensely become a target of coal antibodies.
In SARS-CoV, RBD was a amino axis to 318 to 510 in the S1 fragment, which connected with human ACE2 and its corecector as a path to the virus.
RBD SARS-CoV has the ability to recognise ACE2 receptors of various animals, including skins, skins, tissue, and raw dogs, to allow transmissions of antarspesia virus.
In fact, only 6 amino asylum residues that have been different between human virus isolated and blend in RBD and 4 are located on the reason for the receptor connection to interact with ACE2 receptor.
SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which may increase the definition of tonight protein interaction with human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, two substitutions of this amino assom may be very important to adapt virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein S unit implies the definitions of S protein S with ACE2 human potentially changed.
Even a crio-EM study shows the numbers of human ACE2-human associations and SARS-CoV-2-10-10 higher than the terms between the ACE2 and the SARS-CoV protein.
It's also important to know whether there's another corecector that might be needed to transmission SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCOV-NL63 is also connected to ACE2, but with different parts of S.
There are many other HCOV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCOV-229E and 9-O-therapy acids for HCOV-OC43.
These receptors may also play in the performance of this coV adjustment in humans after transmission of antarses from their animals.
In addition to cell receptors, the final results of HCOV antarspeties are also established by the factors of dependence and other weapons.
These proteins between humans and natural reserves, such as bleeding, snakes, snakes, and animals, can be lost to transmission antarspesia.
HCOV should take the only factors of marine dependance and blend the rail discharge factors so that it could be successful in the transmission of antarseses.
In this way, the molecular spectrum in the important virus interactions should still be identified and disappeared.
The whole genome analysis is unprecedented to see the dependence factors and the deficiency of SARS-CoV-2-use of improved CRISPR technology may be useful.
Returns the new HCOV: return to the start of the curve
The warm CoV has given great opportunities to appear in the new HCOV.
In this case, the cowl-cover functions as HCOV longs.
Furthermore, the rapid and genetic re combination change also develops HCV evolution and functions as two important steps in this process.
For instance, a smooth or loss of new protein genes makes it drastically possible to modify phenotipe virus.
Among the SARS-CoV accession protein, ORF8 is a major role in adapting humans because the virus of the SARS-CoV-coV-isolated association has been found to find various ORF8 proteins.
SARS-CoV, with the circles of 29 nuclear elimination, was found on the strain that was isolated at the beginning of human epidemics.
This removal divides ORF8 as ORF8a and ORF8b and is expected to be an adaptive variation that supports maritime training.
Furthermore, SARS-CoV may have a reconnection history with the generation lines of the alpha-CoV and the CoV gamma, with a larger number of smaller re combination areas identified in polymerase RNA dependent on the RNA.
Recombination location is also identified in nsp9, most of the nsp10, and part of nsp14.
Similarly, the re-combination between several generations lines were shown on the MERS-CoV epidemies, which occurred in Arabs in Saudi Arabs.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, re combination events have also been observed on HCOV other places where HCOV has been reconnected with other animals in its non-structural gene.
It should also be observed that the combination of bovine cells can lead to unreasoned changes in viral genocide, most likely the liberation of virus from the precise pressure of cells, such as the marine immune system.
This effect is the loss of ORF4 opened on the HCoV-229E strain prototype resulting in the elimination of two nuclears.
While ORF4 can be died on the skin and skin virus associated with HCoV-229E, co-co-alpha-coV shows the unique nucleoid side that affects the grade.
Lastly, new HCOV evolutions are also employed by secular pressures in the reserve.
Rare or without age detected during the CV - infections, which shows an adjustment between the CV and the cowboys.
It seems to be anatomically and physician.
For instance, the infringement of prophecies on the skin will reduce the pathology of CoV effectively echoed.
Furthermore, the activity of natural killer cells in the cell was found because the regulation of the NKG2/CD94 mortal receptor cells and the level of the complex hypercompatibility of the main class I.
Furthermore, so many reactive oxygen species (ROS) high from high heavy metal activity can enhance coV replication and increase the control of exorbonuklease so that the pressure of cellular pressures is to generate a very pathogenic strain of virus when they enter into the new building.
More pathogenic coV strain may also develop through re combination, which affects protein or new protein plants to adjust.
That's why, not a reason that three HCOV newly appeared in two last warnings.
CoV is not patogenic or causes a swimming snack in its reserves, such as skin and skin.
CoV is strongly controlled without driving a strong refrigerator.
This is the secret of the infection of human infections.
The worst event is particularly because the adjustment of more immune responses and the weights of the website, with a weighter deterioration if the immune response is increased.
On the contrary, the immune responses have been discarded from the CV replication.
The same strategy to decide immune responsibilities may benefit from anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The answers of the interferon are particularly strong on the skin.
So, interferon type I, at least at the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 infections on humans, should benefit.
In addition, NLRP3 attractions are defective.
For this reason, inflamation of NLRP3 with MCC950 may benefit from COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 collections follow the public scope of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While the cowl-coVs shared with 95% nuclear homology with SARS-CoV have been found, there is also a cowl-coV that shares 96% nuclearhomologs with SARS-CoV-2.
Although the bottles and other animals on the market were found to bring the same virus with SARS-CoV, the intermediate weather for SARS-CoV-2 was not found.
Beta-CoV trends that have been very homologed with SARS-CoV-2 have found, which shows that trends may play as a part of the intermediate or co-coV trends might contribute to the gene fragment in the final version of SARS-COV-2.
Although it's still questioned, there's no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was made by a good man in a deeply or unexpected way.
CoV returns to the center of attention because the SARS-CoV-2 waves recently.
CoV study in the heavy and other animals has changed greatly our perception about the importance of the zoonotic origin and animal reserve for HCV to human transmissions.
Very many evidence show that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are from the wolf and transmitted to humans by means of the interface.
Remember that SARS-CoV infection originates from the contact between humans and swimming markets, possibly the swimming markets and the killing of all the skins within it that effectively ended the SARS epidemies.
With the same reason, the trends should be moved from the fat market to prevent zoonotic transmissions, remembering there are some driving lines of beta-coV trends close to SARS-CoV-2.
However, true and mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted to humans through trends and other mammals still have to be explained in the study in the past period.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the snake of the Arabs for a long time.
It functions as an important transport tool and as the main source for meat, milk, skin, and wave products for local communities.
The Arabs are largely preached throughout the Middle East and Africa.
That's why we can't kill all birds to control MERS, as done on the market of wild animals in Taykong to prevent SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the MERS wave, comprehensive approach must be done to develop vaccine for effective inputs to MERS-CoV and are combined with other infective control steps.
Before we succeeded to remove this virus, new genotypes can appear and cause skins.
A variety of zoonopathic coVs are sweet in the wild nature.
Indeed, the cows of the cyclopedia, which have a synagotic potential, are very slightly.
There are many possibilities for this zoonotic CoV to evolve and experience recombination, which affects the new CV that appears to be more easily transmised and/or delayed for humans in the future.
The culture is to make wild animals in some places in the Cyclopedia to reduce the unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the experience of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, better plans and overcome should be applied.
In fact, many viruses have been on this planet since then.
These viruses are in their natural reserve until there are opportunities for preaching.
Despite many cylinders supporting the virus, human opportunities to contact the heavy and other wild natural species can be minimised if people are administered to leave wild animals.
Continuing surveillance against mammals needs to be done to understand more the coV ecology and its natural marine, which will be clearly useful in preventing human transmissions and phenomenon.
As a conclusion, the most effective way to prevent synoosis of virus is that humans should be safeguarded from ecological replication of the nature of zoonotic virus.
Some parts of the twins of the SARS-CoV-2 are not found.
First, if heavy transmits SARS-CoV-2 virus to trends, the condition when heavy and trends share ecological replications are the important thing to be known.
Second, if we have a more direct role in transmission to humans, how we can contact the skin.
Third, if there is a third role to be a real intersection, the way the mammal is interacting with other species, including humans, sleeves, and trends must be explained.
Finally, because many mammalians, including the animals that may have reacted to SARS-CoV-2, should be done well infections of tests and surveys.
Indeed, trending, or other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its input virus that almost identical can be identified in its natural edges in the next time.
Continuing research in this area will take into account the SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary route in animals, with an important implication in the prevention and processing of COVID-19 in humans.
diagnostic "first case" and "confirmation case" COVID-19 must be done
On 6 February 2020, we publish the early advice for diagnosis and diagnosis of the new coreavir 2019 (2019-en-CoV), which is based on our experience and became a good reference to combating pandemics throughout the world.
Nevertheless, heartnavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, illness and knowledge increased on the basis of the findings that are ongoing and clinical practices; therefore, the strategies of diagnosis and diagnosis also continued.
In this letter, we responded to one of our comments and provides the most recent diagnostic criteria for the "first case" and "confirmed case" based on the diagnosis and diagnosis guide for COVID-19 (seventh version) issued by the National Health Committee of the Republic of the Côte d'EC.
In December 2019, the new cornavirus 2019 (2019-nCOV) has caused a fat, which is currently formally called heartnavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and that virus was given the name of the heartnavir syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO explains COVID-19 as pandemi.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infections, our team develops a fast-speed board of advice, and it has been published onlinely in Military Medical Research on 6 February 2020.
It has been a lot of interested attention since the publication is published.
However, it must be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, illness and knowledge increased on the basis of the findings that are continuing and experiences of clinical diagnostics.
As an example of the diagnosis and the Approaching Panel for COVID-19, issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Health Committee of the Czech Republic (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), from 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020, this committee has issued a total of seven editions with some contexts have been changed enough.
We accepted comments from Zhou et al., they introduced a proposal for simplicity shoes based on their clinical experience.
They added new evidence for our department and became valuable for this pandemic worldwide.
We supported the results of their work that we deserve and express our appreciation.
Nevertheless, the results of their work are also needed on the basis of the CVID’s diagnosis and the Review of COVID-19 (seventh test version) and the latest study.
Based on the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the previous case requires a combination of one of the epidemiological images with two clinical manifestations to make comprehensive analysis, or need to detect three clinical manifestations if there is no clear epidemiological flow:
Epideology: 1) travellers or travellers in the city Whan and its surrounding region, or other communities where the COVID-19 case has been reported in the last 14 days before the geographical experience; (2) contact rates with the SARS-CoV-2 (Positive Nuclear Suite), (3) contacts with the patient who have been surveyed or breathtaking from Whan city and the area around them, or other communities that include the COVID-19 case has been reported in the last 14 days prior to the geographical incident; (4) was confirmed by the CaseC (≥ 2 cases with the nearby geographical and/shall in 2 weeks, such as the home home home home home to the town.
Clinical manipulation: (1) heat and/or breast-feed; (2) COVID-19; (3) total blood rates show normal liquidity rates, decreasing or decreasing at the early stage.
The diagnosis of case confirmed should be based on the first case with one of the following pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) a real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) all the genems show high homogeneity for the known new heartnavir; (3) positive for specific IgM antibodies and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in the serum test; or changes specific IgG-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from negatively become positive, or increases the rate of ≥4 liver at the time of the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time axis PCR tests in the sample of breathing or blood are added to the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020).
The patogenic detection of the blood sample was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and the fifth (8 February 2020); then, the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
This change is based on the research of researchers to search for the optimal nuclear detection of the axis for rapid diagnosis, and the sample of napkin samples including blood-driving, which increases the existance of specimens, and supports certain antibodies positive results in the confirmed criteria.
Furthermore, there are more evidence that can remind us of watching the patient with atypical and unexpected experience.
So Zhou et al. should be updated because they class people without clinical misconduct as "low risk".
The skor systems also need to be checked in the practice and clinical study of the present time.
As a prosecutor, we hope that more evidence will appear directly and ask readers to give comments.
For the diagnosis of "first case" and "confirmed case", we recommended to follow and follow the most recent cases in each country.
Our team will also update our career as a helpful time.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest number of deaths.
Last night, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 on that day.
It's the highest death number in one day of the virus results.
Yesterday, Institute of epidemiology, Medical Disease and Research (IEDCR) Bangladesh reports to report the number of infected cases that includes 114 active cases and 33 households.
Totally 17 deaths.
In a network news list, Dr. Morejady Sabrina Flora, director of the IEDCR, he said death includes four men and a woman.

Transporting materials of pounds -- medical, fuel, and food -- are still allowed.
The first infection of COVID-19 was recorded in Bangladesh on 8 March, on two new people who return from Italy and their wife.
On March 19, the three of them were healthy.
SARS-CoV-2 infections over a million worldwide

Trade in Australia decreased toilet tiles for transaction
On Monday and Saturday afternoon, Australia Woolworth and Coles' networks all decreasing the toilet tickets limits to two and one pack for transaction at all markets at the national level.
ALDI also applys the limits of one sir, on your day.
This payment is made as a message on the box and on the Facebook page.
The winners are reported to raises the results of the fear of COVID-19 if the community has to make a smooth isolation.
On Rabu’s day, Woolworths was also limited to the shopping of toilets to shipping home to one pack of message.
This change follows four packs for transactions that were previously implemented by Woolworths and Coles each on 4 and 5 March.
In its media statement on 8 March, Coles reported that with the dealing of the four packages, "more shops are still missing in one hour since the shipment," and said the request "only happened before," while ALDI, in a Facebook post on the day of Selasa, called "unexpected."
The seller's "speaking strikes" last week, one of the men who talked to Woolworths.
Costco shop in Canberra was also limited to the numbers allowed up to two packs last week.
In order to avoid deterioration, Coles urged the higher costs from the farmers and increased the frequencies of the shipment, Woolworths tested further preparations, while ALDI prepared for the early special promotion of the Rabu.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Perital Association, said that the office tries to improve the preparation, but the local government limits for the car drive time make it difficult.
He warned the production costs, unless he tried to comply with the requests, and a little more special promotion.
On the day of the Selasa, ALDI announced that because of the exit of the prescription, some shops could not be able to make a special Rabu.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a ritel copy from Queensland University of Technology, said that shop contains all nights.
He stated that the toilet tissue is a great volume of goods that the number of its products is low and, if it is sold, make a lot of spaces in the rats, so that the deterioration of the items is increased.
Coles and Woolworths are thinking if there are many items in the rats, if products such as toilet tissue and supplier may be [disabled] and in large numbers, panics may be minimised, the Russian Roomman is able to spend through the ABC News Office.
Products of renewed toilets Who Gives a Crap said on the Middle Day before they were missing.
Kimberly-Clark, which made Toilet Kleenex, and Solaris Paper, which makes Sorbent, tried them to work 24/7 to keep the passion, according to News.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reports that some owners offer free toilets to the first swimming shop in Melbourne, while more slightly been established because of the shopper takes a jack for the weekend of the Wednesday.
The NT News edition, a daily day in Darwin, includes eight pages that are intended to be cut and used as a toilet tiles.
The stories are rightly refused to apply the limits, according to the Australian ABC report on 3 March, they said they were not planning to apply the cost limits.
Russell Zimmerman adds that other products are also in high - requests, including mask, sweet food, hands and skins.
Similarly, in the outdoor of Australia, on Minggu sun, the British supermarket Okas was limited to the sales of Andres’ toilets to two packs with 12 grams.
World Health Organization (WHO) declares COVID-19 as pandemics
In Rabu’s day, the World Health Organization (WHO) declares the visions of COVID-19 that occurred – illness caused by SARS-CoV-2-co-cardiovascular heart.
Although the word "pandemi" is just aware of how many diseases have been distributed, not how dangerous that case, WHO stated that it is to move the government to act:
All countries can still change this pandemic journey.
If the country is identified, tested, handled, isolated, and mobilizes its people as a response, the Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director-General of WHO.
We looked very well because of the preaching and the peace of our brothers and sisters and sickness.
According to Dr. Tom Peace, the director of the United States Corrections and the Prevention of the United States, this spectrum has happened before.
He said, in the record published by CNN in February, "except influenza, there's no breathing virus that will ever be taken from its depth to the global preaching."
Ghebreyesus declared the same view, saying, "The spirit has never seen the pandemics that the heartnavirs were shocked."
He continued, "and we have never seen pandemics that can be checked together."
The new status of the WHO was to follow the decision in January, which declares that this painting is a healthcare of the world.
The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectional Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, says about this vision, "It's, this wave will be bad."
By Wirs, Associated Press reports at least 126.000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, which affected more than 4.600 deaths.
The heartnavir pandemi 2019-2020 is the pandemic of the 2019 heartnavir disease (COVID-19) which is being continued and caused by the syndrome of acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
The change was identified in Whan, Tskong, on December 2019, as a worldwide health security, which has been identified on January 30, 2020, and was stated as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
By 10 April 2020, about 1,61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and regions, which affected about 97.000 deaths.
About 364.000 people have been healed.
Case fatality is estimated for 4% in the Cyclopedia, while the whole world starts from 13.04% to 0.08% in New Zealand.
The public practice includes shoes, stones, and breasts.
Complete can include pneumonia and syndrome of acute breathing.
The time from shipping up to the frequency is usually about five days, but it can start from two to four to fourteen days.
There is no vaccine known or specific antivirus treatment.
The main treatment of symptoms and supports is recommended to include cleaning the hands, closing the mouth when the stones, keeping the path from others, and spend and isolation for people who are infected.
The authorities in the whole world have responded to treating the limits of travel, karantina, nights, dangers of workplaces, and facility.
This situation has caused a deterioration of global economic scourge, degradation, or deployment of cultural activities, political, gender, publicity, and the deterioration of materials that have been improved by panic business.
Schools and universities have been closed well at the national and local levels of 193 countries, in which around 99.4 per cent of the students in the world have affected.
Mixation on this virus has spread the network and there are xenofobia inside and discrimination against Tionghoa, people with the generation and vision of East Asia and Southeast Asia, and people from the area with significant virus cases.
Infringement of the travel and deterioration of the weighted industry, air pollution and carbon emissions reduced.
Health Authority in Whan, Takong (Habei Provision), reported the pneumonia class that was unknown on December 31, 2019 and investigated early January 2020.
These cases are mostly associated with the Grossir Sea Market, and that's why the virus was expected to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that causes infringements called SARS-CoV-2, new virus found and associated with the heavy heartnavir, the cornavirus strike, and the SARS-CoV. First person with a shock was known to be ill on December 1th, 2019, and the person has no clear relationship with the late market class, which then mentioned.
Among the initial cases reported on December 2019, two thirds were found with the market.
On 13 March 2020, an uncertain report from South China Morning Post suggested that a case that could be issued on 17 November 2019, at a 55-year-old age of Hubei province, may be the first. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, with new cases were decreased in Tibet, but increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the new number of cases outside the Pacific has been reduced in the first time.
There may be a large number of unreported cases, especially among people with more rare experiences.
By 26 February, relatively little cases reported among youths, with 19 people under the age of the world are 2,4% of the cases. The British Scientific Chief Raya, Patrick Vallance, suggests that 60% of the British population must be infected before the group is able to be completed.
The case acknowledges the number of people tested by COVID-19 and the results of the test have been confirmed positively according to the official protocol.
By 23 March, there are no countries who have tested more than 3 percent of its population, and many countries have made official rules to not test people with relief, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Swiss.
A study published on 16 March found that in Chicago, until 23 January, 86% of COVID-19 infections were not detected, and that this undocumented infection is a source of infection for 79% documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March suggested that the infectious number of Italians was more than the case reported.
The initial estimation of basic reproduction (R0) for COVID-19 is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Correction and Prevention Centre concluded that the number may be 5,7.
Most COVID 19 guests.
For those who were not guilty, the time from the development of the age until the death of between 6 and 41 days, with the most common 14 days.
Since April 10, 2020, about 97,000 deaths were related to COVID-19.
In Chekong, up to 5 February, about 80% of the death occurred in people over 60 years and 75% have previously been healthcare, including cardiovascular and diabetes.
The real factory resulting from COVID-19 may be much higher, remembering the official number of people who died without testing, for example, at home, in the hospital, dsb.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of death rates during the pandemics depends on the official COVID death rates with factors of 4 to 5 times slow.
A woman's speaker for the Centre of Control and Diseases (CDC) AS acknowledges: "We know [the number of deaths] is lower than the real number", a statement that was encouraged by the non-scientist report on too low impact in the United States. A too low impact appears in pandemics, such as the epidemics of H1N1 in 2009. The first death is confirmed in the Wan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside the Techkong was held on February 1st in the Filipina, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.
On 28 February, outside the Cyprus, more than one of the deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By 13 March, more than fourteen countries and regions of historic countries have reported deaths in every part, except Antarctics.
These variations are based on regions and temporary, and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health system, the options of the health, the time since the first change, and the nature of popularity such as age, the type of health, and the whole health. The death ratio of the case illustrates the number of deaths shared by the number of cases is diagnosed in a specified period of time.
According to statistics Johns Hopkins University, death ratio against cases globally is 6.0% (97.039/617.204) at 10 April 2020.
This angle varies according to the region.
In Chekong, the death ratio against the case decreased from 17.3% (for people with the incidence of 1-10 January 2020) was 0.7% (for people with infected persons after 1 February 2020). Other figures include case fatality (CFR), which reflects the diagnosis of people who died from certain diseases, and the infectious rates (IFR), which illustrates the infected persons (therapy and undiagnosis) that occurred in certain diseases.
This statistics are not connected to time and follow a certain population starts from infection to the resolve of cases.
Some academics have tried to count these figures for certain populations.
Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine University of Oxford estimates infected fatality counts for pandemic totally between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The rates of this distortion are based on the first testing of COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical investigation that analyzes the deterioration of CFR claims.
WHO states that this pandemic can be controlled.
The point and end of the shipment are not clear, and it may be different according to the location.
Maciej Boni from Pennsylvania State University states: "Don't even be guarded, the swimming waves are normally swimming and then slowing when the disease is available.
However, it is almost impossible to make a project in the current moment about when it happened."
Medical doctors of the Government of the Chiobong Zhong Nanshan believe that "This change may end June" if the whole country can be mobilized to follow the WHO recommendations on the steps to stop the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski from London University of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine states that SRS-CoV-2 "is continued to smile, probably until one or two years."
According to the Imperial College Research of Neil Ferguson, physics and other steps will require "available vaccine (possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner from Vanderbilt University states: "I think that this heartnavir is likely, because it is very easy to be transmitted, to lose all of it" and this disease "it can change to summer disease that comes back every year."
Depending on the reverse of groups and levels of variation, the virus will depend on.
COVID-19 experience can be relatively unspecific, and infected persons can be infected without experience.
The two most common gears are a 88 per cent (68 per cent) and a skin stone (68 per cent).
A less common gesture includes deterioration, smuggling breathing (flegma), loss of breathing power, skin and otot, smelling niggers, head skin, smuggle, heoptics, diarrees, or hepatics. WHO states that some of six people are seriously ill and suffering of breathing difficulties.
Center for Diseases and Protections (CDC) AS suggests emergency experiences include breathing difficulties, imprisoned or imprisoned paintings, swimming swimming, swimming and skining; medical attention is immediately recommended if these events appear. Developing diseases can be more serious, symptoms of acute breasts, sepsis, and death.
Some infected persons may be asymtomatic, without clinical misconduct, but with the result of the test that confirms infection, because the research recommends that those who are close to the infected person should be monitored and checked to ensure that they are not infected.
The Tionghoa people estimate the asthmatical reason from some to 44 percent.
Incubation period (inter-infections and infectious audience) usually divides between 1 and 14 days, most often 5 days. As examples of incertitude, the number of COVID-19 inhibitors that lost the initial 30%, then reduced to 15%.
The question of how this disease is still being preached.
COVID-19 was particularly convinced in the nearly contact time and through small cuttings when stones, stones, or speaking; close contacts are contacted between 1 and 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
A study found that the stone that is not covered can cause a shooting of 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 feet (27 feet).
Some researchers may also be triggered by smaller shocklets that are longer in the air and are stored when talking. The breathing driplet can also be used when breathing, including when speaking, although this virus is not usually astrayed through the air.
Droplet can fall in the mouth or snake of a person close to her or may be shocked into the pulms.
Some medical processes, such as intubation and pull heart resolve (RJP), can make the breath secret changed to aerosol and spread through the air.
Preaching can also happen when someone touchs the contaminated surface, including skin, and touched the eyes, nests, and mouth.
Although there is anxiety that virus can spread through the fax, the risk is lowly convinced.
The Chekong government shows the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The most translated virus in the first three days after the emergency, although the preaching work may happen before the vision and the more diseases.
People have tested a positive test up to three days before the slogan, which may be reported about transmissions before there was a meaningful event.
Only a few reports of asymtomatic cases confirmed by laboratory, but asymtomatic applications have been identified by some countries when investigating contacts.
The European Disease Centre (ECDC) states that although it is not clearly how easy this disease is, one generally infected two to three other people. This virus can be kept on the surface for hours until days.
It was found that virus can be detected up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and in the cartridge of 304, one day in the cardues, and more than four hours on the fire.
However, this variety depends on the heat and the temperature, and the animals and other animals have been tested the COVID positive.
There is no evidence that the animal can prohibit the virus to humans, although the British authorities recommended to clean the hands after contacting animals, as after contacting with the surface that may have been affected by the infected person.
Coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, the first time is isolated from three pneumonians associated with the classic cases of acute breathing disease in Whan.
All new cyclings of SARS-CoV-2 are related to heartnavirs in the nature. In the outside of the human body, this virus can be destroyed if it was covered by the household, which decreases the wide range. SARS-CoV-2 is close to the first SARS-CoV.
The virus is supposed to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis declared that the cornavirus is genetically classified with the betacoronavirus gene, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (B generation Garis), along with two tumors of bleeding.
This virus has 96 per cent of the entire genome level with other thermal cornavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Tionghoa research found that only one amino axis in certain parts of the genome between the tube virus and human virus.
Even now, the whole genome is found by 92% of the genetic skin between the carnavirus storm and the SARS-CoV-2, not enough to prove that the tension is the SRS-CoV-2 barrier.
Virus infections may be diagnosed while based on a bleeding, but confirmed by the reaction of polymerase transcryption (rRT-PCR) on a infected secret or CT circumcision.
A study compared to PCR’s CT in Whan shows that CT significantly significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specifically, with a lot of skilled plants with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, American Radiology College recommended "TCT cannot be used for separation or as a first line test in COVID-19 diagnosis."
WHO has published a number of RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, which was first issued on January 17.
Test uses polymerase transcrisis transcritical reactions back real-time (rRT-PCR).
Testing can be made in the sample of breathing or blood.
It is usually available for a few hours to a few days.
A number of laboratorys and corporations are developing a serological test that has been detected by antibodies.
In April 6, 2020, no one of these serological tests was made sufficiently suitable to accept its use of widely.
In the U.S., the serological test developed by Cellex has been agreed to use urgently, only by a certified laboratory.
Radioography and tomographic characteristics in persons who have symptoms of a person who include the foundation of the asymmetric glass area and no flaw efficiency.
Italian Radiological Society is making the international network database for the finding of enterprises in the case confirmed.
Because the smoke with other infections such as adenovirus, the cycling without PCR confirmation has a limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in the Cyprus compared with the CCTs with PCR and shows that although less specific for infection, infection is more rapid and more sensitive, so it is recommended to be considered as a separation tool in the epidemic area.
Convolutional neural networks on the basis of smuggling intelligence have developed to detect virus discrepancies with radiography and CT.
The strategy to prevent this illness includes maintaining a goodly comprehensive personal cleaning, cleaning the hands, avoid touching the eyes, necks, or mouth before cutting the hands, and smelling the tits when stones or smells, and immediately cut the tissue into the skin.
Some who may have been infected are recommended to use a wheat mask in the public.
The physicians are also recommended to prevent the distortion, and the governments in various regions have restricted or struggled to stop all non-excellent journeys and from countries and regions.
However, the virus has reached the preaching rate of the community in most parts of the world.
This means that virus has been distributed in the community, and some community members do not know where or how they are infected; health care treatments that may be treated are recommended to make standard prevention, contact prevention, and eye protection.
The use of local data from the phone by the government for this purpose has caused privacy problems, outputing the statements from Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations that develop this kind of survey.
Several applications have been implemented or issued to use voluntaryly, and on April 7, 2020, more than one group of employees have performed private solutions, such as use of Bluetooth to record the approach of users to other phones.
Next, users will receive a message if they are close to a positive one for COVID-19.Reason the infection how to prevent infection; for example, the skin and live with unefficient tumor drugs.
There is no COVID vaccine, although many organizations are working to develop it.
Bringing the hands are encouraged to prevent the preaching of disease.
CDC recommends that people often clean their hands with skin and water during at least twenty seconds, especially after the toilet, or when the hands appear to be smooth; before eating; and after heating, stone, or drinking.
This injury is because, outside human body, the virus was killed by a household snake that destroyed its protective snake.
Moreover, CDC recommends the use of hands of alcohol based on some 60% of alcohol protection based on volumes when salt and water are not available.
WEE encourages people not to touch their eyes, necks, or mouth before cutting their hands.
The surface can be decontaminated using a number of lamins (in one minute of disinfects for cardiac defects), including ethanol 62–71%, isopropanol 50–100%, hydrochloride 0,1%, massaxide hydrogen 0,5%, and povite-yodine 0,2–7,5%.
Other randoms, such as chloride chloride and gluconate glucoon, are less effective.
CDC recommends that if there are trigger COVID cases or confirmed in the public facilities, such as office or child investigation, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, public area, electronic devices such as tablets, keyboard screens, remote controls, and ATM machine that are used by the driver, it must be infected.
The health organization recommends that people close their mouth and neck with a shocked skin or use the tissue when stones or snakes, and immediately remove the tissue.
A large mask is recommended for those who may have been infected because using the mask can limit the volumes and the distances of the espirator droplets that are distributed when talking, snake, and stones.
WHO has issued instructions on mass time and ways.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Makers can reduce the tendency of people to touch the face with unclean hands, which is the main source of bleeding."Masker is also recommended to use those who care for others who may suffer this disease.
WHO recommends the use of mask by healthy people only if they have high risks, such as people care for COVID-19, although WHO also acknowledges that masker use can help prevent people to touch their face.
Some countries have already started to move to use maskers to the community.
In the U.S., CDC recommends the use of non-medical mask faces made from kins. This specifically recommends medical mask uses as well as healthy society, especially when they are near (1 metres (3 feet) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommends that we use a wide mask or a living in many places.
Thai health careers encouraged people to make a kitchen mask in their homes and clean it every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia refused its people to get out of the public place without putting the mask or shut and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all his citizens to put their face mask on the public to protect themselves and others.
Austria’s government defeats everyone who entered the toserba to put the face mask.
The Israelites requested all his citizens to use the face mask when they were in the public place.
Taiwan, who produced ten million mask per day since the midst of March, requires trainers and bus bus to make the face mask on April 1 April.
The panel stipulates the use of the face mask every time out of the house, and recommends the mask of its own faces for those who are not able to purchase the face mask.
In Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore, the faces were largely used.
Social responsibilities (called too physically) are infected actions intended to delay the health care by minimizing the contact close to the individual.
Social loans include carantia; travel payments; and schools, workplaces, stations, theatre, or business centers.
People can apply social dispensing methods by living in their homes, restricting their travels, avoiding many areas, using a chain without contact, and maintaining the physical distance of others.
Today, many governments require or inculcate social burdens in the lands that have been affected.
The maximum number of people who are recommended by the United States governments and health organizations are rapidly reduced, starting from 250 people (if not known about COVID-19 in a region) as 50 people, and then became 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany rejected meetings in the public area which includes more than two people. Lansia and persons with medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, breathing disease, hypertension, and the strongest immune system that have serious diseases and higher complications recommended CDC to be possible in the area that may be only in the area that has been surpassed in the community level. In March 2020, WHO and other health authorities began to replace the use of "social deficiencies" to explain that their aim is to reduce physical contacts with the continuing social, virtual or remote relations.
Using is the term "social responsibilities" stresses that people should be fully isolated into socially and not motived to remain involved with others through alternative ways. Some authorities have issued sexual health care to use during the pandemic period.
This recommendation includes the encouragement to associate sex only with people who live with you and have no virus or virus experience.
Isolasis is made in the home recommended for people who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and who are expected to be infected.
The health offices have issued the primary instructions for the right safe isolation, and many governments are prohibited or recommended to provide career for all the populations living in the counterparty area.
Carantina instructions are the most strict ones who include high-risk groups.
Those who may be employed by COVID-19 and those recently traveled to the country or region with the greatly recommended COVID-19 preaching career for 14 days since the last time possible.
Strategy in the control of the shipment is conservation or suppression, and mitosis.
Prevents made at the beginning of the stage and aim to monitor and isolate the infected persons and to make other steps to control infection and vaccination aimed at stopping the health of disease to the whole population.
When it is not possible to maintain the health care, the next efforts are toward the mixed steps: these steps are taken to delay the preaching and reduce the impact of health and social health systems.
Combining conserving and mixture action can be done in a joint time.
Superation requires more strenger steps to reduce pandemics by reducing the basic reproduction rates to less than 1.
This reduces the risks of health care and gives more time to develop vaccine and treatment.
Non-profit interviews include individual prevention, such as hand-making, with face mass, and career-building; steps in the community's levels that are intended to deal with with physical distortion, such as schools and disruptions the meetings; the community's association to promote research and participation in these interventions; and steps at the environmental levels, such as the surrounding process. Another drastically aimed at maintaining the courses in which it continues, as well as controling the entire city and participation in the travelling process.
Other countries also implement a variety of steps aimed at resolving the virus.
South Korea identified the massive and local carnaval and warnings of infected persons.
Singapore provides financial support for the infected persons who have been infected and set up a great dentist for those who failed to do it.
Taiwan increased the production of face mass and condemns the health increment, and the similarity for England and the United States shows that the mitosis (traslated, but not stop the epidemic care) and the suppression (reducing epidemic growth) has a great challenge.
Optimum mixed rules can reduce health care to 2/3 and death until half, but still affect hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems.
Superation can be chosen, but it is necessary to be maintained while the virus is still in human population (or until the vaccine is available, if this is the first thing), because if not, the shock will go back soon when the suppression steps are deployed.
Long-term interventions to encourage pandemics to spend into social and economic affairs.
There is no specific anti-virus drugs agreed to COVID-19, but the development efforts are being made, which includes already existing drug tests.
Consumption of fluids that are free to sell, drink enough water, and healing can help decline.
Depending on the level of healing, oxygen therapy, intravenous heat, and breathing support may be needed.
The use of steroids can decrease the condition of patients.
Some of the previously agreed things for the treatment of other virus diseases are bound to be used in treatment with COVID-19.
WHO also declares that some "traditional and house-wide-related" could defeat the events caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO said that enhancing the capacity and adaptation of health services for COVID-19 patients is the basic step in the response to the care.
ECDC and the European Regional WHO Office have issued offices to hospitals and health services first to discuss resources at various levels, including focusing on the laboratory service for COVID testing, if enabled to abolish the election process, separate and isolate the positive COVID-19 patients, and increase the ability to enhance intensive treatment with personal training and increase the number of ventilators and beds.
There are various theories about the origin of the first case (called nol patients).
The first known new heartnavirus case can be discovered by the 1st December 2019 in Whan, Hubei, Tsikong.
In a month, the number of heartnavir cases in Hubei increased.
These cases are largely associated with the Grossir Sea Sea market, which also sells lived animals, and one theory states that virus is from one of these types of animals; or, otherwise, virus has a synthetic origin. A pneumonia class is not known for the cause of the fact that the doctor Zhang Jixian is in the Province of Hubei, who told CDC Jianghan Whan on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the Headquarters of the Hospital House told them to their friends about "S.H.I.E.L.D."
Eight of this doctor, including Li Wenliang, was warned by the police because of proclaiming false deficiencies, and others, Ai Fen, was condemned by him because of the warnings that were outside.
The Committee for the Health of the city of Humans then issued a statement to the public on December 31 and told the WHO.
There are many unrecognised pneumonia cases reported to the health authorities in Whan, which then investigated at the beginning of January. At the beginning of the period, the number of cases increased two times per seven and half days.
At the beginning and middle of January 2020, the virus distributed to other provinces of Tskong, was supported by migration during the New Year of New Year and because the Whan is the centre of transport and the main train station.
On January 20, Tsikong reported about 140 new cases every day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The following official data shows that 6.174 people have experienced in the 20th January 2020.On March 26, the United States have crossed the Tskong and Italy with the highest confirmed cases in the world. By 9 April 2020, more than 1,61 million cases have been reported throughout the world; more than 97,000 deaths of the world and more than 364,000 healing.
About 200 countries and areas have at least one case.
Because of pandemics in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Wilayah are limited to free and controlling borders.
National estimates include rescue steps, such as the career (individed as a command to live in home, commands are protected in place, or regional carnaval) and the night. On 2 April, about 300 million people, or around 90% of the population, are located in a region of the United States, more than 50 million people in the area of Philippines, about 59 million people in the South African region, and 1.3 million people in the region of India.
On March 26, 1,7 billion people around the world have been in a number of areas of the region, which increased to 2,6 billion people two days later, around the world’s populations.
The first confirmation case of COVID-19 can be renewed on December 1, 2019 in Whan; one report has not been confirmed showing the first case on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observes the pneumonial case because of unknown reason on December 26, which was reported to his hospital home to the Jianghan CD on December 27.
The initial genetic testing of patients on December 27, 2019 indicated that the heartnavir is like SARS.
Administration to the public was issued by the Honour Safety Committee on 31 December.
WHO was told at the same day.
When this information was done, the doctor at Whan was warned by the police because it was "promoting the deficiencies" about the wave.

About half million companies in Germany settled the support schedule of government support for its officials, called the Kurzwork.
The German detachment scheme was adopted by France and England.
In the whole world, artistic designs and cultural heritage are largely affected by pandemics, which influence organizations and individuals, well as workers.
The art and culture organization is trying to visit their high mission (which is often opened) to provide cultural heritage access to the community, to protect workers and society, and to support art if possible.
In March 2020, in the whole world and at different levels, museums, shops, audience, and other cultural sites were closed without limitations of time, with pleasant, events, and visions.
As a result, intensive efforts are made to provide alternative services through digital platforms, and the decrease of other recent and very rapidly developed diseases is the restraint of academic services, a large history, and other social events, such as music and conser festivals, technology conferences, and the workshops.
The film industry also experienced an inquiry, and it was pronounced that the celebration of the Holy Feast in Rome, which falls on the last week of the Pentecost, was deleted.

This was the Olympice Museum Plan, which was originally started at the end of July; the International Olimpiade Olympice Committee announced on 24 March that the event will "reset up until 2020, but will not be more than the summer 2021." In the whole world, casino and other games were closed and moved directly to poker rounds.
This causes many advisers to the network jumps, many network sites reporting the improvement of the new defence industry, which has also affected the entertainment industry, with various groups of music, or cancel the concert tours.
Many big teaters like Broadway are also taking all the events.
Artists explore several ways to continue to produce and share works through the Internet as an alternative to directly advertising traditionally, such as direct networking concerts, or make "festival" web based for artists to share, publish, and publish their work.
Many of the Internet’s heartnavirs have been distributed networks with a lot of people who spend to humor and spend attention in the midst of uncertainty.
Since it has been understood the COVID-19, there is a increase in priority, xenofobia, and racism against the people of Tionghoa and East Asia, and against the people of the regions in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Inspekts of fear, corruption, and destruction in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asian Pacific.
The report of February (the majority of cases still limited in the Cyclopedia) records the racial signs of the world’s groups that Tionghoa’s people should accept virus or accept what they claim as a unique reward.
Some African countries also experience the improvement of the anti-Tiokong system.
Many of the people of Whan and Hubei reported discrimination because of their territory.
There are support for the Tionghoa people, both the net and the rings, and the people in the virus area.
Exploitating the development of ships to new hotspot countries, people from Italy, the first country in Europe that had serious COVID-19, could also be a number of destruction and xenofobia. People in countries include Malaysia, New Republic, Singapore, and South Korea at the beginning signed requests to prevent Tionghoa's country into their efforts to stop disease.
In Japan, #ChineseDontComeToJapan has become a train on Twitter.
Tionghoa and other Asians in England and the United States reported the increased racism prevention and attack.
President of the United States Donald Trump is critical because the heartnavirus is called "Virus Thatkong", the term which the critics considered race and anti-Tiokong.
The demonstrators in Ukraine attacked the buses that brought the Ukrainians and the invasive foreigners from Whan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from the Eastern India, who are limited to the Tsikong, and learned in the large cities of India, were reported to have a devastation related to the heartnavir.
President of Bharatiya Janata's country part unit in the Western Dilike Ghosh said that Tskong has destroyed the nature and "This is why God replied to them."
The statement then was threatened by the theocratic council in Kolumbian, called the "chuckle". In Tskong, xenofobia and racism against the non-Tionghoa people are struggled because of pandemi, with foreign people are described as "foreign sheep" and forbidden to "slaughter".
Many newspapers that use the payment increase have removed it for parts or all of their heartnavirs.
Many scientific publishers make the scientists available with open access.
Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on the practicing server, such as bioRxiv.

laboratory testing for corenavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods to detect existing virus and to detect antibodies produced as infection responses.
The existence of virus in the sample was confirmed with RT-PCR, which detects the heartnavirus RNA.
This test is specific and designed to detect SARS-CoV-2.
This test is used to confirm a new or still active infection.
Antibodies detection (serology) can be used for diagnosis and population surveys.
The use of antibodies shows the number of persons that have already been engaged, including those who are too able to be reported or who are without shock.
The mortality of diseases that are valid and the reverse of the group in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Because the limited test, until March 2020, there is no country that has legal data on the prevalence of virus in its population.
By 23 March, there is no country that tests more than 3% of its population, and there is a large variation in the number of tests done by countries.
This variability may also affect the number of cases that are reported, which is likely too high in some countries.
Using polymerase transcryption reactions back to the real time (rRT-PCR), this test can be performed on the sample of breathing that is allowed by various methods, including the use of nasophaling or sputum samples.
The results are available in a few hours to two days.
The RT-PCR use that is performed at the smooth use can only be used in the first week of illness.
On the other hand, virus can lose in the shooting as the pull continues to be controlled.
As an alternative, for those tested infections in the second week, the sample may be taken from the breasts in use of the slaughter or the material that is extracted through the stone.
One of the initial PCR tests was developed in Charity, Berlin, in January 2020 uses the actually-time transcriminatory polymerical reactions (rRT-PCR) and forms at least 250,000 test tools to distribute by the World Health Organization (WHO).
England Raya also develops tests on 23 January 2020. South Korean Corea develops SARS-CoV-2-based PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus) pendence tools on 28 January 2020.
This device is searching for "E" gen that takes all the heartnavirus, and the specific RdRp gen for SARS-CoV-2. In Quekong, BGI Group is one of the first company that receives the emergency use of the Administration of The National Medical Products for the PCR-CoV-2 instruments. In the United States, the Headquarters and Administration Centre (CDC) distributes the Panel of diagnostic RT-PCR Real-Time of New 2019 (20N-CoV) to the health laboratory through International Resources.
One of the three genetic tests in the old version test results not convinced because of reaction errors, and the number of tests in the CCD in the Atlanta limited; this affects less than 100 samples per day processed during February 2020.
The test use of two considering components cannot be resolved until 28 February 2020, and the laboratory of the State part and local laboratory was permitted to test.
This is approved by the United States Drugs and Food Office on the basis of the Darurat Use Authority. The US Trade Lab began to test the beginning of March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorrp announced that COVID-19 testing is based on the RT-PCR nationally.
Also, Quest Diagnostics makes COVID-19 testing available nationally on 9 March 2020.
No quantity limits are made; recovery and recovery must be done in accordance with CDC settings.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the Virological and Biotechnology Centre of the VECTOR State Research Center.
On 11 February 2020, this test was included by the Federal Office for Health Surveillance. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic was reported to develop tests to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA for testing that can be performed in 3.5 hours with high volume so that one machine can perform about 4.128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, FDA issued an emergency use authorisation (USA) to Abbott Laboratory for testing at the m2000 Abbott system; FDA has previously issued the same authorisation to the Hologic, LabCorp, and thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepty also received from the USFDA for a testing of about 45 minutes.
FDA has agreed to tests using the expansion of the isothermal nuclear axis that is not PCR.
Because there is no need for a number of temperature change cycles, this method can only provide positive results within five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Now there are about 18.000 machines in the AS and Abbott to increase production until the production of 50,000 tests per day. The use of monoclonal antibodies that are specifically connected to nuclear protein (protein N) new cornavirus is developed in Taiwan, with hope that they can produce results from 15 to 20 minutes like fast influenza tests.
A publishing work on March 2020 concluded that "foto toracs has small diagnostic values at the beginning of the beginning, when the CT [tomography of computers] finding may have already existed before the exhibition."
Special features of CT include bilateral multilocal base options with peripheral, asymmetric, and later distributions.
Subpleural domination, crazy paving, and consolidacy are formed by the development of diseases.
In Whan, a study compared to PCR with CTs at the current point of pandemics shows that CT significantly significantly more sensitive than the PCR, although less specifically, with a lot of skin smuggling plants with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT cannot be used for separation or as the first line test in COVID-19 diagnosis."In March 2020, CDC recommended the PCR for the initial detection.
The amount of immune response to infection is the antibodies of IgM and IgG.
This can be used to detect infectious infections from about 7 days after the experience, to determine immunity against disease, and in population surveys. Meditation can be done in the central laboratory (CLT) or with a point-of-care test (PoCT).
Automatic system with high results in many clinical laboratorys will be able to do this examination, but it will depend on the production levels for each system.
For CLT, normally one personal blood specification is used, although a number of specifications can be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCT, the general use of a personal bloodspecimen that is granted through the skin pressure.
Not like the PCR method, extraction step is not necessary before the investigation. On March 26, 2020, FDA indicates 29 guests that provide information to the Agency as necessary and that is now possible to distribute their antibodies tests.
On April 7, 2020, only one test adopted by the FDA based on an emergency use authorisation. In the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received the European provision for their testing tools that can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against virus in blood samples.
The testing capability is up to a few hundreds of samples in a few hours, so far more fast than the conventional PCR testing against the virus of RNA.
At the beginning of April, the England of Raya found that there was no antibodies testing that it was purchased enough to use.
Hong Kong launched the skelema that the first patient can stay at home, "Aurorate department will give specific shoes to the patients", they spend into it, send it back, and obtain the test results after some time. NHS of England states that the NHS is preaching the second case testing schemes in the home to avoid the risk of the patient to dismiss the other people if they come to the hospital or should be disinfected by ambulances if used.
On March 2, Germany’s National Association of Statutional Health Insurance Physicians said that Germany has the capacity of about 12.000 tests a day in the road station and 10.700 tests have been performed in the past week.
The costs are responsible for health insurance if testing is requested by the doctor.
According to President Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, a floor test was offered in some large cities.
In March 26, 2020, the number of tests carried out in Germany was not known because only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey declared that at least 483.295 samples have been tested until week 12/2020 and 33.491 sample (6.9%) positively for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers in the Technion and Rambam Heart developed and tested the samples of 64 patients together, with a series of samples and only tested more if the sample was found positive. In Whan, the laboratory emergency is 2,000 meters called "Huo-Yan" (i.e. g., Mandatory: "Fooo" or "Mapi" in Indonesian language in 5 February 2020, it is possible to get more than 10,000 (i.e.g., 1,000 m).
With its building watched by the BGI Wang Wang Jian and spends five days, the models show that the case in Hubei can be 47 percent higher and the costs associated with the carantina slows twice if there is no testing capacity.
The Whan Laboratory is immediately followed by the Huo-Yan laboratory in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in total 12 cities throughout the Cina.
For 4 March 2020, the total capacity of the day is a total of 500,000 tests per day. Multiple source design that is removed by Origami Assays can test the number of 1.222 patients for COVID-19 by using only 93 tests. This project can be performed in the small laboratory without the need to be robotic.
By the month of Maret, infringements and reactions that have not been identified have been a slave for massive testing in the United of Europe, the United Kingdom, the Raya, and the United States.
Because of this, a number of researchers are trying to explore the sample sample protocols that includes samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genome for further testing. On March 31, the Arab Emirat Unit was reported to make more heartnavir tests for the capital of any country, and is ready to increase the test scale to reach the major population.
This results through the combination of plot tests and the laboratory of the massive population of group 42 and BGI (based on the laboratory of emergency detection "Huo-Yan" in the Cyprus).
In 14 days, this laboratory can make hundreds of thousands of RT-PCR tests a day and is the first laboratory that has this scale outside the Pacific.
several test receptors are developed in the Cyclopedia, France, Germany, Hongkong, Japan, and the United States.
World Health Organization adopts German reception for testing tools sent to countries lowly without resources to develop themselves.
Germany’s response was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Administration Center is not available until 28 January to delay the available tests in the United States. At the beginning of the United States, the Cyprus and the United States are incomprehensive with the control of the test tools; these two countries and Australia are not able to provide sufficient tests to meet the requests and recommendations for healthy firms.
Instead, the doctor said that the extensive testing available in South Korea helps to reduce the new carnavir service.
Testing capacity, most in the Swasta Sector Laboratory, built in a few years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization recommends the improvement of the test programme as the best way to delay COVID-19. High request for testing because the large virus service causes a hundreds of thousands of tests to wait for work in the US swasta laboratory, and use and chemical reactions.
In March 2020, Tskong reported the problems of the testing tools.
In the United States, the testing tool developed by CDC has "defat"; then the government removes the birocratic interests that prevent swasta testing. Spain buys the test tools from the Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd company, but finds that the results are not correct.
The company explains that the unreasonable results of the failure in collecting the samples or using the test tools correctly.
Spain's curriculum said that they will interest the tools that make it wrong, and replace it with other test tools prepared by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test tools that the Czech Republic of Ceko has purchased is not correct. Slovakia purchased 1,2 million tests from the Tacoma that is not correct.
The Prime Minister Matovič recommended that the test tool is removed to the Danube River. The Kara Ateist from the Turkish Health Services states that the test was purchased from Turkey has "high-level" and they don't use it."Ingris Raya buys 3,5 million tools from the Chekongron, but at the beginning of April 2020, they claim that the device could not be used.
Testing, which is followed by the carantinas of people who are the most positively enhanced people and talking to people who are positive SARS-CoV-2, gives a positive end.
The first death site of COVID-19 in Italy, a researcher in Vó Italy, made two tests in the entire population of 3,400 people, with a distance of about 10 days.
About half of the positive ones who are experiencing have no phenomenon, and all the cases found in the karantina.
With the extent of the trip to the community, new infections are being identified as well.
With aggressive contacts, travel payments, tests and carantia, the corenavirus 2020 in Singapore developed far more late than other countries without extreme restraints, such as the reserve of restaurants and the corporations.
Many events were denied, and Singapore recommended the people to stay at home on March 28, but schools were opened back in the right time after release on March 23.
Some other countries also have pandemics with aggressive contacts, travels, tests, and karantinas, but with non - aggressive areas such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistics found that states who are testing more, relative to the number of death, have a less lower case fatality, perhaps because these countries are more able to determine those who have a smooth or unexpected losses.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have test capacity, and national laboratory with limited COVID-19 experience, send five positive COVID-19 samples and ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO laboratorys to confirm.
From 16 laboratorys, 7 in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the next quarter, the "Positive Tests" column is influenced by the testing rules of the country.
The country that is only tested by people who are in the hospital will have more positive results than all the countries who are testing, but they show the same spectrum or not, with other factors.
Put your hands, also called by purification of hands, is the action of purifying someone’s hands aimed to eliminate cows, oil, microorgans, or other unwanted ceremonies.
Bringing hands with skin in consistently on "Critic situations" throughout the day prevents many diseases, such as diarrees and coleras, which are expressed through fatal routes.
People can also be cut up with breathing diseases, such as influenza or seal, if they don’t cut their hands before touching the eyes, skin or mouth.
Five of the critical day to clean the hands with the sacs are: before and after a large swimming water, after cleaning the swimming pocket or replaceing the pocket, before kids, before eat and before and after they prepare food, or breasts, fish, or swallowing.
The World Health Organization recommends cleaning your hands if there is no water and salt.
Before, then, and after preparing food.
Before and after visiting the sick.
After replaceing the popup or cleaning the child’s only use of the toilet.
After cleaning nails, stones, or dinners.
After touching animals, animals, or animals.
Medical cleanness involves cleaning practices related to medical processes.
Bring your hands before giving drugs or medical care can prevent or reduce the preaching of disease.
Main medical goals cleaning their hands are cleaning the hands of pathogen (bacteria, virus, or other microorgans that can cause disease) and chemicals that may cause danger or disease.
This is especially important for those who care for food or work in medical fields, but also for the public.
Bringing hands have a lot of benefits of health, including minimising the influenza, heart virus, and other menu diseases; preventing the cause of decrease diarree; reduce breathing infections;
and reduce the number of children's mortality in the house.
The 2013 study shows that the improvement of the practical cleaning of the hands can slightly increase the increase of the balita child.
In developing countries, the mortality of children resulting in breast diseases and diarrees can be reduced by identifying simplicity of conduct, such as cleaning the hands of the skin.
This simplicity can reduce mortality rates of the disease to almost 50 percent.
The intervention that encouraging the hands can reduce the case of diameters around them; this intervention can be done by providing clean water in the low - control area.
48% of the cases of diare can be related to the hands of salt. Closing the hands with sauna is the only way the most effective and affordable to prevent the diare and infection of the acute breathing (ISPA), as a conduct under the conduct of the house, school, and community throughout the world.
Pneumion, which is the main ISPA, is the cause of a number of children’s death; this disease causes about 1,8 million children a year.
Diare and pneumonia caused almost 3,5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, making the hands with skin before eating and after using the tuberculosis, it can save more vacuum or medical life, and reduce the death caused by diarree to almost half and death resulting in the infection of acute respiratory infections to the fourth century.
Bringing hands are usually connected with other health action as part of the water program, sanitation, and cleanness (WASH).
Put your hands also protect themselves from the impetigo that is sent directly through physical contacts.
Small effects in cleaning the hands are a cleaning of hands that often can cause skin damage.
A study carried out in 2012 in Denmark found that the cleaning of the hands can lead to the skin and skin condition, which is known as hand exams or dematisms, especially in health officers.
Skip too often is seen as one of the obsessive-compulsive gangs (OCD).
There are five critics during the day when cleaning the hands with the skin is important to reduce illness by fever: before and after use of tuberculosis (low water broken, large water), after cleaning the child (pooking), before kids, before eating and/or preparing food or preparing meat, fish, or swallowing.
Another important time to apply the techniques to clean the right hands of preventing disease is before and after the blessed; after sweet, stones, or snakes; after touching animals or treating animals; and after touching the skin.
In many countries, the level of swimming hands is still low.
A study on the cleaning of hands in 54 countries in 2015 found that 38.7% households have sweet hands. A 2014 study shows that Saudi Arab has the highest level with 97%; the United States almost in the midst of 77%; and the Tacoma at the highest level with 23%. Now there are some changes in practice to increase the adoption of the conduct of the behaviour at the critical time. The group of students have been one choice in the country of developing countries to enhance the cost of children.
The Department of Education in the Philippian Health program is an example of the ability to support child health and education.
The use of skin drugs two times a year, added with cleaning the hands every day with sand and connecting teeth every day with fluoride, is the part of this national program.
This program was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The use of skin organics is forced with salt or detergence in water.
The main work of swimming and detergeny is a reduction in swimming and enhanced power.
The water is only unefficiently skin skinstorms because of milk and protein, which is organic cotton components, is not easy to break in water.
Indeed, heavy and protein smells are helped by enough water flows.
The skin, because the qualities that can be used again, may contain a bacteria that is obtained from the previous use of the bacteria.
A small number of studies that investigate the bacteria’s movement of bacteria from contaminated pigs found that movement could not happen because of the bacteria’s weaknesses.
However, CDC continues to declare "the skin that's extracted from the face without being cut off the hands more sweet."
Anti-Bankers are strike to healthy communities.
Together, there is no evidence that antiseptics or infections are better recommended for antibiotic organisms in the nature.
Nevertheless, anti - baker samples include general anti - baker agents such as triclus, which have a list of strain organisms with large detention.
So, even though antibiotic strains are not affected by antibacteria samples, it may not be an adverse effect.
Besides the surface and the skin protein, the formulation that can be included assam (assets, assets, asylum, meat ass, pHs) as pH, as a combination of active antimicrobics, and more skin conditioners ( vitamin, extracts, greenlands, etc.), and comprehensive analysis of the Massive Health Facility of the Oregon University of Oregon shows that the same effect is with high temperatures of consum particles that containers involving three diseases and leaves from bacteris.
Quiet water to clean your hands is not enough to kill bacteria.
bacteria grows faster in the body temperature (37 °C).
The warming water is more effective than the cold water in the elimination of natural oil that holds cows and bacteria.
However, in the back of many people’s confidence, scientific study shows that heat water use does not have effects in decreasing the number of microbes in their hands.
Hand - or antiseptics of hands are cleaning agents that are not based on water.
At the end of the 1990 ’ s and beginning of the 21th century, an unreasonable alcohol smooth agent began to be known with alcohol, antiseptic hands, or handproofing.
Most of these cleaning agencys are based on alcohol or ethanol isopropyl, which are formed together with the materials such as Carbomer (acrilate polymers) to be gele or with skins like gliserin, to make use of and to reduce the effects of alcohol.
Mass hydrogen production involving more antimicrobial activity, which contains at least 60-95% alcohol is an efficiency killer.
Alcohol testing killed bacteria, random bacteria against many drugs (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis bacteria, number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccination, influenza, and hepatitis).
Alcohol analysis with 70% of alcohol died 99.97% (log 3.5%, similar to 35 decibel) bacteria is handed in 30 seconds after injury and 99.99% to 99.99% to 99.999% (log 4 to 5) bacteria in the hands of 1 minute after the currency.
The testing of the hands of alcohol is almost not effective to the virus type of norovirus (or Norwalk), the most common cause for the menu gastroenteritis. Hand antiseptics or alcohol smokers in the number of drunkens must be used to interrupt or close two hands completely.
The front and the back of two hands and the hands on the eye and the distance of all the fingers were shocked around 30 seconds until the light, the skin, or the ring glass.
The U.S. Control and Protection Control Center also recommends the skilled hands of smoke hands, especially when the hands appear to be shocked.
It increases the use of an information agent because the use of rapid use and mortality against microorganisms; however, the agency should not be used as the right hand cut, except the skin and water.
Hand-based alcohol use can often cause skin bones, except emolines and/or skin causes to be added to the form.
Decreasing effects of alcohol can be reduced or avoided by adding gliserin and/or other emolines to the form.
In clinical tests, alcohol - based analysis contained emols causes a deterioration of skin and skin weakness far less less than skin and antimicrobial detergence.
Alergy contacts, urtic syndrome of contact, or hypersensitiveness against alcohol or additive seeds in dilute alcohol.
Increasedness results in the dematization of contacts that are struggling to become the power of this product is compared to cleaning the hands with water and skin.
Although effective, non-air agents do not clean their hands from organic materials, but just infecting it.
For this reason, the manufacturer of hands is not sweet and water in preventing many pathogens because the pathogens are still in their hands.
The dignity of alcohol free will depend on its materials and forms, and in his history, this product is significantly worse than alcohol and alcohol.
Recently, the formulation that uses clorid benzine has an anti-microbatic activity that continues and switchs after the pursuit, not like alcohol, which has been decreased after repeating use, maybe because of the reaction of progressive effects.
Many of the communities are lowly incapable of buying a skin and using a skin or a land as their way.
Abu or land may be more effective than just water, but less effective than skin.
One of the concerns is, if intaminations with microorganisms, land or abu may increase the care of natural diseases.
Like skin, the skin is also a desinfect agent because, if water contacts, the snake will form an alkalin fluctuation.
WHO recommends a snake and a snake as an alternative when the snake is not available.
Technology cleared the right hands based on the recommendation of the United States Diseases Control Center for Prevention of Diseases includes the following steps:
Hands with heat or cold water.
Water flow is recommended because it can be contaminated, while the temperature seems to be unlikely.
Take the hand with a lot of skins, including the hands, in the skins and under the skins.
The sauna puts a skin from skin, and the study shows that the skin cleans the hands more accurately when he uses a skin than when he uses water.
It's at least 20 seconds.
A shock of creating a skin that helps to remove the skins, and smell more longer skins.
If it is exactly under the water.
Rounding in the basket can make the hands contaminated again.
Slide with a snake, or let me swallow in the air.
The low and low arms are easier to contain again, and the frequencies are shocks, hands, zones between the fingers, and under the shock.
Cows and cups that are missing can store a microorgan.
Losion is often recommended to keep the hands off; skin skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection.
A number of lower costs can be made to facilitate the cleaning of the hands when water and/or salts are not available, for example, driving water from giards or bottles depending on and swimming and/or using skin, if necessary, in the developing countries. In the situation where the water is limited (e.g. school or areas of the developing countries), there are strong water solutions, such as "types" and other lower costs.
The thread of the type is a simple technology that uses water bottles depending on the tiles, the parents operated by the feet to give some water into the hands, and the snake.
Effective hand relief is an important part in the hand cleaning process, but there is a debate on the most effective form of handing in the public toilet.
More research shows that cards are much cleaner than electric hands found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study carried out by Westminster University, London, and has been funded by the European Tisue Symposium Card industry, to compare the level of card cleaning, heat air swimming and more modern aircraft.
After pulling and shrinking hands with warm air, the total number of bacteria was found increased in 194% in the finger books and 254% in the handscreen.
Rating with the jet air reverse results in the total rate 42% of bacteria in the finger books and 15% in the handscreen.
After pulling and cutting hands with the card, the total volume of bacteria reduces 76% in the finger books and 77% in the hand screen.There are also tested to determine the potential of mild contamination in other tuberculous users and the toilet environment because of each type of relief method.
Jet aircraft, which slows the air from the unit with the speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), enabled to spend a microorgan from hands and units and able to prevent other tube users and toilet environments up to 2 m.
The use of warm aircraft distributes microorgans up to 0.25 meters from the ring.
In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV products and the environment, various methods of evaluation have been evaluated.
After handling, the following bacteria changed:
There are many hand manufacturers, and the hand manufacturer has been compared with the relief using the card laptop.
Bringing hands using hands of the tissue is an alternative during driving if there is no salt and water.
Hand-based alcohol testing must contain at least 60% of alcohol.
Medical treatment was long after the physician Ignaz Semmelweis found its effect (1846) in preventing hospital diseases.
There is an electronic device that provides backup to remind hospital workers to clean their hands if they forgot.
One study found that the infection level decreased with the use of the device.
Medical hands are performed during at least 15 seconds, using salt and water in many or geles to assemble and strike each part of the hand.
The arm must be shocked with the fingers each other.
If there's a shoe under the shoes, the skin can be used to escape it.
Because the smells can keep in the water that are in the hands, the hands need to be able to swallow and swallow with clean snakes.
After the ring, the card was used to switch because of water (and open the door if needed).
This avoids the hand-contamination of the surface.
The aim of cleaning the hands in health care is to avoid the microorganization of pathogens ("man") and to avoid the blue.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the poorly cut the hands still on a level that could not be accepted in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses continue to forget to pull their hands before touching the patient to decrease microorganism.
One study shows that cleaning the right and simple hands of other simple processes can reduce the level of blood infection to 66 percent. World Health Organization has published paintings that show the standards of hands and hands in the health sector.
WHO’s hand cleaning concepts can also be found on its website for public comments.
Whitby et al was an important effort.
Commercial devices can be confirmed and confirmed when demonstrating the validity of the rules.
World Health Organization has five times to clean the hands:
After packing into body blood/heating
before aseptic task, and
After the patient's treatment. The use of anti-septic chemicals to the pig (any" drug "animicroba" or "animicroba") functions of killing handsome materials.
The function may be used before the slaughter or in situations when the antibiotic body holds very slow. To 'good' hands before the swimming operation, it requires because it can be dissolved and dissolved without touching, clorhexin or yodium cleaning, steril stirs to reduce the hand after cleaning, and steril to stirl and other sterile instructions to purify under mys.
All the clusters have to be released.
This process puts the hands and arms down to the shoes, usually 2 to 6 minutes.
It's not necessary for a long time of cutting 10 minutes.
When we driving, the water in the hands must be able to not flow back to the hand.
After the finishing hands, the hands were stripped with steriled bones and shocked snakes.
In order to reduce the mixture of the preaching work, it will be better to clean your hands or to use the career before and after the treatment of illnesses.
For the administration of statilokocus infections in the hospital, it was found that the greatest benefit of cleaning hands is of 20 percent of the first cleaning, and that additional benefits were very few when hands are increased over 35 percent.
Bringing with a common salt has more than three times to reduce infected diseases in the food than cleaning with antibacteria. Involvement between the hands with the alcohol base and cleaning the hand with the antibacteria with the media every 30 seconds shows that alcohol-based containers reduce the contamination of bacteria by 26% more than the antibacteria.
However, pigs and waters more effective than alcoholic skins to reduce the influenza of A H1N1 and difficult Clostridium. Intervention to enhance the cleaning of hands in health care can include education for the cutting of the hands, increased the use of alcohol based, and written reminders and lyrics to the staf.
More studies have been undertaken to know the most effective interventions in various health care rates.
In developing countries, wearing hands with skin was acknowledged as a basic way to achieve good health and even good nutrition.
However, less the water supply that can be managed, swimming, or skin facilities in the households, schools, and workplace makes it possible to achieve the universal hand - hand behavior as a challenge.
For example, most of the African regions, since their hands on the private toilet or the public toilet are disabled, although there are options available to make a wise hands.
Indeed, the weakness of the hands can also happen because of a swimming habit, not because there is little salt or water.
Promotions and encouragement to clean the hands with the sandy can affect the rule, enhance the benefits of the hands, and make changes in the conduct of the long - term population.
In order to walk effectively, control and evaluation are needed.
The systemistic trends against 70 studies found that the effective community-based approach to enhance the LMIC's hands, while the social insurance campaign is less effective. One example of the swimming hands in the school is "Third Star" by UNICEF that urges the school to take simple and widespread steps to ensure that students cut their hands with skin, between other sights.
At the minimum standard, schools can move from one star to three stars.
Construction of hands can be part of the garbage campaign that uses to reduce children’s diseases and deaths.
Another example of improvement of the climate campaigns that try to achieve the purpose of change of conduct. The 2019-2020 heart-related pandemics in the UnitedCEF encourages the sweet emotions of the hands.
Some studies investigate the cost effects cleared the whole hands in developing countries with the prevention of disability-adjusted life Year (DALY) or the lost year size of illness.
One triumph shows that encouraging hands with sandwich significantly higher costs of water and other sanitation.
It was cut off the hands for human health, especially for people in a medium-sized situation, such as the new mother born or soldier in the hospital, first known in the midst of the 19th century by two hand cleaning ports: Dr. Hungaria Ignaz Semmelweis working in Wina, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, "the establishment of modern treatment" in England.
At that time, many still believe that infection is caused by the mixture called mysm or the bad air.
In the 1980s, a change through food and infections related to health care makes the United States Control and Prevention Centre more actively encouraging hand cleaning as an important way to prevent infection.
In 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 increased the emergency in many countries, it would be important to cut their hands with salt to protect themselves from the menu disease.
For example, "Technology cleansed the right hands" depends on the cocktail of the hands in the public toilet and on the toilet of office and airports in Germany.
The expression "Clearn the hands of" means that someone's paragraph is to be responsible for something or to be involved in something.
The explanation comes from the chapter of the Bible in Matthew when Pontius Pilatus cleaned his hands on the decision to engage Jesus Christ, but it has been a large explanation used in the English community.
In Shakespeare’s work, Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to pursue his hands to pursue the skilled noise; the act that shows his fault about the crime that he did and because he has directed his husband to do so.
It has also been known that, after remembering or meditateing of nonethics, the smells are more often cleaning their hands and smelling the instruments of cleaning the hands.
Furthermore, those who were allowed to clean the hands after that meditation have smaller opportunities involved in compensation that "lift", like being volunteer.
The religion orders the hands to purify the purpose of purifying and symbolism. The purification of the hands, which uses water, but without snake to clean the hands, is a ritual part of cleaning the hands in many religions, including the Bahá's faith, Hindu, sweet and the native are in Jews, the Lavabo in Christians, and Wudhu in Islam.
Indeed, Hindu, Jews, and Islam were promising the hands of the toilet.
Furthermore, Hindu’s religion, Buddha, Sikh, Jews, and Islam imposed their hands before and after eating.
Labour danger control for COVID-19
Labour risk control for COVID-19 is the health and health methodology for controlling the dangers of cardiac disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The right dangeral management in the workplace depends on the location of work and jobs, based on the risk assessment of the stock source, the increase in the disease in society, and the risk factors of each employee which may be the most important COVID-19.
According to the AS Health and Work Safety (OSHA), the work of low-risk work has a minimum contact with the public and other working partners; for this work, it is encouraged to prevent basic infection, which includes cleaning hands, move the employees to stay at home if hospital, ethics of breathing, and to pursue and working environmental infections routinely.
The risk of shooting work includes work that requires close contact or often with people who are not known or who are expected to suffer COVID-19, but may be infected because of distortions in the community that are on the international journey.
It includes workers who have contact with the public community, such as schools, work environments with high popularity, and high volume rituals.
The danger control for this group, except the basic infection prevention steps, includes windows using high-efficiency air lines, safeguards against the farm, and provide self-protection tools when meeting COVID 19.
OSHA believes that health and body rooms are well known or expected to suffer high-risk of COVID-19, which increases the risk of high-scale risk if workers make aerosol accommodation process, or take or handle specifics of those who are known or are expected to suffer COVID-19.
The danger control of this worker includes technical controls, such as ventilation pressure space, and self - protection tools that are appropriate to work.
COVID-19 may have a number of disappointments in the workplace.
Workers may not come to work because of sickness, need to care for others, or fear of the likelihood.
Trade patterns can change, well in the kind of things requested, or in the way to obtain these goods (to be paid outside the busy hours, through the driving or the floor).
Finally, the transfer of materials from the extremely affected geographical region of COVID-19 can be detrimental, and infected disease reverse plans can be used to manage protective action.
The plan considers the risk levels related to various jobs and jobs, including funds, risk factors from house and society, and the risk factors of each employee, such as old age or chronic medical condition.
The article also provides the necessary regulations to handle these risks and the urgent plans for situations that may be caused as a result of the wealth.
The responsibilities and the plans of deterioration of disease may be supported by national or subnational recommendations.
The goal of wealth adverse includes reducing the deterioration among the staf, protecting people who are higher risks for bad health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimising bad effects on other entities in the capital.
The increase in diseases in business communities is affected by adverse acts.
Girarki’s dangeral control is a lot of jobs used in health and health work to slow down the danger controls based on its effects.
When COVID-19 dangers cannot be avoided, the most effective regulations are technical controls, are followed by administrative arrangements, and the last self protection tool.
Technical management include isolation of workers from related risks of work without depending on the conduct of workers and may be the most weighty solution to apply.
Administrative management is a change in the rules or processes of work that requires workers or employer’s actions.
Autoprotection tools (APD) are considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but can help prevent some of them.
All the types of APD should be selected based on dangers on workers, which are placed properly as (e.g., breather), be covered consistently and right, checked, careful, and instead of time, if necessary, and disappeared, cleaned, and implanted with right or removed to avoid contamination.
According to the US Health and Work Safety (OSHA), the work of low - risk work has minimum work contact with public and other working partners.
The basic prevention of infections recommended for all places of work is often clearing the hands, stimulating workers to live at home when hospital, and if the career includes covering stones and gardens, providing networks and swifts, preparing jobs from far or labour with the time of coming/decimal, if necessary, telling the workers to not use the tools and firms of others, and making swallowing and environmental infections.
Quick and isolated identification against a person who is able to prohibit is an important step in protecting workers, employees, visitors and others in the workplace.
The Centre of Control and Protection of Diseases (CDC) recommends that workers who have a smooth breast-feeding disease have to stay at home until they are free of warmth, warm signs, and other loops during at least 24 hours without using medications or other drought drugs, and to provide illnesses to enable workers to stay at home to care for a healthy family members, and to know this rules.
According to the OSHA, the risk of the carriage is involved in work that requires close contact or often in six feet (1.8 meters) with people who are not known or who are expected to suffer COVID-19, but may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 because of the community's discounts around business locations, or because a new person has traveled internationally to the location with an overall COVID-19 switch.
The workshop, including the workshops who are contacted with the public community such as schools, the working with high-population and high-level routines. Technical management for this group and risk groups, include high-efficiency filtering, increaseing the physics level of ventilation, incorporating physics like guarding, and establishing a drive-thru or launching windows for the owner service. Administrative arrangement for this group and group of expertise includes high-ranking workers who live in the house, switch up with a virtual communication, make up workers with time-ups/oriented responsibilities, developing an intelligence technicians for the university of COV.
Workers in this group of risks need respiratory.
If someone falls ill in the flight, the right control for protecting workers and other travellers includes separating the ill ones from the other 6 feet [6 feet], showing one cabinet to care for a sick person, and offering a face mask for a sick person, or requesting her to close the mouth and hair with a teeth when stone or dinner.
Canadian awake must hold medical skins once in the care of a ill-passing or touching the body’s liquid or the surface that can be contaminated and may be other protective tools if the ill-feeding skins suffer, the continuous stone, or the difficulty of breathing.
Hands and other items should be removed in the lively dangerous box, and the contaminated surface must be cleaned and defected after it. For commercial ships, including ships and other traveling ships, the dangers of control include travels when sick, isolating themselves, and informing medical centers on ships immediately when someone is on the ship.
It is ideal that further medical care is made in the kitchen that is isolated, without the service in the community, for schools and qualifications of child education, CDC recommends the decrease of infection to be cleaned or infected if the infected person has been in the school building.
If there are distortions in society at least at the level of time, social retribution strategies can be applied, including: cancelling field visits, meetings, and other large groups, such as physical education, vocational education, or eating in cafeteria, increased the speed between the table, time and slowly, restricting non-experienceal health offices, and use separated health offices for children with similar flu.
If there are high wages in local society, along with social relief strategies, school deployment longs can be considered, for law officers who do daily routine activities, the risk of health is directly lower by CDC.
The law enforcement officer that should contact persons with confirmed persons or otherwise COVID-19 is recommended to follow the same instruction with urgent medical technology, including using appropriate self-protecting tools.
If close contact is happening during the arrest, the employee must clean and dissolve lowly and infected tasks before returning with the use of swallowing or householders and follow the standard operating process to control, defeat, and to control and closure the skin clothes.
OSHA considers health energy and certain body rooms are in high or very high risk categorys.
High - board risks include health, support, laboratory and medical transport powers that are available with a known patients or are COVID-19.
This work is a very high risk of packaging if workers make a aerosol acquirement process, or take or handle specifics from, known patients or COVID-19.
Aerosol accommodators include intubations, stone industrial processes, bronkoscopi, some processes and dental examinations, or invasive specimens.
The carriage work includes high-risk workers who are involved in preparing a body known or in the case of COVID-19 at the time of death; this work is very high when workers make autopsis. Additional technical arrangements for this group include isolation rooms for aware or known patients of COVID-19, including when aerosol accommodation process is done.
Special negative pressure windows may be appropriate in some health care and body rooms.
Spesimens should be addressed to the prevention level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the patients who come to separate in different waiting rooms be based on the case of COVID-19. In addition to other APD, OSHA recommends breather for persons who work in 6 feet from aware or two infections of SARS-CoV-2, and those who do aerosol acerosol process.
In the United States, the N95 filtering respirator, which is agreed to NIOSH or better used in the context of the written and comprehensive care program, includes testing, training, and medical examination.
Another type of respiratory can provide greater protection and increase the health of workers. WHO does not recommend the totally closed swimming skins or captural because COVID-19 is breathing disease and not switching through the body.
WHO only recommends a scratch mask for scripting officers on the incoming point.
For those who take care, care, or treat COVID-19 patients without aerosol processing, WHO recommends that weapons, guards, or faces, skins, and hands behaviour.
If aerosol accommodation processes are made, sweet mask is instead of the N95 respirator or FFP2.
Remember that the APDs don't cover around the world, WHO recommended to reduce APD ' s needs by means of remote physics services, switching as a slaughter window, with only those who are involved directly in the care can include the rooms of COVID-19 patients, only useing APDs that are needed for specific tasks, continue to use the same respirator without having the same treatment with many patients with the same diagnosis, enhancing and coordinating the APD passion, and not encouraging the use of massacres for persons without geometry.

[Covid19] Remember the burden and prepare the future
TANGGAL/WAKE: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LISENSI: CC0: No right protected
We find ourselves in a wonderful situation this month.
COVID-19 epidemide is what makes clearly global human relations and the responsibilities we have.
We have never experienced the challenge, but we know that our best response depends on the empathy, the same work and the construction of the global community, which is the heart of this organization.
A friendship and concern that we have witnessed among all the work partners through emails, calls, and obrolans is an extraordinary validation of the extraordinary humans, which we have had enough luck, to work with them.
Thank you and my pride could not be able to call you as a companion of work.
Last week, someone shared my appreciation for our work.
They recall me how important it is for the world today to get access to Wikipedia and how strong this is for this important resources to remain online for all people.
Your job allows this to happen, so you can make sure this site remains walking, helping our friends pay, or help to keep our community's security.
The world needs the information provided by Wikipedia, especially today.
That's the moment when not only the work we do, but the way we do, we will make anxiety to the world.
Because the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some important changes on how we work together, which will start next week.
Adjustment to our work and headquarters
As Robyn previously mentioned, the teams met last night to discuss our approaches and offices for a few days and months in front.
In that conversation, we consider what we think is the right response to the challenges we've faced and the best way to maintain the continuity of the organization in the past.
We want to defeat pressure and support our mission for long speeds.
If you need to reduce the labour care, it's okay.
For all stakeholders, contractors, and contract workers:
Our daily work is about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until further information.
We don't set a free day, if you can work more at normal hours, this mission needs you.
However, the world can’t be predicted today, and you need to care for the loved ones, for the needs of the pocket, or to the doctor, your health is our priority.
We didn't take your job time.
If you're sick, don't work.
It should not be said, but we said it.
Unnecessary sickness or PTO can't be able to know your manager, and help your team to revise your calendars and fields to ensure the main work areas that can be resolved.
( If you are positively diagnosed with COVID-19, hope to know Bryan in T - C Ops that T - C may help you with support and ensure that your situation can be careful of your management.)
The struggles based on the hour will be paid full.
We told it, and again, to respect our committees to the contractor partners and the staf based on hours.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their work hours when normal situations.
This includes if you are sick and can’t work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many use the work as a way to strive toward the world around us.
The work we're doing can give great satisfaction, especially in these times.
Again, what is especially your own care.
Our request is you're communicating with your manager so that we know what to be expected and can take appropriate action.
Some workers are considered essential.
There are some jobs to continue walking.
SRE, SDM Operation, Confidence and Security Team, among others, make important jobs that may need further support.
We're going to start the process with all departments to evaluate this goal and discuss our focus to support the most important things to our mission.
There's a lot to do for all of us, we're only gonna focus full on the most exensive project.
The late moment will be nothing for the future.
We're not planned to follow the defect after this pandemic.
You will not be expected to work pleasantly to fill the time that is unrealistic at present.
We realize that the situation changes and will try to set up new targets and time lines if needed.
What about the APP (Annual Plan?)
To adjust with the new reality and the spectrum of the daily worktime, we intended to adapt time line for the 2020-2021 Yearbook Implementation.
We mean, to examine the length of the 2019-2020 plan, which allows more time to make a precision so that workers can priorize important jobs, self-remediation, and the loving person's care while communicating their needs or want to work with the workshop more than a few weeks before.
The length of this time line is significantly reduced in the work and planning pressure in all the organizations.
We will give our proposal to the next weekly Court and update the delegation and team at the next step, soon after we got confirmed.
Thanks for the APP team for your leadership in this matter.
Status, pages and offices
A week ago, we were told that one of our partners based on the SF might have paid COVID-19 virus.
However, as we were so worried, we worked with antivirus reproduction to disinfect all the surfaces in San Francisco office.
They use antivirus fluid in the hospital to infecte each surface, lobi, and all lifts that can access our floor.
The buildings apply the protocol of his own salvation by using products supporting the salvation of the worshipper.
We were glad that the office would be ready to use when we decided to get back.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which has shared the COVID-19 protocol to us and all the staf members based on the DC.
In the past week, our DC office has moved to the far - long work station, along with the board shared with San Francisco.
As we were known by some of our partners who are based in NYC, we were also discussing how to take places in Brooklyn.
This debate continued, but it may be struck.
Some of our partners worked out far away for the first time.
Our partners who have been working long ago realize that it may be necessary to change and they want to give you suggestions:
The slowest slowest cost of one or two hours.
If a longer session is needed, consider how to share it into a few days.
Define a closely defined partnership, a agenda, and send the previous publications.
So video as default, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate cooperation and connections directly.
The leadership to facilitate each other, a person to ask questions and a list of discussions, and someone to help make a contact record (or make a collaborative recording).
Send e-mail to technical support if you need a quiet header.
Use your peace compensation to buy small food.
Join the #remoties in Slack to talk to a partner about the shared job.
The SDM Operation team is looking for a web-based ergonomic domain to support the improvement of the job distributed throughout the Yasa.
In the past week we asked all the communities' currency funds to abolish the public event, such as Edit-a-thon, until WHO declared the pandemic ended.
We told them that we understood our requests for restraints and other distortions can make them impossible to complete the activities of the channels agreed and that no one will be given to be discovered because it should be taken or edited.
The next week, we will continue with further comments on the Wikipedia and the regional and other thematic conferences.
In general, the sense of the whole global community seems to be disappointed by this angry, but somewhat comforted on the explanation and ability to focus on its own communities, such as Wikimedia and others.
First, the CRT is trying to prepare pages at Meta-Wiki to provide rooms for communities to shut up and follow our communication with them.
Stay connected during the COVID situation19
We'll send an invitation to your calendar to the Kamis at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for special stage.
We will use this time to share additional payments, answer your questions, and take time to connect each other.
We're in this situation together and we want to help our best.
During that time, you can continue to get information from this email and all the extensive information related to COVID-19 in the Wikipedia Office.
CRT will continue to update this page and ensure all information is on one place.
We also tried to maintain the routine communication with the staf living in countries that are now encountered significantly.
If you have questions about travel, show, main work, or difficulties about shipping, or others that may need help, don’t worry about telling and working with CRT.
We're here to help provide support and to be linked according to the needs.
If you have secret or sensitive problems, please send email to Bryan Judan, Director of International SDM.
Do not have any changes in our work and our obligation.
On the contrary, this change is that our work and obligation may be adjusted in the way we have never done before.
These changes are important steps that we are convinced to support each other in this situation so that we can continue to work, provide support for our movement, and provide the world of their service.
The work that we planned before will be there waiting for us when the time arrives.
For now, this is the time to support each other and create a room for an important job that will come in a few weeks and may be a few months before.
We need you all to complete it, for that, we want you to care for yourself and your family so you can work as well as when needed.
Finally, please smell your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and other leader team members (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
b'Enzym of angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is a enzim which is situated on the outer surface of the cell (blowing cell) in pulse, artery, heart, ginsel, and usus.
ACE2 has anxia-conversion enzyme (ACE), which reduces the number of angiotensin-II and increases angiotensin (1-7), which makes it a goal of drugs that are intended to treat cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 also functions as a point of entering into the cell for some cornavirs.
Human ACE2 versions are often called hACE2.
The enzym of angiotensic 2 is a metaloenzim containing a ring that is situated on the surface of the endotel cell and other cells.
ACE2 protein has M2 peptidase terminal-N domain and domain transporting asam renal collectr terminal-C.
ACE2 is a protein burning single type I, with actively enzymized domain on the surface of the cell on the pull and other networks.
ACE2 extrasel domain is separated from the transmise domain by other enzims, known as sheddase, and forbidden protein being released into the blood flow and finally accessed to the urin.
ACE2 is situated in most organs: ACE2 is situated at the breath of most of the alveolar cells of the type II, the integration of small uses, the artery and vein cells, and the artery poles in most organs.
MRNA expression ACE2 is also found in the brain cortex, striatum, hypotalamus and brain barrier.
The principal ACE2 function is as ACE designer.
ACE divides angiotensic hormone I to be angiotensin II vasoconstrics.
Finally, ACE2 cuts the amino-fenilalanin-terminal carbon amino of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Pro-Phe) and hidrolysis became angiotensin (1-7) vasodiilator (H-Asp-Arg -Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also distinguish a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9] -bradikin, ampin, neurotensin, dinarfine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also sets up and burns the net amino axis SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As transmember protein, ACE2 functions as the main point in the cell for some coreavirus, including HCOV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS), and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, S1 protein connections to the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2-enzym domain with ACE2-enzym on the surface of cells affect the endosisis and virus translocation and enzym into the endose in the cell.
The input process also requires protein S by TMPRSS2 protein serial, which is currently investigated as a potential therapy. This fact makes hypothesis that the increase of ACE2 in cells may help infection.
However, many professionals and regulatory authorities recommend that ACE inhibitors and standard ARBs continue therapy.
A systematic and meta analysis interview, published on 11 July 2012, found that "the use of ACE inhibitors causes the increase of 34 per cent in the risk of pneumonia compared to control."
Furthermore, "the use of ACE inhibitors also reduces the risk of pneumonia to patients who have higher risks for pneumonia, especially stroke patients and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors is also related to the decrease of pneumonia, although the results are less strong than the whole pneumonia risk."
ACE2 human re combination (rhACE2) is expected to be a new therapy for acute pulmonary, and it seems to increase the hemodynamics of pulmonary and oxygen saturation in the skin with acute skin syndrome that is produced by lipoplescaride.
The half of the rhACE2 in humans about 10 hours with 30 minutes of work except the long (duration) 24 hours.
Some discovery shows that rhACE2 may be a promised drug for patients with intolerance towards the classic renal-angiotensin systems (OCI) inhibitors or to disease with angiotensin II in blood circle. rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical tests for the symptoms of acute symptoms.
b'Application of COVID-19 is an application designed for helping contacts to reverse the cornavirus 2019-2020, the process identification of people ("context") that may have been connected with infected persons.
Many applications are developed or issued, which receive official support in some regions and urgencys.
Some workshops to build contact conversation applications have developed.
The privacy problem is questioned, especially related to the system based on the location of the user geographical location.
A alternative that is not too excited of privacy includes the use of the Bluetooth signal to record the access to users with other phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple urged together that they would integrate functionality to support Bluetooth's applications directly into Android and iOS operating systems.
In the Quekong government, with Alipay, it has distributed the applications that people have enabled to check whether they had contact with COVID19.
This application is used in more than 200 towns of Tibet. In Singapore, the application was used as TraceTogether.
This application is developed by the local IT community, issued as an open source and will be distributed to the government.
This application is developed by communication, technology, and health.
By 14 April 2020, the application still waits for Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government states that the application of contact talks is in the further development stage and will be available to be distributed in a few weeks. Similar applications are proposed in Ireland and in France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are taking into consideration the applications based on TraceTogether Singapura and BlueTrace applications. Russia intended to identify the geofencing applications for patients living in Moscow; this application was designed to ensure that they do not leave their home.
Ross Anderson, Technology of Security at Cambridge University, mentioned a number of practical problems that may occur on the application system, including false positive and likely to be less effective if the application data are limited to the smallest population.
To overcome the concerns about the preaching of the "koronavirus" applications that are divided or dangerous, Apple sets limits to the type of organization that can add related heartnavir applications to App Store, which would only be limited to the "remi" organization or have a good reputation.
Google and Amazon applied similarly.
Privacy supporters show their concerns about the use of the mass supervisory use of the heartnavirus applications, especially on whether the survey infrastructure made to handle the carnavirus pandemics will be stopped after the threat of the end.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have expressed the limitations of such surveys.
This organization declares eight standards on the government project:
monitoring shall "all law, need, and proportional";
the requirements of the guard and supervisory need to have a swimming sun class;
the use of data should be limited to COVID-19 purpose;
data security and anonymity must be protected and clearly protected based on evidence;
digital supervisions should avoid increasing discrimination and marginalization;
each part of the data with the third party must be defined in the invitations;
must be protected against the abuse and the rights of the citizens to respond to disability;
Participation means all "me important interests" necessary, including social health and initialization groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter without borders) also issued the list of checks.
The Google/Apple article intends to address the problems of the surveillance continues to be removed by removing the playing mechanism from the device operation after no longer needed.
Some countries use network - based locations, not applications, in order to avoid the ability to download applications and ability to avoid talking.
In Israel, it was accepted by a network.
The solution based on the network that has access to the local data has a significant personality potential.
However, not all systems with the center server need to access personal locations; a number of privacy protection systems have been made and use the center only for communications (see below).
In South Korea, the non-application system was used for contact talks.
As a means of using special applications, the system collects information from various sources, including the data for sales and card transactions, and connects this information to produce information through text message to those who are infected.
Besides using this information to warn potential contacts, the government also provides information on this location available to the public, which is allowed to have a broad change in information privacy laws after it was taken in the country.
This information is available to be generally available through a number of applications and websites. States like Germany are considered to use the private systems that protect private systems.
By 6 April 2020, the details haven't been released.
Contacts which protect privacy are an already map concept, with a large number of research literatures starting from at least 2013.After 7 April 2020, more than one of the teams operate with private solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record the closest user with other phones.
However, PEP-PT is a coordinating efforts that contain centralized and developed approaches, and not a single protocol. The Decreased Protocol includes Detail Detailing that protects the Developer Privacy (DPT/DP-3T), Separate Contact number (TCN, previously called Contact number, CEN), Protocol and Privacy Sensibility Mechanism for Simple Contacts (PACT), and otherwise.
In this protocol, personal data that can be identified have never left the device, and all matches happen on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab develops SafePaths, a platform to use private technologies that protect privacy when gathering and use the locations or filter intersecting data to investigate the COVID-19 preaching.
It is based on the study of the white film "Apps Gone Rogue: Personal Privacy maintenance in an epidemic" issued on March 2020.Other way is SafeTrace by Enigma MPC, a company that developed private technology and its initially established on MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses safe hard technology to allow users to share locations and health data sensitively with other users and users without offering the data privacy.
On 5 April 2020, global TCN coalition was established by groups that are closed on the same basis and are a great number of protocols to reduce fragmentation and enable global interoperability for the discussion and warning applications, which is the main aspect of the achievement of a comprehensive review.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that they have made a BlueTrace protocol used by its official application as an open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, a company managing Android and iOS platforms, endorsed the initiative to launch contacts, which they will claim to protect the privacy, based on the combination of Bluetooth Low Energy and privacy cryptographies.
They also have the specification of the integer technology used in that system.
Apple and Google say that this system is intended to be started in three steps:
The destructive of the tools to enable the government to make official applications of cornavir that protect privacy
The integration of this function directly to the iOS and Android Google and Apple are planned to address data control problems and surveys continue to continue to distribute the system through the operating system, and then remove it in the same way after the threat.
b'Direction of drugs (which means new purposes, new profile, or new tasks for drugs or therapy) is the use of drugs that have been agreed for new treatment, assigned to different diseases or medical conditions for the start of development of drugs.
This route is the path of scientific research that is currently undertaken to develop a safe and effective COVID-related treatment.
Another research includes the development of COVID-19 vaccine and convalesen plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 contains around 66 proteins that can be a drug target, each protein has a number of link-related sites.
Analysis to the sites of these linking sites may be the basic project for the development of antivirus drugs against COVID-19 protein.
Some most important SARS-CoV-2 proteins are the protease like papine, polymerase polymerase dependent on RNA, helikase, protein S, and ADP ribofosfatase.

Remdesivir was made and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola and Marburg Virus infection. Then Gilead Sciences found that Remdesivir has antivirus actively in vitro against some philosophy, pneumonics, and cornavirs.
One of the problems with antivirus treatment is that there is resistance through mutations that can cause more serious diseases and transmissions.
Some early trials show remdecivir may have high genetic service against resistance. There are some clinical tests that are ongoing, including two clinical tests carried out by the Cleveland University Hospital, assigned one for people with sick disease and another for sick sick people.
There are three clinical tests that are continued for intravenous C vitamins for persons who are treated by fires and COVID-19 pains, cut two thermoplasebos (Tiokong, Canada) and one without control (Italia).

b'Vaksin COVID-19 is hypothetic vaccine against cardiac disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although there is no vaccine that completes the clinical test, there are many efforts to develop the vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) said that, according to WHO, vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, this disease will not be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates are conducted in the April Fase I security study.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
The large expansion spread to the world in 2020, which affects large investments and research activities to develop vaccine.
Many organizations use genome that are published to develop vaccine that may be possible to combat SARS-CoV-2.
In April, the CEPI Initiative states that what is to be observed in the development of vaccines is speed, production capacity, preaching on the needed scale, and global access.
In April, the CEPI research reports that 10 different technology platforms are in research and development during the beginning of 2020 to create effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main goal of the platform to study Fase I security, including:
Nuclear asam (DNA and RNA) (developing Fase I and vaccine candidates: modern, mRNA-1273)
Vector Virus (developing Fase I and vaccine candidates: CanSino Biologicals, vector adenovirus type 5)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, the total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early development stage, with 78 confirmed as an active project (79, according to Milken Institute), and 37 other are being developed, but with little available public information (often they are being planned or planned).
Uji testing Fase I-II testing security and immunogenity, usually fairly done, plasma control, and in some locations, while identifying a better effective dose.
Fase III test uses usually include more pesticides, including control groups, and test vaccine effects to prevent diseases, while increased the effect of the optimal dose.
From 79 vaccine candidates actively developed (confirmation at the beginning of April 2020), 74 of them are not in human evaluation (and in the "practical") research.

In March 2020, government, industry and three universities assembled resources to access supercomputers from IBM, combined with the sources of hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have the heterolog effects, which also called non-specific effects.
That means that these vaccines can benefit from the outer disease that they are depressed.
The use of more trials in Australia tries to follow 4.170 health officers.
There is likelihood of vaccine in development will not be safe or effective.
Initially studyed to evaluate the vacuum wealth of using the specific COVID-19 animal model, such as ACE2-transgenic tissue, other laboratory animals, and non-human primary primary, shows the need to resolve the level of biological salvation in the process of life virus, and international coordination to ensure standard salvation processes.
Vacuum against SARS and MERS has been tested in nonhumanous animal models.
By 2020, there are no drugs or vaccines for SARS that are safe and effective to humans.
According to the research issue published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS is priority for governments and community health in the whole world.
When MERS becomes prevalence, SARS studies that are convinced can be a useful template to develop vaccine and therapy against MERS-CoV infections.
In March 2020, there is one MERS vaccine (based on DNA) which completes the clinical test on humans, and three other vaccines are in the process, which all are virus vector vaccines, two adenovirus vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts describe the theory of conspiration which declared virus on COVID-19 have been known previously and that vaccine has been available.
Patients that are identified by various social media posts indicate the patents that are for genetics and vaccines for other heartnavirs, such as SARS cornavirus.
b'Penyakit cornavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a menur disease caused by heartnavir syndrome acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-COV-2).
The public practice includes shoes, stones, and breasts.
Other events can include illness, otot, diarree, smooth disease, loss of hate, and skin sickness.
The time from shipping up to the frequency is usually about five days, but it can start from two to four to fourteen days.
Despite most of the cases, some developments have become a virus pneumonia and the fall of major organs.
By April 17, 2020, more than 2,24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and the historic regions, which affects more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568.000 people have been guilty: this virus is mostly distributed by humans when they are close to contacts, often through small divisions or droplets that are produced through stones, snakes, or when talking.
Even though the breasts are cut off, they usually fall to the ground or to the surface, and they do not slow up to a distance.
They can also be infected by touching the contaminated surface and touching their eyes, nests, or mouth.
On the surface, this virus can remain up to 72 hours.
This virus is very prompted for the first three days after the skin, although the preaching may happen before the event appears and after the next illness. Standard diagnosis is with the reaction of polymerase transcryption in real time (rRT-PCR) to the use of nasofaring.
The use of mask is encouraged to those who are expected to be virus and careful.
Recommendations on the use of maskers by the public community; some authors recommend that not use the mask, some recommend their use, and some other deficiencies the use of them.
Today, there is no vaccine or specific antivirus treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmissions of disease have been recorded in almost all countries in the WHO six regions.
The virus infected person can be infected without a phenomenon or experiences a flow, such as skin, stones, weaknesses, and breasts.
The urgency is involved by breathing, nervous or grieve in the skin of the skin, swimming, hardness, waking, and face or snake; the medical currency is immediately recommended if this appears.
Successful breastfeeds, such as smells, smells, or tormental diseases can be seen, but more slowly happen.
Gastrointestinal events, such as smells, torments, and diarrees, are predominant in many spectacles.
Some of the cases in the first Cyclopedia were only with a painted and palpicion channel.
In some people, illness can be developed in pneumonia, insufficient organs, and death.
This time is called an incubatory time.
The incubation time for COVID-19 usually is five to six days, but it can start from two to 14 days.
97.5% of the infected persons will experience in 11,5 days of infection.
But the first evidence shows that they may have contributed to the preaching of the sickness.
Today, the proportion of infectioned persons who are not known and being found, with the Corean Control and Prevention Center (CDC) reports that 20 percent of all cases have been confirmed remaining without experience during the hospital visit.
The Chick National Health Committee began to integrate cases in the case of 1 April; from 166 infections on that day, 130 cases (78%) were not shown injuries during the test.
Sputums and wild waters can lead to viral mutations in large scales.
Speaking with the latter will leave more divisions or droplets than normally speaking.
A study in Singapore found that a stone that is not covered can cause a cutting cut up up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although this virus is not generally advertised through the air, the United States National Science Academy shows that bioaerosol transmission may happen and deploy the air that is placed outside the room of people produce a positive sample for the RNA virus.
Some medical processes, such as intubation and pulmonary heart resolve (RJP), can make the breath secret changed into a aerosol and spread through the air.
Although there is anxiety that the virus can spread through the fascination, the risks are low, but the risks are less less than those who are in the case; even though the preaching work may happen before it appears, the risks are low.
The European Disease Center (ECDC) said that although it is not clearly how easy this disease is, one generally infected two to three others. This virus can be kept on the surface for hours until days.
It was found that virus can be detected for one day in cards/cards, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and cardiac detention (ASI 304) and up to 4 hours on the floor of 99 percent.
However, this variety depends on the heat and temperature.
The skin and detergens are also effective if they are used correctly; the skin produces cutting the tube of the virus, deactivating the virus, and release it from the skin and other surfaces.
Others, such as chloride benzalconium and glucoonic glucoon (grain disinfection), are less effective. In a study in Hongkong, green water sample was taken in a medium two days after the shock began.
In five of six patients, the first sample shows the highest virus load, and six patients show the highest virus load on the second day test.
Coronavirus acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new heavy respiratory syndrome, which first was isolated from three people with a pneumonia related to the classic case of acute respiration disease in Whan.
All the new SARS-CoV-2 virus circles are in the heartnavirs of nature.
In the outside of the human body, this virus was killed by the household snake, which destroyed its protection. SARS-CoV-2 is close to the first SARS-CoV.
The powder is the most affected organ of COVID-19 because the virus has access to frozen cells through angiotensin 2 (ACE2) enzyme, which is the most richest of the alveolar cell type II of pulse.
This virus uses special glucoprotein on the surface called "spike or tonjolan" (peplomer) to connect to the ACE2 and enter a skin cell.
The acid heart is found in 12 percent of the infected infections in Whan, Tskong, and more often in serious diseases.
High cardiovascular rates because there is a response to system inflammation and immune systems during the development of disease, but myocard can also be associated with ACE2 receptor in heart.
ACE2 receptor expressed very high in the heart and involved in the heart function.
Insiden thrombosis (31%) and vein tromboembolics (25%) were found in COVID-19 patients in ICU and may be related to bad prognosis. Autopsis to people who died because COVID-19 found alveolar difus (DAD) and inflamation inflammation in the powder.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for the respiratory epital that expresses ACE2, COVID-19 patients have a systemic hyperinflation skin.
Specially, T cells that enhance the GM-CSF pathogenic pathologically correlated with monosytic controls that increased the IL-6 inflammators and the severe pathology of COVID-19 patients.
Lifostic filters have also been reported on autopsis.
WHO has implemented some test protocols for this disease.
The standard test method is the transcription of polymerase transcrisis back to the real time (rRT-PCR).
These tests are generally performed on the samples of breathing that are permitted by nasopharing; however, it can also be used.
The results are available in a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but two blood samples are taken by two weeks, so that the results have a small time.
Scientists of Chekong can isolate this heartnavir and reduce its genetic sequence so that the laboratory worldwide can develop a testing of polymerase ratio (PCR) independently to detect infection by this virus.
On 4 April 2020, antibodies tests (which can detect active infection and if someone has been previously infected) are in development, but not much use.
The Cyclopedia experience shows that it was only 60 to 70 percent.
FDA in the United States approve first-of-care tests on 21 March 2020 to be used at the end of the month. The diagnosis issued by the Hospital Zhongnan University Whan recommended the methods to detect infection based on clinical descriptions and epidemic risks.
Multilobar multilobar multiplease options with the distribution of perifer, asimetris, and later many were found at the beginning of infection.
Subpleural domination, crazy paving (the use of lobulal seed with alveoleal variation), and consolidation may appear to a degree of disease development.
A few data are available on microscopical leaks and COVID-19 pathophysology.
Main pathology on autopsie is:
Macroscopi: plouration, perikardite, pulmonary consolidation, and pulmonary edema
Four types of virus pneumonia can be observed:
Renal pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumonia pneumonia, big atypic pneumonics, interstitutional inflammation with lymphosistic infiltration, and raising a lot of biological cells
Heavy pneumonia: alveolar difused (DAD) with alveolar exhibition.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory symptoms (ARDS) and heavy hypothemia.
Bangktop tub at the base of origin: dosens of alveolar wheat and interstitual fibrosis
The blood: intravascular coagulated coagulation (DIC); leukoiretroblastic reaction
Prevention steps to reduce the likelihood of infection include in the homes, avoid many places, often cut the hands with the skin and water at least 20 seconds, impair good breath hygiene, and avoid touching the eyes, skin, or mouth with unclean hands.
CDC recommends to close your mouth and neck with a tissue when stones or bushes and recommend the use of part in the pocket if not available.
Hygiene’s hands that are suitable after stones or snakes are encouraged.
CDC recommends the use of shoes from a public place, partly to restrict the distortion of people without gentleness. Social dispensation strategy is intended to reduce the contact of people infected with many people, in a way of closing schools and workplace, restricting travels, and deleting large meetings in public places.
The shipping farm includes at least 6 feet or 1,8 m.
There are no drugs known that prevent COVID-19.Therena vaccine is not available until the beginning of 2021, the main part of COVID-19 treatment is trying to reduce the epidemic height, known as "cover".
CDC also recommends that people often clean their hands with salt and water during at least 20 seconds, especially after the toilet, or when the hands appear to be smooth, before eating, and after heating, stone, or drinking.
More CDC recommends also using hand-based alcohol based with at least 60% of alcohol, but only when salt and water are not available. In an unnecessary trade hands area, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In this formulation, antimicroba activity originates from etanol or isopropanol.
The massage hydrogen used to help switch bacteria in alcohol; this is "make active substances for hand-sepsis."
Gliserol was added as a sweet.
People are treated with support, which can include heat therapy, oxygen support, and support other relevant vital organs.
CDC recommends people who hope they're taking a virus to use a simple face mask.
The oxygen of extracorporeum (ECMO) has been used to address the problems of breathing, but its benefits are still considered.
Suicide, life - style and healthy food patterns are recommended to increase immunity.
The WHO and the Commission of the National Health of Tsikong have published recommendations for the treatment of COVID-19 injuries.
Intensive and pull care practices in the United States have recommended the care of various departments to provide free resources, or IBCC.
By April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
A number of medical powers recommend parasetamol (astaminofen) more than motherprofen for the first line use.
Prevention should be taken to minimise the risk of virus distortion, especially in health care rates when making aerosol process, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
The CDC recommends that this person be placed in the island of Tular-Udara (IAIR) in addition to the use of standard prevention, contact prevention, and the prevention of tuberculosis.
The device recommended is: APD, respirator or face mask, eye protector, and medical hands. If available, a breather (the face mask) better.
N95 respirator was agreed to the industrial statistics, but FDA has authorized this mask to be used on the basis of the Darurat Use Authority (US).
N95 respirator was designed to protect from air swimming parts like a pool, but the effectiveness of certain biological agency is not allowed to use that is not mentioned in the label.
If the mask is not available, CDC recommends to use the face protection or, as the last effort, its own mask.
Most of the COVID-19 cases are not too weak until they need its mechanical or alternative ventilations, but some of the cases are very weak.
The type of breathing support for persons who have failed to live in COVID-19 are active for persons who are careful for the fire, and there are evidence that intubation can be avoided with high flows or bipotic air pressure.
No matter whether one of these two methods produces the same benefit for those who are critical.
Some doctors prefer to continue to use invasive mechanical ventilations, when available, because this technology limits the aerosol part of the service compared to the higher skin.
Many countries have no hospital bedrooms for swimming captains, which limit the health system capabilities to handle slowly the number of cases of COVID-19, so that they need shocks.
A study in Chekong found that 5% in intensive treatment units, 2,3% require mechanical ventilation support, and 1,4% died.
In the Cyprus, about 30 percent of COVID-19 firms were finally engaged in ICU.
Mechanical ventilations become more complicated with the syndrome of acute respiration (ARDS) occurred in COVID-19 and oxygen increased.
A ventilator that can do the pressure control mode and high PEEP requires to reduce oxygen flows as well as minimises the risk of pulmonary and skin motorcycles related to ventilators.
High PEP may not be available on old ventilators.
Studies on the medication potential starting in January 2020, and some antiviral drugs are in clinical tests.
Remdecivir seems the most promising.
Although new drug development may require time to 2021, some drugs that are tested have been agreed to use other uses or have been in a further test.
Antivirus can be tested by people with serious diseases.
The workers recommended that WHO participate in and in the testing of potential effects and safety. FDA has provided temporary authorisation for convalence plasmas as an experimental treatment in the case of a person's life is very or threatened.
Convalesen plasma has not performed clinical studies to prove its safety and effectiveness for this disease.
In February 2020, Tskong started a single application to handle this disease.
User requested to enter their ID name and number.
This application can identify close contacts using monitor data so that it can detect the risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If the risk potential is detected, applications are not only recommended by the infected cards, but also tell local health officers. The analyticals are available on phone data, sight-related technologies, telephones, and swimmingness used to check the infected persons and those in contact with them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed the security office to investigate the telephone data that was expected to be carnavirus.
It was taken to treat the carnatine and protect those who may be contacted with the infected citizens.
Furthermore, in March 2020, German Telekom shared adding data to the Federal Government of Germany, Robert Koch Institute, in an investigation and prevention of the virus.
Russia uses visional technologies to detect carantians.
Italian Regional Health Commissionr, Julia Gallera, said he was told to know the phone operator that "40% of the people continue to move places."
Germany’s government did a hackhone at the end of the week 48 hours with over 42.000 peers.
Furthermore, the President of Estonia, the Chief Kaljulaid, made a global search for creative solutions to the cardiac care.
Many may experience pressures resulting from carantina, travellers, treatment effects, or fear of the infection.
BBC chaired Rory O'Connor that said, "The improvement of social isolation, health, health, stress, and economic emergency is the perfect deterioration of mental health and social health."
This disease can continue with a little or without a smooth, which differs of breathing diseases on the other public, such as pills.
Of course, in two weeks, the cases of illness or critical may need three to six weeks to be curated.
Pregnant women may have higher risks for COVID-19 infections based on similar virus data, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 are still less.
In the worst person, COVID-19 can rapidly develop the syndrome of acute breathing (ARDS) which causes breathing failure, sectic smoke, or fall of major organs.
Complete COVID-19, including sepsis, abnormal blood comparisons, and injury to heart, gymnasium, and heart.
Blood adjustment, especially protrombial increases, has been estimated to 6% of COVID-19 patients who have been treated injury, while gymnastic functions appear to 4% of these groups.
About 20-30 per cent of people with COVID-19 image shows enzym increased (transaminase).
According to the same report, the median time between the age and death is ten days, with five days being spent in shoes.
However, the patient moved to the ICU has a mean time between the fire and the death of seven days.
In a study that examined the first cases, the media time started from the beginning until the death was 14 days, with six to 41 days full.
In a study by the National Health Committee (NHC) of Tskong, men have a dead number of 2,8%, while women have a death rate of 1,7%.
The histopatology samples of postmortems shows alveolar illness is exposed with fibromicsoid slur in the two pulses.
Changes of viral sites are especially in pneumonia.
The pneumatic image divides the syndrome by the accurate breath (ARDS).
On 11,8 per cent of the death reported by the National Health Committee of the tsunami, the predominant heart damage, with a increase in troponin or stopped heart.
According to Maret month data from the United States, 89 per cent of those who are engaged in shipping conditions, and medical and social resources can also affect mortality.
The mortality of the condition is different because of the difference in the region, but also of the difficulties of methodology.
The infringement of the raw case can cause the number of deaths to be too high.
However, the fact that death is the result of the past cases may mean to be too low in the present number of mortality.
But Kok has the probability that it is 1.4 times greater than the serious COVID-19 and about 2.4 times more likely to need intensive treatment or death than those not maze.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority has found the decrease of 20 percent to 30 percent of the diseases, and the injury of the organs shows the damage of the body.
This can also cause passport symptoms after healing.
By March 2020, not known if infections previously provide effective and long-term immunities to people who are guilty from this disease.
Immunity may be accepted if you see the behaviour of another heartnavir, but it has been reported that the case of COVID-19 was accompanied by a positive cornavir test a few days later.
This is a resurrectional infection, not a renewed infection.
This virus is expected to be natural and originate from animals, through a public infection.
It was not known, but in December 2019, the preaching of the infected preaching was almost all of the people’s wickedness to man.
A study against 41 cases confirmed the first COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, declares the most early date of historic life was 1 December 2019.
Official publications of the WHO reported the first time of December 8, 2019.
In the meantime, some measurements are used to calculate mortality.
This changing varies from the region and the time, and is influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health system, the treatment options, the time since the first change, and the nature of popularity such as age, malnutrition, and health.
At the end of 2019, WHO sets the ICD-10 emergency code U07.1 for death because of SARS-CoV-2 infections confirmed in laboratory and U07.2 for deaths resulting from COVID-19 that was diagnosed clinically or epidemic without confirming laboratory infection for SARS-CoV-2 infections.
According to Statistics of University Johns Hopkins, death ratio against cases globally is 6.9% (153.822/2.240.191) at 17 April 2020.
Other increases include case fatality (CFR), which reflects the diagnosis of individuals who died from a certain disease, and the number of infectious fatalities (IFR), which reflects the infected persons (diagnosis and undiagnosis) who died due to certain diseases.
This statistics are not connected to time and follow a certain population starts from infection to the resolve of cases.
Although not everyone infected makes antibodies, antibodies can provide information about the number of people infected.
In the episentrum in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village with 4600 people, 80 (1,7%) already died.
In Gangelt, this disease was distributed through the Karnaval Festival, which spread to young people, causes relatively lower mortality, and it is not likely all the deaths of COVID-19 are classified as COVID-19.
Furthermore, the German health system isn't driving.
In the Netherlands, about 3 per cent of the population may have antibodies, such as the blood donors are examined.
69 people (0.004% of populations) were confried because of COVID-19.
The pandemics and the mortality levels are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher for men in a study in the Cyclopedia and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in the 50s, with a risk of risk between men and new women not appeared at a age of 90.
In the Cyprus, the number of deaths for men is 2.5 percent and for women by 1,7 per cent.
The reasons of differences are certainly not known, but genetic factors and conduct may be reasonable.
Immunological differences based on the type of smoking, smoking lower to women, and men who have a comorbid condition, such as hypertension, in young age than women can contribute to a higher mortality to men.
In Europe, 57 percent of infected people are men and 72 percent died because COVID-19 is a man.
By April 2020, the U.S. government did not investigate the type of data related to the type of COVID-19 infection.
Research shows that virus diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS affect men and women in different ways.
A percentage of healthcare officers who have eight more women, especially illness, and they have higher opportunities to have viruses.
World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of this disease is "COVID-19".
WHO leader Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explains that CO is short for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for the first time identified: 31 December 2019.
The name is selected to avoid references to certain geographical locations (e.g. T.T.), animal species, or group people, with international recommendation to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is given the name of the heartnavirus syndrome of the acute 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19" and "Virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communication.
Good disease and lazim virus called "koronavirus".
At the beginning of Whan, Tskong, the virus and the disease are called "koronavirus" and "Coronavirus Whan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and acute respiratory diseases as a temporary name for virus and diseases in accordance with 2015 that would not be used to use local names in the name of disease and virus.
Official name COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 was issued on 11 February 2020.
Because the limitation of the capacity in the standard market, some digital producers put health care materials such as data and ventilator components.
In one example, when an Italian hospital is very needing to cut the ventilators, and the shopper can't give in the necessary time, a local firm, and loading 100 cups that are needed in the night.
After the beginning of COVID-19, the theory of conspiration, wrong information, and information about origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other diseases, which are fastly distributed.
Humanity seems to be able to distribute virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in dogs, babys, and skins.
There is no drug or vaccine agreed to treat this disease.
International studies on vaccine and COVID-19 are conducted by government organizations, academic groups, and industrial research.
In March, the World Health Organization describes "SOLIDARITY Trial" to investigate the effects of four antivirals that have already been with the most promising joy.
The vaccine is not available, but a number of departments are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Recent research on SARS-CoV is used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies that are understood.
First, research aims to make a smooth virus vaccine.
The use of the virus, well as an active or dead virus, aims to slowly drive human immune response to the new COVID-19 infection.
Second strategy, subunit vaccine, aims to create vaccines that make sensitive immune systems against some virus subunits.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study focused on S-spic protein that helps the virus to detect the ACE2-receptor enzym.
Third strategy is nuclear ass vaccine (ADN vaccine or RNA, new technology to make vaccination).
The experimental vaccine made with these strategies should be tested to know their security and honor. On March 16, 2020, the first clinic of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
Vaxin contains inevitable genetic code of virus that causes disease. The increase in antibodies has been recommended as a potential challenge to develop SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this method is still contraversal.
There are more than 300 active clinical tests in April 2020.
Seven tries to evaluate the treatments that have been agreed for malaria, including four studies on hydroxichloroquin or cloroquin.
The new purpose of antiviral drugs forms a major part of the tsunamix research, with nine tests of Fase III tests on remdecivir in some countries with the summer time of report at the end of April.
In April 2020, the dynamism on clinical development for vaccine candidates and COVID-19 has existed.The amount of antiviral drugs that have been evaluated for COVID-19 treatment, including remidezivir, cloroxicon and hydrochlorocuin, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir are combined with beta interference.
In March 2020, there are temporary evidence for the joy of remdecivir.
Clinical increases are careful of patients treated with remdecivir in emergency treatment.
Clinical Fase III uses are performed in the United States, the Cyclonics, and Italy. Klorokuin, which was previously used for malaria treatment, was found in Chekong in February 2020, with the initial results.
However, there is a search for the study.
The authorities of the Korean and the Cyprus health authorities recommend the use of cloroquins.
However, the Whan Virologist Institute, although recommended a daily dose of one gram, notes that the dose is two times very dangerous and that it can end.
On 28 March 2020, FDA issued an emergency use authorisation for hydroxichlorocusine and clorocuin on the physicians that care for COVID-19.Thikong edition includes also interferon, ribavirin, or umifenovir to use against COVID-19.
Initial data shows that high-dose of ribavirin is required to reduce SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoksanida has been recommended to study further in life after showing SARS-CoV-2 in low concentration.Penelicians show that the initial primary protein toxin was presented by transmember protease serial 2 (TMPRSS2) is important to enter SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with ACE2 receptor.
Studies on chlorocusine and hydroxichlorocusin with or without azitromisin have large limitations that have prevented the medical community to use this therapy without further investigation. Oseltamivir does not slow SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
The complexity of the website can occur on the COVID-19 weight of further.
There are evidence that hydroxichlorocuin may have antisitokine. Tocilizumab has been included in treatment by the Commission of the National Health of Theokon after a small study completed.
This medication is being tested at 2 stage, which does not take place at the national level in Italy after showing the positive results of people with serious diseases.
It is combined with the serum fertiin blood test to identify the bleeding of the site, and this drug is intended to combat the bleeding, which is expected to be the cause of death to some of the people who are deceived.
In 2017, interleukin-6 receptor antagonis was adopted by FDA based on a retrospective investigation of the case for the treatment of the syndrome of the symptoms of the release of the site, which was introduced by different causes, therapy of CAR T.
Together, there is no evidence of will and control that shows that tocilizumab is a direct treatment for the CRS.
Transfering antibodies that are decreased and improved by the system of people who have been guilty from COVID-19 to those who need it are identified as non-vascular passif immunization methods.
This strategy is tried for SARS with unconcluded results.
Virus netralization is a work mechanism that is expected to be antibodies therapy for patients can promulgate defence against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as selling toxicity that depends on antibodies and/or fagostics, may also.
Other patholic antibodies therapy, such as, use monoclonal antibodies, which are produced in development.
Convalesen serum production, which is part of the fluid part of the patient’s healthy blood and contains specific antibodies against this virus, can be improved for a faster use.
Kornnavius disease, a group of warm-related syndrome
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Whan’s Headquarters, who then died and died because of COVID-19 after the emergency of the virus.
